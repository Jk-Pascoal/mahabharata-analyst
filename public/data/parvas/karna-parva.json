Having bowed down unto Narayana, and unto that most exalted of male\r\nbeings, Nara, and unto the goddess Sarasvati also, must the word Jaya be\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After Drona had been slain, O monarch, the royal\r\nwarriors (of the Kaurava army) headed by Duryodhana, with hearts filled\r\nwith great anxiety, all repaired to Drona's son. Lamenting the loss of\r\nDrona, and deprived of energy in consequence of their cheerlessness, they\r\nsat around the son of Sharadvata's daughter, afflicted with grief.\r\nComforted for a little while by considerations founded upon the\r\nscriptures, when night came, those rulers of Earth proceeded to their\r\nrespective tents. Those lords of Earth, however, O thou of Kuru's race,\r\ncould feel no happiness in their abodes. Thinking of that immense\r\nslaughter, they could not also sleep. The Suta's son (Karna), and king\r\nSuyodhana and Duhshasana and Shakuni, in special, could not compose\r\nthemselves to sleep. Those four passed that night together in\r\nDuryodhana's tent, reflecting upon the woes they had inflicted upon the\r\nhigh-souled Pandavas. Formerly they had brought Draupadi, plunged into\r\nwoe on account of the match at dice, into the assembly. Recollecting it\r\nthey experienced great regret, their hearts being filled with anxiety.\r\nThinking of those sufferings inflicted (upon the Pandavas) in consequence\r\nof the gambling match they passed that night in sorrow, O king, as if it\r\nwere really a hundred years. Then when morning came, observing the\r\ndictates of the ordinance, all of them duly went through the customary\r\nrites. Having gone through these customary rites, and comforted to some\r\nextent, O Bharata, they ordered their troops to be arrayed, and then came\r\nout for battle, having made Karna their generalissimo by tying the\r\nauspicious thread round his wrists, and having caused many foremost of\r\nbrahmanas, by presents of vessels of curds, clarified butter, akshatas,\r\ncoins of gold, kine, jewels and gems, and costly robes, to pray for their\r\nvictory, and having caused heralds and musicians, and panegyrists to\r\nadore them with hymns about victory. The Pandavas also, O king, having\r\ngone through their morning rites, issued from their camp, resolved on\r\nbattle. Then commenced a fierce battle, making the hair to stand on end,\r\nbetween the Kurus and the Pandavas, each desirous of vanquishing the\r\nother. During the commandership of Karna, the battle that took place\r\nbetween the Kuru and the Pandava troops was exceedingly fierce and lasted\r\nfor two days. Then Vrisha (Karna) having made an immense slaughter of his\r\nenemies in battle, was at last slain in the sight of the Dhartarashtras,\r\nby Arjuna. Then Sanjaya, repairing to Hastinapura told Dhritarashtra all\r\nthat had happened at Kurujangala.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Having heard of the fall of Bhishma and that other\r\nmighty car-warrior, Drona, the old king Dhritarashtra the son of Ambika\r\nhad been afflicted with great grief. How, O foremost of brahmanas, could\r\nhe, plunged into grief, support his life having heard of the death of\r\nKarna, that well-wisher of Duryodhana? How indeed, could that descendant\r\nof Kuru support his life when he, upon whom that monarch had rested the\r\nhope of his sons' victory, had fallen? When the king did not lay down his\r\nlife even after hearing of Karna's death, I think that it is very\r\ndifficult for men to yield up life even under circumstances of great\r\ngrief! O brahmana, when the king did not yield up his life after hearing\r\nof the fall of the venerable son of Shantanu, of Bahlika and Drona and\r\nSomadatta and Bhurishrava, as also other friends and his sons and\r\ngrandsons, I think, O regenerate one, that the act of yielding up one's\r\nlife is exceedingly difficult! Tell me all these in detail and as they\r\nactually happened! I am not satiated with hearing the high achievements\r\nof my ancestors!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Upon the fall of Karna, O monarch, the son of\r\nGavalgana, with a cheerless heart, set out that night for Nagapura, on\r\nsteeds that rivalled the wind in speed. Arrived at Hastinapura, with a\r\nheart filled with deep anxiety, he proceeded to Dhritarashtra's abode\r\nwhich no longer teemed with kinsmen and friends. Beholding the king\r\ndeprived of all energy by grief, joining his hands he worshipped, with a\r\nbend of his head, the monarch's feet. Having duly worshipped king\r\nDhritarashtra, he uttered an exclamation of woe and then began, 'I am\r\nSanjaya, O lord of Earth! Art thou not happy? I hope thou art not\r\nstupefied, having through thy own faults fallen into such distress?\r\nCounsels for thy good had been uttered by Vidura and Ganga's son and\r\nKeshava. I hope thou feelest no pain now, remembering thy rejection of\r\nthose counsels? Counsels for thy good had also been uttered in the\r\nassembly by Rama and Narada and Kanwa and others. I hope thou feelest no\r\npain now, remembering their rejection by thee? I hope thou feelest no\r\npain, remembering the slaughter in battle, by the foe, of Bhishma and\r\nDrona and others, those friends that were ever engaged in thy good?' Unto\r\nthe Suta's son who with joined hands was telling him so, the monarch\r\nafflicted with grief and drawing a long and hot breath, said these words.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing, O Sanjaya, of the fall of the heroic son\r\nof Ganga, that warrior of all celestial weapons, as also of the fall of\r\nthat foremost of all bowmen, Drona, my heart feeleth great pain! That\r\nhero endued with great energy and born of the Vasus themselves, who slew\r\nevery day 10,000 car-warriors clad in mail, that high-souled one unto\r\nwhom Bhrigu's son had given the highest weapons, that warrior who in his\r\nchildhood had been trained in the science of the bow by Rama, alas, even\r\nhe hath been slain by Yajnasena's son Shikhandi protected by the\r\nPandavas! At this my heart is greatly pained! That hero through whose\r\ngrace those mighty car-warriors, the royal sons of Kunti, as also many\r\nother lords of Earth, have become maharathas, alas, hearing of the\r\nslaughter of that great bowman of sure aim, Drona, by Dhrishtadyumna, my\r\nheart is exceedingly pained! Those two had not in the world a person\r\nequal to them in (knowledge and use of) the four kinds of weapons! Alas,\r\nhearing of the slaughter of these two, Bhishma and Drona, in battle my\r\nheart is exceedingly pained! That warrior who had not in the three worlds\r\na person equal to him in knowledge of weapons, alas, hearing of the\r\nslaughter of that hero, Drona, what did the people of my side do? After\r\nthe high-souled son of Pandu, Dhananjaya, exerting himself with prowess,\r\nhad despatched unto Yama's abode the strong force of the samsaptakas,\r\nafter the Narayana weapon of the intelligent son of Drona had been\r\nbaffled, and after the (Kaurava) divisions had begun to fly away, what,\r\nindeed, did the people of my side do? I think that, after Drona's death\r\nmy troops, flying away and sinking in an ocean of grief, resembled\r\nshipwrecked mariners struggling on the bosom of the vast deep. What also,\r\nO Sanjaya, became the colour of the faces of Duryodhana, and Karna, and\r\nKritavarma the chief of the Bhojas and Shalya, the ruler of the Madras,\r\nand of my remaining sons, and of the others, when the Kuru divisions fled\r\naway from the field? Tell me all this as it truly happened in battle, O\r\nson of Gavalgana, and describe to me the prowess put forth by the\r\nPandavas and the warriors of my side!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'O sire, hearing all that has happened unto the Kauravas\r\nthrough thy fault, thou shouldst not feel any anguish! He that is wise\r\nnever feeleth any pain at what Destiny bringeth! And since Destiny is\r\nunconquerable, human purposes may or may not become attainable. Hence, he\r\nthat is wise never feeleth pain on the acquisition or the reverse of the\r\nobjects cherished by him.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I do not feel great pain, O Sanjaya! I regard all\r\nthis to be the result of Destiny! Tell me all that thou wishest!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of the great bowman Drona, thy sons, those\r\nmighty car-warriors, became pale and deprived of their senses. Armed with\r\nweapons, all of them, O monarch, hung down their heads. Afflicted with\r\ngrief and without looking at one another, they stood perfectly silent.\r\nBeholding them with such afflicted countenances, thy troops, O Bharata,\r\nthemselves perturbed by grief, vacantly gazed upwards. Seeing Drona slain\r\nin battle, the weapons of many of them, O king, dyed with blood, dropped\r\nfrom their hands. Innumerable weapons, again, O Bharata, still retained\r\nin the grasp of the soldiers, seemed in their pendent attitude, to\r\nresemble falling meteors in the sky. Then king Duryodhana, O monarch,\r\nbeholding that army of thine thus standing as if paralysed and lifeless,\r\nsaid, \"Relying upon the might of your army I have summoned the Pandavas\r\nto battle and caused this passage-at-arms to commence! Upon the fall of\r\nDrona, however, the prospect seems to be cheerless. Warriors engaged in\r\nbattle all die in battle. Engaged in battle, a warrior may have either\r\nvictory or death. What can be strange then in this (viz., the death of\r\nDrona)? Fight ye with faces turned towards every direction. Behold now\r\nthe high-souled Karna, the son of Vikartana, that great bowman of mighty\r\nstrength, careering in battle, using his celestial weapons! Through fear\r\nof that warrior in battle, that coward, viz., Dhananjaya, the son of\r\nKunti, always turns back like a small deer at the sight of a lion! It is\r\nhe who, by the ordinary methods of human battle, brought the mighty\r\nBhimasena endued with the strength of 10,000 elephants to that plight! It\r\nis he who, uttering a loud roar, slew with his invincible dart the brave\r\nGhatotkaca of a 1,000 illusions and well-acquainted with celestial\r\nweapons! Behold today the inexhaustible might of arms of that intelligent\r\nwarrior of sure aim and invincible energy! Let the sons of Pandu behold\r\ntoday the prowess of both Ashvatthama and Karna resembling that of Vishnu\r\nand Vasava! All of you are singly able to slay the sons of Pandu with\r\ntheir troops in battle! How much more then are you capable, when united\r\ntogether, of that feat! Endued with great energy and accomplished in\r\nweapons, you will today behold one another engaged in the achievement of\r\nmighty tasks!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, O sinless one, thy son\r\nDuryodhana, with his brothers, made Karna the generalissimo (of the Kuru\r\narmy). Obtaining the command, the mighty car-warrior Karna, so fierce in\r\nbattle, uttered loud roars and fought with the foe. He caused, O sire, a\r\ngreat carnage among the Srinjayas, the Pancalas, the Kekayas, and the\r\nVidehas. From his bow issued innumerable lines of arrows, one close\r\nbehind the wings of another, like flights of bees. Having afflicted the\r\nPancalas and the Pandavas endued with great activity, and slain thousands\r\nof warriors, he was at last slain by Arjuna!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hearing this intelligence, O monarch, Dhritarashtra\r\nthe son of Ambika, feeling the acme of grief, regarded Suyodhana to be\r\nalready dead. Exceedingly agitated, the king fell down on the Earth like\r\nan elephant deprived of its senses. When that foremost of the monarchs,\r\ngreatly agitated, fell down on the Earth, loud wails were uttered, O best\r\nof the Bharatas, by the ladies (of the royal household). That noise was\r\nso loud that it seemed to fill the entire Earth. Immersed in a deep ocean\r\nof woe, the Bharata ladies, with hearts exceedingly agitated and scorched\r\nby grief, wept aloud. Approaching the king, Gandhari, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, and the other ladies of the household, all fell down on the earth,\r\ndeprived of their senses. Then Sanjaya, O king, began to comfort those\r\nladies stricken with grief, bathed in tears, and reft of consciousness.\r\nComforted (by Sanjaya), those ladies began to tremble repeatedly like a\r\nplantain grove shaken by the wind. Vidura also, sprinkling that\r\ndescendant of Kuru with water, began to comfort the puissant monarch who\r\nhad knowledge only for his eye. Slowly restored to consciousness, and\r\nunderstanding that the ladies of the household were there, the king, O\r\nmonarch, remained perfectly silent for some time like one reft of reason.\r\nHaving reflected then for some time, and repeatedly drawn long breaths,\r\nthe king censured his own sons and applauded the Pandavas. Censuring also\r\nhis own intelligence and that of Shakuni the son of Subala, the king,\r\nhaving reflected for a long time, began to tremble repeatedly.\r\nControlling his mind once more, the king, with sufficient fortitude,\r\nquestioned his charioteer Sanjaya the son of Gavalgana.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have heard, O Sanjaya, all that thou hast said.\r\nHath my son Duryodhana, O Suta, who is ever desirous of victory, already\r\ngone to Yama's abode, despairing of success? Tell me truly, O Sanjaya,\r\nall this even if thou wilt have to repeat it!'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by the king, O Janamejaya, the\r\nSuta said unto him, 'The mighty car-warrior Vaikartana, O monarch, hath\r\nbeen slain with his sons and brothers, and other Suta warriors, all of\r\nwhom were mighty bowmen ready to lay down their lives in battle!\r\nDuhshasana also hath been slain by the renowned son of Pandu. Indeed, his\r\nblood also hath been, from wrath, drunk by Bhimasena in battle!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hearing these words, O monarch, Ambika's son\r\nDhritarashtra, with heart agitated by grief, addressed his driver\r\nSanjaya, saying, 'Though the evil policy, O sire, of my son of little\r\nforesight, Vikartana's son hath been slain! This intelligence is cutting\r\nthe very core of my heart! I am desirous of crossing this sea of grief!\r\nRemove my doubts, therefore, by telling me who are still alive and who\r\nare dead amongst the Kurus and the Pandavas!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Endued with great prowess and invincible in battle,\r\nBhishma the son of Shantanu, O king, having slain large numbers of\r\nSrinjayas and Pancalas, hath been slain after ten days. The mighty and\r\ninvincible bowman Drona of the golden car, having slaughtered the Pancala\r\ndivisions in battle, hath been slain. Having slaughtered the half of what\r\nremained after the carnage by Bhishma and the illustrious Drona,\r\nVikartana's son Karna hath been slain. Endued with great strength, O\r\nmonarch, prince Vivingsati, having slain hundreds of Anarta warriors in\r\nbattle, hath been slain. Thy heroic son Vikarna, deprived of steeds and\r\nweapons, stood, facing the foe, remembering the duties of Kshatriyas.\r\nRemembering the many foul wrongs inflicted upon him by Duryodhana, and\r\nbearing in mind his own vow, Bhimasena hath slain him. Possessed of great\r\nmight, Vinda and Anuvinda, the two princes of Avanti, after achieving the\r\nmost difficult feats, have gone to Yama's abode. That hero who had under\r\nhis sway ten kingdoms, having Sindhu for their chief, him who was ever\r\nobedient to thee, Jayadratha of mighty energy, O king, Arjuna hath slain\r\nafter vanquishing eleven akshauhinis of troops with his keen arrows.\r\nEndued with great activity and incapable of being easily defeated in\r\nbattle, the son of Duryodhana, ever obedient to his sire's commands, hath\r\nbeen slain by the son of Subhadra. The brave son of Duhshasana, possessed\r\nof mighty arms and fierce in battle, hath been despatched to Yama's abode\r\nby Draupadi's son exerting himself with great prowess! The ruler of the\r\nKiratas and other dwellers of the lowlands on the seacoast, the much\r\nrespected and dear friend of the chief of the celestials himself, the\r\nvirtuous king Bhagadatta, who was ever devoted to Kshatriya duties, hath\r\nbeen despatched to Yama's abode by Dhananjaya exerting himself great with\r\nprowess. The kinsman of the Kauravas, the son of Somadatta, the brave and\r\ncelebrated Bhurishrava, O king, hath been slain by Satyaki in battle. The\r\nAmvashtha king Srutayus, that foremost of Kshatriyas, who used to career\r\nin battle most fearlessly, hath been slain by Arjuna. Thy son Duhshasana,\r\naccomplished in arms and invincible in battle, and who was always\r\nwrathful, hath, O monarch, been slain by Bhimasena. Sudakshina, O king,\r\nwho had many thousands of wonderful elephants, hath been slain in battle\r\nby Arjuna. The ruler of the Kosolas, having slain many hundreds of foes,\r\nhath himself been despatched to Yama's abode by Subhadra's son exerting\r\nhimself with prowess. Having fought with many thousands of foes and with\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Bhimasena himself, thy son Citrasena hath been\r\nslain by Bhimasena. The brave younger brother of the ruler of the Madras,\r\nthat enhancer of the fears of foes, that handsome warrior armed with\r\nsword and shield, hath been slain by Subhadra's son. He who was equal to\r\nKarna himself in battle, Karna's son Vrishasena, accomplished in arms, of\r\nmighty energy and steady prowess, hath, in the very sight of Karna, been\r\ndespatched to Yama's abode by Dhananjaya who put forth his prowess\r\nremembering the slaughter of his own son Abhimanyu and bearing in mind\r\nthe vow he had made. That lord of Earth, Srutayus, who always displayed a\r\ndeep-rooted antipathy towards the Pandavas, hath been slain by Partha who\r\nreminded him of that antipathy before taking his life. Shalya's son of\r\ngreat prowess, O sire, Rukmaratha, hath, O king, been slain in battle by\r\nSahadeva although the former happened to be the latter's brother, having\r\nbeen the son of the latter's maternal uncle. The old king Bhagiratha, and\r\nVrihatkshatra the ruler of the Kaikeyas both endued with great prowess\r\nand might and energy, have been slain. Bhagadatta's son, O king who was\r\npossessed of great wisdom and great strength, hath been slain by Nakula\r\nwho always careers in battle with the activity of the hawk. Thy grandsire\r\nBahlika, possessed of great might and prowess, hath, with all his\r\nfollowers, been slain by Bhimasena. The mighty Jayatsena the son of\r\nJarasandha, the prince of the Magadhas, O king, hath been slain in battle\r\nby the high-souled son of Subhadra. Thy son Durmukha, O king, as also thy\r\nother son Dussaha, that mighty car-warrior, both of whom were regarded as\r\nheroes, have been slain by Bhimasena with his mace. Durmarshana and\r\nDurvisaha and the mighty car-warrior Durjaya, having achieved the most\r\ndifficult feats, have gone to Yama's abode. The two brothers Kalinga and\r\nVrishaka, who were invincible in battle, having achieved very difficult\r\nfeats have gone to Yama's abode. Thy counsellor Vrishavarman of the Suta\r\ncaste, endued with great energy, hath been despatched to Yama's abode by\r\nBhimasena exerting himself with prowess. So also king Paurava who was\r\nendued with the might of 10,000 elephants, hath, with all his followers,\r\nbeen slain by Pandu's son Arjuna. The Vasatis, O king, numbering 2,000,\r\neffectual smiters of all, as also the Surasenas endued with prowess, have\r\nall been slain in battle. The Abhishahas, clad in mail, capable of\r\nsmiting effectually, and fierce in battle, also the Sivis, those foremost\r\nof car-warriors, with the Kalingas, have all been slain. Those other\r\nheroes also, (the Narayana Gopas) who live and grew in Gokula, who were\r\nexceedingly wrathful in battle, and who never retreated from the field\r\nhave been slain by Savyasaci. Many thousands of Srenis, as also the\r\nsamsaptakas, approaching Arjuna, have all repaired to the abode of Yama.\r\nThy two brothers-in-law, viz., the princes Vrishaka and Achala, who were\r\nendued with great prowess, have for thy sake been slain by Savyasaci.\r\nKing Shalva of mighty arms and fierce deeds, who was a great bowman both\r\nin name and feats, hath been slain by Bhimasena. Oghavat, O king, and\r\nVrishanta, fighting together in battle and exerting themselves with great\r\nvigour for the sake of their ally, have both repaired to Yama's abode. So\r\nalso that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Kshemadhurti, O monarch, hath\r\nbeen slain in battle by Bhimasena with his mace. So also that great\r\nbowman, viz., the mighty king Jalasandha, after causing an immense\r\ncarnage, hath been slain by Satyaki in battle. That prince of Rakshasas,\r\nviz., Alayudha, unto whose vehicle were yoked asses (of monstrous shape)\r\nhath been despatched to Yama's abode by Ghatotkaca exerting himself with\r\ngreat prowess. Radha's son of the Suta caste, and those mighty\r\ncar-warriors who were his brothers, and the Kaikeyas, the Malavas, the\r\nMadrakas the Dravidas of fierce prowess, the Yaudheyas, the Lalittyas,\r\nthe Kshudrakas, the Usinaras, the Tundikeras, the Savitriputras, the\r\nEasterners, the Northerners, the Westerners, and the Southerners, O sire,\r\nhave all been slain by Savyasaci. Large bands of foot-soldiers, myriads\r\nupon myriads of steeds, large number of car-warriors, and many huge\r\nelephants, have been slain. Many heroes also, with standards and weapons,\r\nand with armour and attire and ornaments, and endued with perseverance\r\nand possessed of high birth and good conduct, have been slain in battle\r\nby Partha who is never fatigued with exertion. Others, endued with\r\nimmeasurable might, and desirous of slaying their foes, (have met with a\r\nsimilar fate). These and many other kings, numbering thousands, with\r\ntheir followers, have, O monarch, been slain in battle. That which thou\r\naskest me I am answering now. Even thus did the destruction take place\r\nwhen Arjuna and Karna fought. Even as Mahendra slew Vritra, and Rama slew\r\nRavana; even as Krishna slew Naraka or Mura in battle; even as the mighty\r\nRama of Bhrigu's race slew the heroic Kartavirya, invincible in battle,\r\nwith all his kinsmen and friends, after fighting a terrible battle\r\ncelebrated through the three worlds; even as Skanda slew (the Asura)\r\nMahisha, and Rudra slew (the Asura) Andhaka, even so hath Arjuna, O king,\r\nin single combat, slain, with all his kinsmen, that foremost of smiters,\r\nviz., Karna, who was invincible in battle and upon whom the\r\nDhartarashtras had placed their hopes of victory, and who was the great\r\ncause of the hostility with the Pandavas! Pandu's son hath now\r\naccomplished that which at one time thou couldst not believe him capable\r\nof accomplishing, although, O monarch, well-meaning friends failed not to\r\napprise thee of it. That calamity, fraught with great destruction, hath\r\nnow come! Thou, O king wishing them well, hast heaped those evils on the\r\nheads of thy covetous sons! The fruit of those evils is now manifesting\r\nitself!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou hast, O son, mentioned the names of those of\r\nmy side that have been slain in battle by the Pandavas. Tell me now, O\r\nSanjaya, the names of those amongst the Pandavas that have been slain by\r\nthe people of my side!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The Kuntis possessed of great prowess in battle, endued\r\nwith great energy and great might, have been slain in fight by Bhishma,\r\nwith all their kinsmen and advisers. The Narayanas, the Valabhadras, and\r\nhundreds of other heroes, all devoted (to the Pandavas) have been slain\r\nin battle by the heroic Bhishma. Satyajit, who was equal to the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna himself in battle as regards energy and might, hath\r\nbeen slain in battle by Drona of sure aim. Many mighty bowmen among the\r\nPancalas, all of whom were skilled in battle, encountering Drona, have\r\nrepaired to Yama's abode. So the two kings Virata and Drupada, both\r\nvenerable in years, who exerted themselves with great prowess for their\r\nally, have, with their sons, been slain in battle by Drona. That\r\ninvincible hero, viz., Abhimanyu, who, though a child in years, was still\r\nequal in battle to Arjuna or Keshava or Baladeva, O lord, that, warrior\r\nwho was highly accomplished in battle, after making an immense slaughter\r\nof the foe, was at last encompassed by six foremost of car-warriors and\r\nslain by them. Unable to resist Arjuna himself, they thus slew Arjuna's\r\nson! Deprived of his car, that hero, viz., the son of Subhadra, still\r\nstayed in battle, remembering the duties of a Kshatriya. At last, O king,\r\nDuhshasana's son slew him on the field. The slayer of the Patachchatras,\r\nviz., the handsome son of Amvashtha, surrounded by a large force, had put\r\nforth all his prowess for the sake of his allies. Having made a great\r\nslaughter among the foe, he was encountered by Duryodhana's son, the\r\nbrave Lakshmana, in battle and despatched to Yama's abode. The mighty\r\nbowman Vrihanta, accomplished in arms and invincible in battle, hath been\r\ndespatched to Yama's abode by Duhshasana, exerting himself with great\r\nprowess. The two kings Manimat and Dandadhara, both of whom were\r\ninvincible in battle and had put forth their prowess for their allies,\r\nhave been slain by Drona. Ansumat the ruler of the Bhojas, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior at the head of his own forces, hath been despatched to Yama's\r\nabode by Drona exerting himself with great prowess. Citrasena, the ruler\r\nof the sea-coast, with his son, O Bharata, hath been forcibly despatched\r\nby Samudrasena to Yama's abode. Another ruler of a maritime country,\r\nviz., Nila, and Vyaghradatta of great energy, have both, O king, been\r\ndespatched to Yama's abode by Ashvatthama. Citrayudha and Citrayodhin,\r\nafter making a great slaughter, have both been slain in battle by Vikarna\r\nexerting himself with great prowess and displaying diverse manoeuvres of\r\nhis car. The chief of the Kaikeyas, who was equal to Vrikodara himself in\r\nbattle and surrounded by Kaikeya warriors, has been slain by Kaikeya, the\r\nbrother by the brother. Janamejaya of the hilly country, endued with\r\ngreat prowess and accomplished in encounters with the mace, hath, O king,\r\nbeen slain by thy son Durmukha. Those two foremost of men, viz., the\r\nbrothers Rochamana, like two brilliant planets, have together been\r\ndespatched to heaven by Drona with his shafts. Many other kings, O\r\nmonarch, endued with great prowess, have fought (for the Pandavas) Having\r\nachieved the most difficult feats, all of them have gone to Yama's abode.\r\nPurujit and Kuntibhoja, the two maternal uncles of Savyasaci, have been\r\ndespatched by Drona with shafts to such regions as are attained by death\r\nin battle. Abhibhu the Kasis, at the head of many of his followers, hath\r\nbeen obliged by Vasudana's son to lay down his life in battle. Yudhamanyu\r\nof immeasurable prowess, and Uttamauja of great energy, after slaying\r\nhundreds of heroic warriors, have themselves been slain by our men. The\r\nPancala prince Mitravarman, O Bharata, those two foremost of bowmen, have\r\nbeen despatched to Yama's abode by Drona. Shikhandi's son Kshatradeva,\r\nthat foremost of warriors, possessed of great bravery, hath, O king, been\r\nslain by thy grandson Lakshmana, O sire! The two heroes Sucitra and\r\nCitravarman, who were sire and son and endued with great might, and who\r\ncareered fearlessly in battle, have been slain by Drona. Vardhakshemi, O\r\nmonarch, who was like the ocean at full tide, having had his weapons\r\nexhausted in battle, hath at last obtained undisturbed peace. That\r\nforemost of Sutas, viz., Senavindu, having consumed many foes in battle,\r\nhath, at last, O king been slain by Bahlika. Dhrishtaketu, O monarch,\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors among the Cedis, after accomplishing the\r\nmost difficult feats, hath repaired to the abode of Yama. Similarly, the\r\nheroic Satyadhriti, endued with great prowess, having made a great\r\nslaughter in battle for the sake of the Pandavas, has been despatched to\r\nYama's abode. That lord of Earth, viz., Suketu, the son of Shishupala,\r\nhaving slain many foes, hath at last been slain by Drona in battle.\r\nVirata's son Sankha, as also Uttara of great strength, having\r\naccomplished the most difficult feats, have repaired to Yama's abode.\r\nSimilarly, Satyadhriti of the Matsyas, and Madiraswa of great energy, and\r\nSuryadatta possessed of great prowess, have all been slain by Drona with\r\nhis shafts. Srenimat also, O monarch, having fought with great prowess\r\nand accomplished the most difficult feats, hath repaired to Yama's abode.\r\nSimilarly, the chief of the Magadhas, that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\nendued with great energy and acquainted with the highest weapons,\r\nsleepeth on the field of battle, slain by Bhishma. Vasudana also, having\r\nmade an immense carnage in battle, has been despatched to Yama's abode by\r\nBharadwaja's son exerting himself with great prowess. These and many\r\nother mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas have been slain by Drona\r\nexerting himself with great energy. I have now told them all that thou\r\nhadst asked me.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When all the foremost of my warriors, O Sanjaya\r\nhave perished, I do not think that the remnant of my army will not\r\nperish! When those two heroes, those two mighty bowmen, those two\r\nforemost of the Kurus, Bhishma and Drona, have been slain, what use can I\r\nany longer have with life? I cannot also brook the death of Radha's son,\r\nthat ornament of battle, the might of whose arms was as great as that of\r\n10,000 elephants! O foremost of speakers, tell me now, O Suta, who are\r\nyet alive in my army after the death of all the foremost heroes! Thou\r\nhast told me the names of those that have fallen. It seems, however, to\r\nme that those who are still alive are almost all dead!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'That hero O king, to whom Drona, that foremost of\r\nbrahmanas, imparted many blazing, celestial, and mighty weapons of the\r\nfour kinds, that mighty car-warrior, possessed of skill and lightness of\r\nhands, that hero of firm grasp, strong weapons, and powerful shafts, that\r\nhigh-souled son of Drona, capable of shooting to a great distance, is\r\nstill on the field, desirous of battling for thy sake. That dweller of\r\nthe Anarta country, that son of Hridika, that mighty car-warrior, that\r\nforemost one among the Satwatas, that chief of the Bhojas, Kritavarma,\r\naccomplished in arms, is on the field, desirous of battle. Artayana's\r\nson, dauntless in battle, that first of warriors, that foremost of all\r\nyet on thy side, he, that abandoned his own sister's sons, the Pandavas,\r\nfor making his own words true, that hero endued with great activity who\r\npromised in the presence of Yudhishthira that he would in battle depress\r\nthe proud spirit of Karna, that invincible Shalya, who is equal unto\r\nSakra himself in energy, is still on the field, desirous of battling for\r\nthy sake. Accompanied by his own force consisting of Ajaneyas,\r\nSaindhavas, mountaineers, dwellers of riparian regions, Kambojas, and\r\nVanayus, the king of the Gandharas stayeth on the field, desirous of\r\nbattling for thy sake. Sharadvata's son called Gautama, O king, endued\r\nwith mighty arms and capable of fighting with diverse weapons in diverse\r\nbeautiful ways, taking up a beautiful and large bow capable of bearing\r\ngreat strain, stayeth on the field, desirous of battle. That mighty\r\ncar-warrior, the son of the ruler of the Kaikeyas, riding on a goodly car\r\nequipped with standard and goodly steeds, stayeth on the field, O chief\r\nof Kuru's race, for battling for thy sake. Thy son also, that foremost of\r\nheroes in Kuru's race, Purumitra, O king, riding on his car possessed of\r\nthe effulgence of fire or the Sun, stayeth on the field, like the Sun\r\nhimself shining brilliantly in the cloudless firmament. Duryodhana also,\r\nendued with great energy, in the midst of an elephant force and\r\naccompanied by many foremost of combatants, stayeth on his car adorned\r\nwith gold, desirous of engaging in battle. In the midst of many kings,\r\nthat foremost of men, possessed of the splendour of a lotus, looked\r\nresplendent in his beautiful armour of gold like a fire with little smoke\r\nor the Sun emerged from the clouds. So also thy sons Sushena, armed with\r\nsword and shield, and the heroic Satyasena, are staying with Citrasena,\r\ntheir hearts full of joy and themselves desirous of battle. Endued with\r\nmodesty, the Bharata princes Citrayudha, Srutavarman, and Jaya, Dala, and\r\nSatyavrata, and Dussala, all of whom are possessed of great might, stay\r\non the field, desirous of battle. The ruler of the Kaitavyas, that prince\r\nproud of his courage, and capable of fearlessly careering in battle and\r\nslaying his foes, possessing foot-soldiers and cavalry, and elephants and\r\ncars, stayeth on the field, desirous of battling for thy sake. The heroic\r\nSrutayu and Srutayudha, and Citrangada and Citravarman, those foremost of\r\nmen, those proud warriors capable of smiting effectually and possessed of\r\nsureness of aim, stay on the field, desirous of battle. The high-souled\r\nSatyasandha, the son of Karna, stayeth on the field, desirous of battle.\r\nTwo other sons of Karna, possessing a knowledge of high weapons and\r\nendued with great lightness of hands, are both staying, O king, at the\r\nhead of forces that are large and incapable of being pierced by warriors\r\nof little energy, desirous of battling for thy sake. Accompanied by these\r\nheroes and by many other foremost of warriors, O king, that are possessed\r\nof immeasurable might, the Kuru king (Duryodhana) is staying like a\r\nsecond Indra in the midst of his elephant division in expectation of\r\nvictory!'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou hast told me duly all that are alive both\r\namongst us and the foe. From this I plainly see on which side the victory\r\nwill be. Indeed, it may be inferred from the facts.'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"While saying this, Dhritarashtra the son of\r\nAmbika, having learnt that only a small portion of his army was alive,\r\nfor all his foremost of warriors had died, felt his heart to be\r\nexceedingly agitated by grief. The king swooned away. Partially restored\r\nto his senses, he addressed Sanjaya, saying, 'Wait for a moment!' And the\r\nking said, 'O son, having heard of this dire calamity, my heart is\r\ngreatly agitated. My senses are being stupefied, and my limbs are about\r\nto be paralysed!' Having said these words, Dhritarashtra the son of\r\nAmbika, that lord of earth, lost his senses and fell down on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Having heard of Karna's fall and the slaughter of his\r\nsons, what, O foremost of regenerate ones, did the king say, after he had\r\nbeen a little comforted? Indeed, poignant was the grief that he\r\nexperienced, arising from the calamity that befell his sons! Tell me, I\r\nask thee, all that the king said on that occasion!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hearing of the slaughter of Karna that was\r\nincredible and astounding, that was dreadful and capable of paralysing\r\nthe senses of all creatures, that looked like the downfall of Meru, or a\r\nnever-to-be-believed clouding of the intellect of the wise Shukra, or the\r\ndefeat of Indra of terrible feats at the hands of his foes, or the\r\nfalling down on the Earth of the resplendent Sun from the firmament, or a\r\nscarcely-to-be-comprehended drying up of the ocean, that receptacle of\r\ninexhaustible waters, or the annihilation, perfectly astounding, of the\r\nearth, the firmament, the points of the compass, and the waters, or the\r\nfruitlessness of acts both virtuous and sinful, king Dhritarashtra,\r\nhaving earnestly reflected for some time on it, thought that his army had\r\nbeen annihilated. Thinking that other creatures also, as unslayable as\r\nKarna, would meet with a similar fate, king Dhritarashtra the son of\r\nAmbika, scorched with grief and sighing like a snake, with limbs almost\r\npalsied, long breaths, highly cheerless, and filled with melancholy,\r\nbegan to lament, saying, 'Oh!' and 'Alas!' And the king said, 'O Sanjaya,\r\nthe heroic son of Adhiratha was endued with the prowess of the lion or\r\nthe elephant! His neck was as thick as that of a bull, and his eyes,\r\ngait, and voice were like the bull's! Of limbs as hard as the\r\nthunderbolt, that young man, like a bull never flying away from a bull,\r\nnever desisted from battle even if his foe happened to be the great Indra\r\nhimself! At the sound of his bow-string and palms and at the whizz of his\r\narrowy showers men and steeds and cars and elephants fled away from\r\nbattle. Relying upon that mighty-armed one, that slayer of large bands of\r\nfoes, that warrior of unfading glory, Duryodhana had provoked hostilities\r\nwith those mighty car-warriors, the sons of Pandu! How then could Karna,\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, that tiger among men, that hero of\r\nirresistible onset, be forcibly slain by Partha in battle? Relying on the\r\nmight of his own arms, he always disregarded Keshava of unfading glory,\r\nand Dhananjaya, and the Vrishnis, and all other foes! Often did he use to\r\nsay unto the foolish, avaricious crestfallen, kingdom-coveting, and\r\nafflicted Duryodhana even such words as these, \"Alone, I shall, in\r\nbattle, throw down from their foremost of cars, those two invincible\r\nwarriors united together, the wielder of sarnga and the wielder of\r\ngandiva!\" He had subjugated many invincible and mighty foes--the\r\nGandharas, the Madrakas, the Matsyas, the Trigartas, the Tanganas, the\r\nKhasas, the Pancalas, the Videhas, the Kulindas, the Kasi-kosalas, the\r\nSuhmas, the Angas, the Nishadhas, the Pundras, the Kichakas, the Vatsas,\r\nthe Kalingas, the Taralas, the Asmakas, and the Rishikas. Subjugating all\r\nthese brave races, by means of his keen and whetted arrows equipped with\r\nkanka feathers, that foremost of car-warriors, Radha's son, had caused\r\nall of them to pay tribute to us for the aggrandisement of Duryodhana.\r\nAlas, how could that warrior acquainted with celestial weapons, that\r\nprotector of armies, Karna the son of Vikartana, called also Vrisha, of\r\nmighty energy, be slain in battle by his foes, the heroic and mighty sons\r\nof Pandu? As Indra is the foremost of gods, Karna was the foremost of\r\nmen. In the three worlds no third person has been heard of by us to be\r\nlike them. Amongst steeds, Uccaisravas is the foremost; amongst Yakshas,\r\nVaishravana is the foremost; amongst celestials, Indra is the foremost;\r\namongst smiters, Karna was the foremost. Unvanquished by even the most\r\nheroic and the mightiest of monarchs, he had, Duryodhana's\r\naggrandisement, subjugated the whole earth. The ruler of Magadha, having\r\nby conciliation and honours obtained Karna for a friend, had challenged\r\nall the Kshatriyas of the world, except the Kauravas and the Yadavas, to\r\nbattle. Hearing that Karna hath been slain by Savyasaci in single combat,\r\nI am plunged in an ocean of woe like a wrecked vessel in the vast deep!\r\nIndeed, hearing that that foremost of men, that best of car-warriors,\r\nhath been slain in single combat, I am sinking in an ocean of grief like\r\na person without a raft in the sea! When, O Sanjaya, I do not die of such\r\ngrief, I think my heart is impenetrable and made of something harder than\r\nthe thunderbolt. Hearing of the defeat and humiliation of kinsmen and\r\nrelatives and allies, who else in the world, O Suta, save my wretched\r\nself, would not yield up his life? I desire to have poison or fire or a\r\nfall from the summit of a mountain, I am unable, O Sanjaya, to bear this\r\nheavy load of grief!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The world regards thee to be equal to Yayati the son of\r\nNahusha, in beauty, birth, fame, asceticism, and learning! Indeed, in\r\nlearning, thou art, O king, like a great rishi, highly accomplished and\r\ncrowned with success! Summon thy fortitude! Do not yield to grief!'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I think destiny is supreme, and exertion fruitless\r\nsince even Karna, who was like a shala tree, hath been slain in battle!\r\nHaving slaughtered Yudhishthira's army and the large throngs of the\r\nPancala car-warriors, having scorched all the points of the compass by\r\nmeans of his arrowy showers, having stupefied the Parthas in battle like\r\nthe wielder of the thunderbolt stupefying the asuras, alas, how could\r\nthat mighty car-warrior, slain by the foe, fall down on the earth like a\r\nlarge tree uprooted by the tempest? Indeed, I do not behold the end of my\r\nsorrows like a drowning man unable to see the end of the ocean. My\r\nanxieties are increasing, I do not desire to live, hearing of Karna's\r\ndeath and Phalguni's victory! Indeed O Sanjaya, I regard the slaughter of\r\nKarna to be highly incredible. Without doubt, this hard heart of mine is\r\nmade of the essence of adamant, for it does not burst into a 1,000\r\nfragments upon hearing of the fall of Karna! Without doubt, the gods\r\nordained, before (my birth), a very long life for me, since sore\r\ndistressed on hearing of the death of Karna, I do not die! Fie, O\r\nSanjaya, on this life of one that is destitute of friends. Brought today,\r\nO Sanjaya, to this wretched plight, miserably shall I have to live, of\r\nfoolish understanding that I am, pitied by all! Having formerly been the\r\nhonoured of the whole world, how shall I, O Suta, live, overridden by\r\nfoes? From pain to greater pain and calamity, have I come, O Sanjaya, in\r\nconsequence of the fall of Bhishma and Drona and the high-souled Karna! I\r\ndo not see that anyone (of my army) will escape with life when the Suta's\r\nson hath been slain in battle! He was the great raft, O Sanjaya, to my\r\nsons! That hero, having shot innumerable arrows, hath been slain in\r\nbattle! What use have I of life, without that bull among men? Without\r\ndoubt, the son of Adhiratha, afflicted with arrows, fell down from his\r\ncar, like a mountain-peak riven by the fall of thunder! Without doubt,\r\nbathed in blood, he lieth, adorning the Earth, like an elephant slain by\r\nan infuriate prince of elephants! He who was the strength of the\r\nDhartarashtras, he who was an object of fear to the sons of Pandu, alas,\r\nhe viz., Karna, that pride of all bowman, hath been slain by Arjuna! He\r\nwas a hero, a mighty bowman, the dispeller of the fears of my sons! Alas,\r\nthat hero, reft of life, lieth (on the earth), like mountain struck down\r\nby Indra! The fulfilment of Duryodhana's wishes is even like locomotion\r\nto one that is lame, or the gratification of the poor man's desire, or\r\nstray drops of water to one that is thirsty! Planned in one way, our\r\nschemes end otherwise. Alas, destiny is all powerful, and time incapable\r\nof being transgressed! Was my son Duhshasana, O Suta, slain, while flying\r\naway from the field, humbled (to the dust), of cheerless soul, and\r\ndestitute of all manliness? O son, O Sanjaya, I hope he did no dastardly\r\nact on that occasion? Did not that hero meet with his death like the\r\nother kshatriyas that have fallen? The foolish Duryodhana did not accept\r\nYudhishthira's constant advice, wholesome as medicine, against the\r\npropriety of battle. Possessed of great renown, Partha, when begged for\r\ndrink by Bhishma then lying on his arrowy bed, pierced the surface of the\r\nearth! Beholding the jet of water caused by the son of Pandu, the\r\nmighty-armed (Bhishma, addressing Duryodhana), said, \"O sire, make peace\r\nwith the Pandavas! Hostilities ceasing, peace will be thine! Let the war\r\nbetween thyself and thy cousins end with me! Enjoy the earth in\r\nbrotherliness with the sons of Pandu!\" Having disregarded those counsels,\r\nmy child is certainly repenting now. That has now come to pass which\r\nBhishma of great foresight said. As regards myself, O Sanjaya, I am\r\ndestitute of counsellors and reft of sons! In consequence of gambling, I\r\nam fallen into great misery like a bird shorn of its wings! As children\r\nengaged in sport, O Sanjaya, having seized a bird and cut off its wings,\r\nmerrily release it, but the creature cannot achieve locomotion in\r\nconsequence of its winglessness; even so have I become, like a bird shorn\r\nof its wings! Weak, destitute of every resource, without kinsmen and\r\ndeprived of relatives and friends, cheerless and overpowered by enemies,\r\nto which point of the compass shall I go? He who vanquished all the\r\nKambojas and the Amvashthas with the Kaikeyas, that puissant one, who,\r\nhaving for the accomplishment of his purpose vanquished the Gandharas and\r\nthe Videhas in battle, subjugated the whole Earth for the sake of\r\nDuryodhana's aggrandisement, alas, he hath been vanquished by the heroic\r\nand strong Pandavas endued with mighty arms! Upon the slaughter, in\r\nbattle, of that mighty bowman, Karna, by the diadem-decked (Arjuna), tell\r\nme, O Sanjaya, who were these heroes that stayed (on the field)! I hope\r\nhe was not alone and abandoned (by friends) when slain in battle by the\r\nPandavas? Thou hast, O sire, told me, before this, how our brave warriors\r\nhave fallen. With his powerful shafts Shikhandi felled in battle that\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, viz., Bhishma, who did nothing to\r\nrepel the attack. Similarly, Sanjaya, Drupada's son Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nuplifting his scimitar, slew the mighty bowman Drona who, already pierced\r\nwith many arrows, had laid aside his weapons in battle and devoted\r\nhimself to Yoga. These two were both slain at a disadvantage and\r\nespecially by deceit. Even this is what I have heard about the slaughter\r\nof Bhishma and Drona! Indeed, Bhishma and Drona, while contending in\r\nfight, were incapable of being slain in battle by the wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt himself by fair means. This that I tell thee is the truth! As\r\nregards Karna, how, indeed, could Death touch him, that hero equal unto\r\nIndra himself, while he was engaged in shooting his manifold celestial\r\nweapons? He unto whom in exchange for his earrings, Purandara had given\r\nthat foe slaying, gold-decked, and celestial dart of the splendour of\r\nlightning,--he who had, lying (within his quiver) amid sandal-dust, that\r\nsnake-mouthed celestial arrow decked with gold, equipped with goodly\r\nwings, and capable of slaying all foes, he who, disregarding those heroic\r\nand mighty car-warriors having Bhishma and Drona at their head, had\r\nacquired from Jamadagni's son the terrible brahmastra, that mighty-armed\r\none, who, having seen the warriors with Drona at their head afflicted\r\nwith arrows and turn away from the field, had cut off with his keen\r\nshafts the bow of Subhadra's son, he who, having in a trice deprived the\r\ninvincible Bhimasena endued with the might of 10,000 elephants and the\r\nspeed of the wind, of his car, had laughed at him,--he who, having\r\nvanquished Sahadeva by means of his straight shafts and made him carless,\r\nslew him not from compassion and considerations of virtue,--he who, with\r\nShakra's dart, slew that prince of rakshasas, Ghatotkaca, who from desire\r\nof victory, had invoked a 1,000 kinds of illusions,--he whose feats in\r\nbattle, filling Dhananjaya with fear, had made the latter for such a long\r\nperiod avoid a single combat with him,--alas, how could that hero be\r\nslain in battle? How could he be slain by foes unless one of these had\r\nhappened to him viz., the destruction of his car, the snapping of his\r\nbow, and the exhaustion of his weapons? Who could vanquish that tiger\r\namong men, like a real tiger, endued with great impetuosity, Karna, while\r\nshaking his formidable bow and shooting therefrom his terrible shafts and\r\ncelestial weapons in battle? Surely, his bow broke, or his car sank in\r\nthe earth, or his weapons became exhausted, since thou tellest me that he\r\nis slain! I do not, indeed, see any other cause for (explaining) his\r\nslaughter! That high-souled one who had made the terrible vow \"I will not\r\nwash my feet till I slay Phalguni,\" that warrior through whose fear that\r\nbull among men, king Yudhishthira the just, had not, in the wilderness,\r\nfor thirteen years continuously, obtained a wink of sleep,--that\r\nhigh-souled hero of great prowess relying upon whose valour my son had\r\nforcibly dragged the wife of the Pandavas to the assembly, and there in\r\nthe midst of that conclave, in the very sight of the Pandavas and in the\r\npresence of the Kurus, had addressed the princess of Pancala as the wife\r\nof slaves, that hero of the Suta caste, who in the midst of the assembly\r\nhad addressed Krishna, saying, \"All thy husbands, O Krishna, that are\r\neven like sesamum seeds without kernel, are no more, therefore, seek some\r\nother husband, O thou of the fairest complexion!\" and in wrath had caused\r\nher to listen to other expressions equally harsh and rude, how was that\r\nhero slain by the foe? He who had said unto Duryodhana even these words,\r\nviz., \"If Bhishma who boasteth of his prowess in battle or Drona who is\r\ninvincible in fight, doth not, from partiality, slay the sons of Kunti, O\r\nDuryodhana, even I will slay them all, let the fever of thy heart be\r\ndispelled!\" who also said, \"What will (Arjuna's) gandiva and the two\r\ninexhaustible quivers do to that shaft of mine, smeared with cool\r\nsandal-paste, when it will course through the welkin?\" alas, how could\r\nthat warrior possessed of shoulders broad as those of the bull be slain\r\nby Arjuna? He who, disregarding the fierce touch of the arrows shot from\r\ngandiva had addressed Krishna, saying, \"Thou hast no husbands now\" and\r\nglared at the Pandavas, he who, O Sanjaya, relying on the might of his\r\nown arms, had entertained no fear, for even a moment, of the Parthas with\r\ntheir sons and Janardana,--he, I think, could not possibly meet with\r\ndeath at the hands of the very gods with Vasava at their head rushing\r\nagainst him in fury, what then need I say, O sire, of the Pandavas? The\r\nperson could not be seen competent to stay before the son of Adhiratha,\r\nwhile the latter, putting on his fences, used to touch the bowstring! It\r\nwas possible for the Earth to be destitute of the splendour of the Sun,\r\nof the Moon, or of fire, but the death of that foremost of men, who never\r\nretreated from battle, could not be possible. That foolish child of mine,\r\nof wicked understanding, who having got Karna, as also his brother\r\nDuhshasana, for his ally, had made up his mind for the rejection of\r\nVasudeva's proposals, surely, that wight, beholding the slaughter of the\r\nbull-shouldered Karna and of Duhshasana, is now indulging in\r\nlamentations! Seeing Vikartana's son slain in single combat by Savyasaci,\r\nand the Pandavas crowned with victory, what indeed, did Duryodhana say?\r\nSeeing Durmarshana slain in battle and Vrishasena also, and seeing his\r\nhost break when slaughtered by mighty car-warriors, beholding also the\r\nkings (of his army) turn back their faces, intent on flight, and his\r\ncar-warriors already fled, I think that son of mine is now indulging in\r\nlamentations! Beholding his host dispirited, what, indeed, did the\r\nungovernable, proud, and foolish Duryodhana, with passions not under\r\ncontrol, say? Having himself provoked such fierce hostility though\r\ndissuaded by all his friends what, indeed, did Duryodhana, who has\r\nsuffered a great loss in battle of friends and followers, say? Beholding\r\nhis brother slain in battle by Bhimasena, and upon his blood being drunk,\r\nwhat indeed, did Duryodhana say? My son had, with the ruler of the\r\ngandharvas, said, \"Karna will slay Arjuna in battle!\" When he saw that\r\nKarna slain, what indeed, did he say? What, O sire, did Shakuni, the son\r\nof Subala, who had formerly been filled with joy after going through the\r\nmatch at dice and cheating the son of Pandu, say when he saw Karna slain?\r\nWhat did that mighty car-warrior among the Satwatas, that great bowman,\r\nKritavarma the son of Hridika, say when he saw Vaikartana slain? Endued\r\nwith youth, possessed of a handsome form, agreeable to the sight, and\r\ncelebrated throughout the world, what, O Sanjaya, did Ashvatthama, the\r\nintelligent son of Drona, upon whom brahmanas and kshatriyas and vaishyas\r\nwho are desirous of acquiring the science of arms wait, for protections,\r\nsay when he saw Karna slain? What did Sharadvata's son Kripa, O sire, of\r\nGotama's race, that foremost of car-warriors, that teacher of the science\r\nof arms, say when he saw Karna slain? What did the mighty leader of the\r\nMadras warriors, that king of the Madras, the great bowman Shalya of the\r\nSauvira clan, that ornament of assemblies, that foremost of car-warriors\r\n(temporarily) engaged in driving the car, say when he saw Karna slain?\r\nWhat also did all the other warriors, difficult of defeat in battle,\r\nthose lords of earth that came to fight, say, O Sanjaya, when they behold\r\nVaikartana slain? After the fall of the heroic Drona, that tiger among\r\ncar-warriors that bull among men, who, O Sanjaya, became the heads of the\r\nseveral division in their order? Tell me, O Sanjaya, how that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, Shalya the ruler of the Madras, became engaged in driving\r\nthe car of Vaikartana! Who were they that guarded the right wheel of the\r\nSuta's son while the latter was engaged in fight, and who were they that\r\nguarded his left wheel, and who were they that stood at the rear of that\r\nhero? Who were those heroes that did not desert Karna, and who were those\r\nmean fellows that ran away? How was the mighty car-warrior Karna slain\r\namidst your united selves? How also did those mighty car-warriors, the\r\nbrave Pandavas, advance against him shooting showers of shafts like the\r\nclouds pouring torrents of rain? Tell me also, O Sanjaya, how that mighty\r\nshaft, celestial and foremost of its species, and equipped with a head\r\nlike that of a serpent became futile! I do not, O Sanjaya, see the\r\npossibility of even a small remnant of my cheerless host being saved when\r\nits leaders have been crushed! Hearing of the slaughter of those two\r\nheroes, those two mighty bowmen, Bhishma and Drona, who were ever ready\r\nto lay down their lives for my sake, what use have I of life? Again and\r\nagain I am unable to endure that Karna, the might of whose arms equalled\r\nthat of 10,000 elephants, should be slain by the Pandavas! Tell me, O\r\nSanjaya, all that occurred in the battle between the brave warriors of\r\nthe Kauravas and their foes, after the death of Drona! Tell me also how\r\nthe sons of Kunti fought the battle with Karna, and how that slayer of\r\nfoes received his quietus in the fight!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the fall of the mighty bowman Drona on that day, O\r\nBharata, and after the purpose had been baffled of that mighty\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the son of Drona, and after the vasty army, O\r\nmonarch, of the Kauravas had fled away, Partha, having arrayed his own\r\ntroops, stayed on the field with his brothers. Perceiving him staying on\r\nthe field, thy son, O bull of Bharata's race, seeing his own army running\r\naway, rallied them with great courage. Having caused his divisions to\r\ntake up their stand, thy son, O Bharata, relying on the might of his\r\narms, fought for a long time with his foes, the Pandavas, who, having\r\ngained their end, were filled with joy and had been struggling for hours\r\ntogether. On the approach there of the evening twilight, he caused the\r\ntroops to be withdrawn. Having caused the withdrawal of their troops, and\r\nhaving entered their own encampment, the Kauravas held with one another a\r\nconsultation about their own welfare, seated like the celestials on\r\ncostly couches overlaid with rich coverlets, and on excellent seats and\r\nluxurious beds. Then king Duryodhana, addressing those mighty bowmen in\r\nagreeable and highly sweet expression, spoke the following words suited\r\nto the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"Ye foremost of intelligent men, declare all of you,\r\nwithout delay, your opinions! Under these circumstances, ye kings, what\r\nis necessary and what is still more necessary?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'When that prince of men had spoken those words,\r\nthose lions among men, seated on their thrones, made various gestures\r\nexpressive of their desire of battle. Observing the indications of those\r\nwho were all desirous of pouring their lives as libations on the\r\nbattle-fire, and beholding the monarch's face radiant as morning Sun, the\r\npreceptor's son endued with intelligence and accomplished in speech, said\r\nthese words: \"Enthusiasm, opportunity, skill and policy,--these are the\r\nmeans declared by the learned, to be capable of accomplishing all ends.\r\nThey are, however, dependent on destiny. Those foremost of men we had on\r\nour side, equal unto the celestials, mighty car-warriors all, possessed\r\nof policy, devoted, accomplished, and loyal, have been slain. For all\r\nthat we should not despair of victory. If all these means be properly\r\napplied, even destiny may be made propitious. All of us, therefore, O\r\nBharata, shall install Karna, that foremost of men, endued besides with\r\nevery accomplishment, in the command of the army! Making Karna our\r\ncommander, we shall crush our foes. This Karna is endued with great\r\nmight; he is a hero, accomplished in weapons, and incapable of defeat in\r\nbattle. Irresistible as Yama himself, he is quite competent to vanquish\r\nour foes in battle!\" Hearing these words from the preceptor's son, O\r\nking, at that time, built great hopes on Karna. Cherishing the hope in\r\nhis heart that after the fall of Bhishma and Drona, Karna would vanquish\r\nthe Pandavas, and comforted (by it), O Bharata, Duryodhana then, filled\r\nwith joy at having heard those words of Ashvatthama, steadying his mind\r\nand relying on the might of his arms, said unto Radha's son, O monarch,\r\nthese words that were fraught with affection and regard, and that were\r\ntrue, delightful, and beneficial to himself: \"O Karna, I know thy\r\nprowess, and the great friendship thou bearest to me! For all that, O\r\nmighty-armed one, I shall address the certain words that are for my good!\r\nHaving heard them, O hero, do that which may appear desirable to thee!\r\nThou art endued with great wisdom, and thou art even my supreme refuge!\r\nThose two Atirathas that were my Generals, viz., Bhishma and Drona, have\r\nbeen slain. Be thou my General, thou that art mightier than they! Both of\r\nthose great bowmen were advanced in years. They were, besides, partial to\r\nDhananjaya. Still both those heroes were respected by me, O son of Radha,\r\nat thy word! Viewing his relationship of grandsire unto them, the sons of\r\nPandu, O sire, were spared in dreadful battle by Bhishma for ten\r\nsuccessive days! Thyself also having laid aside thy weapons, the valiant\r\nBhishma was slain in great battle by Phalguni with Shikhandi before him!\r\nAfter that great bowman had fallen and betaken himself to his bed of\r\narrows, it was at thy word, O tiger among men, that Drona was made our\r\nleader! By him also were the sons of Pritha spared, in consequence, as I\r\nthink, of their relationship unto him of pupils. That old man also has\r\nbeen slain by Dhrishtadyumna more speedily. I do not see, even on\r\nreflection, another warrior equal to thee in battle,--thee, that is,\r\nwhose prowess could not be measured by even those two foremost of\r\nwarriors that have been slain in the fight! Without doubt, thou alone\r\ntoday art competent to win victory for us! Before, in the middle, and\r\nlater on, thou hast accordingly acted for our good. Therefore, like a\r\nleader, it behoveth thee, in this battle, to bear the burden thyself.\r\nThyself install thy own self in the Generalship. Like the celestial\r\ngeneralissimo, the lord Skanda of unfading prowess, (supporting the\r\ncelestial army), do thou support this Dhartarashtra host! Like Mahendra\r\nslaying the Danavas, destroy thou all the throngs of our foes! Beholding\r\nthee staying in battle, the Pandavas, those mighty car-warriors, will,\r\nwith the Pancalas, fly away from battle, like the Danavas at sight of\r\nVishnu. Do thou, therefore lead this vast force! When thou shalt stand\r\nresolved on the field, the Pandavas of wicked hearts, the Pancalas, and\r\nthe Srinjayas, will all fly away with their friends. As the risen Sun,\r\nscorching everything by his energy, destroyeth the thick gloom, even so\r\ndo thou destroy our foes!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Strong became that hope, O king, in the heart of thy\r\nson, viz., that where Bhishma and Drona had been slain, Karna would\r\nvanquish the Pandavas. Cherishing that hope within his heart, he said\r\nunto Karna, \"O Suta's son, Partha never wishes to fight, standing before\r\nthee!\" Karna said, \"I have, O son of Gandhari, said before in thy\r\npresence, even these words, vanquish all the Pandavas with their sons and\r\nJanardana!' I shall become thy General. In this there is no doubt.\r\nTranquilise thyself, O monarch I Consider the Pandavas to be already\r\nvanquished!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, O monarch, king Duryodhana then\r\nstood up with all the monarchs, like He of a hundred sacrifices with the\r\ngods, for honouring Karna with the command of the army, like the\r\ncelestials for honouring Skanda. Then, O monarch, all the kings headed by\r\nDuryodhana, desirous of victory, installed Karna in the command,\r\naccording to the rites enjoined by the ordinance. With golden and earthen\r\njars filled to the brim with water and sanctified with mantras, with\r\ntusks of elephants and horns of rhinoceroses and mighty bulls, with other\r\nvessels decked with jewels and gems, with also fragrant herbs and plants,\r\nand with other articles collected in abundance, Karna, seated at his ease\r\non a seat made of udumvara wood and overlaid with silken cloth, was\r\ninvested with the command, according to the rites in the scriptures.\r\nBrahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and respectable shudras, praised that\r\nhigh-souled one after he was bathed on that excellent seat. Thus\r\ninstalled in the command, O king, that slayer of foes, the son of Radha,\r\ncaused, by presents of Niskas and kine and other wealth, many foremost of\r\nbrahmanas to utter blessings on him. \"Vanquish the Parthas with Govinda\r\nand all their followers,\" even these were the words that the eulogists\r\nand the brahmanas said (unto him), O bull among men! (And they also said)\r\n\"Slay the Parthas and the Pancalas, O son of Radha, for our victory, like\r\nrisen Sun ever destroying Darkness with his fierce rays! The son of Pandu\r\nwith Keshava are not able to even look at the shafts shot by thee, like\r\nowls unable to gaze at the burning rays of the Sun! The Parthas with the\r\nPancalas are incapable of standing before thee armed with weapons, like\r\nthe danavas before Indra in battle!\" Installed in the command, Radha's\r\nson of incomparable splendour looked resplendent in beauty and radiance\r\nlike a second Sun. Having installed the son of Radha (thus) in the\r\ncommand of the army, thy son, urged on by Death, regarded himself as one\r\nwho had his purpose accomplished. That chastiser of foes, Karna, also, O\r\nking, having obtained the command, ordered the troops to be arrayed, at\r\nthe rise of the Sun. Surrounded by thy sons, O Bharata, Karna looked\r\nresplendent like Skanda surrounded by the celestials, in the battle\r\nhaving Saraka for its evil root.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After having obtained the command of the army, and\r\nafter he had been addressed by the king himself in those sweet and\r\nbrotherly words, and after he had ordered the troops to be arrayed at the\r\nhour of sunrise, tell me, O Sanjaya, what did Vikartana's son Karna do?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having learnt Karna's wishes, thy sons, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, ordered the troops to be arrayed with joyful music. While\r\nit still wanted a long period for the coming of the dawn, a loud noise of\r\n\"Array, Array!\" O king, suddenly arose among thy troops. And the uproar\r\nthat arose, became tremendous and touched the very heavens, of foremost\r\nof elephants and fenced cars while under process of equipment, of\r\nfoot-soldiers and steeds, O monarch, while putting on their armour or in\r\ncourse of being harnessed, and of combatants moving with activity and\r\nshouting unto one another! Then the Suta's son bearing a gold-backed bow\r\nappeared (on the field) in his car possessed of the splendour of the\r\nradiant Sun, crowned with many banners, equipped with a white standard,\r\nwith steeds of the hue of cranes, bearing the device of the elephants'\r\nrope, filled with a hundred quivers, furnished with mace and wooden\r\nfence, freighted with shataghnis and rows of bells and darts and lances\r\nand spears, and supplied with many bows. And the Suta's son appeared on\r\nthe field, blowing his conch, O king; decorated with a net-work of gold,\r\nand shaking his formidable bow adorned with pure gold. Beholding the\r\nmighty bowman Karna, that foremost of car-warriors, seated on his car,\r\ndifficult of approach and resembling the risen Sun that destroys the\r\ngloom, none amongst the Kauravas, O tiger among men, recked, O sire, the\r\nloss of Bhishma or Drona or other men! Speeding the warriors, O sire,\r\nwith the blasts of his conch, Karna caused the vast army of the Kauravas\r\nto be drawn out. Having arrayed the troops in the makara array, that\r\nmighty bowman, that scorcher of foes, viz., Karna, proceeded against the\r\nPandavas from desire of victory. In the tip of the beak of that makara, O\r\nking, was stationed Karna himself. In the two eyes were the brave Shakuni\r\nand the mighty car-warrior Uluka. In the head was Drona's son and in the\r\nneck were all the uterine brothers. In the middle was king Duryodhana\r\nsupported by a large force. In the left foot, O monarch, was stationed\r\nKritavarma accompanied by the Narayana troops, and those invincible\r\nwarriors, the gopalas. In the right foot, O king, was Gotama's son of\r\nprowess incapable of being baffled, surrounded by those mighty bowmen\r\nviz., the Trigartas and by the Southerners. In the left hind-foot was\r\nstationed Shalya with a large force raised in the country of Madras. In\r\nthe right (hind-foot), O monarch, was Sushena of true vows, surrounded by\r\na 1,000 cars and 300 elephants. In the tail were the two royal brothers\r\nof mighty energy, viz., Citra and Citrasena surrounded by a large force.\r\n\r\n\"'When, O great king, that foremost of men, Karna, thus came out, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, casting his eyes on Arjuna, said these words:\r\n\"Behold, O Partha, how the Dhartarashtra force, O hero, in this battle,\r\nprotected by heroes and mighty car-warriors, hath been arrayed by Karna!\r\nThis vast Dhartarashtra force hath lost its bravest warriors. They that\r\nremain, O mighty-armed one, are feeble, equal, as I think, to straw! Only\r\none great bowman, viz., the Suta's son, shineth in it! That foremost of\r\ncar-warriors is incapable of being vanquished by the three worlds with\r\ntheir mobile and immobile creatures, including the gods, Asuras and\r\nGandharvas, and the Kinnaras and great serpents! If thou slayest him\r\ntoday, O mighty-armed one, the victory will be thine, O Phalguna! The\r\nthorn also which for twelve years hath been planted in my heart will then\r\nbe plucked out! Knowing this, O thou of mighty arms, form thou the array\r\nthat thou wishest!\" Hearing those words of his brother, that Pandava of\r\nthe white steeds disposed his army in counter array after the form of the\r\nhalf moon. On the left side was stationed Bhimasena, and on the right was\r\nstationed the great bowman Dhrishtadyumna. In the middle of the array\r\nwere the king and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu. Nakula and Sahadeva were\r\nat the rear of king Yudhishthira the just. The two Pancala princes,\r\nYudhamanyu and Uttamauja, became the protectors of (Arjuna's) car wheels.\r\nProtected by the diadem-decked Arjuna himself, they did not quit Arjuna\r\nfor a moment. The remaining kings, possessed of great courage, clad in\r\nmail, stood in the array, each in the position assigned to him, according\r\nto the measure of his enthusiasm and resolution, O Bharata. Having thus\r\nformed their great array, O Bharata, the Pandavas, and the mighty bowmen\r\nof thy army set their hearts on battle. Beholding thy army disposed into\r\nbattle array by the Suta's son in battle Duryodhana with all his brethren\r\nregarded the Pandavas to be already slain. Similarly Yudhishthira, O\r\nking, beholding the Pandava army disposed in array, regarded the\r\nDhartarashtras with Karna to be already slain. Then conches, and\r\nkettle-drums, and tabours, and large drums, and cymbals, and Dindimas,\r\nand Jharjharas, were loudly blown and beaten on all sides! Indeed, those\r\nloud-sounding instruments were blown and beaten, O king, among both the\r\narmies. Leonine roars also arose, uttered by brave warriors for victory.\r\nAnd there also arose, O king, the noise of neighing steeds and grunting\r\nelephants, and the fierce clatter of car-wheels. None, O Bharata, (in the\r\nKaurava army), at that time, felt the loss of Drona, seeing the great\r\nbowman Karna clad in mail and stationed at the head of the array. Both\r\narmies, O monarch, teeming with joyous men, stood, eager for battle and\r\n(ready) to destroy each other without delay. There, the two heroes, viz.,\r\nKarna and the son of Pandu, excited with wrath at sight of each other,\r\nand both firmly resolved, stood or careered, O king, through their\r\nrespective divisions. The two armies, as they advanced to meet each\r\nother, seemed to dance (in joy). From the wings and the side-wings of\r\nboth, warriors desirous of battle came forth. Then commenced the battle,\r\nO monarch, of men, elephants, steeds, and cars, engaged in destroying one\r\nanother.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then those two vast armies, teeming with rejoicing men\r\nand steeds and elephants, resembling in splendour the celestial and the\r\nAsura hosts, meeting together, began to strike each other. Men, cars,\r\nsteeds, elephants, and foot-soldiers of fierce prowess, made sturdy\r\nstrokes destructive of bodies and sin. Lion-like men strewed the Earth\r\nwith the heads of lion-like men, each resembling the full moon or the sun\r\nin splendour and the lotus in fragrance. Combatants cut off the heads of\r\ncombatants, with crescent-shaped and broad-headed shafts and razor-faced\r\narrows and axes, and battle-axes. The arms of men of long and massive\r\narms, cut off by men of long and massive arms, falling upon the Earth,\r\nshone, decked with weapons and bracelets. With those writhing arms\r\nadorned with red fingers and palms, the Earth looked resplendent as if\r\nstrewn with fierce five-headed snakes slain by Garuda. From elephants and\r\ncars and steeds, brave warriors fell down, struck by foes, like the\r\ndenizens of heaven from their celestial cars on the exhaustion of their\r\nmerits. Other brave warriors fell down by hundreds, crushed in that\r\nbattle by brave combatants with heavy maces spiked clubs and short\r\nbludgeons. Cars also, in that tumultuous fight, were crushed by cars, and\r\ninfuriate elephants by infuriate compeers, and horsemen by horsemen. Men\r\ndestroyed by cars, and cars by elephants, and horsemen by foot-soldiers,\r\nand foot-soldiers by horsemen, dropped down on the field, as also cars\r\nand steeds and foot-soldiers destroyed by elephants and cars and steeds\r\nand elephants by foot-soldiers, and cars and foot-soldiers and elephants\r\nby steeds and men and elephants by cars. Great was the carnage made of\r\ncar-warriors and steeds and elephants and men by men and steeds and\r\nelephants and car-warriors, using their hands and feet and weapons and\r\ncars. When that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic warriors\r\nthe Parthas, headed by Vrikodara, advanced against us. They consisted of\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the five sons of Draupadi and the\r\nPrabhadrakas, and Satyaki and Chekitana with the Dravida forces, and the\r\nPandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, surrounded by a mighty array, all\r\npossessed of broad chests, long arms, tall statures, and large eyes.\r\nDecked with ornaments, possessed of red teeth, endued with the prowess of\r\ninfuriate elephants, attired in robes of diverse colours, smeared with\r\npowdered scents, armed with swords and nooses, capable of restraining\r\nmighty elephants, companions in death, and never deserting one another,\r\nequipped with quivers, bearing bows adorned with long locks, and\r\nagreeable in speech were the combatants of the infantry files led by\r\nSatyaki, belonging to the Andhra tribe, endued with fierce forms and\r\ngreat energy. Other brave warriors such as the Cedis, the Pancalas, the\r\nKaikayas, the Karushas, the Kosalas, the Kanchis, and the Maghadhas, also\r\nrushed forward. Their cars and steeds and elephants, all of the foremost\r\nkind, and their fierce foot-soldiers, gladdened by the notes of diverse\r\ninstruments, seemed to dance and laugh. In the midst of that vast force,\r\ncame Vrikodara, riding on the neck of an elephant, and surrounded by many\r\nforemost of elephant-soldiers, advancing against thy army. That fierce\r\nand foremost of elephants, duly equipped, looked resplendent, like the\r\nstone-built mansion on the top of the Udaya mountain, crowned with the\r\nrisen Sun. Its armour of iron, the foremost of its kind, studded with\r\ncostly gems, was as resplendent as the autumnal firmament bespangled with\r\nstars. With a lance in his outstretched arm, his head decked with a\r\nbeautiful diadem, and possessed of the splendour of the meridian Sun at\r\nautumn, Bhima began to burn his foes. Beholding that elephant from a\r\ndistance, Kshemadhurti, himself on an elephant, challenging, rushed\r\ncheerfully towards Bhima who was more cheerful still. An encounter then\r\ntook place between those two elephants of fierce forms resembling two\r\nhuge hills topped with trees, each, fighting with the other as it liked.\r\nThose two heroes, then, whose elephants thus encountered each other,\r\nforcibly struck each other with lances endued with the splendour of solar\r\nrays, and uttered loud roars. Separating, they then careered in circles\r\nwith their elephants, and each taking up a bow began to strike the other.\r\nGladdening the people around with their loud roars and the slaps on their\r\narmpits and the whizz of this arrows, they continued to utter leonine\r\nshouts. Endued with great strength, both of them, accomplished in\r\nweapons, fought, using their elephants with upturned trunks and decked\r\nwith banners floating on the wind. Then each cutting off the other's bow,\r\nthey roared at each other, and rained on each other showers of darts and\r\nlances like two masses of clouds in the rainy season pouring torrents of\r\nrain. Then Kshemadhurti pierced Bhimasena in the centre of the chest with\r\na lance endued with great impetuosity, and then with six others, and\r\nuttered a loud shout. With those lances sticking to his body, Bhimasena,\r\nwhose form then blazed with wrath, looked resplendent like the\r\ncloud-covered Sun with his rays issuing through the interstices of that\r\ncanopy. Then Bhima carefully hurled at his antagonist a lance bright as\r\nthe rays of the Sun, coursing perfectly straight, and made entirely of\r\niron. The ruler of the Kulutas then, drawing his bow, cut off that lance\r\nwith ten shafts and then pierced the son of Pandu with sixty shafts. Then\r\nBhima the son of Pandu, taking up a bow whose twang resembled the roar of\r\nthe clouds, uttered a loud shout and deeply afflicted with his shafts the\r\nelephants of his antagonist. Thus afflicted in that battle by Bhimasena\r\nwith his arrows, that elephant, though sought to be restrained, stayed\r\nnot on the field like a wind-blown cloud. The fierce prince of elephants\r\nowned by Bhima then pursued his (flying) compeer, like a wind-blown mass\r\nof clouds pursuing another mass driven by the tempest. Restraining his\r\nown elephant valiant Kshemadhurti pierced with his shafts the pursuing\r\nelephant of Bhimasena. Then with a well-shot razor-headed arrow that was\r\nperfectly straight, Kshemadhurti cut off his antagonist's bow and then\r\nafflicted that hostile elephant. Filled with wrath, Kshemadhurti then, in\r\nthat battle, pierced Bhima and struck his elephant with many long shafts\r\nin every vital part. That huge elephant of Bhima then fell down, O\r\nBharata! Bhima, however, who had jumped down from his elephant and stood\r\non the Earth before the fall of the beast, then crushed the elephant of\r\nhis antagonist with his mace. And Vrikodara then struck Kshemadhurti\r\nalso, who, jumped down from his crushed elephant, was advancing against\r\nhim with uplifted weapon. Kshemadhurti, thus struck, fell down lifeless,\r\nwith the sword in his arm, by the side of his elephant, like a lion\r\nstruck down by thunder beside a thunder-riven hill. Beholding the\r\ncelebrated king of the Kulutas slain, thy troops, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace exceedingly distressed, fled away.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then the mighty and heroic bowman Karna began to smite\r\nthe Pandava army in that battle, with his straight shafts. Similarly,\r\nthose great car-warriors, viz., the Pandavas, O king, filled with wrath,\r\nbegan to smite the army of thy son in the very sight of Karna. Karna\r\nalso, O king, in that battle slew the Pandava army with his cloth-yard\r\nshafts bright as the rays of the Sun and polished by the hands of the\r\nsmith. There, O Bharata, the elephants, struck by Karna with his shafts,\r\nuttered loud cries, lost strength, became faint, and wandered on all\r\nsides. While the army was being thus destroyed by the Suta's son, Nakula\r\nrushed with speed against that mighty car-warrior. And Bhimasena rushed\r\nagainst Drona's son who was engaged in the accomplishment of the most\r\ndifficult feats. Satyaki checked the Kaikaya princes Vinda and Anuvinda.\r\nKing Citrasena rushed against the advancing Srutakarman; and Prativindhya\r\nagainst Citra owning a beautiful standard and a beautiful bow. Duryodhana\r\nrushed against king Yudhishthira the son of Dharma; while Dhananjaya\r\nrushed against the angry throngs of the samsaptakas. In that slaughter of\r\ngreat heroes, Dhrishtadyumna proceeded against Kripa. The invincible\r\nShikhandi closed with Kritavarma. Srutakirti encountered Shalya, and\r\nMadri's son, the valiant Sahadeva, O king, encountered thy son\r\nDuhshasana. The two Kaikaya princes, in that battle, shrouded Satyaki\r\nwith a shower of blazing arrows, and the latter also, O Bharata, shrouded\r\nthe two Kaikaya brothers. Those two heroic brothers deeply struck Satyaki\r\nin the chest like two elephants striking with their tusks a hostile\r\ncompeer in the forest. Indeed, O king, those two brothers, in that\r\nbattle, their own vitals pierced with shafts, pierced Satyaki of true\r\ndeeds with their shafts. Satyaki, however, O great king, covering all the\r\npoints of the compass with a shower of arrows and smiling the while,\r\nchecked the two brothers, O Bharata. Checked by those showers of arrows\r\nshot by the grandson of Sini, the two brothers speedily shrouded the car\r\nof Sini's grandson with their shafts. Cutting off their beautiful bows,\r\nSaurin of great fame checked them both with his keen arrows in that\r\nbattle. Taking up two other beautiful bows, and a number of powerful\r\nshafts, the two began to cover Satyaki and career with great activity and\r\nskill. Shot by the two brothers, those mighty shafts equipped with the\r\nfeathers of the Kanka and the peacock and decked with gold, began to\r\nfall, illumining all the points of the compass. In that dreadful battle\r\nbetween them, O king, the arrows they shot caused a darkness there. Those\r\nmighty car-warriors then cut off each other's bows. Then the invincible\r\nSatwata, O king, filled with rage, took up another bow in that battle,\r\nand stringing it, cut off Anuvinda's head with a keen razor-headed shaft.\r\nDecked with earrings, that large head, O king, fell like the head of\r\nSamvara slain in the great battle (of old). And it reached the Earth in\r\nno time, filling all the Kaikayas with grief. Beholding that brave\r\nwarrior slain, his brother, the mighty car-warrior Vinda, stringing\r\nanother bow began to resist the grandson of Sini from every side.\r\nPiercing with sixty arrows equipped with wings of gold and whetted on\r\nstone, he uttered a loud shout and said, \"Wait, Wait!\" Then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior of the Kaikayas speedily struck Satyaki with many thousands\r\nof shafts in his arms and chest. All his limbs wounded with arrows,\r\nSatyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled, looked resplendent in\r\nthat battle, O king, like a flowering Kinsuka. Pierced by the high-souled\r\nKaikaya in that encounter, Satyaki, with the greatest ease, pierced the\r\nKaikaya (in return) with five and twenty arrows. Then those two foremost\r\nof car-warriors, having each cut off the other's handsome bow in that\r\nencounter, and having each quickly slain the other's driver and steeds\r\napproached each other on foot for a fight with swords. Both endued with\r\nmassive arms, they looked resplendent on that extensive arena, each\r\nhaving taken up a shield decked with a hundred moons, and each armed with\r\nan excellent sword, like Jambha and Sakra, both endued with great might,\r\nin the battle between the gods and the Asuras (of old). Both of them, in\r\nthat great battle, then began to career in circles. And then they\r\nspeedily encountered each other in battle, each approaching the other\r\nnear. And each of them made great efforts for the destruction of the\r\nother. Then Satwata cut in twain the shield of Kaikeya. The latter also,\r\nO king, cut in twain the shield of Satyaki. Having cut off his\r\nantagonist's shield covered with centuries of stars, Kaikeya began to\r\ncareer in circles, advancing and receding (at times). Then the grandson\r\nof Sini, endued with great activity, cut off by a sidestroke the prince\r\nof the Kaikeyas thus careering in that great arena armed with excellent\r\nsword. Cased in armour that great bowman, viz., the Kaikeya prince, O\r\nking, thus cut off in twain in that great battle, fell down like a hill\r\nriven with thunder. Having slain him in battle that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors that scorcher of foes, viz., the brave grandson of Sini\r\nquickly got upon the car of Yudhamanyu. Afterwards riding upon another\r\ncar duly equipped (with everything), Satyaki began to slay with his\r\nshafts the large force of the Kaikeyas. The vast army of the Kaikeyas,\r\nthus slaughtered in battle, leaving that foe of theirs fled away on all\r\nsides.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Srutakarman then, O king, filled with wrath, struck that\r\nlord of Earth, viz., Citrasena, in that battle, with fifty shafts. The\r\nruler of the Abhisars (in return), striking Srutakarman, O king, with\r\nnine straight arrows, pierced his driver with five. Srutakarman then,\r\nfilled with rage, struck Citrasena at the head of his forces, with a keen\r\narrow in a vital part. Deeply pierced, O monarch, with that arrow by that\r\nhigh-souled prince the heroic Citrasena felt great pain and swooned away.\r\nDuring this interval, Srutakarman of great renown covered that lord of\r\nEarth, (viz., his insensible antagonist), with ninety arrows. The mighty\r\ncar-warrior Citrasena then, recovering consciousness, cut off his\r\nantagonist's bow with a broad-headed arrow, and pierced his antagonist\r\nhimself with seven arrows. Taking up another bow that was decked with\r\ngold, and capable of striking hard, Srutakarman then, with his waves of\r\narrows, made Citrasena assume a wonderful appearance. Adorned with those\r\narrows, the youthful king, wearing beautiful garlands, looked in that\r\nbattle like a well-adorned youth in the midst of an assembly. Quickly\r\npiercing Srutakarman with an arrow in the centre of the chest, he said\r\nunto him, \"Wait, Wait!\" Srutakarman also, pierced with that arrow in the\r\nbattle, began to shed blood, like a mountain shedding streams of liquid\r\nred chalk. Bathed in blood and dyed therewith, that hero shone in battle\r\nlike a flowering Kinsuka. Srutakarman, then, O king, thus assailed by the\r\nfoe, became filled with rage, and cut in twain the foe-resisting bow of\r\nCitrasena. The latter's bow having been cut off, Srutakarman then, O\r\nking, pierced him with three hundred arrows equipped with goodly wings,\r\ncovering him completely therewith. With another broad-headed arrow,\r\nsharp-edged and keen pointed, he cut off the head, decked with head-gear\r\nof his high-souled antagonist. That blazing head of Citrasena fell down\r\non the ground, like the moon loosened from the firmament upon the Earth\r\nat will. Beholding the king slain, the troops of Citrasena, O sire,\r\nrushed impetuously against (his slayer). That great bowman then, filled\r\nwith rage, rushed, shooting his shafts, against that army, like Yama\r\nfilled with fury, against all creatures at the time of the universal\r\ndissolution. Slaughtered in that battle by thy grandson armed with the\r\nbow, they quickly fled on all sides like elephants scorched by a\r\nforestconflagration. Beholding them flying away, hopeless of vanquishing\r\nthe foe, Srutakarman, pursuing them with his keen arrows, looked\r\nexceedingly resplendent (on his car). Then Prativindhya, piercing Citra\r\nwith five arrows, struck his driver with three and his standard with one.\r\nHim Citra pierced, striking in the arms and the chest, with nine\r\nbroad-headed shafts equipped with wings of gold, having keen points, and\r\nplumed with Kanka and peacock feathers. Then Prativindhya, O Bharata,\r\ncutting off with his shafts the bow of his antagonist deeply struck the\r\nlatter with five keen arrows. Then Citra, O monarch, sped at thy grandson\r\na terrible and irresistible dart, adorned with golden bells, and\r\nresembling a flame of fire. Prativindhya, however, in that battle, cut\r\noff, with the greatest ease, into three fragments, that dart as it\r\ncoursed towards him like a flashing meteor. Cut off into three fragments,\r\nwith Prativindhya's shafts, that dart fell down, like the thunderbolt\r\ninspiring all creatures with fear at the end of the Yuga. Beholding that\r\ndart baffled, Citra, taking up a huge mace decked with a net-work of\r\ngold, hurled it at Prativindhya. That mace slew the latter's steeds and\r\ndriver also in that great battle, and crushing, besides, his car, fell\r\nwith great impetuosity on the Earth. Meanwhile, having alighted from his\r\ncar, O Bharata, Prativindhya hurled at Citra a dart, well-adorned and\r\nequipped with a golden staff. Catching it as it coursed towards him, the\r\nhigh-souled king Citra, O Bharata, hurled the very weapon at\r\nPrativindhya. Striking the brave Prativindhya in that battle, that\r\nblazing dart, piercing through his right arm, fell down on the Earth, and\r\nfalling illumined the whole region like a blast of lightning. Then\r\nPrativindhya, O king, filled with rage, and desiring to compass the\r\ndestruction of Citra, sped at him a lance decked with gold. That lance\r\npenetrating through his armour and chest, entered the Earth like a mighty\r\nsnake in its hole. Struck with that lance, the king fell down, stretching\r\nout his large and massive arms that resembled a couple of iron clubs.\r\nBeholding Citra slain, thy warriors, those ornaments of battle, rushed\r\nimpetuously at Prativindhya from all sides. Shooting diverse kinds of\r\nshafts and Sataghnis decked with rows of bells, they soon covered\r\nPrativindhya like masses of clouds covering the Sun. The mighty-armed\r\nPrativindhya, consuming with his arrowy showers those assailants of his\r\nin that battle, routed thy army like the thunder-wielding Sakra routing\r\nthe Asura host. Thus slaughtered in battle by the Pandavas, thy troops, O\r\nking, suddenly dispersed in all directions like congregated masses of\r\nclouds dispersed by the wind. While thy army, slaughtered on all sides,\r\nwas thus flying away, only Drona's son singly rushed with speed against\r\nthe mighty Bhimasena. All at once a fierce encounter ensued between them\r\nlike to what had taken place between Vritra and Vasava in the battle\r\nbetween the gods and the Asuras (of old).'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Endued with the greatest activity, Drona's son, O king,\r\ndisplaying the lightness of his arms, pierced Bhima with an arrow. Aiming\r\nat all his vital points--for he had a knowledge of all the vital points\r\nof the body--the quick-handed Ashvatthama again struck him with ninety\r\nshafts. Pierced all over with keen arrows by the son of Drona, Bhimasena\r\nlooked resplendent in that battle like the Sun himself with his rays. The\r\nson of Pandu then, covering the son of Drona with a 1,000 well-directed\r\nshafts, uttered a leonine roar. Baffling with his own shafts the shafts\r\nof his foe in that battle, the son of Drona, O king, as if smiling, then\r\nstruck the Pandava on the forehead with a cloth-yard shaft. The son of\r\nPandu bore that arrow on his forehead even as the proud rhinoceros, O\r\nking, in the forest bears its horn. The valiant Bhima, then, in that\r\nbattle as if smiling all the while, struck the struggling son of Drona on\r\nthe forehead with three cloth-yard shafts. With those three arrows\r\nsticking on his forehead, that brahmana looked beautiful like a\r\nthree-peaked mountain washed with water in the season of rains. The son\r\nof Drona then afflicted the Pandava with hundreds of arrows, but failed\r\nto shake him like the wind failing to shake the mountain. Similarly the\r\nson of Pandu, filled with joy, could not in that battle shake the son of\r\nDrona with his hundreds of keen shafts like torrents of rain failing to\r\nshake a mountain. Shrouding each other with showers of terrible shafts\r\nthose two great car-warriors, those two heroes, endued with fierce might,\r\nshone resplendent on those two foremost of cars of theirs. Then they\r\nlooked like two blazing Suns risen for the destruction of the world, and\r\nengaged themselves in scorching each other with their rays representing\r\nexcellent arrows. Endeavouring with great care to counteract each other's\r\nfeats in the great battle, and actually engaged in matching deed by deed\r\nwith showers of arrows most fearlessly, those two foremost of men\r\ncareered in that combat like a couple of tigers. Both invincible and\r\nterrible, arrows constituted their fangs and bows their mouths. They\r\nbecame invisible under those clouds of arrows on all sides like the Sun\r\nand the Moon in the firmament shrouded by masses of clouds. And then\r\nthose two chastisers of foes soon became visible and blazed forth like\r\nMars and Mercury freed from cloudy screens. Then at that instant during\r\nthe progress of that awful battle, Drona's son placing Vrikodara to his\r\nright, poured hundreds of fierce arrows upon him like the clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain upon a mountain. Bhima, however, could not brook that\r\nindication of his enemy's triumphs. The son of Pandu, O king, from that\r\nvery station on Ashvatthama's right, began to counteract the latter's\r\nfeats. Their cars continuing to wheel around in diverse ways and advance\r\nand retreat (according to the exigencies of the situation), the battle\r\nbetween those two lions among men became exceedingly furious. Careering\r\nin diverse paths, and (executing) circular manoeuvres, they continued to\r\nstrike each other with arrows shot from their bows drawn to their fullest\r\nstretch. And each made the greatest endeavours to compass the destruction\r\nof the other. And each of them desired to make the other carless in that\r\nbattle. Then that car-warrior, viz., the son of Drona, invoked many\r\nmighty weapons. The son of Pandu, however, in that battle, with his own\r\nweapons, counteracted all those weapons of his foe. Then, O monarch,\r\nthere took place an awful encounter of weapons, like to the terrible\r\nencounter of planets at the time of the universal dissolution. Those\r\nshafts, O Bharata, let off by them, coming in collision, illuminated all\r\nthe points of the compass and thy troops also all around. Covered with\r\nflights of arrows, the welkin assumed a terrible sight, like to what\r\nhappens, O king, at the time of the universal dissolution, when it is\r\ncovered with falling meteors. From the clash of shafts, O Bharata, fire\r\nwas generated there with sparks and blazing flames. That fire began to\r\nconsume both armies. Siddhas, moving there, O monarch, said these words,\r\n\"O lord, this battle is the foremost of all battles. Any battle (fought\r\nbefore) does not come up to even a sixteenth part of this. A battle like\r\nthis will never occur again. Both these persons, viz., this brahmana and\r\nthis kshatriya, are endued with knowledge. Both are possessed of courage,\r\nand both are fierce in prowess. Dreadful is the might of Bhima, and\r\nwonderful is the skill of the other in weapons. How great is their energy\r\nand how wonderful the skill possessed by both! Both of them stand in this\r\nbattle like two universe-destroying Yamas at the end of the Yuga. They\r\nare born like two Rudras or like two Suns. These two tigers among men,\r\nboth endued with terrible forms, are like two Yamas in this battle.\" Such\r\nwere the words of the Siddhas heard there every moment. And among the\r\nassembled denizens of heaven there arose a leonine roar. Beholding the\r\namazing and inconceivable feats of the two warriors in that battle, the\r\ndense throngs of Siddhas, and Charanas were filled with wonder. And the\r\ngods, the Siddhas, and the great Rishis applauded them both saying,\r\n\"Excellent, O mighty-armed son of Drona. Excellent, O Bhima.\" Meanwhile\r\nthose two heroes, in that battle, O king, having done injuries to each\r\nother, glared at each other with eyes rolling in rage. With eyes red in\r\nrage, their lips also quivered in rage. And they grinded their teeth in\r\nwrath and bit their lips. And those two great car-warriors covered each\r\nother with showers of arrows, as if they were in that battle two masses\r\nof clouds that poured torrents of arrows for rain and that gleamed with\r\nweapons constituting their lightning. Having pierced each other's\r\nstandards and drivers in that great battle, and having also pierced each\r\nother's steeds, they continued to strike each other. Then, O monarch,\r\nfilled with rage, they took up in that dreadful encounter, two arrows,\r\nand each desirous of slaying the other shot quickly at his foe. Those two\r\nblazing arrows, resistless and endued with the force of thunder, coming,\r\nO king, to the two warriors as they stood at the head of their respective\r\ndivisions, struck them both. Each of the two mighty combatants then\r\ndeeply struck with those arrows, sank, on the terrace of their respective\r\ncar. Understanding the son of Drona to be insensible, his driver then\r\nbore him away from the battle-field, O king, in the sight of all the\r\ntroops. Similarly, O king, Bhima's driver bore away from the battle-field\r\non his car, the son of Pandu, that scorcher of foes, who was repeatedly\r\nfalling into a swoon.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Describe to me the battle of Arjuna with the\r\nsamsaptakas, and of the other kings with the Pandavas. Narrate to me\r\nalso, O Sanjaya, the battle of Arjuna with Ashvatthama, and of the other\r\nlords of the Earth with Partha.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, as I speak to thee as to how occurred the\r\nbattle of the heroic warriors (on our side) with the foe--the battle\r\nwhich was destructive of bodies, sins, and lives. That slayer of foes,\r\nviz, Partha, penetrating into the Samsaptaka force that resembled the\r\nocean, agitated it exceedingly, like a tempest agitating the vast deep.\r\nCutting off with broad-headed arrows of keen edges the heads of brave\r\nwarriors that were decked with faces possessed of the splendour of the\r\nfull moon and with beautiful eyes and eyebrows and teeth, Dhananjaya\r\nspeedily caused the Earth to be strewn there as if with lotuses, plucked\r\noff their stalks. And in that battle Arjuna with his razor-headed shafts,\r\ncut off the arms of his foes, that were all well rounded, large and\r\nmassive, and smeared with sandal-paste and other perfumes, with weapons\r\nin grasp, with leathern gloves casing their fingers, and looking like\r\nfive-headed snakes. And the son of Pandu repeatedly cut off with his\r\nbroad-headed shafts, steeds, riders, drivers, and flags, and bows and\r\narrows, and arms decked with gems. And Arjuna in that battle, O king,\r\nwith many thousands of arrows, despatched to Yama's abode, car-warriors\r\nand elephants and horses and horsemen. Many foremost of warriors, filled\r\nwith rage and roaring like bulls mad (like them) with excitement for a\r\ncow in season, rushed towards Arjuna, with loud cries. All of them then\r\nbegan to strike Arjuna with their arrows as the latter was employed in\r\nslaying them, like infuriate bulls striking one of their species with\r\ntheir horns. The battle that took place between him and them made the\r\nhair to stand on end, even like the battle between the Daityas and the\r\nwielder of the thunderbolt on the occasion of the conquest of the three\r\nworlds. Resisting with his own weapons the weapons of his foes on all\r\nsides. Arjuna, piercing them fast with innumerable arrows, took their\r\nlives. Like the wind destroying vast masses of clouds, Arjuna, otherwise\r\ncalled Jaya, that enhancer of the fears of his foes, cutting off into\r\nminute fragments large throngs of cars,--cars, that is, whose poles,\r\nwheels, and axles had previously been shattered by him, and whose\r\nwarriors and steeds and drivers had been slain before, and whose weapons\r\nand quivers had been displaced, and standards crushed, and traces and\r\nreins sundered, and wooden fences and shafts broken already, and filling\r\nevery body with wonder, achieved feats magnificent to behold and\r\nrivalling those of a 1,000 great car-warriors fighting together. Crowds\r\nof Siddhas and celestial Rishis and Charanas all applauded him. And\r\ncelestial kettle-drums sounded, and floral showers fell upon the heads of\r\nKeshava and Arjuna. And an incorporeal voice said, \"These viz., Keshava\r\nand Arjuna, are those two heroes that always possess the beauty of the\r\nmoon, the splendour of fire, the force of the wind and the radiance of\r\nthe sun. Stationed on the same car these two heroes are invincible even\r\nlike Brahman and Isana. These two heroes the foremost of all creatures\r\nare Nara and Narayana.\" Hearing and beholding these wonderful things, O\r\nBharata, Ashvatthama, with great care and resolution, rushed against\r\nKrishna and Arjuna in that battle. With his arm that held an arrow in its\r\ngrasp, the son of Drona hailed the Pandava, shooting shafts equipped with\r\nfoe-slaying heads, and smilingly told him these words, \"If, O hero, thou\r\nregardest me a worthy guest arrived (before thee), then give me today,\r\nwith the whole heart, the hospitality of battle.\" Thus summoned by the\r\npreceptor's son from desire of battle, Arjuna regarded himself highly\r\nhonoured, and addressing Janardana said, \"The samsaptakas should be slain\r\nby me, but Drona's son again is summoning me. Tell me, O Madhava, to\r\nwhich of these duties should I first turn? First let the services of\r\nhospitality be offered, if thou thinkest that to be proper.\" Thus\r\naddressed, Krishna bore Partha who had been summoned according to the\r\nrules of triumphant challenge to the vicinity of Drona's son, like Vayu\r\nbearing Indra to the sacrifice. Saluting Drona's son whose mind was fixed\r\nupon one thing, Keshava, said unto him, \"O Ashvatthama, be cool, and\r\nwithout losing a moment strike and bear. The time has come for those that\r\nare dependent on others to repay their obligation to their masters. The\r\ndisputes between brahmanas are subtle. The consequences, however, of the\r\ndisputes of kshatriyas are palpable, being either victory or defeat. For\r\nobtaining those excellent rites of hospitality that from folly thou\r\nsolicitest at the hands of Partha, fight coolly now with the son of\r\nPandu.\" Thus addressed by Vasudeva, that foremost of regenerate ones,\r\nreplied saying, \"So be it!\" pierced Keshava with sixty shafts and Arjuna\r\nwith three. Arjuna then, filled with rage, cut off Ashvatthama's bow with\r\nthree shafts. Drona's son took up another bow that was still more\r\nformidable. Stringing it within the twinkling of an eye, he pierced\r\nArjuna and Keshava, the latter with three hundred arrows, and the former\r\nwith a 1,000. And then Drona's son, with good care, stupefying Arjuna in\r\nthat battle, shot thousands and tens of thousands and millions of arrows.\r\nFrom the quivers, the bow, the bow-string, the fingers, the arms, the\r\nhands, the chest, the face, the nose, the eyes, the ears, the heads, the\r\nlimbs, the pores of the body, the armour on his person, the car, and the\r\nstandard, O sire, of that utterer of Brahma, arrows began to issue.\r\nPiercing Madhava and the son of Pandu with the thick arrowy shower,\r\nDrona's son filled with joy, roared aloud like a vast mass of congregated\r\nclouds. Hearing that roar of his, the son of Pandu said unto Keshava of\r\nunfading glory these words \"Behold, O Madhava, this wickedness towards me\r\nof the preceptor's son. He regardeth us to be slain, having shrouded us\r\nwith his dense arrowy shower. I will presently, however, by my training\r\nand might, baffle his purpose.\" Cutting off every one of those arrows\r\nshot by Ashvatthama into three fragments, that foremost one of Bharata's\r\nrace destroyed them all like the Sun destroying a thick fog. After this\r\nthe son of Pandu once more pierced with his fierce shafts, the\r\nsamsaptakas with their steeds, drivers, cars, elephants, standards and\r\nfoot-soldiers. Every one of those that stood there as spectators, every\r\none of those that were stationed there on foot or car or steed or\r\nelephant, regarded himself as shrouded by the arrows of Arjuna. Shot from\r\nGandiva, those winged arrows of diverse forms slew in that battle\r\nelephants and steeds and men whether stationed in his immediate front or\r\nat the distance of two miles. The trunks, cut off with broad-headed\r\nshafts, of elephants, down whose cheeks and other limbs flowed the juice\r\nindicative of excitement, fell down like tall trees in the forest struck\r\ndown with the axe. A little after down fell elephants, huge as hillocks,\r\nwith their riders, like mountains crushed by Indra with his thunder. With\r\nhis shafts cutting into minute portions well-equipped cars that looked\r\nlike dissolving edifices of vapour in the evening sky and unto which were\r\nyoked well-trained steeds of great speed and which were ridden by\r\nwarriors invincible in battle, the son of Pandu continued to shower his\r\narrows on his enemies. And Dhananjaya continued to slay well-decked\r\nhorsemen and foot-soldiers of the foe. Indeed, Dhananjaya, resembling the\r\nvery Sun as he rises at the end of the Yuga, dried up the samsaptaka\r\nocean incapable of being dried up easily, by means of keen arrows\r\nconstituting his rays. Without losing a moment, the son of Pandu once\r\nmore pierced Drona's son resembling a huge hill, with shafts of great\r\nimpetuosity and the splendour of the Sun, like the wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt piercing a mountain with the thunder. Desirous of battle, the\r\npreceptor's son then, filled with rage, approached Arjuna for piercing\r\nhim and his steeds and drivers by means of his swiftly coursing shafts.\r\nArjuna, however, quickly cut off the shafts shot at him by Ashvatthama.\r\nThe son of Pandu then filled with great wrath, proffered unto\r\nAshvatthama, that desirable guest, quivers upon quivers of arrows, like a\r\ncharitable person offering everything in his house unto a guest. Leaving\r\nthe samsaptakas then the son of Pandu rushed towards Drona's son like a\r\ndonor abandoning unworthy guests, for proceeding towards one that is\r\nworthy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then occurred that battle between Arjuna and Ashvatthama\r\nresembling the planets Shukra and Brihaspati in splendour, like the\r\nbattle between Shukra and Brihaspati in the firmament for entering the\r\nsame constellation. Afflicting each other with blazing shafts that\r\nconstituted their rays, those terrifiers of the world stood like two\r\nplanets both deviating from their orbits. Then Arjuna deeply pierced\r\nAshvatthama with a shaft in the midst of his eyebrows. With that shaft\r\nthe son of Drona looked resplendent like the Sun with upward rays. The\r\ntwo Krishnas (Nara and Narayana), also deeply afflicted by Ashvatthama\r\nwith hundreds of arrows, looked like two Suns at the end of the Yuga,\r\nresplendent with their own rays. Then when Vasudeva seemed to be\r\nstupefied, Arjuna shot a weapon from which issued torrents of shafts on\r\nall sides. And he struck the son of Drona with innumerable shafts, each\r\nresembling the thunder or fire or the sceptre of Death. Endued with\r\nmighty energy, that achiever of fierce feats, (Ashvatthama) then pierced\r\nboth Keshava and Arjuna with well-shot shafts which were inspired with\r\ngreat impetuosity and struck with which Death himself would feel pain.\r\nChecking the shafts of Drona's son, Arjuna covered him with twice as many\r\narrows equipped with goodly wings, and shrouding that foremost of heroes\r\nand his steeds and driver and standard, began to strike the samsaptakas.\r\nWith his well-shot shafts Partha began to cut off the bows and quivers\r\nand bowstrings and hands and arms and tightly grasped weapons and\r\numbrellas and standards and steeds and car shafts and robes and floral\r\ngarlands and ornaments and coats of mail and handsome shields and\r\nbeautiful heads, in large numbers, of his unretreating foes.\r\nWell-equipped cars and steeds and elephants, ridden by heroes fighting\r\nwith great care, were destroyed by the hundreds of shafts sped by Partha\r\nand fell down along with the heroes that rode on them. Cut off with\r\nbroad-headed and crescent-shaped and razor-faced arrows, human heads,\r\nresembling the lotus, the Sun, or the full Moon in beauty and resplendent\r\nwith diadems and necklaces and crowns, dropped ceaselessly on the earth.\r\nThen the Kalinga, the Vanga, and the Nishada heroes, riding on elephants,\r\nthat resembled in splendour the elephant of the great foe of the daityas,\r\nrushed with speed against the queller of the pride of the danavas, the\r\nson of Pandu, from desire of slaying him. Partha cut off the vital limbs,\r\nthe trunks, the riders, the standards, and the banners of those\r\nelephants, upon which those beasts fell down like mountain summits riven\r\nwith thunder. When that elephant force was broken, the diadem-decked\r\nArjuna shrouded the son of his preceptor with shafts endued with the\r\nsplendour of the newly risen Sun, like the wind shrouding the risen Sun\r\nwith masses of congregated clouds. Checking with his own shafts those of\r\nArjuna, Drona's son shrouding both Arjuna and Vasudeva with his arrows,\r\ngave a loud roar, like a mass of clouds at the close of summer after\r\nshrouding the Sun or the Moon in the firmament. Deeply afflicted with\r\nthose arrows, Arjuna, aiming his weapons at Ashvatthama and at those\r\nfollowers of his belonging to the army, speedily dispelled that darkness\r\ncaused by Ashvatthama's arrows, and pierced all of them with shafts\r\nequipped with goodly wings. In that battle none could see when Savyasaci\r\ntook up his shafts, when he aimed them, and when he let them off. All\r\nthat could be seen was that elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers and\r\ncar-warriors, struck with his arrows, fell down deprived of life. Then\r\nDrona's son without losing a moment, aiming ten foremost of arrows, sped\r\nthem quickly as if they formed only one arrow. Shot with great force,\r\nfive of these pierced Arjuna and the other five pierced Vasudeva. Struck\r\nwith those arrows, those two foremost of men, like Kuvera and Indra,\r\nbecame bathed in blood. Thus afflicted, all the people there regarded\r\nthose two heroes as slain by Ashvatthama the warrior who had completely\r\nmastered the science of arms. Then the chief of the Dasharhas addressed\r\nArjuna and said, \"Why errest thou in thus sparing Ashvatthama? Slay this\r\nwarrior. If treated with indifference, even this one will be the cause of\r\ngreat woe, like a disease not sought to be put down by treatment.\"\r\nReplying unto Keshava of unfading glory with the words \"So be it!\" Arjuna\r\nof unclouded understanding began with good care to mangle the son of\r\nDrona with his shafts. Now the son of Pandu, filled with rage, quickly\r\npierced the massive arms, smeared with sandal-paste, and the chest, the\r\nhead, and the unrivalled thighs of his antagonist with shafts equipped\r\nwith heads like goats' ears, and shot with great force from gandiva. Then\r\ncutting off the traces of Ashvatthama's steeds, Arjuna began to pierce\r\nthe steeds themselves, whereat the latter bore Ashvatthama away to a\r\ngreat distance from the field. Thus borne away by these steeds endued\r\nwith the speed of the wind, the intelligent son of Drona, deeply\r\nafflicted with the shafts of Partha, reflecting for some time, wished not\r\nto go back and renew the fight with Partha. Knowing that victory is ever\r\nwith the chief of the Vrishnis and with Dhananjaya, that foremost one of\r\nAngirasa's race, endued with great activity, entered the army of Karna,\r\ndeprived of hope and with shafts and weapons almost exhausted. Indeed,\r\nDrona's son, restraining his steeds, and having comforted himself a\r\nlittle, O sire, entered the force of Karna, teeming with cars and steeds\r\nand men. After Ashvatthama, that enemy of theirs, had been thus removed\r\nfrom the field by his steeds like a disease removed from the body by\r\nincantations and medicines and means, Keshava and Arjuna proceeded\r\ntowards the samsaptakas, on their car whose rattle resembled the roar of\r\nthe clouds and whose banner waved on the wind.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile towards the northern part of the Pandava army,\r\na loud uproar arose of cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers as\r\nthose were being massacred by Dandadhara. Turning the course of the car,\r\nbut without stopping the steeds which were as fleet as Garuda or the\r\nwind, Keshava, addressing Arjuna, said, \"The chief of the Magadhas, with\r\nhis (foe-crushing) elephant is unrivalled in prowess. In training and\r\nmight he is not inferior to Bhagadatta himself. Having slain him first,\r\nthou wilt then slay the samsaptakas.\" At the conclusion of his words,\r\nKeshava bore Partha to the presence of Dandadhara. The chief of the\r\nMagadhas, peerless in handling the elephant-hook even as the headless\r\nplanet Ketu (is peerless) among all the planets, was destroying the\r\nhostile army like a fierce comet destroying the whole earth. Riding on\r\nhis foe-slaying and well-equipped elephant which looked like the danava\r\nwith elephantine face and form, and whose roar resembled that of a\r\ncongregated mass of clouds, Dandadhara was destroying with his shafts\r\nthousands of cars and steeds and elephants and men. The elephants also,\r\ntreading upon cars with their feet, pressed down into the Earth a large\r\nnumber of men with their steeds and drivers. Many were the elephants,\r\nalso, which that foremost of elephants, crushed and slew with his two\r\nforefeet and trunk. Indeed, the beast moved like the wheel of Death.\r\nSlaying men adorned with steel coats of mail, along with their horses and\r\nfoot-soldiers, the chief of the Magadhas caused these to be pressed down\r\ninto the earth, like thick reeds pressed down with crackling sounds, by\r\nmeans of that mighty and foremost of elephants belonging to him. Then\r\nArjuna, riding on that foremost of cars, rushed quickly towards that\r\nprince of elephants in the midst of that host teeming with thousands of\r\ncars and steeds and elephants, and resounding with the beat and blare of\r\ninnumerable cymbals and drums and conchs and uproarious with the clatter\r\nof car-wheels, the twang of bow-strings, and the sound of palms. Even\r\nDandadhara pierced Arjuna with a dozen foremost of shafts and Janardana\r\nwith sixteen and each of the steeds with three, and then uttered a loud\r\nshout and laughed repeatedly. Then Partha, with a number of broad-headed\r\nshafts, cut off the bow of his antagonist with its string and arrow fixed\r\nthereon, as also his well-decked standard, and then the guides of his\r\nbeast and the footmen that protected the animal. At this, the lord of\r\nGirivraja became filled with rage. Desirous of agitating Janardana with\r\nthat tusker of his, whose temples had split from excitement, and which\r\nresembled a mass of clouds and was endued with the speed of the wind,\r\nDandadhara struck Dhananjaya with many lances. The son of Pandu then,\r\nwith three razor-headed arrows, cut off, almost at the same instant of\r\ntime, the two arms each looking like the trunk of an elephant, and then\r\nthe head, resembling the full Moon, of his foe. Then Arjuna struck the\r\nelephant of this antagonist with hundreds of arrows. Covered with the\r\ngold-decked arrows of Partha, that elephant equipped with golden armour\r\nlooked as resplendent as a mountain in the night with its herbs and trees\r\nblazing in a conflagration. Afflicted with the pain and roaring like a\r\nmass of clouds, and exceedingly weakened, the elephant crying and\r\nwandering and running with tottering steps, fell down with the guide on\r\nits neck, like a mountain summit riven by thunder. Upon the fall of his\r\nbrother in battle, Danda advanced against Indra's younger brother and\r\nDhananjaya, desirous of slaying them, on his tusker white as snow and\r\nadorned with gold and looking like a Himalayan summit. Danda struck\r\nJanardana with three whetted lances bright as the rays of the sun, and\r\nArjuna with five, and uttered a loud shout. The son of Pandu then\r\nuttering a loud shout cut off the two arms of Danda. Cut off by means of\r\nrazor-headed shafts, those two arms, smeared with sandal-paste, adorned\r\nwith angadas, and with lances in grasp, as they fell from the elephant's\r\nback at the same instant of time, looked resplendent like a couple of\r\nlarge snakes of great beauty falling down from a mountain summit. Cut off\r\nwith a crescent-shaped arrow by the diadem-decked (Partha), the head also\r\nof Danda fell down on the Earth from the elephant's back, and covered\r\nwith blood it looked resplendent as it lay like the sun dropped from the\r\nAsta mountain towards the western quarter. Then Partha pierced with many\r\nexcellent arrows bright as the rays of the sun that elephant of his foe,\r\nresembling a mass of white clouds whereupon it fell down with a noise\r\nlike a Himalayan summit riven with thunder. Then other huge elephants\r\ncapable of winning victory and resembling the two already slain, were cut\r\noff by Savyasaci, in that battle, even as the two (belonging to Danda and\r\nDandadhara) had been cut off. At this the vast hostile force broke. Then\r\nelephants and cars and steeds and men, in dense throngs, clashed against\r\none another and fell down on the field. Tottering, they violently struck\r\none another and fell down deprived of life. Then his soldiers,\r\nencompassing Arjuna like the celestials encompassing Purandara, began to\r\nsay, \"O hero, that foe of whom we had been frightened like creatures at\r\nthe sight of Death himself, hath by good luck been slain by thee. If thou\r\nhadst not protected from that fear those people that were so deeply\r\nafflicted by mighty foes, then by this time our foes would have felt that\r\ndelight which we now feel at their death, O slayer of enemies.\" Hearing\r\nthese and other words uttered by friends and allies, Arjuna, with a\r\ncheerful heart, worshipped those men, each according to his deserts, and\r\nproceeded once more against the samsaptakas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Wheeling round, like the planet Mercury in the curvature\r\nof its orbit, Jishnu (Arjuna) once more slew large number of the\r\nsamsaptakas. Afflicted with the shafts of Partha, O king, men, steeds,\r\nand elephants, O Bharata, wavered and wondered and lost colour and fell\r\ndown and died. Many foremost of animals tied to yokes and drivers and\r\nstandards, and bows, and shafts and hands and weapons in grasp, and arms,\r\nand heads, of heroic foes fighting with him, the son of Pandu cut off in\r\nthat battle, with arrows, some of which were broad-headed, some equipped\r\nwith heads like razors, some crescent-shaped, and some furnished with\r\nheads like the calf's tooth. Like bulls fighting with a bull for the sake\r\nof a cow in season, brave warriors by hundreds and thousands closed upon\r\nArjuna. The battle that took place between them and him made the hair to\r\nstand on end like the encounter between the Daityas and Indra, the\r\nwielder of the thunderbolt on the occasion of the conquest of the three\r\nworlds. Then the son of Ugrayudha pierced Partha with three shafts\r\nresembling three venomous snakes. Partha, however, cut off from his\r\nenemy's trunk the latter's head. Then those warriors, filled with rage,\r\ncovered Arjuna from every side with diverse kinds of weapons like the\r\nclouds urged by the Maruts shrouding Himavat at the close of summer.\r\nChecking with his own weapons those of his foes on every side, Arjuna\r\nslew a large number of his enemies with well-shot shafts. With his arrows\r\nArjuna then cut off the Trivenus, the steeds, the drivers, and the\r\nparshni drivers of many cars, and displaced the weapons and quivers of\r\nmany, and deprived many of their wheels and standards, and broke the\r\ncords, the traces and the axles of many, and destroyed the bottoms and\r\nyokes of others, and caused all the equipment of many to fall from their\r\nplaces. Those cars, thus smashed and injured by Arjuna in large numbers,\r\nlooked like the luxurious mansions of the rich destroyed by fire, wind,\r\nand rain. Elephants, their vitals pierced with shafts resembling\r\nthunderbolts in impetuosity, fell down like mansions on mountain-tops\r\noverthrown by blasts of lightning. Large numbers of steeds with their\r\nriders, struck by Arjuna, fell down on the Earth, their tongues and\r\nentrails pressed out, themselves deprived of strength and bathed in\r\nblood, and presenting an awful sight. Men and steeds and elephants,\r\npierced by Savyasaci (Arjuna) with his shafts, wondered and tottered and\r\nfell down and uttered cries of pain and looked pale, O sire. Like\r\nMahendra smiting down the danavas, Partha smote down large numbers of his\r\nfoes, by means of shafts whetted on stone and resembling the thunder of\r\npoison in deadliness. Brave warriors, cased in costly coats of mail and\r\ndecked with ornaments and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, lay on the\r\nfield, with their cars and standards, slain by Partha. Vanquished (and\r\ndeprived of life) persons of righteous deeds, possessed of noble birth\r\nand great knowledge, proceeded to heaven in consequence of those glorious\r\ndeeds of theirs while their bodies only lay on Earth. Then the chief,\r\nbelonging to thy army, of various realms, filled with wrath and\r\naccompanied by their followers, rushed against Arjuna, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors. Warriors borne on their cars and steeds and elephants, and\r\nfoot-soldiers also, all desirous of slaying (Arjuna), rushed towards him,\r\nshooting diverse weapons with great speed. Then Arjuna like wind, by\r\nmeans of keen shafts, destroyed that thick shower of weapons dropped by\r\nthose warriors constituting a mass of congregated clouds. People then\r\nbeheld Arjuna crossing that raftless ocean constituted by steeds and\r\nfoot-soldiers and elephants and cars, and having mighty weapons for its\r\nwaves, on a bridge constituted by his own mighty weapons of offence and\r\ndefence. Then Vasudeva, addressing Partha, said, \"Why, O sinless one,\r\ndost thou sport in this way? Grinding these samsaptakas, haste thyself\r\nfor Karna's slaughter.\" Saying, \"So be it\" unto Krishna, Arjuna then,\r\nforcibly smiting the remnant of the samsaptakas with his weapons, began\r\nto destroy them like Indra destroying the Daityas. At that time, with\r\neven the closest attention, men could not mark when Arjuna took out his\r\nshafts, when he aimed them and when he let them off quickly. Govinda\r\nhimself, O Bharata, regarded it wonderful. Like swans diving into a lake\r\nthe shafts of Arjuna, white and active as swans, penetrated into the\r\nhostile force. Then Govinda, beholding the field of battle during the\r\nprogress of that carnage, said these words to Savyasaci, \"Here, O Partha,\r\nfor the sake of Duryodhana alone, occurreth this great and terrible\r\ndestruction of the Bharatas and other kings of Earth. Behold, O son of\r\nBharata, these bows, with golden backs, of many mighty bowmen, and these\r\ngirdles and quivers loosened from their bodies. Behold these straight\r\nshafts equipped with wings of gold, and these long arrows washed with oil\r\nand looking like snakes freed from their sloughs. Behold these beautiful\r\nlances decked with gold lying scattered about, and these coats of mail, O\r\nBharata, adorned with gold and fallen off from the bodies of the\r\nwarriors. Behold these spears embellished with gold, these darts adorned\r\nwith the same metal, and these huge maces twined round with threads of\r\ngold, and cords of hemp. Behold these swords decked with bright gold and\r\nthese axes adorned with the same, and these battle-axes equipped with\r\ngold-decked handles. Behold also these spiked clubs, these short arrows,\r\nthese Bhusundis, and these Kanapas; these iron Kuntas lying around, and\r\nthese heavy Mushalas. These victory-longing warriors endued with great\r\nactivity and armed with diverse weapons, though dead, still seem to be\r\nquick with life. Behold those thousands of warriors, their limbs crushed\r\nwith maces, and heads split with Mushalas or smashed and trod by\r\nelephants and steeds and cars. O slayer of foes, the field of battle is\r\nstrewn with the bodies of men and elephants and steeds, deprived of life,\r\ndreadfully mangled with shafts and darts and swords and lances and\r\nscimitars and axes and spears and Nakharas and bludgeons, and bathed in\r\nstreams of blood. Strewn with arms smeared with sandal-paste and decked\r\nwith Angadas and graced with auspicious indications and cased in leathern\r\nfences and adorned with Keyuras, the Earth looks resplendent, O Bharata.\r\nStrewn also with hands having fingers cased in fences, decked with\r\nornaments, and lopped off from arms, and with severed thighs looking like\r\nthe trunks of elephants, of heroes endued with great activity and with\r\nheads adorned with earrings and headgears set with gems, (the Earth looks\r\nexceedingly beautiful). Behold those beautiful cars, decked with golden\r\nbells, broken in diverse ways. Behold those numerous steeds bathed in\r\nblood, those bottoms of cars and long quivers, and diverse kinds of\r\nstandards and banners and those huge conchs, of the combatants, and those\r\nyak-tails perfectly white, and those elephants with tongues lolling out\r\nand lying on the field like hills, and those beautiful with triumphal\r\nbanners, and those slain elephant-warriors, and those rich coverlets,\r\neach consisting of one piece of blanket, for the backs of those huge\r\nbeasts, and those beautiful and variegated and torn blankets, and those\r\nnumerous bells loosened from the bodies of elephants and broken into\r\nfragments by those falling creatures, and those hooks with handles set\r\nwith stones of lapis lazuli fallen upon the Earth, and those ornamental\r\nyokes of steeds, and those armours set with diamonds for their breasts\r\nand those rich cloths, adorned with gold and tied to the ends of the\r\nstandards borne by horsemen, and those variegated coverlets and housings\r\nand Ranku skins, set with brilliant gems and inlaid with gold, for the\r\nbacks of steeds and fallen on the ground, and those large diamonds\r\nadorning the head-gears of kings, and those beautiful necklaces of gold,\r\nand those umbrellas displaced from their positions, and those yak-tails\r\nand fans. Behold the earth strewn with faces adorned with earrings bright\r\nas the moon or stars, and embellished with well-cut beards, and each\r\nlooking like the full moon. The earth, strewn with those faces looking\r\nlike lilies and lotuses, resembles a lake adorned with a dense assemblage\r\nof lilies and lotuses. Behold, the earth possessing the effulgence of the\r\nbright moon and diversified as if with myriads of stars, looks like the\r\nautumnal firmament bespangled with stellar lights. O Arjuna, these feats\r\nthat have been achieved by thee in great battle today are, indeed, worthy\r\nof thee or of the chief of the celestials himself in heaven.\" Even thus\r\ndid Krishna show the field of battle unto Arjuna. And while returning\r\n(from the field to their camp), they heard a loud noise in the army of\r\nDuryodhana. Indeed the uproar that was heard consisted of the blare of\r\nconchs and the beat of cymbals and drums and Patahas and the clatter of\r\ncar wheels, the neighing of steeds, the grunt of elephants, and the\r\nfierce clash of weapons. Penetrating into that force by the aid of his\r\nsteeds possessing the fleetness of the wind, Krishna became filled with\r\nwonder upon beholding the army grinded by Pandya. Like Yama himself\r\nslaying creatures whose lives have run out, Pandya, that foremost of\r\nwarriors skilled in shafts and weapons, was destroying crowds of foes by\r\nmeans of diverse kinds of shafts. Piercing the bodies of the elephants\r\nand steeds and men with sharp shafts, that foremost of smiters overthrew\r\nand deprived them of life. Cutting off with his own shafts the diverse\r\nweapons hurled at him by many foremost of foes, Pandya slew his enemies\r\nlike Sakra (Indra) destroying the Danavas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou didst mention to me before the name of Pandya,\r\nthat hero of world-wide celebrity, but his feats, O Sanjaya, in battle\r\nhave never been narrated by thee. Tell me today in detail of the prowess\r\nof that great hero, his skill, spirit, and energy, the measure of his\r\nmight, and his pride.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Drona's son and Karna and\r\nArjuna and Janardana, those thorough masters of the science of weapons,\r\nare regarded by thee as the foremost of car-warriors. Know, however, that\r\nPandya regarded himself superior to all these foremost of car-warriors in\r\nenergy. Indeed he never regarded any one amongst the kings as equal to\r\nhimself. He never admitted his equality with Karna and Bhishma. Nor did\r\nhe admit within his heart that he was inferior in any respect to Vasudeva\r\nor Arjuna. Even such was Pandya, that foremost of kings, that first of\r\nwielder of weapons. Filled with rage like the Destroyer himself, Pandya\r\nat the time was slaughtering the army of Karna. That force, swelling with\r\ncars and steeds and teeming with foremost of foot-soldiers, struck by\r\nPandya, began to turn round like the potter's wheel. Like the wind\r\ndispersing a mass of congregated clouds, Pandya, with his well shot\r\narrows, began to disperse that force, destroying its steeds and drivers\r\nand standards and cars and causing its weapons and elephants to fall\r\ndown. Like the splitter of mountains striking down mountains with his\r\nthunder, Pandya overthrew elephants with their riders, having previously\r\ncut down the standards and banners and weapons with which they were\r\narmed, as also the foot-soldiers that protected those beasts. And he cut\r\ndown horses, and horsemen with their darts and lances and quivers.\r\nMangling with his shafts the Pulindas, the Khasas, the Bahlikas, the\r\nNishadas, the Andhakas, the Tanganas, the Southerners, and the Bhojas,\r\nall of whom, endued with great courage, were unyielding and obstinate in\r\nbattle, and divesting them of their weapons and coats of mail, Pandya\r\ndeprived them of their lives. Beholding Pandya destroying with his shafts\r\nin battle that host consisting of four kinds of forces, the son of Drona\r\nfearlessly proceeded towards that fearless warrior. Fearlessly addressing\r\nin sweet words that warrior who then seemed to dance on his car, Drona's\r\nson, that foremost of smiters, smiling the while, summoned him and said,\r\n\"O king, O thou with eyes like the petals of the lotus, thy birth is\r\nnoble and learning great. Of celebrated might and prowess, thou\r\nresemblest Indra himself. Stretching with thy two massive arms the bow\r\nheld by thee and whose large string is attached to thy grasp, thou\r\nlookest beautiful like a mass of congregated clouds as thou pourest over\r\nthy foes thick showers of impetuous shafts. I do not see anybody save\r\nmyself that can be a match for thee in battle. Alone thou crushest\r\nnumerous cars and elephants and foot-soldiers and steeds, like the\r\nfearless lion of terrible might crushing herds of deer in the forest.\r\nMaking the welkin and the Earth resound with the loud clatter of thy\r\ncar-wheels thou lookest resplendent, O king, like a crop-destroying\r\nautumnal cloud of loud roars. Taking out of thy quiver and shooting thy\r\nkeen shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison fight with myself only,\r\nlike (the asura) Andhaka fighting with the three-eyed deity.\" Thus\r\naddressed, Pandya answered, \"So be it.\" Then Drona's son, telling him\r\n\"Strike,\" assailed him with vigour. In return, Malayadhwaja pierced the\r\nson of Drona with a barbed arrow. Then Drona's son, that best of\r\npreceptors, smiling the while, struck Pandya with some fierce arrows,\r\ncapable of penetrating into the very vitals and resembling flames of\r\nfire. Then Ashvatthama once more sped at his foe some other large arrows\r\nequipped with keen points and capable of piercing the very vitals,\r\ncausing them to course through the welkin with the ten different kinds of\r\nmotion. Pandya, however, with nine shafts of his cut off all those arrows\r\nof his antagonist. With four other shafts he afflicted the four steeds of\r\nhis foe, at which they speedily expired. Having then, with his sharp\r\nshafts, cut off the arrows of Drona's son, Pandya then cut off the\r\nstretched bow-string of Ashvatthama, endued with the splendour of the\r\nsun. Then Drona's son, that slayer of foes, stringing his unstringed bow,\r\nand seeing that his men had meanwhile speedily yoked other excellent\r\nsteeds unto his car, sped thousands of arrows (at his foe). By this, that\r\nregenerate one filled the entire welkin and the ten points of the compass\r\nwith his arrows. Although knowing that those shafts of the high-souled\r\nson of Drona employed in shooting were really inexhaustible, yet Pandya,\r\nthat bull among men, cut them all into pieces. The antagonist of\r\nAshvatthama, carefully cutting off all those shafts shot by the latter,\r\nthen slew with his own keen shafts the two protectors of the latter's car\r\nwheels in that encounter. Beholding the lightness of hand displayed by\r\nhis foe, Drona's son, drawing his bow to a circle, began to shoot his\r\narrows like a mass of clouds pouring torrents of rain. During that space\r\nof time, O sire, which consisted only of the eighth part of a day, the\r\nson of Drona shot as many arrows as were carried on eight carts each\r\ndrawn by eight bullocks. Almost all those men that then beheld\r\nAshvatthama, who at the time looked like the Destroyer himself filled\r\nwith rage, or rather the Destroyer of the Destroyer, lost their senses.\r\nLike a mass of clouds at the close of summer drenching with torrents of\r\nrain, the Earth with her mountains and trees, the preceptor's son poured\r\non that hostile force his arrowy shower. Baffling with the Vayavya weapon\r\nthat unbearable shower of arrows shot by the Ashvatthama-cloud, the\r\nPandya-wind, filled with joy, uttered loud roars. Then Drona's son\r\ncutting off the standard, smeared with sandal-paste and other perfumed\r\nunguents and bearing the device of the Malaya mountain on it, of the\r\nroaring Pandya, slew the four steeds of the latter. Slaying then his\r\nfoe's driver with a single shaft, and cutting off with a crescent-shaped\r\narrow the bow also of that warrior whose twang resembled the roar of the\r\nclouds, Ashvatthama cut off his enemy's car into minute fragments.\r\nChecking with the weapons those of his enemy, and cutting off all the\r\nweapons of the latter, Drona's son, although he obtained the opportunity\r\nto do his enemy the crowning evil, still slew him not, from desire of\r\nbattling with him for some time more. Meanwhile Karna rushed against the\r\nlarge elephant force of the Pandavas and began to rout and destroy it.\r\nDepriving car-warriors of their cars, he struck elephants and steeds and\r\nhuman warriors, O Bharata, with innumerable straight shafts. That mighty\r\nbowman, the son of Drona, although he had made Pandya, that slayer of\r\nfoes and foremost of car-warriors, carless, yet he did not slay him from\r\ndesire of fight. At that time a huge riderless elephant with large tusks,\r\nwell-equipped with all utensils of war, treading with speed, endued with\r\ngreat might, quick to proceed against any enemy, struck with\r\nAshvatthama's shafts, advanced towards the direction of Pandya with great\r\nimpetuosity, roaring against a hostile compeer. Beholding that prince of\r\nelephants, looking like a cloven mountain summit, Pandya, who was well\r\nacquainted with the method of fighting from the neck of an elephant,\r\nquickly ascended that beast like a lion springing with a loud roar to the\r\ntop of a mountain summit. Then that lord of the prince of mountains,\r\nstriking the elephant with the hook, and inspired with rage, and with\r\nthat cool care for which he was distinguished in hurling weapons with\r\ngreat force, quickly sped a lance, bright as Surya's rays, at the\r\npreceptor's son and uttered a loud shout. Repeatedly shouting in joy,\r\n\"Thou art slain, Thou art slain!\" Pandya (with that lance) crushed to\r\npieces the diadem of Drona's son adorned with foremost of jewels and\r\ndiamonds of the first water and the very best kind of gold and excellent\r\ncloth and strings of pearls. That diadem possessed of the splendour of\r\nthe Sun, the Moon, the planets, or the fire, in consequence of the\r\nviolence of the stroke, fell down, split into fragments, like a mountain\r\nsummit riven by Indra's thunder, falling down on the Earth with great\r\nnoise. At this, Ashvatthama blazed up with exceeding rage like a prince\r\nof snakes struck with the foot, and took up four and ten shafts capable\r\nof inflicting great pain upon foes and each resembling the Destroyer's\r\nrod. With five of those shafts he cut off the four feet and the trunk of\r\nhis adversary's elephant, and with three the two arms and the head of the\r\nking, and with six he slew the six mighty car-warriors, endued with great\r\neffulgence, that followed king Pandya. Those long and well-rounded arms\r\nof the king, smeared with excellent sandal-paste, and adorned with gold\r\nand pearls and gems and diamonds falling upon the Earth, began to writhe\r\nlike a couple of snakes slain by Garuda. That head also, graced with a\r\nface bright as the full Moon, having a prominent nose and a pair of large\r\neyes, red as copper with rage, adorned with earrings, falling on the\r\nground, looked resplendent like the Moon himself between two bright\r\nconstellations. The elephant, thus cut off by that skilful warrior into\r\nsix pieces with those five shafts and the king into four pieces with\r\nthose three shafts lay divided in all into ten pieces that looked like\r\nthe sacrificial butter distributed into ten portions intended for the ten\r\ndeities. Having cut off numerous steeds and men and elephants into pieces\r\nand offered them as food into the Rakshasas, king Pandya was thus quieted\r\nby Drona's son with his shafts like a blazing fire in a crematorium,\r\nextinguished with water after it has received a libation in the shape of\r\na lifeless body. Then like the chief of the celestials joyfully\r\nworshipping Vishnu after the subjugation of the Asura Vali, thy son, the\r\nking, accompanied by his brothers approaching the preceptor's son\r\nworshipped with great respect that warrior who is a complete master of\r\nthe science of arms, after indeed, he had completed the task he had\r\nundertaken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When Pandya had been slain and when that foremost\r\nof heroes, viz., Karna was employed in routing and destroying the foe,\r\nwhat, O Sanjaya, did Arjuna do in battle? That son of Pandu is a hero,\r\nendued with great might, attentive to his duties, and a complete master\r\nof the science of arms. The high-souled Sankara himself hath made him\r\ninvincible among all creatures. My greatest fears proceed from that\r\nDhananjaya, that slayer of foes. Tell me, O Sanjaya, all that Partha\r\nachieved there on that occasion.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After Pandya's fall, Krishna quickly said unto Arjuna\r\nthese beneficial words, \"I do not behold the King. The other Pandavas\r\nalso have retreated. If the Parthas had returned, the vast force of the\r\nenemy would have been broken. In fulfilment of purposes entertained by\r\nAshvatthama, Karna is slaying the Srinjayas. A great carnage is being\r\nmade (by that warrior) of steeds and car-warriors and elephants.\" Thus\r\nthe heroic Vasudeva represented everything unto the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna). Hearing of and beholding that great danger of his brother\r\n(Yudhishthira), Partha quickly addressed Krishna, saying, \"Urge the\r\nsteeds, O Hrishikesha.\" Then Hrishikesha proceeded on that irresistible\r\ncar. The encounter then that once more took place became exceedingly\r\nfierce. The Kurus and the Pandavas once more fearlessly closed with each\r\nother, that is, the Parthas headed by Bhimasena and ourselves headed by\r\nthe Suta's son. Then, O best of kings, there once more commenced a battle\r\nbetween Karna and the Pandavas that swelled the population of Yama's\r\nkingdom. With bows and arrows and spiked clubs and swords and lances and\r\naxes and short clubs and Bhushundis and darts and rapiers and battle-axes\r\nand maces and spears and polished Kuntas, and short shafts and hooks, the\r\ncombatants quickly fell upon one another, desirous of taking one\r\nanother's life. Filling the welkin, the cardinal points of the compass,\r\nthe subsidiary ones, the firmament, and the Earth, with the whizz of\r\narrows, the twang of bow-strings, the sound of palms, and the clatter of\r\ncar-wheels, foes rushed upon foes. Gladdened by that loud noise, heroes,\r\nfought with heroes desirous of reaching the end of the hostilities. Loud\r\nbecame the noise caused by the sound of bow-strings and fences and bows,\r\nthe grunt of elephants, and the shouts of foot-soldiers and falling men.\r\nHearing the terrible whizz of arrows and the diverse shouts of brave\r\nwarriors, the troops took fright, became pale, and fell down. Large\r\nnumbers of those foes thus employed in shouting and shooting weapons, the\r\nheroic son of Adhiratha crushed with his arrows. With his shafts Karna\r\nthen despatched to Yama's abode twenty car-warriors among the brave\r\nPancala heroes, with their steeds, drivers, and standards. Then many\r\nforemost of warriors of the Pandava army, endued with great energy and\r\nquick in the use of weapons, speedily wheeling round, encompassed Karna\r\non all sides. Karna agitated that hostile force with showers of weapons\r\nlike the leader of an elephantine herd plunging into a lake adorned with\r\nlotuses and covered with swans. Penetrating into the midst of his foes,\r\nthe son of Radha, shaking his best of bows, began to strike off and fell\r\ntheir heads with his sharp shafts. The shield and coats of mail of the\r\nwarriors, cut off, fell down on the Earth. There was none amongst them\r\nthat needed the touch of a second arrow of Karna's. Like a driver\r\nstriking the steeds with the whip, Karna, with his shafts capable of\r\ncrushing coats of mail and bodies and the life that quickened them,\r\nstruck the fences (of his foes) perceivable only by their bow-strings.\r\nLike a lion grinding herds of deer, Karna speedily grinded all those\r\nPandus and Srinjayas and Pancalas that came within range of his arrows.\r\nThen the chief of the Pancalas, and the sons of Draupadi, O sire, and the\r\ntwins, and Yuyudhana, uniting together, proceeded against Karna. When\r\nthose Kurus, and Pancalas and Pandus were thus engaged in battle, the\r\nother warriors, reckless of their very lives, began to strike at one\r\nanother. Well-cased in armour and coats of mail and adorned with\r\nhead-gears, combatants endued with great strength rushed at their foes,\r\nwith maces and short clubs and spiked bludgeons looking like uplifted\r\nrods of the Destroyer, and jumping, O sire, and challenging one another,\r\nuttered loud shouts. They struck one another, and fell down, assailed by\r\none another with blood rising from their limbs and deprived of brains and\r\neyes and weapons. Covered with weapons, some, as they lay there with\r\nfaces beautiful as pomegranates, having teeth-adorned mouths filled with\r\nblood, seemed to be alive. Others, in that vast ocean of battle, filled\r\nwith rage mangled or cut or pierced or overthrew or lopped off or slew\r\none another with battle-axes and short arrows and hooks and spears and\r\nlances. Slain by one another they fell down, covered with blood and\r\ndeprived of life like sandal trees cut down with the axe falling down and\r\nshedding as they fall their cool blood-red juice. Cars destroyed by cars,\r\nelephants by elephants, men by men, and steeds by steeds, fell down in\r\nthousands. Standards, and heads, and umbrellas, and elephants, trunks,\r\nand human arms, cut off with razor-faced or broad-headed or\r\ncrescent-shaped arrows, fell down on the Earth. Large numbers also of\r\nmen, and elephants, and cars with steed yoked thereto, were crushed in\r\nthat battle. Many brave warriors, slain by horsemen, fell down, and many\r\ntuskers, with their trunks cut off, and banners and standards (on their\r\nbodies), fell down like fallen mountains. Assailed by foot-soldiers, many\r\nelephants and cars, destroyed or in course of destruction, fell down on\r\nall sides. Horsemen, encountering foot-soldiers with activity, were slain\r\nby the latter. Similarly crowds of foot-soldiers, slain by horsemen, laid\r\nthemselves down on the field. The faces and the limbs of those slain in\r\nthat dreadful battle looked like crushed lotuses and faded floral\r\nwreaths. The beautiful forms of elephants and steeds and human beings, O\r\nking, then resembled cloths foul with dirt, and became exceedingly\r\nrepulsive to look at.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Many elephant-warriors riding on their beasts, urged by\r\nthy son, proceeded against Dhrishtadyumna, filled with rage and desirous\r\nof compassing his destruction. Many foremost of combatants skilled in\r\nelephant-fight, belonging to the Easterners, the Southerners, the Angas,\r\nthe Vangas, the Pundras, the Magadhas, the Tamraliptakas, the Mekalas,\r\nthe Koshalas, the Madras, the Dasharnas, the Nishadas uniting with the\r\nKalingas, O Bharata, and showering shafts and lances and arrows like\r\npouring clouds, drenched the Pancala force therewith in that battle.\r\nPrishata's son covered with his arrows and shafts those (foe-crushing)\r\nelephants urged forward by their riders with heels and toes and hooks.\r\nEach of those beasts that were huge as hills, the Pancala hero pierced\r\nwith ten, eight, or six whetted shafts, O Bharata. Beholding the prince\r\nof the Pancalas shrouded by those elephants like the Sun by the clouds,\r\nthe Pandus and the Pancalas proceeded towards him (for his rescue)\r\nuttering loud roars and armed with sharp weapons. Pouring their weapons\r\nupon those elephants, those warriors began to dance the dance of heroes,\r\naided by the music of their bow-strings and the sound of their palms, and\r\nurged by heroes beating the time. Then Nakula and Sahadeva, and the sons\r\nof Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakas, and Satyaki, and Shikhandi, and\r\nChekitana endued with great energy,--all those heroes--drenched those\r\nelephants from every side with their weapons, like the clouds drenching\r\nthe hills with their showers. Those furious elephants, urged on by\r\nmleccha warriors dragging down with their trunks men and steeds and cars,\r\ncrushed them with their feet. And some they pierced with the points of\r\ntheir tusks, and some they raised aloft and dashed down on the ground;\r\nothers taken aloft on the tusks of those huge beasts, fell down inspiring\r\nspectators with fear. Then Satyaki, piercing the vitals of the elephant\r\nbelonging to the king of the Vangas staying before him, with a long shaft\r\nendued with great impetuosity, caused it to fall down on the field of\r\nbattle. Then Satyaki pierced with another long shaft the chest of the\r\nrider whom he could not hitherto touch, just as the latter was about to\r\njump from the back of his beast. Thus struck by Satwata, he fell down on\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\n\"'Meanwhile Sahadeva, with three shafts shot with great care, struck the\r\nelephant of Pundra, as it advanced against him like a moving mountain,\r\ndepriving it of its standard and driver and armour and life. Having thus\r\ncut off that elephant, Sahadeva proceeded against the chief of the Angas.\r\n\r\n\"'Nakula, however, causing Sahadeva to desist, himself afflicted the\r\nruler of the Angas with three long shafts, each resembling the rod of\r\nYama, and his foe's elephant with a hundred arrows. Then the ruler of the\r\nAngas hurled at Nakula eight hundred lances bright as the rays of the\r\nSun. Each of these Nakula cut off into three fragments. The son of Pandu\r\nthen cut off the head of his antagonist with a crescent-shaped arrow. At\r\nthis that mleccha king, deprived of life, fell down with the animal he\r\nrode. Upon the fall of the prince of the Angas who was well-skilled in\r\nelephant-lore, the elephant-men of the Angas, filled with rage, proceeded\r\nwith speed against Nakula, on their elephants decked with banners that\r\nwaved in the air, possessing excellent mouths, adorned with housings of\r\ngold, and looking like blazing mountains, from desire of crushing him to\r\npieces. And many Mekalas and Utkalas, and Kalingas, and Nishadas, and\r\nTamraliptakas, also advanced against Nakula, showering their shafts and\r\nlances, desirous of slaying him. Then the Pandus, the Pancalas, and the\r\nSomakas, filled with rage, rushed with speed for the rescue of Nakula\r\nshrouded by those warriors like the Sun by the clouds. Then occurred a\r\nfierce battle between those car-warriors and elephant-men, the former\r\nshowering their arrows and shafts the latter their lances by thousands.\r\nThe frontal globes and other limbs and the tusks and adornments of the\r\nelephants, exceedingly pierced with shafts, were split and mangled. Then\r\nSahadeva, with four and sixty impetuous arrows, quickly slew eight of\r\nthose huge elephants which fell down with their riders. And Nakula also,\r\nthat delighter of his race, bending his excellent bow with great vigour,\r\nwith many straight shafts, slew many elephants. Then the Pancala prince,\r\nand the grandson of Sini (Satyaki) and the sons of Draupadi and the\r\nPrabhadrakas, and Shikhandi, drenched those huge elephants with showers\r\nof shafts. Then in consequence of those rain-charged clouds constituted\r\nby the Pandava warriors, those hills constituted by the elephants of the\r\nfoe, fell, struck down by torrents of rain formed by their numerous\r\nshafts, like real mountains struck down with a thunder-storm. Those\r\nleaders of the Pandava car-warriors then, thus slaying those elephants of\r\nthine cast their eyes on the hostile army, which, as it fled away at that\r\ntime resembled a river whose continents had been washed away. Those\r\nwarriors of Pandu's son, having thus agitated that army of thine,\r\nagitated it once more, and then rushed against Karna.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'While Sahadeva, filled with rage, was thus blasting thy\r\nhost, Duhshasana, O great king, proceeded against him, the brother\r\nagainst the brother. Beholding those two engaged in dreadful combat, all\r\nthe great car-warriors uttered leonine shouts and waved their garments.\r\nThen, O Bharata, the mighty son of Pandu was struck in the chest with\r\nthree arrows by thy angry son armed with bow. Then Sahadeva, O king,\r\nhaving first pierced thy son with an arrow, pierced him again with\r\nseventy arrows, and then his driver with three. Then Duhshasana, O\r\nmonarch, having cut off Sahadeva's bow in that great battle, pierced\r\nSahadeva himself with three and seventy arrows in the arms and the chest.\r\nThen Sahadeva filled with rage, took up a sword, in that dreadful\r\nconflict, and whirling, hurled it quickly towards the car of thy son.\r\nCutting off Duhshasana's bow with string and arrow fixed on it, that\r\nlarge sword fell down on the Earth like a snake from the firmament. Then\r\nthe valiant Sahadeva taking up another bow, shot a deadly shaft at\r\nDuhshasana. The Kuru warrior, however, with his keen-edged sword, cut off\r\ninto two fragments that shaft, bright as the rod of Death, as it coursed\r\ntowards him. Then whirling that sharp sword, Duhshasana quickly hurled it\r\nin that battle as his foe. Meanwhile that valiant warrior took up another\r\nbow with a shaft. Sahadeva, however, with the greatest ease, cut off,\r\nwith his keen shafts, that sword as it coursed towards him, and caused it\r\nto fall down in that battle. Then, O Bharata, thy son, in that dreadful\r\nbattle, quickly sped four and sixty shafts at the car of Sahadeva.\r\nSahadeva, however, O king, cut off every one of those numerous arrows as\r\nthey coursed with great impetuosity towards him, with five shafts of his.\r\nChecking then those mighty shafts sped by thy son, Sahadeva, in that\r\nbattle, sped a large number of arrows at his foe. Cutting off each of\r\nthose shafts with three shafts of his, thy son uttered a loud shout,\r\nmaking the whole Earth resound with it. Then Duhshasana, O king, having\r\npierced Sahadeva in that battle, struck the latter's driver with nine\r\narrows. The valiant Sahadeva then, O monarch, filled with rage, fixed on\r\nhis bow-string a terrible shaft resembling the Destroyer himself and\r\nforcibly drawing the bow, he sped that shaft at thy son. Piercing with\r\ngreat speed through his strong armour and body, that shaft entered the\r\nEarth, O king, like a snake penetrating into an ant-hill. Then thy son,\r\nthat great car-warrior, swooned away, O king. Beholding him deprived of\r\nhis senses, his driver quickly took away the car, himself forcibly struck\r\nall the while with keen arrows. Having vanquished the Kuru warrior thus,\r\nthe son of Pandu, beholding Duryodhana's division, began to crush it on\r\nall sides. Indeed, O king, as a man excited with wrath crushes swarm of\r\nants, even so, O Bharata did that son of Pandu begin to crush the Kaurava\r\nhost.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'While Nakula was employed in destroying and routing the\r\nKaurava divisions in battle with great force, Vikartana's son Karna,\r\nfilled with rage, checked him, O king. Then Nakula smiling the while,\r\naddressed Karna, and said, \"After a long time, through the favour of the\r\ngods, I am seen by thee, and thou also, O wretch, dost become the object\r\nof my sight. Thou art the root of all these evils, this hostility, this\r\nquarrel. It is through thy faults that the Kauravas are being thinned,\r\nencountering one another. Slaying thee in battle today, I will regard\r\nmyself as one that has achieved his object, and the fever of my heart\r\nwill be dispelled.\" Thus addressed by Nakula, the Suta's son said unto\r\nhim the following words befitting a prince and a bowman in particular,\r\n\"Strike me, O hero. We desire to witness thy manliness. Having achieved\r\nsome feats in battle, O brave warrior, thou shouldst then boast. O sire,\r\nthey that are heroes fight in battle to the best of their powers, without\r\nindulging in brag. Fight now with me to the best of thy might. I will\r\nquell thy pride.\" Having said these words the Suta's son quickly struck\r\nthe son of Pandu and pierced him, in that encounter, with three and\r\nseventy shafts. Then Nakula, O Bharata, thus pierced by the Suta's son,\r\npierced the latter in return with eighty shafts resembling snakes of\r\nvirulent poison. Then Karna, that great bowman, cutting off his\r\nantagonist's bow with a number of arrows winged with gold and whetted on\r\nstone, afflicted him with thirty arrows. Those arrows, piercing through\r\nhis armour drank his blood in that battle, like the Nagas of virulent\r\npoison drinking water after having pierced through the Earth. Then\r\nNakula, taking up another formidable bow whose back was decked with gold,\r\npierced Karna with twenty arrows and his driver with three. Then, O\r\nmonarch, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., Nakula, filled with rage,\r\ncut off Karna's bow with a razor-headed shaft of great keenness. Smiling\r\nthe while, the heroic son of Pandu then struck the bowless Karna, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, with three hundred arrows. Beholding Karna thus\r\nafflicted, O sire, by the son of Pandu, all the carwarriors there, with\r\nthe gods (in the welkin), were filled with great wonder. Then Vikartana's\r\nson Karna taking up another bow, struck Nakula with five arrows in the\r\nshoulder-joint. With those arrows sticking to him here, the son of Madri\r\nlooked resplendent like the Sun with his own rays while shedding his\r\nlight on the Earth. Then Nakula piercing Karna with seven shafts, once\r\nmore, O sire, cut off one of the horns of Karna's bow. Then Karna, taking\r\nup in that battle a tougher bow, filled the welkin on every side of\r\nNakula with his arrows. The mighty car-warrior, Nakula, however, thus\r\nsuddenly shrouded with the arrows shot from Karna's bow quickly cut off\r\nall those shafts with shafts of his own. Then was seen overspread in the\r\nwelkin a vast number of arrows like to the spectacle presented by the sky\r\nwhen it is filled with myriads of roving fireflies. Indeed, the sky\r\nshrouded with those hundreds of arrows shot (by both the warriors)\r\nlooked, O monarch, as if it was covered with flights of locusts. Those\r\narrows, decked with gold, issuing repeatedly in continuous lines, looked\r\nbeautiful like rows of cranes while flying through the welkin. When the\r\nsky was thus covered with showers of arrows and the sun himself hid from\r\nthe view, no creature ranging the air could descend on the Earth. When\r\nall sides were thus covered with showers of arrows, those two high-souled\r\nwarriors looked resplendent like two Suns risen at the end of the Yuga.\r\nSlaughtered with the shafts issuing from Karna's bow the Somakas, O\r\nmonarch, greatly afflicted and feeling much pain, began to breathe their\r\nlast. Similarly, thy warriors, struck with the shafts of Nakula,\r\ndispersed on all sides, O king, like clouds tossed by the wind. The two\r\narmies thus slaughtered by those two warriors with their mighty celestial\r\nshafts, retreated from the range of those arrows and stood as spectators\r\nof the encounter. When both the armies were driven off by means of the\r\nshafts of Karna and Nakula, those two high-souled warriors began to\r\npierce each other with showers of shafts. Displaying their celestial\r\nweapons on the field of battle, they quickly shrouded each other, each\r\ndesirous of compassing the destruction of the other. The shafts shot by\r\nNakula, dressed with Kanka and peacock feathers, shrouding the Suta's\r\nson, seemed to stay in the welkin. Similarly, the shafts sped by the\r\nSuta's son in that dreadful battle, shrouding the son of Pandu, seemed to\r\nstay in the welkin. Shrouded within arrowy chambers, both the warriors\r\nbecame invisible, like the Sun and the Moon, O king, hidden by the\r\nclouds. Then Karna, filled with rage and assuming a terrible aspect in\r\nthe battle, covered the son of Pandu with showers of arrows from every\r\nside. Completely covered, O monarch, by the Suta's son, the son of Pandu\r\nfelt no pain like the Maker of day when covered by the clouds. The son of\r\nAdhiratha then, smiling the while, sped arrowy lines, O sire, in hundreds\r\nand thousands, in that battle. With those shafts of the high-souled\r\nKarna, an extensive shade seemed to rest on the field of battle. Indeed,\r\nwith those excellent shafts constantly issuing out (of his bow), a shade\r\nwas caused there like that formed by the clouds. Then Karna, O monarch,\r\ncutting off the bow of the high-souled Nakula, felled the latter's driver\r\nfrom the car-niche with the greatest ease. With four keen shafts, next,\r\nhe quickly despatched the four steeds of Nakula, O Bharata, to the abode\r\nof Yama. With his shafts, he also cut off into minute fragments that\r\nexcellent car of his antagonist as also his standard and the protectors\r\nof his car-wheels, and mace, and sword, and shield decked with a hundred\r\nmoons, and other utensils and equipments of battle. Then Nakula,\r\nsteedless and carless and armourless, O monarch, quickly alighting from\r\nhis car, stood, armed with a spiked bludgeon. Even that terrible\r\nbludgeon, so uplifted by the son of Pandu, the Suta's son, O king, cut\r\noff with many keen arrows capable of bearing a great strain. Beholding\r\nhis adversary weaponless. Karna began to strike him with many straight\r\nshafts, but took care not to afflict him greatly. Thus struck in that\r\nbattle by that mighty warrior accomplished in weapons, Nakula, O king,\r\nfled away precipitately in great affliction. Laughing repeatedly, the son\r\nof Radha pursued him and placed his stringed bow, O Bharata, around the\r\nneck of the retreating Nakula. With the large bow around his neck, O\r\nking, the son of Pandu looked resplendent like Moon in the firmament when\r\nwithin a circular halo of light, or a white cloud girdled round by\r\nIndra's bow. Then Karna, addressing him, said, \"The words thou hadst\r\nuttered were futile. Canst thou utter them now once more in joy,\r\nrepeatedly struck as thou art by me? Do not, O son of Pandu, fight again\r\nwith those amongst the Kurus that are possessed of greater might. O\r\nchild, fight with them that are thy equals. Do not, O son of Pandu, feel\r\nany shame for it. Return home, O son of Madri, or go thither where\r\nKrishna and Phalguna are.\" Having addressed him thus he abandoned him\r\nthen. Acquainted with morality as the brave Karna was, he did not then\r\nslay Nakula who was already within the jaws of death. Recollecting the\r\nwords of Kunti, O king, Karna let Nakula go. The son of Pandu, thus let\r\noff, O king, by that bowman, Suta's son, proceeded towards Yudhishthira's\r\ncar in great shame. Scorched by the Suta's son, he then ascended his\r\nbrother's car, and burning with grief he continued to sigh like a snake\r\nkept within a jar. Meanwhile Karna, having vanquished Nakula, quickly\r\nproceeded against the Pancalas, riding on that car of his which bore many\r\ngorgeous pennons and whose steeds were as white as the Moon. There, O\r\nmonarch, a great uproar arose among the Pandavas when they saw the leader\r\nof the Kaurava army proceeding towards the Pancala car-throngs. The\r\nSuta's son, O monarch, made a great massacre there at that hour when the\r\nSun had reached the meridian, that puissant warrior careering all the\r\nwhile with the activity of a wheel. We beheld many Pancala car-warriors\r\nborne away from the battle on their steedless and driverless cars with\r\nbroken wheels and broken axles and with standards and pennons also that\r\nwere broken and torn, O sire. And many elephants were seen to wander\r\nthere in all directions (with limbs scorched by arrows) like individuals\r\nof their species in the wide forest with limbs scorched and burned in a\r\nforest conflagration. Others with their frontal globes split open, or\r\nbathed in blood, or with trunks lopped off, or with their armour cut\r\ndown, or their tails lopped off, fell down, struck by the high-souled\r\nKarna, like straggling clouds. Other elephants, frightened by the shafts\r\nand lances of Radha's son proceeded against Radha's son himself like\r\ninsects towards a blazing fire. Other huge elephants were seen striking\r\nagainst one another and shedding blood from various limbs like mountains\r\nwith rillets running down their breasts. Steeds of the foremost breed,\r\ndivested of breast-plates and their ornaments of silver and brass and\r\ngold, destitute of trappings and bridle-bits and yak-tails and\r\nsaddle-cloths, with quivers fallen off from their backs, and with their\r\nheroic riders,--ornaments of battle,--slain, were seen wandering here and\r\nthere on the field. Pierced and cut with lances and scimitars and swords,\r\nO Bharata, we beheld many a horseman adorned with armour and head-gear,\r\nslain or in course of being slain or trembling with fear, and deprived, O\r\nBharata, of diverse limbs. Cars also, decked with gold, and unto which\r\nwere yoked steeds of great fleetness, were seen by us dragged with\r\nexceeding speed hither and thither, their riders having been slain. Some\r\nof these had their axles and poles broken, and some, O Bharata, had their\r\nwheels broken; and some were without banners and standards, and some were\r\ndivested of their shafts. Many car-warriors also were seen there, by us,\r\nO monarch, wandering all around, deprived of their cars and scorched with\r\nthe shafts of the Suta's son. And some destitute of weapons and some with\r\nweapons still in their arms were seen lying lifeless on the field in\r\nlarge numbers. And many elephants also were seen by us, wandering in all\r\ndirections, studded with clusters of stars, adorned with rows of\r\nbeautiful bells, and decked with variegated banners of diverse hues.\r\nHeads and arms and chests and other limbs, cut off with shafts sped from\r\nKarna's bow, were beheld by us lying around. A great and fierce calamity\r\novertook the warriors (of the Pandava army) as they fought with whetted\r\narrows, and mangled as they were with the shafts of Karna. The Srinjayas,\r\nslaughtered in that battle by the Suta's son, blindly proceeded against\r\nthe latter's self like insects rushing upon a blazing fire. Indeed, as\r\nthat mighty car-warrior was engaged in scorching the Pandava divisions,\r\nthe kshatriyas avoided him, regarding him to be the blazing Yuga fire.\r\nThose heroic and mighty car-warriors of the Pancala that survived the\r\nslaughter fled away. The brave Karna, however, pursued those broken and\r\nretreating warriors from behind, shooting his shafts at them. Endued with\r\ngreat energy, he pursued those combatants divested of armour and\r\ndestitute of standards. Indeed, the Suta's son, possessed of great might,\r\ncontinued to scorch them with his shafts, like the dispeller of darkness\r\nscorching all creatures when he attains to the meridian.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Against Yuyutsu who was employed in routing the vast army\r\nof thy son, Uluka proceeded with speed saying \"Wait, Wait.\" Then Yuyutsu,\r\nO king, with a winged arrow of keen edge struck Uluka with great force,\r\nlike (Indra himself striking ) a mountain with the thunderbolt. Filled\r\nwith rage at this, Uluka, in that battle, cut off thy son's bow with a\r\nrazor-headed arrow and struck thy son himself with a barbed shaft.\r\nCasting off that broken bow, Yuyutsu, with eyes red in wrath, took up\r\nanother formidable bow endued with greater impetus. The prince then, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, pierced Uluka with sixty arrows. Piercing next\r\nthe driver of Uluka, Yuyutsu struck Uluka once more. Then Uluka, filled\r\nwith rage pierced Yuyutsu with twenty shafts adorned with gold, and then\r\ncut off his standard made of gold. That lofty and gorgeous standard made\r\nof gold, O king, thus cut off (by Uluka), fell down in front of Yuyutsu's\r\ncar. Beholding his standard cut off, Yuyutsu, deprived of his senses by\r\nwrath, struck Uluka with five shafts in the centre of the chest. Then\r\nUluka, O sire, in that battle, cut off, with a broad-headed arrow steeped\r\nin oil, the head of his antagonist's driver, O best of the Bharatas.\r\nSlaying next his four steeds he struck Yuyutsu himself with five arrows.\r\nDeeply struck by the strong Uluka, Yuyutsu proceeded to another car.\r\nHaving vanquished him in battle, O king, Uluka proceeded quickly towards\r\nthe Pancalas and the Srinjayas and began to slaughter them with sharp\r\nshafts. Thy son Srutakarman, O monarch, within half the time taken up by\r\na wink of the eye, fearlessly made Satanika steedless and driverless and\r\ncarless. The mighty car-warrior Satanika, however, staying on his\r\nsteedless car, O sire, hurled a mace, filled with rage, at thy son. That\r\nmace, reducing thy son's car with its steeds and driver into fragments,\r\nfell down upon the Earth with great speed, and pierced it through. Then\r\nthose two heroes, both enhancers of the glory of the Kurus, deprived of\r\ntheir cars, retreated from the encounter, glaring at each other. Then thy\r\nson, overcome with fear, mounted upon the car of Vivingsu, while Satanika\r\nquickly got upon the car of Prativindhya. Shakuni, filled with rage,\r\npierced Sutasoma with many keen shafts, but failed to make the latter\r\ntremble like a torrent of water failing to produce any impression upon a\r\nmountain. Beholding that great enemy of his father, Sutasoma covered\r\nShakuni, O Bharata, with many thousands of arrows. Shakuni, however, that\r\nwarrior of sure aim and conversant with all methods of warfare, actuated\r\nby desire of battle, quickly cut off all those shafts with his own winged\r\narrows. Having checked those shafts with his own keen arrows in battle,\r\nShakuni, filled with rage, struck Sutasoma with three arrows. Thy\r\nbrother-in-law then, O monarch, with his arrows cut off into minute\r\nfragments the steeds, the standard, and the driver of his adversary, at\r\nwhich all the spectators uttered a loud shout. Deprived of his steed and\r\ncar, and having his standard cut off, O sire, the great bowman\r\n(Sutasoma), jumping down from his car, stood on the Earth, having taken\r\nup a good bow. And he shot a large number of arrows equipped with golden\r\nwings and whetted on stone, and shrouded therewith the car of thy\r\nbrother-in law in that battle. The son of Subala, however, beholding\r\nthose showers of arrows that resembled a flight of locusts, coming\r\ntowards his car, did not tremble. On the other hand, that illustrious\r\nwarrior crushed all those arrows with arrows of his own. The warriors\r\nthat were present there, as also the Siddhas in the firmament, were\r\nhighly pleased at sight of that wonderful and incredible feat of\r\nSutasoma, inasmuch as he contended on foot with Shakuni staying in his\r\ncar. Then Shakuni, with a number of broad-headed shafts of great\r\nimpetuosity, keen and perfectly straight, cut off, O king, the bow of\r\nSutasoma as also all his quivers. Bowless, and carless, Sutasoma then,\r\nuplifting a scimitar of the hue of the blue lotus and equipped with an\r\nivory handle, uttered a loud shout. That scimitar of the intelligent\r\nSutasoma of the hue of the clear sky, as it was whirled by that hero, was\r\nregarded by Shakuni to be as fatal as the rod of Death. Armed with that\r\nscimitar he suddenly began to career in circles over the arena,\r\ndisplaying, O monarch, the fourteen different kinds of manoeuvres, endued\r\nas he was with skill and might. Indeed, he displayed in that battle all\r\nthose motions such as wheeling about and whirling on high, and making\r\nside-thrusts and jumping forward and leaping on high and running above\r\nand rushing forward and rushing upwards. The valiant son of Subala then\r\nsped a number of arrows at his foe, but the latter quickly cut them off\r\nwith that excellent scimitar of his as they coursed towards him. Filled\r\nwith rage (at this), the son of Subala, O king, once more sped at\r\nSutasoma a number of shafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison.\r\nAided by his skill and might, Sutasoma cut off even these with his\r\nscimitar, displaying his great activity, and possessed as he was of\r\nprowess equal to that of Garuda himself. With a razor-headed arrow of\r\ngreat sharpness, Shakuni then, O king, cut off that bright scimitar of\r\nhis adversary as the latter careered in circles before him. Thus cut off,\r\n(half of) that large scimitar suddenly fell down on the Earth, while half\r\nof it, O Bharata, continued in the grasp of Sutasoma. Seeing his sword\r\ncut off, the mighty car-warrior Sutasoma retreated six steps and then\r\nhurled that half (of the scimitar) which he had in his grasp at his foe.\r\nThe fragment decked with gold and gems, cutting off the bow, with string,\r\nof the illustrious Shakuni, quickly fell down on the Earth. Then Sutasoma\r\nwent to the great car of Srutakirti. Subala's son also, taking up another\r\nformidable and invincible bow, proceeded towards the Pandava army,\r\nslaying large numbers of foes (on the way). Beholding the son of Subala\r\ncareering fearlessly in battle, a loud uproar, O king, arose among the\r\nPandavas in that part of the army. People witnessed those large and proud\r\ndivisions bristling with arms, routed by the illustrious son of Subala.\r\nEven as the chief of the celestials crushed the Daitya army, the son of\r\nSubala destroyed that army of the Pandavas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Kripa, O king, resisted Dhrishtadyumna in battle, like a\r\nSarabha in the forest resisting a proud lion. Checked by the mighty son\r\nof Gautama, Prishata's son, O Bharata, could not advance even one step.\r\nBeholding Gautama's car in front of Dhrishtadyumna's, all creatures were\r\ninspired with fright and regarded the latter's destruction to be at hand.\r\nCar-warriors and horsemen, becoming very cheerless, said, \"Without doubt,\r\nthis foremost of men, Sharadvata's son of mighty energy and great\r\nintelligence and versed in celestial weapon, is filled with rage at the\r\ndeath of Drona. Will Dhrishtadyumna today escape from the hands of\r\nGautama? Will this vast army escape today this great danger? Will not\r\nthis brahmana slay all of us together? The form that he has assumed\r\ntoday, even like that of the Destroyer himself, shows that he will today\r\nact after the manner of Drona himself. The preceptor Gautama, endued with\r\ngreat lightness of hands, is ever victorious in battle. Possessing a\r\nknowledge of weapons, he is endued with great energy and filled with\r\nrage.\" Diverse speeches like these, uttered by the warriors of both the\r\narmies were, O monarch, heard there as those two heroes encountered each\r\nother. Drawing deep breath in rage, Sharadvata's son Kripa, O king, began\r\nto afflict the son of Prishata in all his vital limbs while the latter\r\nstood inactive. Struck in that battle by the illustrious Gautama,\r\nDhrishtadyumna, greatly stupefied, knew not what to do. His driver then,\r\naddressing him said, \"It is not all right with thee, O son of Prishata.\r\nNever before have I seen such a calamity overtake thee in battle. It is a\r\nlucky chance, it seems, that these shafts, capable of penetrating the\r\nvery vitals, sped by that foremost of brahmanas aiming at thy vital\r\nlimbs, are not striking thee. I will presently cause the car to turn\r\nback, like the current of a river dashed back by the sea. I think that\r\nbrahmana, by whom thy prowess hath been annihilated, is incapable of\r\nbeing slain by thee.\" Thus addressed, Dhrishtadyumna, O king, slowly\r\nsaid, \"My mind becometh stupefied, O sire, and perspiration covereth my\r\nlimbs. My body trembles and my hair stands on end. Avoiding that brahmana\r\nin battle, proceed slowly to where Arjuna is, O charioteer; arrived at\r\nthe presence of either Arjuna or Bhimasena, prosperity may be mine. Even\r\nthis is my certain conviction.\" Then, O monarch, the charioteer, urging\r\nthe steeds, proceeded to the spot where the mighty bowman Bhimasena was\r\nbattling with thy troops. Beholding the car, O sire, of Dhrishtadyumna\r\nspeedily moving away from that spot, Gautama followed it, shooting\r\nhundreds of shafts. And that chastiser of foes also repeatedly blew his\r\nconch. Indeed, he routed the son of Prishata like Indra routing the\r\nDanava Namuci.\r\n\r\n\"'The invincible Shikhandi, the cause of Bhishma's death, was in that\r\nbattle, resisted by Hridika's son who smiled repeatedly as he fought with\r\nthe former. Shikhandi, however, encountering the mighty car-warrior of\r\nthe Hridikas, struck him with five keen and broad-headed shafts at the\r\nshoulder-joint. Then the mighty car-warrior Kritavarma filled with rage,\r\npierced his foe with sixty winged arrows. With a single arrow then, he\r\ncut off his bow, laughing the while. The mighty son of Drupada, filled\r\nwith wrath, took up another bow, and addressing the son of Hridika, said,\r\n\"Wait, Wait.\" Then, O monarch, Shikhandi sped at his foe ninety shafts of\r\ngreat impetuosity, all equipped with golden wings. Those shafts, however,\r\nall recoiled from Kritavarma's armour. Seeing those shafts recoil and\r\nscattered on the surface of the Earth, Shikhandi cut off Kritavarma's bow\r\nwith a keen razor-headed arrow. Filled with wrath he struck the bowless\r\nson of Hridika, who then resembled a hornless bull, in the arms and the\r\nchest, with eighty arrows. Filled with rage but torn and mangled with\r\nshafts, Kritavarma vomited blood through his limbs like a jar disgorging\r\nthe water with which it is filled. Bathed in blood, the Bhoja king looked\r\nbeautiful like a mountain, O king, streaked with streams of liquefied red\r\nchalk after a shower. The puissant Kritavarma then, taking up another bow\r\nwith a string and an arrow fixed thereon, struck Shikhandi in his\r\nshoulder-joint. With those shafts sticking to his shoulder-joint,\r\nShikhandi looked resplendent like a lordly tree with its spreading\r\nbranches and twigs. Having pierced each other, the two combatants were\r\nbathed in blood, and resembled a couple of bulls that have gored each\r\nother with their horns Carefully exerting themselves to slay each other,\r\nthose two mighty car-warriors moved in a 1,000 circles with their\r\nrespective cars on that arena. Then Kritavarma, O king, in that\r\nencounter, pierced the son of Prishata with seventy shafts all of which\r\nwere equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone. The ruler of the\r\nBhojas then, that foremost of smiters, sped with great activity a\r\nterrible and fatal shaft at his foe. Struck therewith, Shikhandi quickly\r\nswooned away. Overcome with stupefaction, he supported himself by seizing\r\nhis flag-staff. The driver then of that foremost of car-warriors speedily\r\nbore him away from the fight. Scorched with the shaft of Hridika's son he\r\ndrew breath upon breath repeatedly. After the defeat of the heroic son of\r\nDrupada, O lord, the Pandava army, slaughtered on all sides, fled away\r\nfrom the field.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The white steeded (Arjuna) also, O monarch, routed thy\r\nforce even as the winds, approaching a heap of cotton, scatters it on all\r\nsides. Against him rushed the Trigartas, the Sivis, the Kauravas, the\r\nSalwas, the samsaptakas, and that force which consisted of the Narayanas.\r\nAnd Satyasena and Candradeva, and Mitradeva and Satrunjaya, and Susruta's\r\nson, and Citrasena, and Mitravarman, O Bharata, and the king of the\r\nTrigartas surrounded by his brothers and by his sons that were all mighty\r\nbowmen accomplished in diverse weapons, suddenly advanced, shooting and\r\nscattering showers of shafts in that battle, against Arjuna, like a\r\nfierce current of water towards the ocean. Those warriors in hundreds of\r\nthousands, approaching Arjuna, seemed to melt away like snakes at sight\r\nof Garuda. Though slaughtered in battle, they did not still leave the son\r\nof Pandu like insects, O monarch, never receding from a blazing fire.\r\nSatyasena, in that encounter, pierced that son of Pandu with three\r\narrows, and Mitradeva pierced him with three and sixty, and Candradeva\r\nwith seven. And Mitravarman pierced him with three and seventy arrows,\r\nand Susruta's son with seven. And Satrunjaya pierced him with twenty, and\r\nSusharma with nine. Thus pierced in that encounter by many, Arjuna\r\npierced all those kings in return. Indeed, piercing the son of Susruta\r\nwith seven arrows, he pierced Satyasena with three, Satrunjaya with\r\ntwenty and Candradeva with eight, Mitradeva with a hundred, Srutasena\r\nwith three, Mitravarman with nine, and Susharma with eight. Then slaying\r\nking Satrunjaya with a number of arrows whetted on stone, he smote off\r\nfrom his trunk, the head, decked with headgear, of Susruta's son. Without\r\nany delay he then, with a number of other shafts, despatched Candradeva\r\nto the abode of Yama. As regards the other mighty car-warriors vigorously\r\ncontending with him, he checked each of them with five arrows. Then\r\nSatyasena filled with rage, hurled a formidable lance in that battle\r\naiming at Krishna and uttered a leonine roar. That ironmouthed lance\r\nhaving a golden shaft, piercing through the left arm of the high-souled\r\nMadhava, penetrated into the Earth. Madhava being thus pierced with that\r\nlance in great battle the goad and the reins, O king, fell down from his\r\nhands. Beholding Vasudeva's limb pierced through, Pritha's son Dhananjaya\r\nmustered all his wrath and addressing Vasudeva said, \"O mighty-armed one,\r\nbear the car to Satyasena, O puissant one, so that I may, with keen\r\nshafts, despatch him to Yama's abode.\" The illustrious Keshava then,\r\nquickly taking up the goad and the reins, caused the steeds to bear the\r\ncar to the front of Satyasena's vehicle. Beholding the Ruler of the\r\nUniverse pierced, Pritha's son Dhananjaya, that mighty car-warrior,\r\nchecking Satyasena with some keen arrows, cut off with a number of\r\nbroad-headed shafts of great sharpness, the large head of that king\r\ndecked with earrings, from off his trunk at the head of the army. Having\r\nthus cut off Satyasena's head, he then despatched Citravarman with a\r\nnumber of keen shafts, and then the latter's driver, O sire, with a keen\r\ncalf-toothed arrow. Filled with rage, the mighty Partha then, with\r\nhundreds of shafts, felled the samsaptakas in hundreds and thousands.\r\nThen, O king, with a razor-headed arrow equipped with wings of silver,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior cut off the head of the illustrious Mitrasena.\r\nFilled with rage he then struck Susharma in the shoulder-joint. Then all\r\nthe samsaptakas, filled with wrath, encompassed Dhananjaya on all sides\r\nand began to afflict him with showers of weapons and make all the points\r\nof the compass resound with their shouts. Afflicted by them thus, the\r\nmighty car-warrior Jishnu, of immeasurable soul, endued with prowess\r\nresembling that of Sakra himself, invoked the Aindra weapon. From that\r\nweapon, thousands of shafts, O king, began to issue continually. Then O\r\nking, a loud din was heard of falling cars with standards and quivers and\r\nyokes, and axles and wheels and traces with chords, of bottoms of cars\r\nand wooden fences around them, of arrows and steeds and spears and\r\nswords, and maces and spiked clubs and darts and lances and axes, and\r\nSataghnis equipped with wheels and arrows. Thighs and necklaces and\r\nAngadas and Keyuras, O sire, and garlands and cuirasses and coats of\r\nmail, O Bharata, and umbrellas and fans and heads decked with diadems lay\r\non the battle-field. Heads adorned with earrings and beautiful eyes, and\r\neach resembling the full moon, looked, as they lay on the field, like\r\nstars in the firmament. Adorned with sandal-paste, beautiful garlands of\r\nflowers and excellent robes, many were the bodies of slain warriors that\r\nwere seen to lie on the ground. The field of battle, terrible as it was,\r\nlooked like the welkin teeming with vapoury forms. With the slain princes\r\nand kshatriyas of great might and fallen elephants and steeds, the Earth\r\nbecame impassable in that battle as if she were strewn with hills. There\r\nwas no path on the field for the wheels of the illustrious Pandava's car,\r\nengaged as he was in continually slaying his foes and striking down\r\nelephants and steeds with his broad-headed shafts. It seemed, O sire,\r\nthat the wheels of his car stopped in fright at the sight of his own self\r\ncareering in that battle through that bloody mire. His steeds, however,\r\nendued with the speed of the mind or the wind, dragged with great efforts\r\nand labour those wheels that had refused to move. Thus slaughtered by\r\nPandu's son armed with the bow, that host fled away almost entirely,\r\nwithout leaving even a remnant, O Bharata, contending with the foe.\r\nHaving vanquished large numbers of the samsaptakas in battle, Pritha's\r\nson Jishnu looked resplendent, like a blazing fire without smoke.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'King Duryodhana, O monarch, himself fearlessly received\r\nYudhishthira, as the latter was engaged in shooting large numbers of\r\nshafts. The royal Yudhishthira the just, speedily piercing thy son, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, as the latter was rushing towards him with\r\nimpetuosity, addressed him, saying, \"Wait, Wait.\" Duryodhana, however,\r\npierced Yudhishthira, in return, with nine keen arrows, and filled with\r\ngreat wrath, struck Yudhishthira's driver also with a broad-headed shaft.\r\nThen king Yudhishthira sped at Duryodhana three and ten arrows equipped\r\nwith wings of gold and whetted on stone. With four shafts that mighty\r\ncar-warrior then slew the four steeds of his foe, and with the fifth he\r\ncut off from his trunk the head of Duryodhana's driver. With the sixth\r\narrow he felled the (Kuru) king's standard on the Earth, with the seventh\r\nhis bow, and with the eighth his scimitar. And then with five more shafts\r\nking Yudhishthira the just deeply afflicted the Kuru monarch. Thy son,\r\nthen, alighting from that steedless car, stood on the Earth in imminent\r\ndanger. Beholding him in that situation of great peril, Karna and Drona's\r\nson and Kripa and others rushed suddenly towards the spot, desirous of\r\nrescuing the king. Then the (other) sons of Pandu, surrounding\r\nYudhishthira, all proceeded to the encounter, upon which, O king, a\r\nfierce battle was fought. Thousands of trumpets then were blown in that\r\ngreat engagement, and a confused din of myriad voices arose there, O\r\nking. There where the Pancalas engaged the Kauravas, in battle, men\r\nclosed with men, and elephants with foremost of elephants. And\r\ncar-warriors closed with car-warriors, and horse with horse. And the\r\nvarious couples of battling men and animals, of great prowess and armed\r\nwith diverse kinds of weapons and possessed of great skill presented a\r\nbeautiful sight, O king, over the field. All those heroes endued with\r\ngreat impetuosity and desirous of compassing the destruction of one\r\nanother, fought beautifully and with great activity and skill. Observing\r\nthe (sanctioned) practices of warriors, they slew one another in battle.\r\nNone of them fought from behind others. For only a very short time that\r\nbattle presented a beautiful aspect. Soon it became an encounter of mad\r\nmen, in which the combatants showed no regard for one another. The\r\ncar-warrior, approaching the elephant, pierced the latter with keen\r\nshafts and despatched it to Yama's presence by means of straight arrows.\r\nElephants, approaching steeds, dragged down many of them in that battle,\r\nand tore them (with their tusks) most fiercely in diverse places. Large\r\nnumbers of horsemen also, encompassing many foremost of steeds, made a\r\nloud noise with their palms, and closed with them. And those horsemen\r\nslew those steeds as they ran hither and thither, as also many huge\r\nelephants as these wandered over the field, from behind and the flanks.\r\nInfuriate elephants, O king, routing large numbers of steeds, slew them\r\nwith their tusks or crushed them with great force. Some elephants, filled\r\nwith wrath pierced with their tusks horses with horsemen. Others seizing\r\nsuch with great force hurled them to the ground with violence. Many\r\nelephants, struck by foot-soldiers availing of the proper opportunities,\r\nuttered terrible cries of pain and fled away on all sides. Among the\r\nfoot-soldiers that fled away in that great battle throwing down their\r\nornaments, there were many that were quickly encompassed on the field.\r\nElephant-warriors, riding on huge elephants, understanding indications of\r\nvictory, wheeled their beasts and causing them to seize those beautiful\r\nornaments, made the beasts to pierce them with their tusks. Other\r\nfoot-soldiers endued with great impetuosity and fierce might, surrounding\r\nthose elephant-warriors thus engaged in those spots began to slay them.\r\nOthers in that great battle, thrown aloft into the air by elephants with\r\ntheir trunks, were pierced by those trained beasts with the points of\r\ntheir tusks as they fell down. Others, suddenly seized by other\r\nelephants, were deprived of life with their tusks. Others, borne away\r\nfrom their own divisions into the midst of others, were, O king, mangled\r\nby huge elephants which rolled them repeatedly on the ground. Others,\r\nwhirled on high like fans, were slain in that battle. Others, hither and\r\nthither on the field, that stood full in front of other elephants had\r\ntheir bodies exceedingly pierced and torn. Many elephants were deeply\r\nwounded with spears and lances and darts in their cheeks and frontal\r\nglobes and parts between their tusks. Exceedingly afflicted by fierce\r\ncar-warriors and horsemen stationed on their flanks, many elephants,\r\nripped open, fell down on the Earth. In that dreadful battle many\r\nhorsemen on their steeds, striking foot-soldiers with their lances,\r\npinned them down to the Earth or crushed them with great force. Some\r\nelephants, approaching mail-clad car-warriors, O sire, raised them aloft\r\nfrom their vehicles and hurled them down with great force upon the Earth\r\nin that fierce and awful fight. Some huge elephants slain by means of\r\ncloth-yard shafts, fell down on the Earth like mountain summits riven by\r\nthunder. Combatants, encountering combatants, began to strike each other\r\nwith their fists, or seizing each other by the hair, began to drag and\r\nthrow down and mangle each other. Others, stretching their arms and\r\nthrowing down their foes on the Earth, placed their feet on their chests\r\nand with great activity cut off their heads. Some combatant, O king,\r\nstruck with his feet some foe that was dead, and some, O king, struck off\r\nwith his sword, the head of a falling foe, and some thrust his weapon\r\ninto the body of a living foe. A fierce battle took place there, O\r\nBharata, in which the combatants struck one another with fists or seized\r\none another's hair or wrestled with one another with bare arms. In many\r\ninstances, combatants, using diverse kinds of weapons, took the lives of\r\ncombatants engaged with others and, therefore, unperceived by them.\r\nDuring the progress of that general engagement when all the combatants\r\nwere mangled in battle, hundreds and thousands of headless trunks stood\r\nup on the field. Weapons and coats of mail, drenched with gore, looked\r\nresplendent, like cloths dyed with gorgeous red. Even thus occurred that\r\nfierce battle marked by the awful clash of weapons. Like the mad and\r\nroaring current of the Ganga it seemed to fill the whole universe with\r\nits uproar. Afflicted with shafts, the warriors failed to distinguish\r\nfriends from foes. Solicitous of victory, the kings fought on because\r\nthey fought that fight they should. The warriors slew both friends and\r\nfoes, with whom they came in contact. The combatants of both the armies\r\nwere deprived of reason by the heroes of both the armies assailing them\r\nwith fury. With broken cars, O monarch, the fallen elephants, and steeds\r\nlying on the ground, and men laid low, the Earth, miry with gore and\r\nflesh, and covered with streams of blood, soon became impassable, Karna\r\nslaughtered the Pancalas while Dhananjaya slaughtered the Trigartas. And\r\nBhimasena, O king, slaughtered the Kurus and all the elephant divisions\r\nof the latter. Even thus occurred that destruction of troops of both the\r\nKurus and the Pandavas, both parties having been actuated by the desire\r\nof winning great fame, at that hour when the Sun had passed the\r\nmeridian.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have heard from thee, O Sanjaya, of many poignant\r\nand unbearable griefs as also of the losses sustained by my sons. From\r\nwhat thou hast said unto me, from the manner in which the battle has been\r\nfought, it is my certain conviction, O Suta, that the Kauravas are no\r\nmore. Duryodhana was made carless in that dreadful battle. How did\r\nDharma's son (then) fight, and how did the royal Duryodhana also fight in\r\nreturn? How also occurred that battle which was fought in the afternoon?\r\nTell me all this in detail, for thou art skilled in narration, O Sanjaya.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'When the troops of both armies were engaged in battle,\r\naccording to their respective divisions, thy son Duryodhana, O king,\r\nriding on another car and filled with rage like a snake of virulent\r\npoison, beholding king Yudhishthira the just, quickly addressed his own\r\ndriver, O Bharata, saying, \"Proceed, proceed, quickly take me there, O\r\ndriver, where the royal son of Pandu, clad in mail shineth under yon\r\numbrella held over his head.\" Thus urged by the king, the driver, in that\r\nbattle, quickly urged his royal master's goodly car towards the face of\r\nYudhishthira. At this, Yudhishthira also, filled with rage and looking\r\nlike an infuriate elephant, urged his own driver saying, \"Proceed to\r\nwhere Suyodhana is.\" Then those two heroes and brothers and foremost of\r\ncar-warriors encountered each other. Both endued with great energy, both\r\nfilled with wrath, both difficult of defeat in battle, approaching each\r\nother, those two great bowmen began to mangle each other with their\r\narrows in that battle. Then king Duryodhana, in that encounter, O sire,\r\nwith a broad-headed arrow whetted on stone, cut in twain the bow of the\r\nvirtuous monarch. Filled with rage, Yudhishthira could not brook that\r\ninsult. Casting aside his broken bow, with eyes red in wrath, Dharma's\r\nson took up another bow at the head of his forces, and then cut off\r\nDuryodhana's standard and bow. Duryodhana then, taking up another bow,\r\npierced the son of Pandu. Filled with rage, they continued to shoot\r\nshowers of shafts at each other. Desirous of vanquishing each other, they\r\nresembled a pair of angry lions. They struck each other in that battle\r\nlike a couple of roaring bulls. Those mighty car-warriors continued to\r\ncareer, expecting to find each other's lapses. Then wounded with shafts\r\nsped from bows drawn to their fullest stretch the two warriors, O king,\r\nlooked resplendent like flowering Kinsukas. They then, O king, repeatedly\r\nuttered leonine roars. Those two rulers of men, in that dreadful battle,\r\nalso made loud sounds with their palms and caused their bows to twang\r\nloudly. And they blew their conchs too with great force. And they\r\nafflicted each other very much. Then king Yudhishthira, filled with rage,\r\nstruck thy son in the chest with three irresistible shafts endued with\r\nforce of thunder. Him, however, thy royal son quickly pierced, in return,\r\nwith five keen shafts winged with gold and whetted on stone. Then king\r\nDuryodhana, O Bharata, hurled a dart capable of slaying everybody,\r\nexceedingly keen, and resembling a large blazing brand. As it advanced,\r\nking Yudhishthira the just, with sharp shafts, speedily cut it off into\r\nthree fragments, and then pierced Duryodhana also with five arrows.\r\nEquipped with golden staff, and producing a loud whizz, that dart then\r\nfell down, and while falling, looked resplendent like a large brand with\r\nblazing flames. Beholding the dart baffled, thy son, O monarch, struck\r\nYudhishthira with nine sharp and keen-pointed arrows. Pierced deeply by\r\nhis mighty foe, that scorcher of foes quickly took up an arrow for aiming\r\nit at Duryodhana. The mighty Yudhishthira then placed that arrow on his\r\nbow-string. Filled with rage and possessed of great valour, the son of\r\nPandu then shot it at his foe. That arrow, striking thy son, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, stupefied him and then (passing through his body) entered\r\nthe Earth. Then Duryodhana, filled with wrath, uplifting a mace of great\r\nimpetuosity, rushed at king Yudhishthira the just, for ending the\r\nhostilities (that raged between the Kurus and the Pandus). Beholding him\r\narmed with that uplifted mace and resembling Yama himself with his\r\nbludgeon, king Yudhishthira the just hurled at thy son a mighty dart\r\nblazing with splendour, endued with great impetuosity, and looking like a\r\nlarge blazing brand. Deeply pierced in the chest by that dart as he stood\r\non his car, the Kuru prince, deeply pained, fell down and swooned away.\r\nThen Bhima, recollecting his own vow, addressed Yudhishthira, saying,\r\n\"This one should not be slain by thee, O king.\" At this Yudhishthira\r\nabstained from giving his foe the finishing blow. At that time\r\nKritavarma, quickly advancing, came upon thy royal son then sunk in an\r\nocean of calamity. Bhima then, taking up a mace adorned with gold and\r\nflaxen chords, rushed impetuously towards Kritavarma in that battle. Thus\r\noccurred the battle between thy troops and the foe on that afternoon, O\r\nmonarch, every one of the combatants being inspired with the desire of\r\nvictory.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Placing Karna at their van, thy warriors, difficult of\r\ndefeat in fight, returned and fought (with the foe) a battle that\r\nresembled that between the gods and the Asuras. Excited by the loud\r\nuproar made by elephants and men and cars and steeds and conchs,\r\nelephant-men and car-warriors and foot-soldiers and horsemen, in large\r\nnumbers, filled with wrath advanced against the foe and slew the latter\r\nwith strokes of diverse kinds of weapons. Elephants and cars, steeds and\r\nmen, in that dreadful battle were destroyed by brave warriors with sharp\r\nbattle axes and swords and axes and shafts of diverse kinds and by means\r\nalso of their animals. Strewn with human heads that were adorned with\r\nwhite teeth and fair faces and beautiful eyes and goodly noses, and\r\ngraced with beautiful diadems and earrings, and everyone of which\r\nresembled the lotus, the Sun, or the Moon, the Earth looked exceedingly\r\nresplendent. Elephants and men and steeds, by thousands, were slain with\r\nhundreds of spiked clubs and short bludgeons and darts and lances and\r\nhooks and Bhusundis and maces. The blood that fell formed a river like\r\ncurrents on the field. In consequence of those car-warriors and men and\r\nsteeds and elephants slain by the foe, and lying with ghostly features\r\nand gaping wounds, the field of battle looked like the domains of the\r\nking of the dead at the time of universal dissolution. Then, O god among\r\nmen, thy troops, and those bulls amongst the Kurus, viz., thy sons\r\nresembling the children of the celestials, with a host of warriors of\r\nimmeasurable might at their van, all proceeded against Satyaki, that bull\r\nof Sini's race. Thereupon that host, teeming with many foremost of men\r\nand steeds and cars and elephants, producing an uproar loud as that of\r\nthe vast deep, and resembling the army of the Asuras or that of the\r\ncelestials, shone with fierce beauty. Then the son of Surya, resembling\r\nthe chief of the celestials himself in prowess and like unto the younger\r\nbrother of Indra, struck that foremost one of Sini's race with shafts\r\nwhose splendour resembled the rays of the Sun. That bull of Sini's race\r\nalso, in that battle, then quickly shrouded that foremost of men, with\r\nhis car and steeds and driver, with diverse kinds of shafts terrible as\r\nthe poison of the snake. Then many Atirathas belonging to thy army,\r\naccompanied by elephants and cars and foot-soldiers, quickly approached\r\nthat bull among car-warriors, viz., Vasusena, when they beheld the latter\r\ndeeply afflicted with the shafts of that foremost hero of Sini's race.\r\nThat force, however, vast as the ocean, assailed by foes possessed of\r\ngreat quickness viz., the Pandava warriors headed by the sons of Drupada,\r\nfled away from the field. At that time a great carnage occurred of men\r\nand cars and steeds and elephants. Then those two foremost of men, viz.,\r\nArjuna and Keshava, having said their daily prayer and duly worshipped\r\nthe lord Bhava, quickly rushed against thy troops, resolved to slay those\r\nfoes of theirs. Their foes (i.e., the Kurus) cast their eyes cheerlessly\r\non that car whose rattle resembled the roar of the clouds and whose\r\nbanners waved beautifully in the air and which had white steeds yoked\r\nunto it and which was coming towards them. Then Arjuna, bending Gandiva\r\nand as if dancing on his car, filled the welkin and all the points of the\r\ncompass, cardinal and subsidiary, with showers of shafts, not leaving the\r\nsmallest space empty. Like the tempest destroying the clouds, the son of\r\nPandu destroyed with his arrows many cars looking like celestial\r\nvehicles, that were well-adorned, and equipped with weapons and\r\nstandards, along with their drivers. Many elephants also, with the men\r\nthat guided them, adorned with truimphal banners and weapons, and many\r\nhorsemen with horses, and many foot-soldiers also, Arjuna despatched with\r\nhis arrows to Yama's abode. Then Duryodhana singly proceeded against that\r\nmighty car-warrior who was angry and irresistible and resembled a\r\nveritable Yama, striking him with his straight shafts. Arjuna, cutting\r\noff his adversary's bow and driver and steeds and standard with seven\r\nshafts, next cut off his umbrella with one arrow. Obtaining then an\r\nopportunity, he sped at Duryodhana an excellent shaft, capable of taking\r\nthe life of the person struck. Drona's son, however, cut off that shaft\r\ninto seven fragments. Cutting off then the bow of Drona's son and slaying\r\nthe four steeds of the latter with his arrow, the son of Pandu next cut\r\noff the formidable bow of Kripa too. Then cutting off the bow of\r\nHridika's son, he felled the latter's standard and steeds. Then cutting\r\noff the bow of Duhshasana, he proceeded against the son of Radha. At\r\nthis, Karna, leaving Satyaki quickly pierced Arjuna with three arrows and\r\nKrishna with twenty, and Partha again repeatedly. Although many were the\r\narrows that he shot while slaying his foes in that battle, like Indra\r\nhimself inspired with wrath, Karna yet felt no fatigue. Meanwhile\r\nSatyaki, coming up, pierced Karna with nine and ninety fierce arrows, and\r\nonce more with a hundred. Then all the foremost heroes among the Parthas\r\nbegan to afflict Karna. Yudhamanyu and Shikhandi and the sons of Draupadi\r\nand the Prabhadrakas, and Uttamauja and Yuyutsu and the twins and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and the divisions of the Cedis and the Karushas and the\r\nMatsyas and Kaikeyas, and the mighty Chekitana, and king Yudhishthira of\r\nexcellent vows, all these, accompanied by cars and steeds and elephants,\r\nand foot-soldiers of fierce prowess, encompassed Karna on all sides in\r\nthat battle, and showered upon him diverse kinds of weapons, addressing\r\nhim in harsh words and resolved to compass his destruction. Cutting off\r\nthat shower of weapons with his sharp shafts, Karna dispersed his\r\nassailants by the power of his weapons like the wind breaking down the\r\ntrees that stand on its way. Filled with wrath, Karna was seen to destroy\r\ncar-warriors, and elephants with their riders, and horses with horse-men,\r\nand large bands of foot-soldiers. Slaughtered by the energy of Karna's\r\nweapons, almost the whole of that force of the Pandavas, deprived of\r\nweapons, and with limbs mangled and torn, retired from the field. Then\r\nArjuna, smiling the while, baffled with his own weapons the weapons of\r\nKarna and covered the welkin, the Earth, and all the points of the\r\ncompass with dense shower of arrows. The shafts of Arjuna fell like heavy\r\nclubs and spiked bludgeons. And some amongst them fell like Sataghnis and\r\nsome fell like fierce thunderbolts. Slaughtered therewith, the Kaurava\r\nforce consisting of infantry and horse and cars and elephants, shutting\r\nits eyes, uttered loud wails of woe and wandered senselessly. Many were\r\nthe steeds and men and elephants that perished on that occasion. Many,\r\nagain, struck with shafts and deeply afflicted fled away in fear.\r\n\r\n\"'Whilst thy warriors were thus engaged in battle from desire of victory,\r\nthe Sun approaching the Setting Mountain, entered it. In consequence of\r\nthe darkness, O king, but especially owing to the dust, we could not\r\nnotice anything favourable or unfavourable. The mighty bowmen (amongst\r\nthe Kauravas), fearing a night-battle, O Bharata, then retired from the\r\nfield, accompanied by all their combatants. Upon the retirement of the\r\nKauravas, O king, at the close of the day, the Parthas, cheerful at\r\nhaving obtained the victory, also retired to their own encampment,\r\njeering at their enemies by producing diverse kinds of sounds with their\r\nmusical instruments, and applauding Acyuta and Arjuna. After those heroes\r\nhad thus withdrawn the army, all the troops and all the kings uttered\r\nbenediction upon the Pandavas. The withdrawal having been made, those\r\nsinless men, the Pandavas, became very glad, and proceeding to their\r\ntents rested there for the night. Then rakshasas and pishacas, and\r\ncarnivorous beasts, in large numbers came to that awful field of battle\r\nresembling the sporting ground of Rudra himself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'It seems that Arjuna slew all of you at his will.\r\nIndeed, the Destroyer himself could not escape him in battle, if Arjuna\r\ntook up arms against Him. Single-handed, Partha ravished Bhadra, and\r\nsingle-handed, he gratified Agni. Single-handed, he subjugated the whole\r\nEarth, and made all the kings pay tribute. Single-handed, with his\r\ncelestial bow he slew the Nivatakavachas. Single-handed, he contended in\r\nbattle with Mahadeva who stood before him in the guise of a hunter.\r\nSingle-handed, he protected the Bharatas, and single-handed, he gratified\r\nBhava. Single-handed, were vanquished by him all the kings of the Earth\r\nendued with fierce prowess. The Kurus cannot be blamed. On the other\r\nhand, they deserve praise (for having fought with such a warrior). Tell\r\nme now what they did. Tell me also, O Suta, what Duryodhana did after\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Struck and wounded and overthrown from their vehicles and\r\ndivested of armour and deprived of weapons and their beasts slain, with\r\nplaintive voices and burning with grief and vanquished by their foes, the\r\nvain Kauravas, entering their tents once more took counsel of one\r\nanother. They then looked like snakes deprived of fangs and poison trod\r\nupon by others. Unto them, Karna, sighing like an angry snake, squeezing\r\nhis hands, and eyeing thy son, said, \"Arjuna is always careful, firm,\r\npossessed of skill, and endued with intelligence. Again, when the time\r\ncomes, Vasudeva awakes him (to what should be done). Today, by that\r\nsudden shower of weapons we were deceived by him. Tomorrow, however, O\r\nlord of Earth, I will frustrate all his purposes.\" Thus addressed by\r\nKarna, Duryodhana said, \"So be it,\" and then granted permission to those\r\nforemost of kings to retire. Bidden by the king, all those rulers\r\nproceeded to their respective tents. Having passed the night happily,\r\nthey cheerfully went out for battle (the next day). They then beheld an\r\ninvincible array formed by king Yudhishthira the just, that foremost one\r\nof Kuru race, with great care, and according to the sanction of\r\nBrihaspati and Usanas. Then that slayer of foes, Duryodhana, called to\r\nmind the heroic Karna, that counteractor of foes, that warrior with neck\r\nlike that of a bull, equal to Purandara himself in battle, the Maruts in\r\nmight, and Kartavirya in energy. Indeed, the heart of the king turned\r\ntowards Karna. And the hearts of all the troops also turned to that hero,\r\nthat Suta's son, that mighty bowman, as one's heart turns to a friend in\r\na situation of great danger.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'What did Duryodhana next do, O Suta, when the\r\nhearts of all of you turned towards Vikarna's son Karna? Did my troops\r\ncast their eyes on Radha's son like persons afflicted with cold turning\r\ntheir gaze towards the Sun? Upon the recommencement of the battle after\r\nthe withdrawal of the troops, how, O Sanjaya, did Vikarna's son Karna\r\nfight? How also did all the Pandavas fight with the Suta's son? The\r\nmighty-armed Karna would, single-handed, slay the Parthas with the\r\nSrinjayas. The might of Karna's arms in battle equals that of Sakra or\r\nVishnu. His weapons are fierce, and the prowess also of that high-souled\r\none is fierce. Relying upon Karna, king Duryodhana had set his heart on\r\nbattle. Beholding Duryodhana deeply afflicted by the son of Pandu, and\r\nseeing also the sons of Pandu displaying great prowess, what did that\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., Karna, do? Alas, the foolish Duryodhana,\r\nrelying on Karna, hopeth to vanquish the Parthas with their sons and\r\nKeshava in battle! Alas, it is a matter of great grief that Karna could\r\nnot, with his strength, overcome the sons of Pandu in fight! Without\r\ndoubt, Destiny is supreme. Alas, the terrible end of that gambling match\r\nhath now come! Alas, these heartrending sorrows, due to Duryodhana's\r\nacts, many in number and like unto terrible darts, are now being borne\r\nby, me, O Sanjaya! O sire, Subala's son used to be then regarded as a\r\npolitic person. Karna also is always exceedingly attached to king\r\nDuryodhana. Alas, when such is the case, O Sanjaya, why have I then to\r\nhear of the frequent defeats and deaths of my sons? There is no one that\r\ncan resist the Pandavas in battle. They penetrate into my army like a man\r\ninto the midst of helpless women. Destiny, indeed, is supreme.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'O king, think now of all those wrongful acts of thine\r\nlike that match at dice and the others--acts that have passed away from\r\nthe subjects of thought with man. One should not, however, reflect on\r\nbygone acts. One may be ruined by such reflection. That result (which\r\nthou hadst expected) is now much removed from the point of fruition,\r\nsince, although possessed of knowledge, thou didst not reflect on the\r\npropriety or impropriety of thy acts then. Many a time wert thou, O king,\r\ncounselled against warring with the Pandavas. Thou didst not, however, O\r\nmonarch, accept those counsels, from folly. Diverse sinful acts of a\r\ngrave nature were perpetrated by thee against the sons of Pandu. For\r\nthose acts this awful slaughter of kings hath now come. All that,\r\nhowever, is now past. Do not grieve, O bull of Bharata's race. O thou of\r\nunfading glory, listen now to the details of the awful carnage that has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\"'When the night dawned, Karna repaired to king Duryodhana. Approaching\r\nthe king, the mighty-armed hero said, \"I shall, O king, engage in battle\r\ntoday the illustrious son of Pandu. Either I will slay that hero today,\r\nor he will slay me. In consequence of the diverse things both myself and\r\nPartha had to do, O Bharata, an encounter, O king, could not hitherto\r\ntake place between myself and Arjuna! Listen now, O monarch, to these\r\nwords of mine, spoken according to my wisdom. Without slaying Partha in\r\nbattle I will not come back, O Bharata. Since this army of ours hath been\r\ndeprived of its foremost warriors, and since I will stand in battle,\r\nPartha will advance against me, especially because I am destitute of the\r\ndart Sakra gave me. Therefore, O ruler of men, listen now to what is\r\nbeneficial. The energy of my celestial weapons is equal to the energy of\r\nArjuna's weapons. In counteracting the feats of powerful foes, in\r\nlightness of hands, in range of the arrows shot, in skill, and in hitting\r\nthe mark, Savyasaci is never my equal. In physical strength, in courage,\r\nin knowledge of (weapons), in prowess, O Bharata, in aiming, Savyasaci is\r\nnever my equal. My bow, called Vijaya, is the foremost of all weapons (of\r\nits kind). Desirous of doing what was agreeable (to Indra), it was made\r\nby Vishakarman (the celestial artificer) for Indra. With that bow, O\r\nking, Indra had vanquished the Daityas. At its twang the Daityas beheld\r\nthe ten points to be empty. That bow, respected by all, Sakra gave to\r\nBhrigu's son (Rama). That celestial and foremost of bows Bhrigu's son\r\ngave to me. With that bow I will contend in battle with the mighty-armed\r\nArjuna, that foremost of victorious warriors, like Indra fighting with\r\nthe assembled Daityas. That formidable bow, the gift of Rama, is superior\r\nto Gandiva. It was with that bow that the Earth was subjugated thrice\r\nseven times (by Bhrigu's son). With that bow given to me by Rama I will\r\ncontend in battle with the son of Pandu. I will, O Duryodhana, gladden\r\nthee today with thy friends, by slaying in battle that hero, viz.,\r\nArjuna, that foremost of conquerors. The whole Earth with her mountains\r\nand forest and islands, without a heroic warrior (to oppose thy wish),\r\nwill, O king, become thine today, over which thyself with thy sons and\r\ngrandsons will reign supreme. Today there is nothing that is incapable of\r\nbeing achieved by me, especially when the object is to do what is\r\nagreeable to thee, even as success is incapable of being missed by an\r\nascetic zealously devoted to virtue and having his soul under control.\r\nArjuna will not be able to bear me in battle, even as a tree in contact\r\nwith fire is incapable of bearing that element. I must, however, declare\r\nin what respect I am inferior to Arjuna. The string of his bow is\r\ncelestial, and the two large quivers of his are inexhaustible. His driver\r\nis Govinda. I have none like him. His is that celestial and foremost of\r\nbows, called Gandiva, which is irrefragible in battle. I also have that\r\nexcellent, celestial, and formidable bow called Vijaya. In respect of our\r\nbows, therefore, O king, I am superior to Arjuna. Listen now to those\r\nmatters in which the heroic son of Pandu is superior to me. The holder of\r\nthe reins (of his steeds) is he of Dasharha's race who is adored by all\r\nthe worlds. His celestial car decked with gold, given unto him by Agni,\r\nis impenetrable in every part, and his steeds also, O hero, are endued\r\nwith the speed of the mind. His celestial standard, bearing the blazing\r\nApe, is exceedingly wonderful. Again, Krishna, who is Creator of the\r\nuniverse, protects that car. Though inferior to Arjuna in respect of\r\nthese things, I still desire to fight with him. This Shalya, however, the\r\nornament of assemblies, is equal to Saurin. If he becomes my driver,\r\nvictory will certainly be thine. Let Shalya, therefore, who is incapable\r\nof being resisted by foes be the driver of my car. Let a large number of\r\ncarts bear my long shafts and those that are winged with vulturine\r\nfeathers. Let a number of foremost cars, O monarch, with excellent steeds\r\nyoked unto them, always follow me, O bull of Bharata's race. By these\r\narrangements I will, as regards the qualities mentioned, be superior to\r\nArjuna. Shalya is superior to Krishna, and I am superior to Arjuna. As\r\nthat slayer of foes, viz., he of Dasharha's race, is acquainted with\r\nhorselore, even so is that mighty car-warrior, viz., Shalya acquainted\r\nwith horselore. There is none equal to the chief of the Madras in might\r\nof arms. As there is none equal to myself in weapons, so there is none\r\nequal to Shalya in knowledge of steeds. So circumstanced, I will become\r\nsuperior to Partha. Against my car, the very gods with Vasava at their\r\nhead will not dare advance. All these being attended to, when I take my\r\nstand on my car, I will become superior to Arjuna in the attributes of\r\nwarrior and will then, O best of the Kurus, vanquish Phalguna. I desire,\r\nO monarch, all this to be done by thee, O scorcher of foes. Let these\r\nwishes of mine be accomplished. Let no time be suffered to elapse. If all\r\nthis be accomplished, the most effectual aid will be rendered to me on\r\nevery desirable point. Thou wilt then see, O Bharata, what I will achieve\r\nin battle. I will by every means vanquish the sons of Pandu in battle\r\nwhen they will approach me. The very gods and Asuras are not able to\r\nadvance against me in battle. What need be said then of the sons of Pandu\r\nthat are of human origin?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by that ornament of battle, viz.,\r\nKarna, thy son, worshipping the son of Radha, answered him, with a glad\r\nheart, saying, \"Accomplish that, O Karna, which thou thinkest. Equipped\r\nwith goodly quivers and steeds, such cars shall follow thee in battle.\r\nLet as many cars as thou wishest bear thy long shafts and arrows equipped\r\nwith vulturine feathers. Ourselves, as also all the kings, O Karna will,\r\nfollow thee in battle.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, thy royal son, endued with\r\ngreat prowess, approached the ruler of the Madras and addressed him in\r\nthe following words.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thy son then, O monarch, humbly approaching that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the ruler of the Madras, addressed him, from\r\naffection, in these words, \"O thou of true vows, O thou of great good\r\nfortune, O enhancer of the sorrows of foes, O ruler of the Madras, O hero\r\nin battle, O thou that inspirest hostile troops with fear, thou hast\r\nheard, O foremost of speakers, how, for the sake of Karna who spoke unto\r\nme, I myself am desirous of soliciting thee among all these lions of\r\nkings. O thou of incomparable prowess, O king of the Madras, for the\r\ndestruction of the foe, I solicit thee today, with humility and bow of\r\nthe head. Therefore, for the destruction of Partha and for my good, it\r\nbehoveth thee, O foremost of car-warriors, to accept, from love, the\r\noffice of charioteer. With thee for his driver, the son of Radha will\r\nsubjugate my foes. There is none else for holding the reins of Karna's\r\nsteeds, except thee, O thou of great good fortune, thou that art the\r\nequal of Vasudeva in battle. Protect Karna then by every means like\r\nBrahma protecting Maheswara. Even as he of Vrishni's race protects by\r\nevery means the son of Pandu in all dangers, do thou, O chief of the\r\nMadras, protect the son of Radha today. Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa,\r\nand thyself and the valiant ruler of the Bhojas, and Shakuni the son of\r\nSubala, and Drona's son and myself, constituted the chief strength of our\r\narmy. Even thus, O lord of Earth, we had divided amongst ourselves the\r\nhostile army into portion for the share of each. The share that had been\r\nallotted to Bhishma is now no more as also that which had been allotted\r\nto the high-souled Drona. Going even beyond their allotted shares, those\r\ntwo slew my foes. Those two tigers among men, however, were old, and both\r\nof them have been slain deceitfully. Having achieved the most difficult\r\nfeats, both of them, O sinless one, have departed hence to heaven.\r\nSimilarly, many other tigers among men, of our army, slain by foes in\r\nbattle, have ascended to heaven, casting off their lives and having made\r\ngreat exertions to the best of their powers. This my host, therefore, O\r\nking, the greater portion of which has been slaughtered, has been reduced\r\nto this state by the Parthas who were at first fewer than us. What should\r\nbe done for the present? Do that now, O lord of Earth, by which the\r\nmighty and the high-souled sons of Kunti, of prowess incapable of being\r\nbaffled, may be prevented from exterminating the remnant of my host. O\r\nlord, the Pandavas have in battle slain the bravest warriors of this my\r\nforce. The mighty-armed Karna alone is devoted to our good, as also\r\nthyself, O tiger among men, that art the foremost of car-warriors in the\r\nwhole world. O Shalya, Karna wishes to contend in battle today with\r\nArjuna. On him, O ruler of the Madras, my hopes of victory are great.\r\nThere is none else in the world (save thee) that can make so good a\r\nholder of the reins for Karna. As Krishna is the foremost of all holders\r\nof reins for Partha in battle, even so, O king, be thou the foremost of\r\nall holders of reins for Karna's car. Accompanied and protected, O sire,\r\nby him in battle, the feats that Partha achieve are all before thee.\r\nFormerly, Arjuna had never slain his foes in battle in such a way. Now\r\nhowever, his prowess has become great, united as he is with Krishna. Day\r\nafter day, O ruler of the Madras, this vast Dhritarashtra force is seen\r\nto be routed by Partha because he is united with Krishna. A portion\r\nremains of the share allotted to Karna and thyself, O thou of great\r\nsplendour. Bear that share with Karna, and destroy it unitedly in battle.\r\nEven as Surya, uniting with Aruna, destroys the darkness, do thou,\r\nuniting with Karna, slay Partha in battle. Let the mighty car-warriors\r\n(of the enemy), fly away, beholding in battle those two warriors endued\r\nwith the effulgence of the morning sun, viz., Karna and Shalya,\r\nresembling two Suns risen above the horizon. Even as darkness is\r\ndestroyed, O sire, at the sight of Surya and Aruna, even so let the\r\nKaunteyas (Pandavas) with the Pancalas and the Srinjayas perish beholding\r\nthee and Karna. Karna is the foremost of car-warriors, and thou art the\r\nforemost of drivers. In the clash of battle, again there is none equal to\r\nthee. As he of Vrishni's race protects the son of Pandu under all\r\ncircumstances, even so let thyself protect Vikarna's son Karna in battle.\r\nWith thee as his driver, Karna will become invincible, O king, in battle\r\neven with the gods having Sakra at their head! What then need be said\r\nabout the Pandavas? Do not doubt my words.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Shalya, became\r\nfilled with rage. Contracting his brow into three lines, and waving his\r\narms repeatedly, and rolling his large eyes red in wrath, that warrior of\r\nmassive arms proud of his lineage and wealth and knowledge and strength,\r\nsaid these words:\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said \"Thou insultest me, O son of Gandhari, or without doubt\r\nsuspectest me, since thou solicitest me, without hesitation, saying, 'Act\r\nthou as a driver.' Regarding Karna to be superior to ourselves, thou\r\napplaudest him thus. I, however, do not regard the son of Radha as my\r\nequal in battle. Assign to me a much greater share, O lord of Earth.\r\nDestroying that in battle, I will return to the place I come from. Or, if\r\nthou wishest, I will, O delighter of the Kurus, contend, single-handed,\r\nwith the enemy. While engaged in consuming the foe, behold thou my\r\nprowess today. Brooding upon an insult, O thou of Kuru's race, a person\r\nlike ourselves never engageth in my task. Do not have thy doubts about\r\nme. Never shouldst thou humiliate me in battle. Behold these two massive\r\narms of mine, strong as the thunder. Behold also my excellent bow, and\r\nthese shafts that resemble snakes of virulent poison. Behold my car, unto\r\nwhich are yoked excellent steeds endued with the speed of the wind.\r\nBehold also, O son of Gandhari, my mace decked with gold and twined with\r\nhempen chords. Filled with wrath, I can split the very Earth, scatter the\r\nmountains, and dry up the oceans, with my own energy, O king. Knowing me,\r\nO monarch, to be so capable, of afflicting the foe, why dost thou appoint\r\nme to the office of driver in battle for such a low-born person as\r\nAdhiratha's son? It behoveth thee not, O king of kings, to set me to such\r\nmean tasks! Being so superior, I cannot make up my mind to obey the\r\ncommands of a sinful person. He that causeth a superior person arrived of\r\nhis own will and obedient from love, to yield to a sinful wight,\r\ncertainly incurreth the sin of confusing the superior with the inferior.\r\nBrahman created the brahmanas from his mouth, and the kshatriyas from his\r\narms. He created the Vaishyas from his thighs and the Shudras from his\r\nfeet. In consequence of the intermixture of those four orders, O Bharata,\r\nfrom those four have sprung particular classes, viz., those born of men\r\nof superior classes wedding women of classes inferior to themselves, and\r\nvice versa. The kshatriyas have been described to be protectors (of the\r\nother classes) acquirers of wealth and givers of the same. The brahmanas\r\nhave been established on the Earth for the sake of favouring its people\r\nby assisting at sacrifices, by teaching and acceptance of pure gifts.\r\nAgriculture and tending of cattle and gift are the occupations of the\r\nVaishyas according to the scriptures. Shudras have been ordained to be\r\nthe servants of the brahmanas, the kshatriyas, and the vaishyas.\r\nSimilarly, the Sutas are the servants of kshatriyas, and not latter the\r\nservants of the former. Listen to these my words, O sinless one. As\r\nregards myself, I am one whose coronal locks have undergone the sacred\r\nbath. I am born in a race of royal sages. I am reckoned a great\r\ncar-warrior. I deserve the worship and the praises that bards and\r\neulogists render and sing. Being all this, O slayer of hostile troops, I\r\ncannot go to the extent of acting as the driver of the Suta's son in\r\nbattle. I will never fight, undergoing an act of humiliation. I ask thy\r\npermission, O son of Gandhari, for returning home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words that tiger among men and\r\nornament of assemblies, viz., Shalya, filled with rage stood up quickly\r\nand endeavoured to get away from that concourse of kings. Thy son,\r\nhowever, from affection and great regard, held the king, and addressed\r\nhim in these sweet and conciliatory words, that were capable of\r\naccomplishing every object, \"Without doubt, O Shalya, it is even so as\r\nthou hast said. But I have a certain purpose in view. Listen to it, O\r\nruler of men, Karna is not superior to thee, nor do I suspect thee, O\r\nking. The royal chief of the Madras will never do that which is false.\r\nThose foremost of men that were thy ancestors always told the truth. I\r\nthink it is for this that thou art called Artayani (the descendant of\r\nthose that had truth for their refuge). And since, O giver of honours,\r\nthou art like a barbed arrow to thy foes, therefore art thou called by\r\nthe name of Shalya on earth. O thou that makest large present (to\r\nbrahmanas) at sacrifices, do thou accomplish all that which, O virtuous\r\none, thou hadst previously said thou wouldst accomplish. Neither the son\r\nof Radha nor myself am superior to thee in valour that I would select\r\nthee as the driver of those foremost of steeds (that are yoked unto\r\nKarna's car). As, however, O sire, Karna is superior to Dhananjaya in\r\nregard to many qualities, even so doth the world regard thee to be\r\nsuperior to Vasudeva. Karna is certainly superior to Partha in the matter\r\nof weapons, O bull among men. Thou too art superior to Krishna in\r\nknowledge of steeds and might. Without doubt O ruler of the Madras, thy\r\nknowledge of horse is double that which the high-souled Vasudeva hath.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Since, O son of Gandhari, thou describest me, O thou of\r\nKuru's race, in the midst of all these troops, to be superior to Devaki's\r\nson, I am gratified with thee. I will become the driver of Radha's son of\r\ngreat fame while he will be engaged in battle with the foremost one of\r\nPandu's sons, as thou solicitest me. Let this, however, O hero, be my\r\nunderstanding with Vikartana's son that I will in his presence utter\r\nwhatever speeches I desire.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'O king, thy son, with Karna then, O Bharata,\r\nanswered the prince of the Madras, O best of Bharata's race, saying, \"So\r\nbe it.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"Listen, once more, O ruler of the Madras, to what I\r\nwill say unto thee, about what happened, O lord, in the battle between\r\nthe gods and the Asuras in days of yore. The great rishi Markandeya\r\nnarrated it to my sire. I will now recite it without leaving out\r\nanything, O best of royal sages. Listen to that account confidingly and\r\nwithout mistrusting it at all. Between the gods and the Asuras, each\r\ndesirous of vanquishing the other, there happened a great battle, O king,\r\nwhich had Taraka for its evil (root). It hath been heard by us that the\r\nDaityas were defeated by the gods. Upon the defeat of the Daityas, the\r\nthree sons of Taraka, named Tarakaksha, Kamalaksha and Vidyunmalin, O\r\nking, practising the austerest penances, lived in the observance of high\r\nvows. By those penances they emaciated their bodies, O scorcher of foes.\r\nIn consequence of their self-restraint, their penances, their vows and\r\ncontemplation, the boongiving Grandsire became gratified with them and\r\ngave them boons. Unitedly they solicited the Grandsire of all the worlds,\r\nO king, for the boon of immunity from death at the hands of all Creatures\r\nof all times. The divine Lord and Master of all the worlds said unto\r\nthem, 'There is nothing like immunity from death at the hands of all\r\ncreatures. Therefore, ye Asuras, abstain from such a prayer. Solicit some\r\nother boon that may seem desirable to you.' When all of them, O king,\r\nhaving settled it amongst themselves after long and repeated conferences,\r\nbowed to the great Master of all the worlds and said these words, 'O god,\r\nO Grandsire, give us this boon. Residing in three cities, we will rove\r\nover this Earth, with thy grace ever before us. After a 1,000 years then,\r\nwe will come together, and our three cities also, O sinless one, will\r\nbecome united into one. That foremost one amongst the gods who will, with\r\none shaft, pierce those three cities united into one, will, O lord, be\r\nthe cause of our destruction.' Saying unto them, 'Let it be so,' that god\r\nascended to heaven. Those Asuras then, filled with joy at having obtained\r\nthose boons and having settled it among themselves about the construction\r\nof the three cities, selected for the purpose the great Asura Maya, the\r\ncelestial artificer, knowing no fatigue or decay, and worshipped by all\r\nthe daityas and danavas. Then Maya, of great intelligence, by the aid of\r\nhis own ascetic merit, constructed three cities, one of which was of\r\ngold, another of silver, and the third of black iron. The golden city was\r\nset in heaven, the silver city in the welkin, and the iron city was set\r\non the Earth, all in such a way as to revolve in a circle, O lord of\r\nEarth. Each of those cities measured a hundred yojanas in breadth and a\r\nhundred in length. And they consisted of houses and mansions and lofty\r\nwalls and porches. And though teeming with lordly palaces close to each\r\nother, yet the streets were wide and spacious. And they were adorned with\r\ndiverse mansions and gate-ways. Each of those cities, again, O monarch,\r\nhad a separate king. The beautiful city of gold belonged to the\r\nillustrious Tarakaksha: the silver city to Kamalaksha, and the iron one\r\nto Vidyunmalin. Those three Daitya kings, soon assailing the three worlds\r\nwith their energy, continued to dwell and reign, and began to say, 'Who\r\nis he called the Creator?' Unto those foremost of Danavas having no\r\nheroes equal to them, came from every side millions upon millions, of\r\nproud and flesh-eating Danavas who had before been defeated by the\r\ncelestials, and who now settled in the three cities, desirous of great\r\nprosperity. Unto all of them thus united, Maya became the supplier of\r\nevery thing they wanted. Relying upon him, all of them resided there, in\r\nperfect fearlessness. Whoever amongst those residing in the triple city\r\nwished for any object in his heart had his wish fulfilled by Maya aided\r\nby the latter's powers of illusion. Tarakaksha had a heroic and mighty\r\nson named Hari. He underwent the austerest of penances, upon which the\r\nGrandsire became gratified with him. When the god was gratified, Hari\r\nsolicited a boon of him, saying, 'Let a lake start into existence in our\r\ncity, such that persons, slain by means of weapons, may, when thrown into\r\nit, come out with life, and with redoubled strength.' Obtaining this\r\nboon, the heroic Hari, son of Tarakaksha, created a lake, O lord, in his\r\ncity, that was capable of reviving the dead. In whatever form and\r\nwhatever guise a Daitya might have been slain, if thrown into that lake,\r\nhe was restored to life, in the self-same form and guise. Obtaining alive\r\nthe slain among them, the Daityas began to afflict the three worlds.\r\nCrowned with success by means of austere penances, those enhancers of the\r\nfears of the gods sustained, O king, no diminution in battle. Stupefied\r\nthen by covetousness and folly, and deprived of their senses, all of them\r\nbegan to shamelessly exterminate the cities and towns established all\r\nover the universe. Filled with pride at the boons they had received, and\r\ndriving before them, at all times and from all places, the gods with\r\ntheir attendants, they roamed at will over celestial forests and other\r\nrealms dear to the denizens of heaven and the delightful and sacred\r\nasylums of rishis. And the wicked Danavas ceased to show any respect for\r\nanybody. While the worlds were thus afflicted, Sakra, surrounded by the\r\nMaruts, battled against the three cities by hurling his thunder upon them\r\nfrom every side. When, however, Purandra failed to pierce those cities\r\nmade impenetrable, O king, by the Creator with his boons, the chief of\r\ncelestials, filled with fear, and leaving those cities, repaired with\r\nthose very gods to that chastiser of foes, viz., the Grandsire, for\r\nrepresenting unto him the oppressions committed by the Asuras.\r\nRepresenting everything and bowing with their heads unto him, they asked\r\nthe divine Grandsire the means by which the triple city could be\r\ndestroyed. The illustrious Deity, hearing the words of Indra, told the\r\ngods, 'He that is an offender against you offends against me also. The\r\nAsuras are all of wicked souls and always hate the gods. They that give\r\npain to you always offend against me. I am impartial to all creatures.\r\nThere is no doubt in this. For all that, however, they that are\r\nunrighteous should be slain. This is my fixed vow. Those three forts are\r\nto be pierced with one shaft. By no other means can their destruction be\r\neffected. None else, save Sthanu, is competent to pierce them with one\r\nshaft. Ye Adityas, select Sthanu, otherwise called Ishana and Jishnu, who\r\nis never fatigued with work, as your warrior. It is he that will destroy\r\nthose asuras.' Hearing these words of his, the gods with Sakra at their\r\nhead, making Brahman take their lead, sought the protection of the Deity\r\nhaving the bull for his mark. Those righteous ones accompanied by rishis\r\ndevoted to the severest penances and uttering the eternal words of the\r\nVedas, sought Bhava with their whole soul. And they praised, O king, in\r\nthe high words of the Vedas, that dispeller of fears in all situations of\r\nfear that Universal Soul, that Supreme Soul, that One by whom All this is\r\npervaded with his Soul. Then the gods who, by special penances, had\r\nlearnt to still all the functions of his Soul and to withdraw Soul from\r\nMatter,--they who had their soul always under control--beheld him, called\r\nIshana,--that lord of Uma, that mass of energy, that is, who hath no\r\nequal in the universe, that source (of everything), that sinless Self.\r\nThough that Deity is one they had imagined him to be of various forms.\r\nBeholding in that high-souled one those diverse forms that each had\r\nindividually conceived in own heart, all of them became filled with\r\nwonder. Beholding that Unborn one, that Lord of the universe, to be the\r\nembodiment of all creatures, the gods and the regenerate Rishis, all\r\ntouched the Earth with their heads. Saluting them with the word 'Welcome'\r\nand raising them from their bent attitudes, the illustrious Sankara\r\naddressed them smilingly, saying, 'Tell us the object of your visit.'\r\nCommanded by the Three-eyed god, their hearts became easy. They then said\r\nthese words unto him, 'Our repeated salutations to thee, O Lord.\r\nSalutations to thee that art the source of all the gods, to thee that art\r\narmed with the bow, to thee that art full of wrath. Salutations to thee\r\nthat hadst destroyed the sacrifice of that lord of creatures (viz.,\r\nDaksha) to thee that art adored by all the lords of creatures.\r\nSalutations to thee that art always praised, to thee that deservest to be\r\npraised, to thee that art Death's self. Salutations to thee that art red,\r\nto thee that art fierce, to thee that art blue-throated, to thee that art\r\narmed with the trident, to thee that art incapable of being baffled, to\r\nthee that hast eyes as beautiful as those of the gazelle, to thee that\r\nfightest with the foremost of weapons, to thee that deservest all praise,\r\nto thee that art pure, to thee that art destruction's self, to thee that\r\nart the destroyer; to thee that art irresistible, to thee that art\r\nBrahman, to thee that leadest the life of a brahmacari; to thee that art\r\nIshana; to thee that art immeasurable, to thee that art the great\r\ncontroller, to thee that art robed in tatters; to thee that art ever\r\nengaged in penances, to thee that art tawny, to thee that art observant\r\nof vows, to thee that art robed in animal skins; to thee that art the\r\nsire of Kumara, to thee that art three-eyed, to thee that art armed with\r\nthe foremost of weapons, to thee that destroyest the afflictions of all\r\nthat seek thy shelter, to thee that destroyest all haters of brahmanas,\r\nto thee that art the lord of all trees, the lord of all men, the lord of\r\nall kine, and ever the lord of sacrifices. Salutations to thee that art\r\nalways at the head of troops, to thee that art three-eyed, to thee that\r\nart endued with fierce energy. We devote ourselves to thee in thought,\r\nword and deed. Be gracious unto us.' Gratified with these adorations, the\r\nholy one, saluting them with the word 'Welcome' said unto them, 'Let your\r\nfears be dispelled. Say, what we are to do for you?'\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"After the fears of those throngs of the pitris, the\r\ngods, and the Rishis had thus been dispelled by that high-souled Deity,\r\nBrahman then offered his adorations, unto Sankara, and said these words\r\nfor the benefit of the universe, 'Through thy favour, O Lord of all, the\r\nLordship of all creatures is mine. Occupying that rank, I have given a\r\ngreat boon to the Danavas. It behoveth none else, save thee, O Lord of\r\nthe Past and the Future, to destroy those wicked wights that show no\r\nregard for any one. Thou O god, art the only person competent to slay the\r\nfoes of these denizens of heaven that have sought thy protection and that\r\nsolicit thee. O lord of all the gods, show favour to these. Slay the\r\nDanavas, O wielder of the trident. O giver of honours, let the universe,\r\nthrough thy grace, obtain happiness. O Lord of all the worlds, thou art\r\nthe one whose shelter should be sought. We all seek thy shelter.'\r\n\r\n\"'\"Sthanu said, 'All your foes should be slain. But, I shall not however,\r\nslay them single-handed. The enemies of the gods are possessed of might.\r\nTherefore, all of you, united together, consume those enemies of yours in\r\nbattle, with half my might. Union is great strength.'\r\n\r\n\"'\"The gods said, 'Theirs (Danavas') is twice the energy and might of\r\nourselves, we think, for we have already seen their energy and might.'\r\n\r\n\"'\"The holy one said, 'Those sinful wights that have offended against ye\r\nshould be slain. With half of my energy and might, slay all those enemies\r\nof yours.'\r\n\r\n\"'\"The gods said, 'We will not be able, O Maheswara, to bear half of thy\r\nenergy. With, on the other hand, half of our united might, do thou slay\r\nthose foes.'\r\n\r\n\"'\"The holy one said, 'If, indeed, ye have not the ability to bear half\r\nof my might, then, endued with half of your united energy, I will slay\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana continued, \"The celestials then, addressing the god of gods,\r\nsaid 'So be it' O best of kings. Taking half of their energies from all\r\nof them, he became superior in might. Indeed, in might that god became\r\nsuperior to all in the universe. From that time Sankara came to be called\r\nMahadeva. And Mahadeva then said, 'Armed with bow and shaft, I will, from\r\nmy car, slay in battle those foes of yours, ye denizens of heaven.\r\nTherefore, ye gods, see now to my car and bow and shaft so that I may,\r\nthis very day, throw the Asuras down on the Earth.'\r\n\r\n\"'\"The gods said, 'Gathering all forms that may be found in the three\r\nworlds and taking portions of each, we will each, O Lord of the gods,\r\nconstruct a car of great energy for thee. It will be a large car, the\r\nhandiwork of Viswakarman, designed with intelligence.' Saying this, those\r\ntigers among the gods began the construction of that car. And they made\r\nVishnu and Soma and Hutasana the arrow for Sankara's use. Agni became the\r\nstaff, and Soma became the head, and Vishnu the point, O king, of that\r\nforemost of arrows. The goddess Earth, with her large cities and towns,\r\nher mountains and forests and islands, that home of diverse creatures,\r\nwas made the car. The Mandara mountain was made its axle; and the great\r\nriver Ganga was made its Jangha; and the points of the compass, cardinal\r\nand subsidiary became the ornaments of the car. The constellations became\r\nits shaft; the Krita age became its yoke; and that best of Snakes, viz.,\r\nVasuki, became the Kuvara of that car. Himavat and Vindhya mountains\r\nbecame its Apaskara and Adhishthana; and the Udaya and the Asta mountains\r\nwere made the wheels of that car by those foremost ones among the gods.\r\nThey made the excellent Ocean, that abode of the Danavas its other axle.\r\nThe seven Rishis became the protectors of the wheels of that car. Ganga\r\nand Sarasvati and Sindhu and the Sky became its Dhura; all the other\r\nrivers and all the waters became the chords for binding the several limbs\r\nof that car. Day and Night and the other divisions of time such as Kalas\r\nand Kasthas, and the Seasons became its Amukarsha. The blazing planets\r\nand the stars became its wooden fence; Religion, Profit, and Pleasure,\r\nunited together, became its Trivenu. The herbs and the creepers, decked\r\nwith flowers and fruits, became its bells. Making the Sun and the Moon\r\nequal, these were made the (other two) wheels of that foremost of cars.\r\nDay and Night were made its auspicious wings on the right and left. The\r\nten foremost of snakes having Dhritarashtra for their first, all\r\nexceedingly strong, formed the (other) shaft of that car. The Sky was\r\nmade its (other) yoke, and the clouds called Samvartaka and Valahaka were\r\nthe leathern strings of the yoke. The two Twilights and Dhritri and Medha\r\nand Sthiti and Sannati, and the firmament bespangled with planets and\r\nstars, were made the skins for covering that car. Those Regents of the\r\nworld, viz., the Lords of the gods, of the waters, of the dead, and of\r\ntreasures, were made the steeds of that car. Kalaprishtha, and Nahusha,\r\nand Karkotaka, and Dhananjaya and the other snakes became the chords for\r\nbinding the manes of the steeds. The cardinal and the subsidiary\r\ndirections became the reins of the steeds of that car. The Vedic sound\r\nVashat became the goad, and Gayatri became the string attached to that\r\ngoad. The four auspicious days were made the traces of the steeds, and\r\nthe pitris presiding over them were made the hooks and pins. Action and\r\ntruth and ascetic penances and profit were made the chords of that car.\r\nThe Mind became the ground upon which that car stood, and Speech the\r\ntracks upon which it was to proceed. Beautiful banners of various hues\r\nwaved in the air. With lightning and Indra's bow attached to it, that\r\nblazing car gave fierce light. That space of time which, on a former\r\noccasion, had, in the Sacrifice of the high-souled Ishana, been fixed as\r\na Year, became the bow, and the goddess Savitri became the loud-sounding\r\nbow-string. A celestial coat of mail was made, decked with costly gems,\r\nand impenetrable and effulgent, sprung from the wheel of Time. That\r\ngolden mountain, viz., the beautiful Meru, became the flagstaff, and the\r\nclouds decked with flashes of lightning became its banners. Thus\r\nequipped, that car shone brilliantly like a blazing fire in the midst of\r\nthe priests officiating at a sacrifice. Beholding that car properly\r\nequipped, the gods became filled with wonder. Seeing the energies of the\r\nentire universe united together in one place, O sire, the gods wondered,\r\nand at last represented unto that illustrious Deity that the car was\r\nready. After, O monarch, that best of cars had thus been constructed by\r\nthe gods, O tiger among men, for grinding their foes, Sankara placed upon\r\nit his own celestial weapons. Making the sky its flagstaff, he placed\r\nupon it his bovine bull. The Brahmana's rod, the rod of Death, Rudra's\r\nrod, and Fever became the protectors of the sides of that car and stood\r\nwith faces turned towards all sides. Atharvan and Angirasa became the\r\nprotectors of the car-wheels of that illustrious warrior. The Rigveda,\r\nthe Samaveda, and the Puranas stood in advance of that car. The histories\r\nand the Yajurveda became the protectors of the rear. All sacred Speeches\r\nand all the Sciences stood around it, and all hymns, O monarch, and the\r\nVedic sound of Vashat also. And the syllable Om, O king, standing in the\r\nvan of that car, made it exceedingly beautiful. Having made the Year\r\nadorned with the six seasons his bow, he made his own shadow the\r\nirrefragable string of that bow in that battle. The illustrious Rudra is\r\nDeath's self. The Year became his bow; Kala Ratri the Death-night\r\ntherefore, which is Rudra's shadow, became the indestructible string of\r\nthat bow. Vishnu and Agni and Soma became (as already said) the arrow.\r\nThe universe is said to consist of Agni and Soma. The universe is\r\nsimilarly said to consist of Vishnu. Vishnu is, again, the Soul of the\r\nholy Bhava of immeasurable energy. For this the touch of that bow-string\r\nbecame unbearable to the Asuras. And the lord Sankara cast on that arrow\r\nhis own irresistible and fierce wrath, the unbearable fire of anger,\r\nviz., that which was born of wrath of Bhrigu and Angirasa. Then He called\r\nNila Rohita (Blue and Red or smoke)--that terrible deity robed in\r\nskins,--looking like 10,000 Suns, and shrouded by the fire of\r\nsuperabundant Energy, blazed up with splendour. That discomfiter of even\r\nhim that is difficult of being discomfited, that victor, that slayer of\r\nall haters of Brahma, called also Hara, that rescuer of the righteous and\r\ndestroyer of the unrighteous, viz., the illustrious Sthanu, accompanied\r\nby many beings of terrible might and terrible forms that were endued with\r\nthe speed of the mind and capable of agitating and crushing all foes, as\r\nif with all the fourteen faculties of the soul awake about him, looked\r\nexceedingly resplendent. Having his limbs for their refuge, this entire\r\nuniverse of mobile and immobile creatures that were present there, O\r\nking, looked beautiful, presenting a highly wonderful appearance.\r\nBeholding that car, duly equipped, he cased himself in mail and armed\r\nhimself with the bow, and took up that celestial shaft born of Soma and\r\nVishnu and Agni. The gods, O king, then commanded that foremost of\r\ncelestials, viz., Wind, to breathe after that puissant Deity all the\r\nfragrance that he carries. Then Mahadeva, terrifying the very gods, and\r\nmaking the very Earth tremble, ascended that car resolutely. Then the\r\ngreat Rishis, the Gandharvas, those throngs of gods and those diverse\r\ntribes of Apsaras began to praise that Lord of the gods while he was\r\nabout to ascend that car. Adored by the regenerate Rishis, and praised by\r\nthe eulogists and diverse tribes of dancing Apsaras well-versed in the\r\nart of dancing, that boon-giving lord, armed with scimitar and arrow and\r\nbow, looked very beautiful. Smiling, he then asked the gods, 'Who will\r\nbecome my driver?' The gods answered him, saying, 'He whom thou wilt\r\nappoint, will, O Lord of the gods, without doubt, become thy driver!'\r\nUnto them the god replied, 'Reflecting yourselves, without delay make him\r\nmy driver who is superior to me!' Hearing these words uttered by that\r\nhigh-souled Deity, the gods repaired unto the Grandsire and inclining him\r\nto grace, said these words, 'We have accomplished everything, O holy one,\r\nthat thou hadst ordered us to do in the matter of afflicting the foes of\r\ncelestials. The Deity having the bull for his mark has been gratified\r\nwith us. A car hath been constructed by us, equipped with many wonderful\r\nweapons. We do not, however, know who is to become the driver of that\r\nforemost of cars. Therefore, let some foremost one among the gods be\r\nappointed as the driver. O holy one, it behoveth thee to make true those\r\nwords that thou, O lord, hadst then said to us. Before this, O god, thou\r\nhadst even said to us that thou wouldst do us good. It behoveth thee to\r\naccomplish that promise. That irresistible and best of cars, that router\r\nof our foes, hath been constructed out of the component parts of the\r\ncelestials. The Deity armed with Pinaka hath been made the warrior who is\r\nto stand on it. Striking the Danavas with fear, he is prepared for\r\nbattle. The four Vedas have become the four foremost of steeds. With her\r\nmountains, the Earth has become the car of that high-souled one. The\r\nstars have become the adornments of that vehicle. (As already said) Hara\r\nis the warrior. We do not, however, see who is to become the driver. A\r\ndriver should be sought for that car who is superior to all these. Equal\r\nto thee in importance is that car, O god, and Hara is the warrior.\r\nArmour, and weapons, and bow, these we have got already, O Grandsire.\r\nExcept thee, we do not behold any person that can make its driver. Thou\r\nart endued with every accomplishment. Thou, O lord, art superior to all\r\nthe gods. Mounting upon that car with speed, hold the reins of those\r\nforemost of steeds, for the victory of the celestials and the destruction\r\nof their foes.' It has been heard by us that bowing with their heads unto\r\nthe Grandsire that Lord of the three worlds, the gods sought to gratify\r\nhim for inducing him to accept the drivership.\r\n\r\n\"'\"The Grandsire said, 'There is nothing of untruth in all this that ye\r\nhave said, ye denizens of heaven. I will hold the reins of the steeds for\r\nKapaddin while he will be engaged in fight.' Then that illustrious god,\r\nthat Creator of the worlds, the Grandsire, was appointed by the gods as\r\nthe driver of the high-souled Ishana. And when he was about to ascend\r\nquickly upon that car worshipped by all, those steeds, endued with the\r\nspeed of the wind, bowed themselves with their heads to the Earth. Having\r\nascended the car the illustrious Deity, viz., the Grandsire resplendent\r\nwith his own energy, took the reins and the goad. Then the illustrious\r\ngod, raising those steeds addressed that foremost one among the gods,\r\nviz., Sthanu, saying, 'Ascend.' Then, taking that arrow composed of\r\nVishnu and Soma and Agni, Sthanu ascended the car, causing the foe to\r\ntremble by means of his bow. The great Rishis, the Gandharvas, the\r\nthrongs of gods, and the diverse tribes of Apsaras, then praised that\r\nLord of the gods after he had ascended the car. Resplendent with beauty,\r\nthe boon-giving Lord, armed with scimitar, shaft, and bow, stayed on the\r\ncar causing the three worlds to blaze forth with his own energy. The\r\ngreat Deity once more said unto the gods headed by Indra, 'Ye should\r\nnever grieve, doubting my ability to destroy the Asura. Know that the\r\nAsuras have already been slain by means of this arrow'. The gods then\r\nanswered, saying, 'It is true! The Asuras have already been slain.'\r\nIndeed, the gods thinking that the words which the divine Lord had said\r\ncould not be untrue, became exceedingly gratified. Then that Lord of the\r\ngods proceeded surrounded by all the gods, upon that large car, O king,\r\nwhich had nothing to compare with it. And the illustrious Deity was\r\nadored, all the while by the attendants that always wait upon him, and by\r\nothers that subsisted on meat, that were invincible in battle, and that\r\ndanced in joy on the present occasion, running wildly on all sides and\r\nshouting at one another, Rishis also, of great good fortune, possessed of\r\nascetic merit and endued with high qualities, as also the gods, wished\r\nfor Mahadeva's success. When that boon-giving Lord, that dispeller of the\r\nfears of the three worlds, thus proceeded, the entire universe, all the\r\ngods, O best of men, became exceedingly gratified. And the Rishis there\r\nadored the Lord of the gods with diverse hymns, and enhancing his energy,\r\nO king, took up their station there. And millions upon millions of\r\nGandharvas played upon diverse kinds of musical instruments at the hour\r\nof his setting out. When the boon-giving Brahman, having ascended the\r\ncar, set out for the Asuras, the Lord of the Universe, smiling the while,\r\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent! Proceed, O god, to the spot where the\r\nDaityas are. Urge the steeds wakefully. Behold today the might of arms\r\nwhile I slay the foe in battle.' Thus addressed, Brahman urged those\r\nsteeds endued with the fleetness of the wind or thought towards that spot\r\nwhere the triple city, O king, stood, protected by the Daityas and the\r\nDanavas. With those steeds worshipped by all the worlds, and which\r\ncoursed with such speed that they seemed to devour the skies, the\r\nillustrious god quickly proceeded for the victory of the denizens of\r\nheaven. Indeed, when Bhava, riding on the car, set out towards the triple\r\ncity, his bull uttered tremendous roars, filling all the points of the\r\ncompass. Hearing that loud and terrible roar of the bull, many of the\r\ndescendants and followers of Taraka, those enemies of the gods, breathed\r\ntheir last. Others amongst them stood facing the foe for battle. Then\r\nSthanu, O king, armed with trident became deprived of his senses in\r\nwrath. All creatures became frightened, and the three worlds began to\r\ntremble. Frightful portents appeared when he was on the point of aiming\r\nthat shaft. In consequence, however, of the pressure caused by the weight\r\nof Soma, Agni, and Vishnu that were in that shaft, as also of the\r\npressure caused by the weight of Brahman and Rudra and the latter's bow,\r\nthat car seemed to sink. Then Narayana, issuing out of the point of that\r\nshaft, assumed the form of a bull and raised that large car. During the\r\ntime the car had sunk and the foe had began to roar, the illustrious\r\nDeity, endued with great might began, from rage, to utter loud shouts,\r\nstanding, O giver of honours, on the head of his bull and the back of his\r\nsteeds. At that time the illustrious Rudra was employed in eyeing the\r\nDanava city. While in that posture, O best of men, Rudra cut off the\r\nteats of the horses and clove the hoofs of the bull. Blessed be thou,\r\nfrom the date the hoofs of all animals of the bovine species came to be\r\ncloven. And from that time, O king, horses, afflicted by the mighty Rudra\r\nof wonderful deeds, came to be without teats. Then Sarva, having stringed\r\nhis bow and aimed that shaft with which he had united the Pasupata\r\nweapon, waited thinking of the triple city. And O king, as Rudra thus\r\nstood, holding his bow, the three cities during that time became united.\r\nWhen the three cities, losing their separate characters became united,\r\ntumultuous became the joy of the high-souled gods. Then all the gods, the\r\nSiddhas, and the great Rishis, uttered the word Jaya, adoring Maheshwara.\r\nThe triple city then appeared immediately before that god of unbearable\r\nenergy, that Deity of fierce and indescribable form, that warrior who was\r\ndesirous of slaying the Asuras. The illustrious deity, that Lord of the\r\nuniverse, then drawing that celestial bow, sped that shaft which\r\nrepresented the might of the whole universe, at the triple city. Upon\r\nthat foremost of shafts, O thou of great good fortune, being shot, loud\r\nwails of woe were heard from those cities as they began to fall down\r\ntowards the Earth. Burning those Asuras, he threw them down into the\r\nWestern ocean. Thus was the triple city burnt and thus were the Danavas\r\nexterminated by Maheswara in wrath, from desire of doing good to the\r\nthree worlds. The fire born of his own wrath, the three-eyed god\r\nquenched, saying, 'Do not reduce the three worlds to ashes.' After this,\r\nthe gods, the Rishis, and the three worlds became all restored to their\r\nnatural dispositions, and gratified Sthanu of unrivalled energy with\r\nwords of high import. Receiving then the permission of the great god, the\r\ngods with the Creator at their head went away to the places they came\r\nfrom, their object being accomplished after such effort. Thus that\r\nillustrious Deity, that Creator of the worlds, that Lord of both the Gods\r\nand the Asuras, viz., Maheswara, did that which was for the good of all\r\nthe worlds. As the illustrious Brahman, the Creator of the worlds, the\r\nGrandsire, the Supreme Deity of unfading glory, acted as the driver of\r\nRudra, so do thou restrain the steeds of the high-souled son of Radha\r\nlike Grandsire restraining those of Rudra. There is not the slightest\r\ndoubt, O tiger among kings, that thou art superior to Krishna, to Karna,\r\nand to Phalguna. In battle, Karna is like Rudra, and thou art like\r\nBrahman in policy. United, ye two, therefore, are competent to vanquish\r\nmy foes that are even like the Asuras. Let, O Shalya, that be done\r\nspeedily today by which this Karna, grinding the Pandava troops, may be\r\nable to slay Kunti's son owning white steeds and having Krishna for the\r\ndriver of his car. Upon thee depend Karna, ourselves, our kingdom, and\r\n(our) victory in battle. Hold the reins, therefore, of the excellent\r\nsteeds (of Karna). There is another story which I will narrate. Listen\r\nonce more to it. A virtuous brahmana had recited it in the presence of my\r\nfather. Hearing these delightful words fraught with the reasons and\r\npurposes of acts, do, O Shalya, what thou mayst settle, without\r\nentertaining any scruples. In the race of the Bhrigus was Jamadagni of\r\nsevere ascetic penances. He had a son endued with energy and every\r\nvirtue, who became celebrated by the name of Rama. Practising the\r\nausterest penances, of cheerful soul, bound to observances and vows, and\r\nkeeping his senses under control, he gratified the god Bhava for\r\nobtaining weapons. In consequence of his devotion and tranquillity of\r\nheart. Mahadeva became gratified with him. Sankara, understanding the\r\ndesire cherished in his heart, showed himself unto Rama. And Mahadeva\r\nsaid, 'O Rama, I am gratified with thee. Blessed be thou, thy desire is\r\nknown to me. Make thy soul pure. Thou wilt then have all that thou\r\ndesirest. I will give thee all weapons when thou wilt become pure. Those\r\nweapons, O son, of Bhrigu, burn a person that is incompetent and that is\r\nnot deserving of them.' Thus addressed by that god of gods, that deity\r\nbearing the trident, the son of Jamadagni, bending his head unto that\r\npuissant high-souled one, said, 'O god of gods, it behoveth thee to give\r\nthose weapons unto me that am always devoted to thy service, when, indeed\r\nthou wilt regard me fit for holding them.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana continued. \"With penances then, and restraining his senses,\r\nand observances of vows, and worship and offerings and with sacrifices\r\nand Homa performed with mantras, Rama adored Sarva for many long years.\r\nAt last Mahadeva, pleased with the high-souled son of Bhrigu's race,\r\ndescribed him, in the presence of his divine spouse, as possessed of many\r\nvirtues: 'This Rama, of firm vows is ever devoted to me.' Gratified with\r\nhim, the Lord Sankara thus repeatedly proclaimed his virtues in the\r\npresence of gods and the Rishis, O slayer of foes. Meanwhile, the Daityas\r\nbecame very mighty. Blinded by pride and folly, they afflicted the\r\ndenizens of heaven. The gods then, uniting together, and firmly resolved\r\nto slay them, strove earnestly for the destruction of those foes. They,\r\nhowever, failed to vanquish them. The gods then, repairing to Maheswara,\r\nthe Lord of Uma, began to gratify him with devotion, saying, 'Slay our\r\nfoes.' That god, having promised the destruction of their foes unto the\r\ncelestials, summoned Rama the descendant of Bhrigu. And Sankara addressed\r\nRama, saying, 'O descendant of Bhrigu, slay all the assembled foes of the\r\ngods, from desire of doing good unto all the worlds as also for my\r\nsatisfaction.' Thus addressed, Rama replied unto that boon-giving Lord of\r\nThree-eyes, saying, 'What strength have I, O chief of the gods destitute\r\nas I am of weapons, to slay in battle the assembled Danavas that are\r\naccomplished in weapons and invincible in fight? Maheswara said, 'Go thou\r\nat my command. Thou shalt slay those foes. Having vanquished all those\r\nenemies, thou shalt acquire numerous merits.' Hearing these words and\r\naccepting them all, Rama, causing propitiatory rites to be performed for\r\nhis success, proceeded against the Danavas. Addressing those enemies of\r\nthe gods that were endued with might and possessed with folly and pride,\r\nhe said, 'Ye Daityas that are fierce in battle, give me battle. I have\r\nbeen sent by the God of gods to vanquish you.' Thus addressed by the\r\ndescendant of Bhrigu, the Daityas began to fight. The delighter of the\r\nBhargavas, however, slaying the Daityas in battle, with strokes whose\r\ntouch resembled that of Indra's thunder, came back to Mahadeva.\r\nJamadagni's son, that foremost of brahmanas returned with many wounds on\r\nhis person inflicted by the Danavas. Touched, however by Sthanu, his\r\nwounds were immediately healed. Gratified also with that feat of his, the\r\nillustrious god gave diverse kinds of boons unto the high-souled son of\r\nBhrigu. With satisfaction in his heart, the trident-wielding God of gods\r\nsaid, 'The pain thou hast suffered in consequence of the fall of weapons\r\nupon thy body evidences the super-human feat that thou hast achieved, O\r\ndelighter of the Bhrigus. As desired by thee, accept from me these\r\ncelestial weapons.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana continued, \"Having obtained all the celestial weapons and\r\nthe boons that had been desired by him, Rama bowed unto Siva with his\r\nhead. Obtaining the leave also of the gods that great ascetic went away.\r\nThis is the old story that the rishi had recited. The descendant of\r\nBhrigu gave the whole science of weapons unto the high-souled Karna, O\r\ntiger among kings with delighted heart. If Karna had any fault, O lord of\r\nEarth, the delighter of Bhrigu's race would never have given him his\r\ncelestial weapons. I do not think that Karna could have been born in the\r\nSuta order. I think him to be the son of a god, born in the kshatriya\r\norder. I think that he was abandoned (in infancy) in order that the race\r\nin which he was born might be ascertained (by his features and feats). By\r\nno means, O Shalya, could this Karna have been born in the Suta order.\r\nWith his (natural) earring and (natural) coat of mail, this mighty\r\ncar-warrior of long arms, resembling Surya himself, could not be borne by\r\na common woman even as a she-deer can never bear a tiger. His arms are\r\nmassive, each resembling the trunk of a prince of elephants. Behold his\r\nchest that is so broad and capable of resisting every foe. Karna\r\notherwise called Vaikartana, O king, cannot be an ordinary person. Endued\r\nwith great valour, this disciple of Rama, O king of kings, is a\r\nhigh-souled personage.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"Even thus did that illustrious Deity, that Grandsire\r\nof all the worlds, viz., Brahman, act as driver on that occasion and even\r\nthus did Rudra become the warrior. The driver of the car, O hero, should\r\nbe superior to the warrior on it. Therefore, O tiger among men, do thou\r\nhold the reins of the steeds in this battle. As on that occasion the\r\nGrandsire had been selected with care by all the celestials, indeed, O\r\ngreat king, as one greater than Sankara, so thou that art superior to\r\nKarna art now selected by us with care. Like the Grandsire holding the\r\nreins of Rudra's steeds, do thou hold, without delay, the reins of\r\nKarna's steeds in battle, O thou of great splendour.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"O foremost of men, many a time have I heard this\r\nexcellent and celestial history, recited to me, of those two lions among\r\ngods. Indeed, I have heard how the Grandsire acted as the driver of Bhava\r\nand how the Asuras also, O Bharata, were all destroyed with one shaft.\r\nKrishna also had knowledge of all this before, the knowledge, viz., of\r\nhow the illustrious Grandsire had become the driver on that occasion of\r\nyore. Indeed, Krishna knoweth the past and the future with all their\r\ndetails. Knowing this fact, he became the driver, O Bharata, of Partha\r\nlike the Self-create becoming the driver of Rudra. If the Suta's son, by\r\nsome means, succeeds in slaying the son of Kunti, Keshava, beholding\r\nPartha slain, will fight himself. That bearer of the conch, the discus,\r\nand the mace, will then consume thy army. There is no king here that will\r\nstay in the ranks in front of that illustrious one of Vrishni's race when\r\nhe will be excited with wrath.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Unto the ruler of the Madras who was speaking in that\r\nstrain, that chastiser of foes, viz., thy mighty-armed son of cheerful\r\nsoul replied, saying, \"Do not, O mighty-armed one, think disparagingly of\r\nKarna, otherwise called Vaikartana, in battle,--that warrior who is the\r\nforemost of all wielders of arms and who is acquainted with the meaning\r\nof the whole body of our scriptures. Hearing the terrible and loud twang\r\nof his bow and the sound of his palms, the Pandava troops fly away on all\r\nsides. Thou hast witnessed it with thy own eyes, O mighty-armed one, how\r\nGhatotkaca, screened by his illusions and displaying hundreds of still\r\nslain that night (by Karna). Feeling a great fear all these days Vibhatsu\r\ncould never stand, fronting Karna. The mighty Bhimasena also, moved\r\nhither and thither by the horn of Karna's bow, was, O king, addressed in\r\nvery harsh words such as 'Fool' and 'Glutton.' The two brave sons of\r\nMadri also were defeated by Karna in great battle, though, from some\r\nobject he had in view, he did not, O sire, slay them then. That foremost\r\none of Vrishni's race, viz., the heroic Satyaki, the chief of the Satwata\r\nclan, was vanquished by Karna and made carless. Others, such as all the\r\nSrinjayas headed by Dhrishtadyumna, have been repeatedly defeated in\r\nbattle by Karna the great car-warrior who has achieved all these feats\r\nand who excited with wrath, is competent to slay Purandara himself armed\r\nwith the thunderbolt in fight. Thyself also, O hero, art acquainted with\r\nevery weapon. Thou art, again, the master of all branches of learning.\r\nThere is none on Earth who is thy equal in might of arms. Irresistible in\r\nprowess, thou art like a dart (Shalya) unto thy enemies. It is for this,\r\nO king, that thou O slayer of foes, art called 'Shalya.' Encountering the\r\nmight of thy arms, all the Satwatas were unable to get the better of it.\r\nIs Krishna superior to thee in might of arms, O king? Indeed, as Krishna\r\nis to bear the burthen of the Pandava troops upon the slaughter of\r\nPartha, even so art thou to bear the burthen of this vast (Kaurava) force\r\nif Karna lays down his life. Why should he be able to resist my troops\r\nand why shouldst not thou be able to slay the hostile troops, O sire? For\r\nthy sake, O sire, I would willingly follow the footsteps of my (slain)\r\nbrothers and the other heroic kings of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"O son of Gandhari, when thou, O giver of honours,\r\ndescribest me before thy troops to be superior to the son of Devaki, I am\r\nexceedingly gratified with thee. I accept the drivership of the\r\ncelebrated son of Radha when he will fight with that foremost of the sons\r\nof Pandu, as thou desirest. I have, however, O hero, a compact to make\r\nwith Vaikartana, and that is this: I will utter whatever words I may\r\nwish, in this one's presence.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thy son then, O king, with Karna, O sire, answered\r\nthe ruler of the Madras, saying, \"Let it be so\" in the presence of all\r\nthe kshatriyas. Assured by Shalya's acceptance of the drivership,\r\nDuryodhana, filled with joy, embraced Karna. Eulogised (by bards and\r\npanegyrists around), thy son then once more addressed Karna, saying,\r\n\"Slay all the Parthas in battle, like the great Indra slaying the\r\nDanavas.\" Shalya having accepted the office of holding the reins of his\r\nsteeds, Karna, with a cheerful heart, once more addressed Duryodhana,\r\nsaying, \"The ruler of the Madras does not say very cheerfully what he\r\nsays. O king, solicit him once more in sweet words.\" Thus addressed, the\r\nmighty king Duryodhana, possessed of great wisdom and accomplished in\r\neverything, once more spoke unto that lord of Earth, viz., Shalya, the\r\nruler of Madras, in a voice deep as that of the clouds and filling the\r\nwhole region there with the sound of that voice: \"O Shalya, Karna thinks\r\nthat he should fight with Arjuna today. O tiger among men hold the reins\r\nof Karna's steeds in battle. Having slain all the other warriors Karna\r\ndesires to slay Phalguna. I solicit thee, O king, repeatedly, in the\r\nmatter of holding the reins of his steeds. As Krishna, that foremost of\r\nall drivers, is the counsellor of Partha, even so do thou protect the son\r\nof Radha today from every danger.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Embracing thy son then, Shalya the ruler of the\r\nMadras, joyfully answered that slayer of foes, viz., Duryodhana, saying,\r\n\"If this is what is thou thinkest, O royal son of Gandhari, O thou of\r\nhandsome features, I shall, for that, accomplish everything that may be\r\nagreeable to thee. O chief of the Bharatas, for whatever acts I may be\r\nfit, employing myself therein with my whole heart, I will bear the\r\nburthen of those acts of thine. Let Karna, however, and thyself pardon me\r\nall those words, agreeable or disagreeable, that I may speak unto Karna\r\nfrom desire of his good.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"O ruler of the Madras, be thou ever engaged in our good as\r\nBrahman in that of Ishana, as Keshava in that of Partha.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"These four kinds of conduct--self-rebuke and self-praise,\r\nspeaking ill of others, and adulation of others, are never practised by\r\nthose that are respectable. That, however, O learned one, which I shall\r\nsay, for inspiring thy confidence is fraught with self-adulation. For all\r\nthat, listen to it duly. O puissant one, like Matali himself, I am fit to\r\nact as the driver of even Indra in watchfulness, in managing the steeds,\r\nin knowledge of coming danger and of the means of avoiding it, and in\r\ncompetence to avoid it in practice. When thou wilt be engaged in battle\r\nwith Partha, I will hold the reins of thy steeds. Let thy anxiety be\r\ndispelled, O Suta's son.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"This one, O Karna, will act as thy driver, this ruler\r\nof the Madras, who is superior to Krishna, like Matali the driver of the\r\nchief of the celestials. Indeed, as Matali taketh the management of the\r\ncar unto which the steeds of Indra are attached, even so will Shalya be\r\nthe driver of the steeds of thy car today. With thyself as warrior on\r\nthat vehicle and the ruler of the Madras as its driver, that foremost of\r\ncar will certainly vanquish the Parthas in battle.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'When the morning came, O monarch, Duryodhana once\r\nmore addressed the ruler of the Madras endued with great activity,\r\nsaying, \"O ruler of the Madras, hold the reins in battle of Karna's\r\nforemost of steeds. Protected by thee, the son of Radha will vanquish\r\nDhananjaya.\" Thus addressed, Shalya, answering, \"So be it\" ascended the\r\ncar, O Bharata. When Shalya approached that car, Karna with a cheerful\r\nheart addressed his driver, saying, \"O charioteer, quickly equip the car\r\nfor me.\" Having duly equipped that triumphal car, the foremost of its\r\nkind, which resembled the vapoury mansions in the sky, Shalya presented\r\nit to Karna, saying, \"Blessed be thou, victory to thee.\" Then Karna, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, duly worshipping that car which had in days of\r\nold been sanctified by a priest conversant with Brahma, and\r\ncircumambulating it and carefully adoring the god Surya addressed the\r\nruler of the Madras standing near, saying, \"Ascend the vehicle.\"\r\nThereupon Shalya of mighty energy ascended that large, invincible, and\r\nforemost of cars, belonging to Karna like a lion ascending a mountain\r\nsummit. Beholding Shalya stationed, Karna ascended his excellent car like\r\nthe Sun riding on a mass of clouds charged with lightning. Mounted on the\r\nsame car, those two heroes endued with the splendour or the Sun of fire\r\nlooked resplendent like Surya and Agni sitting together on a cloud in the\r\nfirmament. Eulogised then (by bards and panegyrists), those two heroes of\r\ngreat effulgence looked like Indra and Agni adored with hymns in a\r\nsacrifice by Ritwiks and Sadasyas. Karna stood on that car, the reins of\r\nwhose steeds were held by Shalya, stretching his formidable bow, like the\r\nSun himself within a halo of circular light. Stationed on that foremost\r\nof cars, that tiger among men, Karna, with his shafts constituting his\r\nrays, looked beautiful like the Sun on the Mandara mountains. Unto the\r\nmighty-armed son of Radha that warrior of immeasurable energy, stationed\r\non his car for battle. Duryodhana said these words, \"O son of Adhiratha,\r\nO hero, do thou achieve that feat difficult of accomplishment which Drona\r\nand Bhishma have not achieved in the very sight of all the bowmen. I had\r\nalways believed that those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhishma and\r\nDrona, would without doubt slay Arjuna and Bhimasena in battle. Like a\r\nsecond wielder of the thunderbolt, O son of Radha, do thou in great\r\nbattle achieve that feat worthy of a hero which was not achieved by those\r\ntwo. Either seize king Yudhishthira the just or slay Dhananjaya and\r\nBhimasena, O son of Radha, and the twin sons of Madri. Blessed be thou,\r\nlet victory be thine. Set out for battle, O tiger among men. Reduce to\r\nashes all the troops of Pandu's son.\" Then thousands of trumpets and tens\r\nof thousands of drums, sounded together, produced a noise like that of\r\nthe clouds in the welkin. Accepting those words (of Duryodhana), the\r\nforemost of car-warriors stationed on his car, viz., the son of Radha,\r\naddressed Shalya, that warrior accomplished in battle, saying, \"Urge the\r\nsteeds, O mighty-armed one, so that I may slay Dhananjaya and Bhimasena\r\nand both the twins and king Yudhishthira. O Shalya, let Dhananjaya behold\r\ntoday the might of my arms, when I will be engaged in shooting shafts\r\nwinged with Kanka feathers in hundreds and thousands. Today, O Shalya, I\r\nwill shoot shafts with great energy for the destruction of the Pandavas\r\nand the victory of Duryodhana.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"Shalya said, \"O Suta's son, why dost thou think so low of the sons of\r\nPandu, all of whom are endued with great might, all of whom are great\r\nbowmen, and all of whom are acquainted with every weapon? They are\r\nunretreating, of great good fortune, invincible, and of prowess incapable\r\nof being baffled. They are capable of inspiring fear in the heart of\r\nIndra himself. When, son of Radha thou wilt hear the twang of Gandiva in\r\nbattle, resembling the peal of the thunder itself, thou wilt not then\r\nutter such speeches. When thou wilt behold Dharma's son and the twins\r\ncausing a canopy, like that of the clouds in the welkin, with their sharp\r\narrows, and the other invincible kings (of the Pandava army), endued with\r\ngreat lightness of hands and shooting (showers of shafts) and weakening\r\ntheir foes, then thou wilt not utter such words.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Disregarding those words spoken by the ruler of the\r\nMadras, Karna addressing him endued with great activity, saying,\r\n\"Proceed.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the mighty Karna take up his station from\r\ndesire of battle, the Kauravas, filled with delight, uttered loud shouts\r\nfrom every side. With the beat of cymbals and the sound of drums, with\r\nthe whizz of diverse kinds of arrows and the roars of combatants endued\r\nwith great activity, all thy troops proceeded to battle, making death\r\nonly the point at which to stop. When Karna set out and the warriors of\r\nthe Kuru army were filled with joy, the Earth, O king, trembled and made\r\na loud noise. The seven great planets including the Sun seemed to proceed\r\nagainst one another (for combat). Meteoric showers became noticeable and\r\nall the quarters seemed ablaze. Thunders fell from a cloudless sky, and\r\nfierce winds began to blow. Animals and birds in larger numbers kept thy\r\narmy to their right, foreboding great calamities. After Karna had set\r\nout, his steeds tumbled down on the Earth. A frightful shower of bones\r\nfell from the sky. The weapons (of the Kuru warriors) seemed to be\r\nablaze; their standards trembled; and their animals, O monarch, shed\r\ncopious tears. These and many other terrible and awful portents appeared\r\nfor the destruction of the Kurus. Stupefied by destiny, none of them\r\nregarded those portents at all. Beholding the Suta's son setting out, all\r\nthe rulers of men (in the Kaurava army) cried victory to him. The\r\nKauravas regarded the Pandavas to have been already vanquished. That\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, that foremost of car-warriors, viz.,\r\nVaikartana, as he stayed on his car recollecting the death of Bhishma and\r\nDrona, blazed up with splendour like the Sun or fire. Reflecting on the\r\nmighty feats of Partha, and burning with self-conceit and pride, and\r\nblazing with wrath and breathing long and hard, he addressed Shalya and\r\nsaid these words: \"When stationed on my car and armed with my bow, I\r\nwould not take fright at Indra himself armed with the thunder and excited\r\nwith wrath. Beholding those great heroes headed by Bhishma lying on the\r\nfield of battle, do not feel any anxiety. Seeing even the faultless\r\nBhishma and Drona, equal unto Indra and Vishnu, those crushers of\r\nforemost of cars and steeds and elephants, those heroes that were\r\nunslayable, slain by the foe, I do not still experience any fear in this\r\nbattle. Acquainted with mighty weapons, and himself the foremost of\r\nbrahmanas, why, indeed, did not the preceptor slay in battle all foes,\r\nseeing them destroy the mightiest of our kings with their drivers and\r\nelephants and cars? Remembering that Drona in great battle, I tell you\r\ntruly, listen to me, ye Kurus, there is none amongst you, save myself,\r\nthat is competent to bear the advancing Arjuna, that warrior who\r\nresembles Death himself in his fiercest form. In Drona were the skills\r\nattendant on practice, and might, and bravery, and the highest of weapons\r\nand policy. When even that high-souled one had to succumb to Death, I\r\nregard all the others (of our army), strengthless and on the point of\r\ndeath. In this world I do not find anything, even on reflection, to be\r\nstable, in consequence of the inevitable connection of acts. When the\r\npreceptor himself is dead, who then will indulge in the certain belief\r\nthat he will live till even today's sun-rise? When the preceptor was thus\r\nslain by the enemy in battle, without doubt weapons, ordinary and\r\ncelestial, and might and prowess, and achievements and wise policy, are\r\nnot able to compass the happiness of man. In energy Drona was equal to\r\nfire or the Sun, in prowess he resembled Vishnu or Purandara; in policy\r\nhe was equal to Brihaspati or Usana; irresistible as he was, weapons\r\ncould not yet protect him. When (our) women and children are weeping and\r\nuttering loud wails, when the valour of the Dhartarashtras has been\r\ndefeated, I know it, O Shalya, that it is I who am to fight. Proceed\r\ntherefore, against the army of our enemies. Who else, save myself, will\r\nbe able to bear those troops amongst whom are stationed the royal son of\r\nPandu firm in truth, and Bhimasena and Arjuna, and Satyaki, and the\r\ntwins? Therefore, O ruler of the Madras, proceed quickly, in this battle,\r\ntowards the Pancalas, the Pandavas, and the Srinjayas. Encountering them\r\nin battle, either I will slay them, or myself to Yama's presence by the\r\npath taken by Drona. Do not think, O Shalya, that I will not go into the\r\nvery midst of those heroes. These intestine dissensions cannot be\r\ntolerated by me. (Without seeking to tolerate them) I will even follow in\r\nthe wake of Drona. Wise or ignorant, when his period is run out,\r\neverybody is equally regarded by the Destroyer; no one can escape, O\r\nlearned one, for this, I will proceed against the Parthas. I am unable to\r\ntransgress my destiny. The son of Vichitravirya's son is, O king, always\r\nengaged in doing me good. For the accomplishment of his purpose, I will\r\ncast away my life-breaths that are so dear, and this body that is so\r\ndifficult of being cast away. This foremost of cars covered with\r\ntigerskins, with axle producing no sound equipped with a golden seat\r\nendued with trivenu made of silver, and unto which are yoked these\r\nforemost of steeds, Rama gave unto me. Behold, also, O Shalya, these\r\nbeautiful bows, these standards, these maces, these shafts of fierce\r\nforms, this blazing sword, this mighty weapon, this white conch of fierce\r\nand loud blare. Riding upon this car decked with banners, its wheels\r\nproducing a rattle deep as that of the thunder, having white steeds yoked\r\nunto it, and adorned with excellent quivers, I will, putting forth my\r\nmight, slay in battle that bull among car-warriors, Arjuna. If Death\r\nhimself, that universal consumer, were to protect with vigilance the son\r\nof Pandu in battle, I would still encounter him in fight and either slay\r\nhim or myself go to Yama's presence following Bhishma. If Yama, Varuna,\r\nKuvera, and Vasava, with all their followers coming hither, unitedly\r\nprotect the son of Pandu in this great battle, what need of many words, I\r\nwill still vanquish him with them.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of the bragging Karna who was\r\nexceedingly delighted with the prospect of battle, the valiant king of\r\nthe Madras, deriding him, laughed aloud, and gave him the following reply\r\nfor checking him.\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Forbear, forbear, O Karna, from such bragging. Thou art\r\nin transports of delight and sayest what thou shouldst never say. Where\r\nis Dhananjaya, that foremost of men, and where again, art thou, O lowest\r\nof men? Who else, save Arjuna, could take away the younger sister of\r\n(Keshava) that foremost of all persons, having forcibly agitated the home\r\nof the Yadus that was protected by the younger brother of Indra and that\r\nresembled heaven itself that is guarded by the chief of celestials? What\r\nman save Arjuna who is endued with prowess that is equal to the prowess\r\nof the chief of the celestials, could on the occasion of the dispute\r\ncaused by the slaughter of an animal, summon Bhava the Lord of Lords, the\r\nCreator of the worlds, to battle? For the sake of honouring Agni, Jaya\r\nhad vanquished asuras and gods and great snakes and men and birds and\r\npishacas and yakshas and rakshasas with his shafts and gave unto that god\r\nthe food he had desired. Dost thou remember, O Karna, the occasion when,\r\nslaughtering those foes in large numbers with his excellent shafts endued\r\nwith the effulgence of the Sun, Phalguna liberated Dhritarashtra's son\r\nhimself among the Kurus? Dost thou remember the occasion when, thyself\r\nhaving been the first to fly away, the quarrelsome sons of Dhritarashtra\r\nwere liberated by the Pandavas after the latter had defeated those\r\nrangers of the skies (the gandharvas headed by Citraratha)? On the\r\noccasion also of the seizure of (Virata's) kine, the Kauravas, swelling\r\nwith numbers in respect of both men and animals, and having the preceptor\r\nand the preceptor's son and Bhishma amongst them, were vanquished by that\r\nforemost of men. Why, O son of Suta, didst thou not vanquish Arjuna then?\r\nFor thy destruction another excellent battle has now presented itself. If\r\nthou dost not fly away from fear of thy enemy, know O Suta's son, that as\r\nsoon as thou goest to battle thou wilt be slain.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'When the ruler of the Madras was most heartily\r\nengaged in addressing these harsh speeches to Karna and uttering these\r\npraises of the latter's foe, that scorcher of foes, viz., the commander\r\nof the Kuru army, excited with rage, said these words unto the Madra king.\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"Let it be so, let it be so. Why, however, dost thou\r\nindulge in Arjuna's praises? A battle is about to ensue between myself\r\nand him. If he vanquishes me in fight, then will these thy praises be\r\nregarded as well-uttered.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'The ruler of the Madras said, \"Let it be so,\" and\r\ngave no reply. When Karna, from desire of fight, addressed Shalya,\r\nsaying, \"Proceed,\" then that great carwarrior, having white steeds yoked\r\nunto his vehicle and owning Shalya as his charioteer, proceeded against\r\nhis foes, slaying large numbers in battle along his way, like the Sun\r\ndestroying the darkness. Indeed, on that car covered with tiger-skins and\r\nhaving white steeds yoked unto it, Karna proceeded with a cheerful heart,\r\nand beholding the army of the Pandavas, speedily enquired after\r\nDhananjaya.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said 'After Karna, gladdening thy army, had set out for battle,\r\nhe spoke unto every Pandava soldier that he met with, even these words:\r\n\"Unto him that will today point out the high-souled Dhananjaya of white\r\nsteeds to me, I will give whatever wealth he desires. If having got it he\r\ndoes not become satisfied, I shall in addition, give him,--him that is,\r\nthat will discover Arjuna to me, a cart-load of jewels and gems. If that\r\ndoes not satisfy the person who discovers Arjuna to me, I will give him a\r\ncentury of kine with as many vessels of brass for milking those animals.\r\nI will give a hundred foremost of villages unto the person that discovers\r\nArjuna to me. I will also give him that shows Arjuna to me a number of\r\nlong-tressed damsels of black eyes and a car unto which shall be yoked\r\nwhite mules. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers Arjuna to\r\nme, I shall give him another foremost of cars, made of gold, and having\r\nsix bulls yoked unto it that shall be as large as elephants. I shall also\r\ngive unto him a hundred damsels decked with ornaments, with collars of\r\ngold, fair-complexioned and accomplished in singing and dancing. If that\r\ndoes not satisfy the person that discovers Arjuna to me, I shall give him\r\na 100 elephants, a 100 villages and a 100 cars, and 10,000 steeds of the\r\nforemost of breed, fat, docile, endued with many excellent qualities,\r\ncapable of dragging cars and well-trained. I shall also give to the\r\nperson that discovers Arjuna to me four hundred kine, each with golden\r\nhorns and her calf. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers\r\nArjuna to me, I shall make him a more valuable gift, viz., five hundred\r\nsteeds, adorned with trappings of gold and decked with jewelled\r\nornaments. I shall also give eighteen other steeds of great docility. I\r\nshall also give the person that discovers Arjuna to me a bright car made\r\nof gold and adorned with diverse ornaments and having foremost of Kamboja\r\nsteeds yoked unto it. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers\r\nArjuna to me, I shall make him a more valuable gift, viz., six hundred\r\nelephants, with chains of gold around their necks, and covered with\r\nhousings of gold, born in the western shores of the ocean, and trained by\r\nelephant trainers. If that does not satisfy the person that discovers\r\nArjuna to me, I shall make him a more valuable gift, viz., fourteen\r\nVaishya villages, teeming with people, full of wealth, situated in the\r\nproximity of forests and rivers, free from all sorts of danger, well\r\nfurnished (with other necessaries), and worthy of being enjoyed by kings.\r\nTo him that will discover Dhananjaya to me, I shall also give a hundred\r\nfemale slaves, with golden collars, belonging to the country of the\r\nMagadhas, and of very youthful age. If that does not satisfy the person\r\nthat discovers Arjuna to me, I will make him a more valuable gift, that,\r\nindeed, which he himself will solicit. Sons, wives and articles of\r\npleasure and enjoyment that I have, these all I shall give him if he\r\ndesires them. Indeed, unto him who discovers Keshava and Arjuna to me, I\r\nshall, after slaying those two, give all the wealth that may be left by\r\nthem.\" Having uttered those diverse speeches in that battle, Karna blew\r\nhis excellent conch, sea-born and producing a sweet blare. Hearing these\r\nwords of Suta's son that were suitable to his disposition, Duryodhana, O\r\nking, with all his followers became filled with joy. At that juncture the\r\nbeat of cymbals and drums and leonine shouts, and grunts of elephants\r\nwith the sounds of diverse musical instruments, arose there, O king,\r\namong the (Kaurava) troops, O bull among men. The shouts also of warriors\r\nfilled with joy arose there. When the (Kaurava) troops were thus filled\r\nwith joy, the ruler of the Madras, laughing in scorn, said these words\r\nunto that grinder of foes, viz., the son of Radha, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior who was about to plunge into that ocean of battle and who was\r\nindulging in such vain bragging.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Do not, O Suta's son, give away to any man a golden car\r\nwith six bulls of elephantine proportions. Thou wilt obtain a sight of\r\nDhananjaya today. From foolishness thou art giving away wealth as if thou\r\nwert the Lord of treasures. Without any trouble, however, O son of Radha,\r\nthou wilt behold Dhananjaya today. Thou art for giving away this wealth\r\nlike a senseless person; but thou seest not the demerits attaching to\r\nthose gifts that are made to undeserving persons. With that large wealth\r\nwhich thou art desirous of giving away, thou art certainly able to\r\nperform many sacrifices. Therefore, O Suta's son, do thou perform those\r\nsacrifices. As regards thy desire, entertained from folly, that is surely\r\nvain. We have never heard of a couple of lions having been overthrown by\r\na fox. Thou seekest what should never be sought by thee. It seems that\r\nthou hast no friends for forbidding thee that art speedily falling into a\r\nblazing fire. Thou art unable to discriminate between what thou shouldst\r\ndo and what thou shouldst not. Without doubt thy period is full. What man\r\ndesirous of living would utter speeches that are so incoherent and\r\nundeserving of being listened to? This thy endeavour is like that of a\r\nperson desirous of crossing the ocean by the aid of only his two arms\r\nafter having attached to his neck a heavy stone, or of one desirous of\r\nleaping down from the summit of a mountain. If thou art desirous of\r\nwinning what is for thy good, fight with Dhananjaya, well protected from\r\nwithin thy arrayed division, and aided by all thy warriors. I say this to\r\nthee for the good of Dhritarashtra's son and not from any ill will to\r\nthee. If thou hast any wish for preserving thy life then accept the words\r\nspoken by me.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"Relying on the might of my own arms I seek Arjuna in\r\nbattle. Thou, however, that art a foe with the face of a friend desirest\r\nto frighten me. No person shall deter me from this resolution, not even\r\nIndra himself uplifting his thunder; what then need be said of a mortal?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'At the conclusion of these words of Karna, Shalya,\r\nthe ruler of the Madras, desirous of provoking Karna exceedingly, said\r\nthese words in reply, \"When keen-pointed shafts winged with Kanka\r\nfeathers, shot by Phalguna of mighty arms and impelled from his\r\nbow-string and sped with all his energy will seek thee then wilt thou\r\nlament thy encounter with that hero. When Partha, called also Savyasaci,\r\ntaking up his celestial bow, will scorch the (Kuru) army and afflict thee\r\nexceedingly with keen shafts, then, O Suta's son, wilt thou repent (of\r\nthy folly). As a child lying on the lap of its mother seeks to seize the\r\nMoon, even so dost thou from folly seek to vanquish the resplendent\r\nArjuna stationed on his car. In desiring, O Karna, to fight today with\r\nArjuna of keen-edged feats, thou art for rubbing all thy limbs against\r\nthe keen edges of a trident. This thy challenge of Arjuna, O Suta's son,\r\nis like that of a foolish young little deer of activity challenging a\r\nhuge lion excited with wrath. Do not, O Suta's son, challenge that prince\r\nof mighty energy like a fox gratified with meat in the forest challenging\r\nthe maned monarch of the forest. Do not be destroyed, encountering\r\nArjuna. Thou, O Karna, challengest Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, even\r\nlike a hare challenging a mighty elephant with tusks large as\r\nplough-shafts, and with the juice issuing out of its mouth and rent\r\ncheeks. From folly thou art piercing, with a piece of wood, the black\r\ncobra of virulent poison excited to fury within its hole, in desiring to\r\nfight with Partha. Endued with little understanding, thou, O Karna,\r\ndisregarding that lion among men, viz., the son of Pandu, yellest at him,\r\nlike a jackal that, disregarding a maned lion excited with wrath, yells\r\nat him. As a snake, for its own destruction, challenges that foremost of\r\nbirds, viz., Vinata's son, possessed of beautiful plumage and great\r\nactivity, even so dost thou, O Karna, challenge Dhananjaya the son of\r\nPandu. Thou desirest to cross without a raft the terrible ocean, the\r\nreceptacle of all the waters, with its mountain waves and teeming with\r\naquatic animals, when at its height at the rise of the Moon. O Karna,\r\nthou challengest Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, to battle even like a\r\ncalf challenging a smiting bull of keen horns and neck thick as a drum.\r\nLike a frog croaking at a terrible and mighty cloud yielding copious\r\nshowers of rain, thou croakest at Arjuna who is even like Parjanya among\r\nmen. As a dog from within the precincts of the house of his master barks\r\nat a forest-roaming tiger, even so, O Karna, thou barkest at Dhananjaya,\r\nthat tiger among men. A jackal, O Karna, residing in the forest in the\r\nmidst of hares regardeth himself a lion till he actually sees a lion.\r\nEven so, O son of Radha, thou regardest thyself a lion, for thou dost not\r\nbehold that repressor of foes, that tiger among men, viz., Dhananjaya.\r\nThou regardest thyself a lion till thou beholdest the two Krishnas\r\nstationed on the same car like Surya and Candramas. As long as thou dost\r\nnot hear the twang of Gandiva in great battle, so long art thou able to\r\ndo what thou pleasest. Beholding Partha, causing the ten points of the\r\ncompass to resound with the roar of his car and the twang of his bow, and\r\nbeholding him roaring like a tiger, thou wilt become a jackal. Thou art\r\nalways a jackal, and Dhananjaya always a lion. O fool, in consequence of\r\nthy envy and hatred for heroes, thou always, seemest to be like a jackal.\r\nAs a mouse and a car are to each other in strength, or a dog and a tiger,\r\na fox and a lion, or a hare and an elephant, as falsehood and truth, as\r\npoison and nectar, even so art thou and Partha known to all by your\r\nrespective deeds.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thus rebuked by Shalya of immeasurable energy, the son of\r\nRadha, feeling the propriety of his rebuker's name in consequence of his\r\nwordy darts, and becoming filled with rage, answered him thus:\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"The merits of meritorious men, O Shalya, are known to them\r\nthat are themselves meritorious but not to them that are destitute of\r\nmerit. Thou, however, art destitute of every merit. How then canst thou\r\njudge of merit and demerit? The mighty weapons of Arjuna, his wrath, his\r\nenergy, his bow, his shafts and the prowess also of that high-souled hero\r\nare, O Shalya, well known to me. So also, O Shalya, thou dost not know,\r\nso as well as I myself, the greatness of Krishna, that bull among the\r\nlords of Earth. But knowing my own energy as also that of Pandu's son, I\r\nchallenge him to battle, O Shalya, I do not act like an insect in respect\r\nof a blazing fire. I have this shaft, O Shalya, of keen mouth,\r\nblood-drinking, lying alone within one quiver, equipped with wings,\r\nwell-steeped in oil and well-adorned. It lieth amid sandal dust,\r\nworshipped by me for long years. Partaking of the nature and form of a\r\nsnake, it is poisonous and fierce and capable of killing large numbers of\r\nmen and steeds and elephants of terrible form, and exceedingly awful, it\r\nis capable of piercing coats of mail and bones. Inspired with wrath, I\r\nmay pierce even the mighty mountains of Meru with it. That shaft I will\r\nnever shoot at any other person save Phalguna or Krishna, the son of\r\nDevaki. In this I tell thee the truth. Listen to it. With that shaft, O\r\nShalya, I will, inspired with rage, fight with Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.\r\nThat would be a feat worthy of me. Of all the heroes in the Vrishni race,\r\nit is Krishna in whom Prosperity is always established. Among all the\r\nsons of Pandu, it is Partha in whom Victory is always established. Those\r\ntwo tigers among men, stationed together on the same car, will advance\r\nagainst my single self for battle. Thou shalt, O Shalya, behold today the\r\nnobility of my lineage. Those two cousins, one of whom is the son of the\r\naunt and the other the son of the maternal uncle, those two invincible\r\nwarriors, thou shalt see, will be slain by me (with one shaft) and will\r\nlook like two pearls strung together in the same string. Arjuna's gandiva\r\nand the ape-bearing banner, and Krishna's discus and the Garuda-bearing\r\nbanner, inspire with fear only those that are timid. To me, however, O\r\nShalya, they are causes of delight. Thou art a fool, of evil disposition,\r\nand unskilled in the ways of great battle. Overcome with terror, thou\r\nutterest these ravings. Or, thou art praising them for some reason not\r\nknown to me. Having slain those two first, I shall then slay thee today\r\nwith all thy kinsmen. Born in a sinful country thou art wicked-souled and\r\nmean, and a wretch amongst kshatriyas. Being a friend, why dost thou,\r\nlike an enemy, frighten me with these praises of the two Krishnas? Either\r\nthey two will slay me today or I will slay them two. Knowing as I do my\r\nown might, I do not cherish any fear of the two Krishnas. A 1,000\r\nVasudevas and hundreds of Phalgunas, I shall, single-handed, slay. Hold\r\nthy tongue, O thou that art born in a sinful country. Hear from me, O\r\nShalya, the sayings, already passed into proverbs, that men, young and\r\nold, and women, and persons arrived in course of their listless\r\nwanderings, generally utter, as if those sayings formed part of their\r\nstudies, about the wicked Madrakas. brahmanas also duly narrated the same\r\nthings formerly in the courts of kings. Listening to those sayings\r\nattentively, O fool, thou mayst forgive or rejoin. The Madraka is always\r\na hater of friends. He that hateth us is a Madraka. There is no\r\nfriendship in the Madraka who is mean in speech and is the lowest of\r\nmankind. The Madraka is always a person of wicked soul, is always\r\nuntruthful and crooked. It hath been heard by us that till the moment of\r\ndeath the Madrakas are wicked. (Amongst the Madrakas) the sire, the son,\r\nthe mother, the mother-in-law, the brother, the grand-son, and other\r\nkinsmen, companions, strangers arrived at their homes, slaves male and\r\nfemale, mingle together. The women of the Madrakas mingle, at their own\r\nwill, with men known and unknown. Of unrighteous conduct, and subsisting\r\nupon fried and powdered corn and fish, in their homes, they laugh and cry\r\nhaving drunk spirits and eaten beef. They sing incoherent songs and\r\nmingle lustfully with one another, indulging the while in the freest\r\nspeeches. How then can virtue have a place amongst the Madrakas who are\r\narrogant and notorious for all kinds of evil acts? No one should make\r\nfriends with a Madraka or provoke hostilities with him. In the Madraka\r\nland there is no friendship. The Madraka is always the dirt of humanity.\r\nAmongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are lost as purity amongst\r\nthe Gandharakas and the libations poured in a sacrifice in which the king\r\nis himself the sacrificer and priest. Then again, it is truly seen that\r\nwise men treat a person bit by a scorpion and affected by its poison,\r\neven with these words: 'As a brahmana that assists at the religious\r\nceremonies of a Shudra suffereth degradation, as one that hateth\r\nbrahmanas always suffereth degradation, even so a person by making an\r\nalliance with the Madrakas becometh fallen. As there is no friendship in\r\nthe Madraka, so, O scorpion, thy poison is nought.' With these mantras of\r\nthe Atharvan I have duly performed the rite of exorcism. Knowing this, O\r\nlearned one, hold thy tongue, or listen to something further that I will\r\nsay. Those women that, intoxicated by spirits, cast off their robes and\r\ndance, those women that are not attached (to particular individuals) in\r\nthe matter of intercourse and that they do as they please without owning\r\nany restrictions, I say, that being as thou art the child of one of those\r\nwomen, how canst thou, O Madraka, be a fit person for declaring the\r\nduties of men? Those women that live and answer calls of nature like\r\ncamels and asses, being as thou art the child of one of those sinful and\r\nshameless creatures, how canst thou wish to declare the duties of men?\r\nWhen a Madraka woman is solicited for the gift of a little quantity of\r\nvinegar, she scratches her hips and without being desirous of giving it,\r\nsays these cruel words, 'Let no man ask any vinegar of me that is so dear\r\nto me. I would give him my son, I would give him my husband, but vinegar\r\nI would not give.' The young Madraka maidens, we hear, are generally very\r\nshameless and hairy and gluttonous and impure. These and many other\r\nthings of a like nature, in respect of all their acts, from the crown of\r\ntheir heads to the tip of their toes, are capable of being asserted of\r\nthem by myself and others. How, indeed, would the Madrakas and the\r\nSindhu-Sauviras know anything of duty, being born, as they are, in a\r\nsinful country, being mlecchas in their practices, and being totally\r\nregardless of all duties? It hath been heard by us that even this is the\r\nhighest duty of a kshatriya, viz., that slain in battle, he should lie\r\ndown on the Earth, applauded by the righteous. That I should lay down (my\r\nlife) in this clash of arms is my foremost wish, desirous as I am of\r\nheaven through Death. I am also the dear friend of the intelligent son of\r\nDhritarashtra. For his sake are my life-breaths and whatever wealth I\r\nhave! As regards thyself, O thou that art born in a sinful country, it is\r\nevident that thou hast been tampered with by the Pandavas, since thou\r\nbehavest towards us in everything like a foe. Like a righteous man that\r\nis incapable of being led astray by atheists, surely I am incapable of\r\nbeing dissuaded from this battle by hundreds of persons like thee. Like a\r\ndeer, covered with sweat, thou art at liberty to weep or thirst.\r\nObservant as I am of the duties of a kshatriya, I am incapable of being\r\nfrightened by thee. I recall to my mind the end, declared unto me in past\r\ntimes by my preceptor Rama, of those lions among men, those unreturning\r\nheroes, that laid down their lives in battle. Prepared for rescuing the\r\nKauravas and slaying our foes, know that I am now determined to imitate\r\nthe excellent behaviour of Pururavas. I do not, O ruler of the Madrakas,\r\nbehold the person in the three worlds that can, I think, dissuade me from\r\nthis purpose. Forbear to speak, knowing all this. Why dost thou rave in\r\nsuch a way from fear? O wretch amongst the Madrakas, I shall not now slay\r\nthee and present thy carcase as an offering to carnivorous creatures.\r\nFrom regard for a friend, O Shalya, for the sake of Dhritarashtra's son,\r\nand for avoiding blame, for these three reasons, thou still livest. If, O\r\nruler of the Madras, thou speakest such words again, I shall then crush\r\nthy head with my mace that is as hard as the thunder. People will today\r\nsee or hear, O thou that art born in a sinful country, either that the\r\ntwo Krishnas have slain Karna or that Karna has slain the two Krishnas.\"\r\nHaving said these words, the son of Radha, O monarch, once more addressed\r\nthe king of the Madras, fearlessly saying, \"Proceed, proceed.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing, O sire, these words of Radha's son who delighted\r\nin battle, Shalya once more addressed Karna, citing an example, \"I am\r\nborn in the race of men who performed great sacrifices, who never\r\nretreated from battle, who were kings whose coronal locks underwent the\r\nsacred bath. I am also myself devoted to the practice of virtue. Thou, O\r\nVrisha, seemest to be like one that is intoxicated with spirits. For all\r\nthat, I will, from friendship, seek to cure thy erring and intoxicated\r\nself. Listen, O Karna, to this simile of a crow that I am about to\r\nnarrate. Having heard it, thou mayest do what thou choosest, O thou that\r\nart destitute of intelligence and that art a wretch of thy race. I do\r\nnot, O Karna, remember the slightest fault in me for which, O thou of\r\nmighty arms, thou mayst desire to slay my innocent self. I must tell thee\r\nwhat is for thy good and what is for thy ill, acquainted as I am with\r\nboth, especially as I am the driver of thy car and desirous of the good\r\nof king Duryodhana. What land is level and what not, the strength or\r\nweakness of the warrior (on my vehicle), the fatigue and faintness, at\r\nall times, of the steeds and the warrior (I am driving), a knowledge of\r\nthe weapons that are available, the cries of animals and birds, what\r\nwould be heavy for the steeds and what exceedingly heavy for them, the\r\nextraction of arrows and the curing of wounds which weapons counteract\r\nwhich, the several methods of battle, and all kinds of omens and\r\nindications, I who am so nearly connected with this car, being none else\r\nthan its driver, should be familiar with. For this, O Karna, I narrate\r\nthis instance to thee once more. There lived on the other side of the\r\nocean a Vaishya who had abundance of wealth and corn. He performed\r\nsacrifices, made liberal gifts, was peaceful, devoted to the duties of\r\nhis own order, and pure in habits and mind. He had many sons whom he\r\nloved, and was kind unto all creatures. He lived fearlessly in the\r\ndominions of a king that was guided by virtue. There was a crow that\r\nlived on the refuse of the dishes set before those well-behaved young\r\nchildren of the Vaishya. Those Vaishya children always gave the crow meat\r\nand curds, and milk, and sugared milk with rice, and honey, and butter.\r\nThus fed with the refuse of their dishes by the young children of that\r\nVaishya, the crow became arrogant and came to disregard all birds that\r\nwere equal to him or even superior. It chanced that once certain swans of\r\ncheerful hearts, of great speed and capable of going everywhere at will\r\nand equal unto Garuda himself in range and speed of flight, came to that\r\nside of the ocean. The Vaishya boys, beholding those swans, addressed the\r\ncrow and said, 'O ranger of the skies, thou art superior to all winged\r\ncreatures.' Deceived by those children of little understanding, that\r\noviparous creature from folly and pride, regarded their words to be true.\r\nProud of the refuse of the children's dishes upon which he fed, the crow\r\nthen, alighting in the midst of those swans capable of traversing great\r\ndistances, desired to enquire as to who amongst them was their leader.\r\nThe foolish crow at last challenged him amongst those birds of tireless\r\nwings whom he regarded their leader, saying, 'Let us compete in flight.'\r\nHearing those words of the raving crow, the swans that had assembled\r\nthere, those foremost of birds endued with great strength, began to\r\nlaugh. The swans then, that were capable of going everywhere at will,\r\naddressed the crow, saying. 'We are swans, having our abode in the Manasa\r\nlake. We traverse the whole Earth, and amongst winged creatures we are\r\nalways applauded for the length of the distances we traverse. Being, as\r\nthou art, only a crow, how canst thou, O fool, challenge a swan endued\r\nwith might, capable of going everywhere at will, and doing large\r\ndistances in course of his flight? Tell us, O crow, how thou shalt fly\r\nwith us.' The boastful crow, in consequence of the foolishness of his\r\nspecies, repeatedly finding fault with the words of that swan, at last\r\ngave this answer. The crow said, 'I shall without doubt fly displaying a\r\nhundred and one different kinds of motion. Doing every hundred Yojanas in\r\na separate and beautiful kind of motion, I shall display all those\r\nmotions. Rising up, and swooping down, and whirling around, and coursing\r\nstraight, and proceeding gently, and advancing steadily, and performing\r\nthe diverse courses up and receding back, and soaring high, and darting\r\nforward and soaring upwards with fiercer velocity, and once more\r\nproceeding gently and then proceeding with great impetuosity, and once\r\nagain swooping down and whirling around and advancing steadily, and\r\nrising up by the jerks, and soaring straight, and once more falling down\r\nand wheeling in a circle and rushing proudly, and diverse other kinds of\r\nmotion, these all I shall display in the sight of all you. Ye shall then\r\nwitness my strength. With one of these different kinds of motion I shall\r\npresently rise into the sky. Point out duly, ye swans, by which of these\r\nmotions I shall course through space. Settling the kind of motion amongst\r\nyourselves, you will have to course with me. Adopting all those different\r\nmotion, ye shall have to course with me through supportless space.' The\r\ncrow having said these words, one of the swans addressed him, 'Listen, O\r\nson of Radha, to the words that the swan said. The swan spoke, 'Thou, O\r\ncrow, wilt doubtless fly the hundred and one different kinds of flight. I\r\nshall, however, fly in that one kind of motion that all (other) birds\r\nknow, for I do not, O crow, know any other. As regards thee, O thou of\r\nred eyes, fly thou in any kind of course that thou likest.' At these\r\nwords, those crows that had been assembled there laughed aloud, saying,\r\n'How will the swan with only one kind of flight get the better of a\r\nhundred different kinds of flight?'\r\n\r\n\"'\"Then those two, viz., the swan and the crow, rose into the sky,\r\nchallenging each other. Capable of going everywhere at will, the swan\r\nproceeded in one kind of motion, while the crow coursed in a hundred\r\ndifferent kinds. And the swan flew and the crow also flew, causing each\r\nother to wonder (at his skill) and each speaking highly of his own\r\nachievements. Beholding the diverse kinds of flight at successive\r\ninstants of time, the crows that were there were filled with great joy\r\nand began to caw more loudly. The swans also laughed in mockery, uttering\r\nmany remarks disagreeable (to the crows). And they began to soar and\r\nalight repeatedly, here and there. And they began to come down and rise\r\nup from tree-tops and the surface of the earth. And they uttered diverse\r\ncries indicative of their victory. The swan, however, with that one kind\r\nof slow motion (with which he was familiar) began to traverse the skies.\r\nFor a moment, therefore, O sire, he seemed to yield to the crow. The\r\ncrows, at this, disregarding the swans, said these words: 'That swan\r\namongst you which has soared into the sky, is evidently yielding'.\r\nHearing these words, the (soaring) swan flew westwards with great\r\nvelocity to the ocean, that abode of Makaras. Then fear entered the heart\r\nof the crow who became almost senseless at not seeing any island or trees\r\nwhereon to perch when tired. And the crow thought within his heart as to\r\nwhere he should alight when tired, upon that vast expanse of water. The\r\nocean, being as it is the abode of countless creatures, is irresistible.\r\nDwelt in by hundreds of monsters, it is grander than space. Nothing can\r\nexceed it in depth, O Suta's son. Men know, O Karna, that the waters of\r\nthe ocean are as limitless as space. For the extent of its waters, O\r\nKarna, what is a crow to it? The swan, having traversed a great distance\r\nin a moment, looked back at the crow, and (though capable) could not\r\nleave him behind. Having transgressed the crow, the swan cast his eyes on\r\nhim and waited, thinking, 'Let the crow come up.' The crow then,\r\nexceedingly tired, came up to the swan. Beholding him succumbing, and\r\nabout to sink, and desirous of rescuing him in remembrance of the\r\npractices of good folks, the swan addressed him in these words, 'Thou\r\nhadst repeatedly spoken of many kinds of flight while speaking on the\r\nsubject. Thou wouldst not speak of this (thy present motion) because of\r\nits having been a mystery to us? What is the name of this kind of flight,\r\nO crow, that thou hast now adopted? Thou touchest the waters with thy\r\nwings and beak repeatedly. Which amongst those diverse kinds of flight is\r\nthis, O crow, that thou art now practising? Come, come, quickly, O crow,\r\nfor I am waiting for thee.''\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya continued, \"Exceedingly afflicted, and touching the water with\r\nhis wings and beak, O thou of wicked soul, the crow, beheld in that state\r\nby the swan, addressed the latter. Indeed, not seeing the limit of that\r\nwatery expanse and sinking down in fatigue, and exhausted with the effort\r\nof his flight the crow said unto the swan, 'We are crows, we wander\r\nhither and thither, crying-caw, caw. 'O swan, I seek thy protection,\r\nplacing my life-breaths at thy hands. Oh, take me to the shores of the\r\nocean with the wings and beak.' The crow, very much fatigued, suddenly\r\nfell down. Beholding him fallen upon the waters of the ocean with a\r\nmelancholy heart, the swan, addressing the crow who was on the point of\r\ndeath, said these words, 'Remember, O crow, what thou hadst said in\r\npraise of thyself. The words even were that thou wouldst course through\r\nthe sky in a hundred and one different kinds of flight. Thou, therefore\r\nthat wouldst fly a hundred different kinds of flight, thou that art\r\nsuperior to me, alas, why then art thou tired and fallen down on the\r\nocean?' Overcome with weakness, the crow then, casting his eyes upwards\r\nat the swan, and seeking to gratify him, replied, saying, 'Proud of the\r\nremains of others' dishes upon which I fed, I had, O swan, regarded\r\nmyself as the equal of Garuda and disregarded all crows and many other\r\nbirds. I now, however, seek thy protection and place my life-breaths at\r\nthy hands. Oh, take me to the shores of some island. If, O swan, I can, O\r\nlord, return in safety to my own country, I will never again disregard\r\nanybody. Oh rescue me now from this calamity.' Him that said so and was\r\nso melancholy and weeping and deprived of senses, him that was sinking in\r\nthe ocean, uttering cries 'caw, caw,' him so drenched by the water and so\r\ndisgusting to look at and trembling with fear, the swan, without a word,\r\ntook up with his feet, and slowly caused him to ride on his back. Having\r\ncaused the crow whose senses had deserted him to ride upon his back, the\r\nswan quickly returned to that island whence they had both flown,\r\nchallenging each other. Placing down that ranger of the sky on dry land\r\nand comforting him, the swan, fleet as the mind, proceeded to the region\r\nhe desired. Thus was that crow, fed on the remains of others' dinners,\r\nvanquished by the swan. The crow, then, casting off the pride of might\r\nand energy, adopted a life of peace and quiet. Indeed, even, as that\r\ncrow, fed upon the remains of the dinners of the Vaishya children,\r\ndisregarded his equals and superiors, so dost thou, O Karna, that art fed\r\nby the sons of Dhritarashtra upon the remains of their dishes, disregard\r\nall thy equals and superiors. Why didst thou not slay Partha at Virata's\r\ncity when thou hadst the advantage of being protected by Drona and\r\nDrona's son and Kripa and Bhishma and the other Kauravas? There where,\r\nlike a pack of jackals defeated by a lion, ye all were defeated with\r\ngreat slaughter by the diadem-decked Arjuna, what became of your prowess?\r\nBeholding also thy brother slain by Savyasaci, in the very sight of the\r\nKuru heroes, it was thou that didst fly away first. By the skirts also of\r\nthe dvaitya lake, O Karna, when thou wert assailed by the Gandharvas, it\r\nwas thou that, deserting all the Kurus, didst first run away. Having\r\nvanquished in battle the Gandharvas headed by Citrasena, with great\r\nslaughter, it was Partha, O Karna, that liberated Duryodhana with his\r\nwife. Rama himself, O Karna, before the kings in the (Kuru) assembly\r\nspake of the great prowess of both Partha and Keshava. Thou didst\r\nfrequently hear the words of Drona and Bhishma, speaking in the presence\r\nof all the kings, that the two Krishnas are unslayable. I have told thee\r\na little only regarding those matters in which Dhananjaya is superior to\r\nthee like the brahmana who is superior to all created beings. Soon wilt\r\nthou see, stationed on that foremost of cars, the son of Vasudeva and the\r\nson of Kunti and Pandu. As the crow (in the story), acting with\r\nintelligence, had sought the protection of the swan, so do thou seek the\r\nprotection of him of Vrishni's race, and of Pandu's son Dhananjaya. When\r\nthou shalt in battle behold Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, those two endued\r\nwith great prowess, stationed together on the same car, thou shalt not\r\nthen, O Karna, utter such speeches. When Partha will, with hundreds of\r\narrows, quell thy pride, then wilt thou behold the difference between\r\nthyself and Dhananjaya. Those two best of persons are celebrated among\r\nthe gods, the Asuras and human beings. Thou that art a firefly, do not,\r\nfrom folly, think disrespectfully of those two resplendent luminaries.\r\nLike the Sun and moon, Keshava and Arjuna are celebrated for their\r\nresplendence. Thou, however, art like a fire-fly among men. O learned\r\none, O son of a Suta, do not think disrespectfully of Acyuta and Arjuna.\r\nThose two high-souled persons are lions among men. Forbear indulging in\r\nsuch boasts.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The high-souled son of Adhiratha, having listened\r\nunconvinced to these words of the ruler of the Madras, addressed Shalya,\r\nsaying, \"That which Vasudeva and Arjuna are is well-known to me. The\r\nskill of Saurin in the management of cars, and the might and the high\r\nweapons of Arjuna, the son of Pandu are well known to me at this hour.\r\nThou however, O Shalya, hast no ocular proof of those matters. I shall\r\nfearlessly fight with the two Krishnas, those two foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons. The curse, however, of Rama that best of regenerate\r\npersons, paineth me greatly today. I dwelt, in the disguise of a\r\nbrahmana, with Rama in former days, desirous of obtaining celestial\r\nweapons from him. On that occasion, O Shalya, the chief of the gods,\r\nwishing to benefit Phalguna, caused an obstacle, by approaching my thigh\r\nand piercing it, having assumed the dire form of a worm. When my\r\npreceptor slept, having laid his head thereon, that worm, approaching my\r\nthigh, began to pierce it through. In consequence of the piercing of my\r\nthigh, a pool of thick blood flowed from my body. For fear of (disturbing\r\nthe slumber of) my preceptor I did not move my limb. Awaking, the\r\nbrahmana, however, beheld what had taken place. Witnessing my patience he\r\naddressed me, saying, 'Thou art never a brahmana. Tell me truly who thou\r\nart.' I then, O Shalya, truly informed him of myself, saying that I was a\r\nSuta. Hearing my words, the great ascetic, his heart filled with rage,\r\ncursed me, saying, 'In consequence of the deception, O Suta, by which\r\nthou hast obtained this weapon, it will never, at the time of need, when\r\nthe hour of thy death comes, occur to thy memory. Brahma cannot certainly\r\nreside in one that is not a brahmana.' I have forgotten that great weapon\r\nin this fierce and terrible battle. He amongst the Bharatas, O Shalya,\r\nwho is accomplished, who is an effectual smiter, who is universal\r\ndestroyer, and who is exceedingly terrible, (viz., Arjuna),--that mighty\r\ncrusher,--I think, will burn many foremost of kshatriyas. Know, however,\r\nO Shalya, that I will slay in battle that fierce bowman, that foremost of\r\nwarriors, that hero endued with activity, that terrible person whose\r\nenergy is unbearable, that warrior whose promises are accomplished, that\r\nson of Pandu, viz., Dhananjaya. I have that weapon (at least) under my\r\ncontrol today with which I will be able to destroy large numbers of foes.\r\nI will slay in battle that scorcher of enemies, that mighty warrior\r\naccomplished in weapons, that fierce bowman of immeasurable energy, that\r\ncruel and terrible hero, that great resister of enemies, viz.,\r\nDhananjaya. The immeasurable Ocean, that lord of all waters, rusheth with\r\nfierce impetuosity for overwhelming innumerable creatures. The continent,\r\nhowever, holds and checks him. Today, in this world, I will resist in\r\nfight the son of Kunti, that foremost of all drawers of the bow-string,\r\nwhile he will be engaged in ceaselessly shooting his countless shafts\r\nequipped with goodly wings, destructive of heroes, capable of penetrating\r\ninto every limb and none of which becomes futile. Like the continent\r\nresisting the Ocean, I will today resist that mightiest of the mighty,\r\nthat great warrior possessing the highest weapons, that hero like unto\r\nthe Ocean's self of far-reaching arrows, fierce, and having shafts for\r\nhis waves, while he will be engaged in overwhelming (hostile) kings.\r\nBehold today the fierce battle I fight with him that hath no equal, I\r\nthink, among men wielding the bow, and that would vanquish the very gods\r\nunited with the Asuras. Exceedingly proud is that son of Pandu. Desirous\r\nof battle he will approach me with his mighty and super-human weapons.\r\nBaffling his weapons with my own weapons in battle, I shall today\r\noverthrow that Partha with my own excellent shafts. Scorching his foes\r\nlike the Sun endued with fiery rays, and blazing with flame like that\r\ndispeller of the darkness, I shall, like a mass of clouds, completely\r\nshroud Dhananjaya today with my shafts. Like the clouds extinguishing a\r\nblazing fire of great energy and smoke-mixed flames, that seems ready to\r\nconsume the whole Earth, I shall, with my showers of arrows, extinguish\r\nthe son of Kunti in battle. With my broad-headed shafts I shall still the\r\nson of Kunti, that terrible snake of virulent poison, that is exceedingly\r\ndifficult of being captured, that is endued with keen fangs, that is even\r\nlike a blazing fire that flames up in wrath, and that always consumes his\r\nfoes. Like Himavat bearing the mighty, all-crushing, fierce and smiting\r\ngod of wind, I shall, without moving, bear the angry and vindictive\r\nDhananjaya. I shall resist in battle Dhananjaya, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of bows in the world, that hero in fight, that warrior who is\r\nalways in the van and who is competent to meet all foes, that car-warrior\r\nwho is conversant with all car-tracks. Today I shall fight in battle with\r\nthat person who hath, I think, no equal among men wielding the bow and\r\nwho conquered the entire Earth. What other man desirous of saving his\r\nlife, except myself, will fight with that Savyasaci, who vanquished all\r\ncreatures including the very gods in the country called Khandava? Arjuna\r\nis proud; his weapons strike deep; he is endued with great lightness of\r\nhands; he is conversant with steeds; he agitates vast hosts; he is\r\nregarded an Atiratha. Though such, I shall yet, with my sharp shafts,\r\nstrike his head from off his trunk today. O Shalya, ever keeping Death or\r\nvictory in battle before me, I shall today fight with Dhananjaya. There\r\nis none else save myself that would on a single car fight with that\r\nPandava who resembles the destroyer himself. I myself will gladly speak\r\nof the prowess of Phalguna in the midst of an assembly of kshatriyas. Why\r\nhowever, dost thou, a fool as thou art and of foolish understanding,\r\nspeak to me of Phalguna's prowess? Thou art a doer of disagreeable deeds.\r\nThou art cruel and mean and being thyself unforgiving, thou art a\r\ndetractor of one that is forgiving. I can slay a hundred persons like\r\nthee, but I forgive thee in consequence of my forgiving disposition,\r\nowing to the exigency of the times. Thou art of sinful deeds. Like a fool\r\nthou hast, for the sake of Pandu's son, rebuked me and told me many\r\ndisagreeable things. Crooked-hearted as thou art, thou hast said all\r\nthese words unto me, that am of a sincere heart. Cursed art thou for thou\r\nart an injurer of friends,--of friends, because friendship is\r\nseven-paced. Terrible is the hour that is now passing. Duryodhana hath\r\nhimself come to battle. I am solicitous of seeing his purposes achieved.\r\nThou, however, art acting in such a way that it shows thee to have no\r\nfriendship (for the Kuru king)! He is a friend who shows affection for\r\nanother, who gladdens another, who makes himself agreeable to another,\r\nwho protects another, who honours another, and who rejoices in the joys\r\nof another. I tell thee that I have all those attributes, and the king\r\nhimself knows all this. He, on the other hand, that destroys, chastises,\r\nsharpens his weapons, injures, causes us to sigh, makes us cheerless, and\r\nwrongs us in diverse ways, is a foe. All these attributes are to be found\r\nin thee and thou discoverest all of them in me. For the sake of\r\nDuryodhana, for the sake of doing what is agreeable to thee, for the sake\r\nof victory, for the sake of myself, and for the sake of God himself, I\r\nwill with vigorous exertion, fight with Partha and Vasudeva. Witness\r\ntoday my feats. Behold today my excellent weapons, my brahmastra and\r\nother celestial weapons, as also those that are human. I will today slay\r\nthat hero of fierce prowess, like an exceedingly infuriate elephant\r\nslaying an infuriate compeer. I shall, by my mind alone, hurl today at\r\nPartha, for my victory, that weapon of immeasurable energy, called the\r\nbrahmastra. Arjuna will never be able to escape that weapon, if only the\r\nwheels of my car do not sink into the Earth in battle today. Know this, O\r\nShalya, that I would not take fright at Yama himself armed with his rod,\r\nor Varuna himself armed with his noose, or Kuvera himself armed with his\r\nmace, or Vasava himself armed with the thunderbolt, or at any other foe\r\nwhatever that may approach for slaying me. Therefore, I have no fear from\r\nPartha, nor from Janardana. On the other hand, I shall encounter them\r\nboth in today's destructive battle. Once on a time, while wandering for\r\nthe sake of practising weapons on my bow called Vijaya, O king, I had, by\r\nshooting many fierce shafts of terrible forms, heedlessly struck the calf\r\nof a (brahmana's) homa cow with one of those shafts, and unwillingly\r\nkilled it white it was wandering in a solitary forest. The brahmana then\r\naddressed me, saying, 'Since, becoming insensate, thou hast slain the\r\noffspring of my homa cow, the wheel (of thy car) will sink into the Earth\r\nwhile at the time of battle fear will enter thy heart.' From these words\r\nof the brahmana I am experiencing great fear. These kings of the Lunar\r\nrace that are lords of (other people's) weal and woe, offered to give\r\nthat brahmana a 1,000 kine and 600 bovine bulls. With even such a gift, O\r\nShalya, the brahmana would not be gratified, O ruler of the Madras. I was\r\nthen for giving him seven hundred elephants of large tusks and many\r\nhundred of slaves male and female. That foremost of brahmana would not\r\nstill be gratified. Collecting next full 14,000 kine, each black in hue\r\nand having a white calf I was still unable to obtain the grace of that\r\nbest of brahmana. A wealthy mansion full of every object of desire, in\r\nfact, whatever wealth I had, I wished to give him with due worship, but\r\nhe refused to accept the gift. Unto me then that had offended and that\r\nhad begged so importunately for his pardon, the brahmana said, 'That\r\nwhich, O Suta, hath been uttered by me is sure to happen. It cannot be\r\notherwise. A false speech would destroy creatures, and sin also would be\r\nmine. Therefore, for the preservation of virtue I do not venture to speak\r\nwhat is false. Do not, again, destroy the means of a brahmana's support.\r\nThere is none in the world that would be able to falsify my speech.\r\nAccept those words. It will be thy atonement (for the sin of having slain\r\na calf).' Though rebuked by thee, still for friendship's sake, I have\r\ndisclosed to thee all this. I know thee that art rebuking me thus. Be\r\nsilent now, and hear what I will presently say.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'That chastiser of foes, viz., the son of Radha, thus\r\nsilencing the ruler of the Madras, once more addressed him, O monarch,\r\nsaying these words, \"In answer to that which, O Shalya, thou hast said\r\nunto me by way of instance, I tell thee that I am incapable of being\r\nfrightened by thee in battle with thy words. If all the gods themselves\r\nwith Vasava would fight with me, I would not still feel any fear, what\r\nneed be said then of my fears from Pritha and Keshava? I am incapable of\r\nbeing frightened by means of words alone. He, O Shalya, whom thou wouldst\r\nbe able to frighten in battle is some other person (and not myself)! Thou\r\nhast spoken many bitter words to me. Therein lieth the strength of a\r\nperson that is low. Incapable of speaking of my merits, thou sayst many\r\nbitter things, O thou of wicked heart; Karna was never born, O Madraka,\r\nfor fear in battle. On the other hand, I was born for displaying valour\r\nas also for achieving glory for my own self. For the sake of my\r\nfriendship for thee, for my affection, and for thy being an ally,--for\r\nthese three reasons thou still livest, O Shalya. Important is the task\r\nthat has now to be done for king Dhritarashtra. That task, O Shalya,\r\ndepends on me. For this, thou livest a moment. Before this, I made a\r\ncompact with thee that any disagreeable speeches thou mightest utter\r\nwould be pardoned by me. That compact should be observed. It is for this\r\nthat thou livest, O Madraka. Without a 1,000 Salyas I would vanquish my\r\nfoes. He that injureth a friend is sinful. It is for this that thou\r\nlivest for the present.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"These, O Karna, are ravings that thou utterest regarding\r\nthe foe. As regards myself without a 1,000 Karnas I am able to vanquish\r\nthe foe in battle.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto the ruler of Madras, of harsh features, who was\r\nsaying such disagreeable things unto Karna, the latter once more said\r\nwords that were twice bitter.\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"Listen with devoted attention to this, O ruler of the\r\nMadras, that was heard by me while it was recited in the presence of\r\nDhritarashtra. In Dhritarashtra's abode the brahmanas used to narrate the\r\naccounts of diverse delightful regions and many kings of ancient times. A\r\nforemost one among brahmanas, venerable in years while reciting old\r\nhistories, said these words, blaming the Vahikas and Madrakas, 'One\r\nshould always avoid the Vahikas, those impure people that are out of the\r\npale of virtue, and that live away from the Himavat and the Ganga and\r\nSarasvati and Yamuna and Kurukshetra and the Sindhu and its five\r\ntributary rivers. I remember from the days of my youth that a\r\nslaughter-ground for kine and a space for storing intoxicating spirits\r\nalways distinguish the entrances of the abodes of the (Vahika) kings. On\r\nsome very secret mission I had to live among the Vahikas. In consequence\r\nof such residence the conduct of these people is well known to me. There\r\nis a town of the name of Sakala, a river of the name of Apaga, and a clan\r\nof the Vahikas known by the name of the Jarttikas. The practices of these\r\npeople are very censurable. They drink the liquor called Gauda, and eat\r\nfried barley with it. They also eat beef with garlic. They also eat cakes\r\nof flour mixed with meat, and boiled rice that is bought from others. Of\r\nrighteous practices they have none. Their women, intoxicated with drink\r\nand divested of robes, laugh and dance outside the walls of the houses in\r\ncities, without garlands and unguents, singing while drunk obscene songs\r\nof diverse kinds that are as musical as the bray of the ass or the bleat\r\nof the camel. In intercourse they are absolutely without any restraint,\r\nand in all other matters they act as they like. Maddened with drink, they\r\ncall upon one another, using many endearing epithets. Addressing many\r\ndrunken exclamations to their husbands and lords, the fallen women among\r\nthe Vahikas, without observing restrictions even on sacred days, give\r\nthemselves up to dancing. One of those wicked Vahikas,--one that is, that\r\nlived amongst those arrogant women,--who happened to live for some days\r\nin Kurujangala, burst out with cheerless heart, saying, \"Alas, that\r\n(Vahika) maiden of large proportions, dressed in thin blankets, is\r\nthinking of me,--her Vahika lover--that is now passing his days in\r\nKurujangala, at the hour of her going to bed.\" Crossing the Sutlej and\r\nthe delightful Iravati, and arriving at my own country, when shall I cast\r\nmy eyes upon those beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing\r\ncirclets of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black\r\ncollyrium on their eyes, and their beautiful forms attired in blankets\r\nand skins and themselves uttering shrill cries! When shall I be happy, in\r\nthe company of those intoxicated ladies amid the music of drums and\r\nkettle-drums and conchs sweet as the cries of asses and camels and mules!\r\nWhen shall I be amongst those ladies eating cakes of flour and meat and\r\nballs of pounded barley mixed with skimmed milk, in the forests, having\r\nmany pleasant paths of Sami and Pilu and Karira! When shall I, amid my\r\nown countrymen, mustering in strength on the high-roads, fall upon\r\npassengers, and snatching their robes and attires beat them repeatedly!\r\nWhat man is there that would willingly dwell, even for a moment amongst\r\nthe Vahikas that are so fallen and wicked, and so depraved in their\r\npractises?' Even thus did that brahmana describe the Vahikas of base\r\nbehaviour, a sixth of whose merits and demerits is thine, O Shalya.\r\nHaving said this, that pious brahmana began once more to say what I am\r\nabout to repeat respecting the wicked Vahikas. Listen to what I say, 'In\r\nthe large and populous town of Sakala, a Rakshasa woman used to sing on\r\nevery fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, in accompaniment with a drum,\r\n\"When shall I next sing the songs of the Vahikas in this Sakala town,\r\nhaving gorged myself with beef and drunk the Gauda liquor? When shall I\r\nagain, decked in ornaments, and with those maidens and ladies of large\r\nproportions, gorge upon a large number of sheep and large quantities of\r\npork and beef and the meat of fowls and asses and camels? They who do not\r\neat sheep live in vain!\"' Even thus, O Shalya, the young and old, among\r\nthe inhabitants of Sakala, intoxicated with spirits, sing and cry. How\r\ncan virtue be met with among such a people? Thou shouldst know this. I\r\nmust, however, speak again to thee about what another brahmana had said\r\nunto us in the Kuru court, 'There where forests of Pilus stand, and those\r\nfive rivers flow, viz., the Satadru, the Vipasa, the Iravati, the\r\nCandrabhaga, and the Vitasa and which have the Sindhu for their sixth,\r\nthere in those regions removed from the Himavat, are the countries called\r\nby the name of the Arattas. Those regions are without virtue and\r\nreligion. No one should go thither. The gods, the pitris, and the\r\nbrahmanas, never accept gifts from those that are fallen, or those that\r\nare begotten by Shudras on the girls of other castes, or the Vahikas who\r\nnever perform sacrifices and are exceedingly irreligious.' That learned\r\nbrahmana had also said in the Kuru court, 'The Vahikas, without any\r\nfeelings of revulsion, eat of wooden vessels having deep stomachs and\r\nearthen plates and vessels that have been licked by dogs and that are\r\nstained with pounded barley and other corn. The Vahikas drink the milk of\r\nsheep and camels and asses and eat curds and other preparations from\r\nthose different kinds of milk. Those degraded people number many bastards\r\namong them. There is no food and no milk that they do not take. The\r\nAratta-Vahikas that are steeped in ignorance, should be avoided.' Thou\r\nshouldst know this, O Shalya. I must, however, again speak to thee about\r\nwhat another brahmana had said unto me in the Kuru court, 'How can one go\r\nto heaven, having drunk milk in the town called Yugandhara, and resided\r\nin the place called Acyutasthala, and bathed in the spot called\r\nBhutilaya? There where the five rivers flow just after issuing from the\r\nmountains, there among the Aratta-Vahikas, no respectable person should\r\ndwell even for two days. There are two Pishacas named Vahi and Hika in\r\nthe river Vipasa. The Vahikas are the offspring of those two Pishacas.\r\nThey are not creatures created by the Creator. Being of such low origin,\r\nhow can they be conversant with the duties ordained in the scriptures?\r\nThe Karashakas, the Mahishakas, the Kalingas, the Keralas, the\r\nKarkotakas, the Virakas, and other peoples of no religion, one should\r\nalways avoid.' Even thus did a Rakshasa woman of gigantic hips speak unto\r\na brahmana who on a certain occasion went to that country for bathing in\r\na sacred water and passed a single night there. The regions are called by\r\nthe name of Arattas. The people residing there are called the Vahikas.\r\nThe lowest of brahmanas also are residing there from very remote times.\r\nThey are without the Veda and without knowledge, without sacrifice and\r\nwithout the power to assist at other's sacrifices. They are all fallen\r\nand many amongst them have been begotten by Shudras upon other peoples'\r\ngirls. The gods never accept any gifts from them. The Prasthalas, the\r\nMadras, the Gandharas, the Arattas, those called Khasas, the Vasatis, the\r\nSindhus and the Sauviras are almost as blamable in their practices.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\n\"'Karna continued, \"Thou shouldst know all this, O Shalya. I shall\r\nhowever, again speak unto thee. Listen with close attention to what I\r\nsay. Once on a time a brahmana came to our house as a guest. Observing\r\nour practices he became highly gratified and said unto us, 'I dwelt for a\r\nlong time on a peak of the Himavat quite alone. Since then I have seen\r\ndiverse countries following diverse religions. Never, however, have I\r\nseen all the people of a country act unrighteously. All the races I have\r\nmet will admit that to be true religion which has been declared by\r\npersons conversant with the Vedas. Travelling through various countries\r\nfollowing various religions, I at last, O king, came among the Vahikas.\r\nThere I heard that one at first becomes a brahmana and then he becomes a\r\nkshatriya. Indeed, a Vahika would, after that, become a Vaishya, and then\r\na Shudra, and then a barber. Having become a barber, he would then again\r\nbecome a brahmana. Returning to the status of a brahmana, he would again\r\nbecome a slave. One person in a family becomes a brahmana: all the\r\nothers, falling off from virtue, act as they like. The Gandharas, the\r\nMadrakas, and the Vahikas of little understanding are even such. Having\r\ntravelled through the whole world I heard of these practices, destructive\r\nof virtue, of these sinful irregularities amongst the Vahikas.' Thou\r\nshouldst know all this, O Shalya. I shall, however, again speak to thee\r\nabout those ugly words that another said unto me regarding the Vahikas.\r\nIn former days a chaste woman was abducted by robbers (hailing) from\r\nAratta. Sinfully was she violated by them, upon which she cursed them,\r\nsaying, 'Since ye have sinfully violated a helpless girl who am not\r\nwithout a husband, therefore, the women of your families shall all become\r\nunchaste. Ye lowest of men, never shall ye escape from the consequences\r\nof this dreadful sin.' It is for this, O Shalya, that the sisters' sons\r\nof the Arattas, and not their own sons, become their heirs. The Kauravas\r\nwith the Pancalas, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Naimishas, the Koshalas,\r\nthe Kasapaundras, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, and the Cedis who are all\r\nhighly blessed, know what the eternal religion is. The wicked even of\r\nthese various countries know what religion is. The Vahikas, however, live\r\nwithout righteousness. Beginning with the Matsyas, the residents of the\r\nKuru and the Pancala countries, the Naimishas as well and the other\r\nrespectable peoples, the pious among all races are conversant with the\r\neternal truths of religion. This cannot be said of the Madrakas and the\r\ncrooked-hearted race that resides in the country of the five rivers.\r\nKnowing all these things, O king, hold thy tongue, O Shalya, like one\r\ndeprived of utterance, in all matters connected with religion and virtue.\r\nThou art the protector and king of that people, and, therefore, the\r\npartaker of sixth part of their merits and demerits. Or perhaps, thou art\r\nthe partaker of a sixth part of their demerits only, for thou never\r\nprotectest them. A king that protects is a sharer in the merits of his\r\nsubjects. Thou art not a sharer in their merits. In days of yore, when\r\nthe eternal religion was reverenced in all countries, the Grandsire,\r\nobserving the practices of the country of the five rivers, cried fie on\r\nthem. When even in the krita age, Brahman had censured the practices of\r\nthose fallen people of evil deeds who were begotten by Shudras on others'\r\nwives, what would you now say to men in the world? Even thus did the\r\nGrandsire condemn the practices of the country of the five waters. When\r\nall people were observant of the duties of their respective orders, the\r\nGrandsire had to find fault with these men. Thou shouldst know all this,\r\nO Shalya. I shall, however, again speak to thee. A Rakshasa of the name\r\nof Kalmashapada, while plunging in a tank, said, 'Eleemosynation is a\r\nkshatriya's dirt, while the non-observance of vows is a brahmana's dirt.\r\nThe Vahikas are the dirt of the Earth, and the Madra women are the dirt\r\nof the whole female sex. While sinking in the stream, a king rescued the\r\nRakshasa. Asked by the former, the latter gave this answer. I will recite\r\nit to you. Listen to me. 'The mlecchas are the dirt of mankind: the\r\noilmen are the dirt of the Mlecchas; eunuchs are the dirt of oilmen; they\r\nwho avail of the priestly ministrations of Kshatriyas, in their\r\nsacrifices, are the dirt of eunuchs. The sin of those again that have the\r\nlast-named persons for their priests, of also of the Madrakas, shall be\r\nthine if thou do not abandon me.' Even this was declared by the Rakshasa\r\nto be the formula that should be used for curing a person possessed by a\r\nRakshasa or one killed by the energy of a poison. The words that follow\r\nare all very true. The Pancalas observe the duties enjoined in the Vedas;\r\nthe Kauravas observe truth; the Matsyas and the Surasenas perform\r\nsacrifices, the Easterners follow the practices of the Shudras; the\r\nSoutherners are fallen; the Vahikas are thieves; the Saurashtras are\r\nbastards. They that are defiled by ingratitude, theft, drunkenness,\r\nadultery with the wives of their preceptors, harshness of speech,\r\nslaughter of kine, lustful wanderings during the night out of home, and\r\nthe wearing of other people's ornaments,--what sin is there that they do\r\nnot incur? Fie on the Arattas and the people of the country of the five\r\nrivers! Commencing with the Pancalas, the Kauravas, the Naimishas, the\r\nMatsyas,--all these,--know what religion is. The old men among the\r\nNortherners, the Angas, the Magadhas, (without themselves knowing what\r\nvirtue is) follow the practices of the pious. Many gods, headed by Agni,\r\ndwell in the East. The pitris dwell in the South that is presided over by\r\nYama of righteous deeds. The West is protected by the mighty Varuna who\r\noverlooks the other gods there. The north is protected by the divine Soma\r\nalong with the Brahmanas. So Rakshasas and Pishacas protect the Himavat,\r\nthe best of mountains. The Guhyakas, O great king, protect the mountains\r\nof Gandhamadana. Without doubt, Vishnu, otherwise, called Janardana,\r\nprotects all creatures. (For all that the Vahikas have no especial\r\nprotectors among the gods). The Magadhas are comprehenders of signs; the\r\nKoshalas comprehend from what they see; the Kurus and the Pancalas\r\ncomprehend from a half-uttered speech; the Salwas cannot comprehend till\r\nthe whole speech is uttered. The Mountaineers, like the Sivis, are very\r\nstupid. The Yavanas, O king, are omniscient; the Suras are particularly\r\nso. The mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy. Other\r\npeoples cannot understand. The Vahikas resent beneficial counsels; as\r\nregards the Madrakas there are none amongst those (mentioned above.)\r\nThou, O Shalya, art so. Thou shouldst not reply to me. The Madrakas are\r\nregarded on Earth as the dirt of every nation. So the Madra woman is\r\ncalled the dirt of the whole female sex. They that have for their\r\npractices the drinking of spirits, the violation of the beds of their\r\npreceptors, the destruction of the embryo by procuring miscarriage, and\r\nthe robbing of other people's wealth, there is no sin that they have not.\r\nFie on the Arattas and the people of the country of the five rivers.\r\nKnowing this, be silent. Do not seek to oppose me. Do not let me slay\r\nKeshava and Arjuna, having slain thee first.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"The abandonment of the afflicted and the sale of wives\r\nand children are, O Karna, prevalent amongst the Angas whose king thou\r\nart. Recollecting those faults of thine that Bhishma recited on the\r\noccasion of the tale of Rathas and Atirathas, drive away thy wrath. Do\r\nnot be angry. Brahmanas may be found everywhere; Kshatriyas may be found\r\neverywhere; so also Vaishyas and Shudras, O Karna, women of chastity and\r\nexcellent vows may also be found everywhere. Everywhere men take delight\r\nin jesting with men and wounding one another. Lustful men also may be\r\nfound everywhere. Everyone on every occasion can command skill in\r\nspeaking of the faults of others. No one, however, knows his own faults,\r\nor knowing them, feels shame. Everywhere are kings devoted to their\r\nrespective religions, and employed in chastising the wicked. Everywhere\r\nmay be found virtuous men. It cannot be, O Karna, that all the people of\r\na country are sinful. There are men in many countries that surpass the\r\nvery gods by their behaviour.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then king Duryodhana stopped Karna and Shalya (from\r\ngoing on with their wordy warfare), addressing the son of Radha as a\r\nfriend, and beseeching Shalya with joined hands, Karna, O sire, was\r\nquieted by thy son and forbore saying anything more. Shalya also then\r\nfaced the enemy. Then Radha's son, smiling, once more urged Shalya,\r\nsaying, \"Proceed.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding then that unrivalled array of the Parthas made\r\nby Dhrishtadyumna which was capable of resisting all hostile armies,\r\nKarna proceeded, uttering leonine shouts and causing his car to produce a\r\nloud rattle. And he made the Earth to tremble with the loud din of\r\nmusical instruments. And that chastiser of foes, that hero in battle,\r\nseemed to tremble in rage. Duly disposing his own troops in\r\ncounter-array, O bull of Bharata's race, that hero of great energy made a\r\ngreat slaughter of the Pandava forces like Maghavat slaughtering the\r\nAsura host. Striking Yudhishthira then with many arrows, he placed the\r\neldest son of Pandu to his right.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'How, O Sanjaya, did the son of Radha dispose his\r\nforces in counter array to all the Pandavas headed by Dhristadyumna and\r\nprotected by Bhimasena, viz., all those great bowmen invincible by the\r\nvery gods? Who, O Sanjaya, stood in the wings and the further wings of\r\nour army? Dividing themselves properly, how were the warriors stationed?\r\nHow also did the sons of Pandu dispose their army in counter-array to\r\nmine? How also did that great and awful battle commence? Where was\r\nVibhatsu when Karna proceeded against Yudhishthira? Who could succeed in\r\nassailing Yudhishthira in the presence of Arjuna? That Arjuna who had\r\nvanquished, single-handed in former days, all creatures at Khandava, who\r\nelse that is desirous of life, save the son of Radha, would fight with\r\nhim?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear now of the formation of the arrays, the manner in\r\nwhich Arjuna came and how the battle was fought by both sides surrounding\r\ntheir respective kings. Sharadvata's son Kripa, O king, and the Magadhas\r\nendued with great activity, and Kritavarma of Satwata race, took up their\r\nposition in the right wing. Shakuni, and the mighty car-warrior Uluka,\r\nstanding on the right of these, and accompanied by many fearless Gandhara\r\nhorsemen armed with bright lances, and many mountaineers difficult to\r\ndefeat, numerous as flights of locusts, and grimlooking as Pishacas,\r\nprotected the (Kaurava) army. 34,000 unreturning cars of the samsaptakas,\r\nmad with desire of battle, with thy sons in their midst, and all desirous\r\nof slaying Krishna and Arjuna, protected the left side (of the Kaurava\r\narmy). On their left, the Kambojas, the Sakas, and the Yavanas, with cars\r\nand horse and foot, at the command of the Suta's son, stood, challenging\r\nArjuna and the mighty Keshava. In the centre, at the head of that host,\r\nstood Karna, clad in armour with beautiful coat of mail and adorned with\r\nAngadas and garlands, for protecting that point. Supported by his own\r\nangry sons, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, that hero, shone\r\nresplendent at the head of the army as he drew his bow repeatedly. The\r\nmighty-armed Duhshasana, possessed of the effulgence of the sun or fire\r\nwith tawny eyes and handsome features, riding on the neck of a huge\r\nelephant, surrounded by many troops, and stationed at the rear of the\r\narmy gradually approached for fight. Behind him came Duryodhana himself,\r\nO monarch, protected by his uterine brothers riding on beautiful steeds\r\nand cased in beautiful mail. Protected by the united Madrakas and the\r\nKekayas of exceeding energy, the king, O monarch, looked resplendent like\r\nIndra of a hundred sacrifices when surrounded by the celestials.\r\nAshvatthama and the other foremost of mighty car-warriors, and many\r\never-infuriate elephants shedding temporal secretions like the very\r\nclouds and ridden by brave Mlecchas, followed behind that car-force.\r\nDecked with triumphal standards and blazing weapons, those huge\r\ncreatures, ridden by warriors skilled in fighting from their backs,\r\nlooked beautiful like hills overgrown with trees. Many thousands of brave\r\nand unreturning warriors, armed with axes and swords, became the\r\nfootguards of those elephants. Gorgeously decked with horsemen and\r\ncar-warriors and elephants, that foremost of arrays looked exceedingly\r\nbeautiful like the array of the celestials or of the Asuras. That great\r\narray, formed according to the scheme of Brihaspati by its commander,\r\nwell-versed in ways of battle, seemed to dance (as it advanced) and\r\nstruck terror into the hearts of foes. Like ever-appearing clouds in the\r\nseason of rains, foot-soldiers and horsemen and car-warriors and\r\nelephants, longing for battle began to issue from the wings and further\r\nwings of that array. Then king Yudhishthira, beholding Karna at the head\r\nof the (hostile) army, addressed Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes, that\r\none hero in the world, and said these words, \"Behold, O Arjuna, the\r\nmighty array formed by Karna in battle. The hostile force looks\r\nresplendent with its wings and further wings. At sight of this vast\r\nhostile force, let such measures be adopted that it may not vanquish us.'\r\nThus addressed by the king, Arjuna replied with joined hands, 'Everything\r\nwill be done as thou sayest. Nothing will be otherwise. I will, O\r\nBharata, do that by which the destruction of the enemy may be compassed.\r\nBy slaying their foremost of warriors, I will achieve their destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"With that view, do thou proceed against the son of\r\nRadha, and let Bhimasena proceed against Suyodhana, Nakula against\r\nVirshasena, Sahadeva against the son of Subala, Satanika against\r\nDuhshasana, that bull amongst the Sinis, viz., Satyaki, against the son\r\nof Hridika, and Pandya against the son of Drona. I myself will fight with\r\nKripa. Let the sons of Draupadi with Shikhandi amongst them, proceed\r\nagainst the rest of the Dhartarashtras. Let the other warriors of our\r\narmy encounter our other foes.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira the just, Dhananjaya\r\nsaying, \"So be it,\" ordered his troops (to do the needful) and himself\r\nproceeded to the head of the army. That car for which the Leader of the\r\nuniverse, viz., Agni, who derives his effulgence from Brahman, became the\r\nsteeds, that car which was known amongst the gods as belonging to Brahman\r\nbecause it sprang first from Brahman himself, that car which in days of\r\nold had successively borne Brahman and Ishana and Indra and Varuna one\r\nafter another, riding on that primeval car, Keshava and Arjuna now\r\nproceeded to battle. Beholding that advancing car of wonderful aspect,\r\nShalya once more said unto Adhiratha's son, that warrior of great energy\r\nin battle, these words \"Yonder comes that car having white steeds yoked\r\nunto it and owning Krishna for its driver, that vehicle incapable of\r\nbeing resisted by all the troops, like the inevitable fruit of work.\r\nThere comes the son of Kunti, slaughtering his foes along the way,--he,\r\nthat is, about whom thou hadst been enquiring. Since tremendous is the\r\nuproar that is being heard, deep as the roar of the clouds, it is,\r\nwithout doubt, those high-souled ones, viz., Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.\r\nYonder ascends a cloud of dust that overspreads the welkin like a canopy.\r\nThe whole Earth, O Karna, seems to tremble, cut deep by the circumference\r\nof Arjuna's wheels. These violent winds are blowing on both sides of thy\r\narmy. These carnivorous creatures are yelling aloud and these animals are\r\nuttering fearful cries. Behold, O Karna, the terrible and portentous Ketu\r\nof vapoury form, making the hair to stand on end, hath appeared, covering\r\nthe Sun. Behold, diverse kinds of animals, all around in large packs, and\r\nmany mighty wolves and tigers are looking at the Sun. Behold those\r\nterrible Kankas and those vultures, assembled together in thousands,\r\nsitting with faces towards one another, in seeming discourse. Those\r\ncoloured yak-tails attached to thy great car are waving unquietly. Thy\r\nstandard also is trembling. Behold these thy beautiful steeds, of huge\r\nlimbs and great speed resembling that of soaring birds, are also\r\nquivering. From these portents, it is certain that kings, in hundreds and\r\nthousands, O Karna, deprived of life, will lie down on the ground for\r\neternal sleep. The loud uproar of conchs, making the hair to stand on\r\nend, is being heard. The sound also of drums and cymbals, O son of Radha,\r\nis being heard on all sides, as also the whizz of diverse kinds of\r\narrows, and the din made by cars and steeds and men. Listen also, O\r\nKarna, to the loud twang produced by the bow-strings of high-souled\r\nwarriors. Behold, O Karna, those banners of Arjuna, that are equipped\r\nwith rows of bells, and decked with golden moons and stars. Made by\r\nskilful artists out of cloths embroidered with gold and of diverse hues,\r\nthey are blazing with resplendence on Arjuna's car as they are shaken by\r\nthe wind, like flashes of lightning in a mass of clouds. Behold those\r\n(other) banners producing sharp sounds as they wave in the air. Those\r\ncar-warriors of the high-souled Pancalas, with flag-decked standards on\r\ntheir vehicles, are looking resplendent, O Karna, like the very gods on\r\ntheir celestial cars. Behold the heroic son of Kunti, the unvanquished\r\nVibhatsu (Arjuna) with that foremost of apes on his standard, advancing\r\nfor the destruction of the foe. There, on the top of Partha's standard,\r\nis to be seen that terrible ape, that enhancer of the fears of foes,\r\nattracting the gaze (of warriors) from every side. The discus, the mace,\r\nthe bow called Saranga and the conch (called Panchajanya) of the\r\nintelligent Krishna, as also his gem Kaustubha, look exceedingly\r\nbeautiful in him. The wielder of Saranga and the mace, viz., Vasudeva, of\r\ngreat energy, cometh, urging those white steeds endued with the fleetness\r\nof the wind. Yonder twangs Gandiva, drawn by Savyasaci. Those whetted\r\nshafts, sped by that strong-armed hero, are destroying his enemies. The\r\nEarth is strewn with the heads of unretreating kings, with faces\r\nbeautiful as the moon at full, and decked with large and expansive eyes\r\nof coppery hue. There the arms, looking like spiked maces, with weapons\r\nin grasp, and smeared with excellent perfumes, of warriors delighting in\r\nbattle and contending with uplifted weapons, are falling. Steeds with\r\neyes, tongues, and entrails drawn out along with their riders, are\r\nfalling and fallen and deprived of life lie prostrate on the Earth. Those\r\nlifeless elephants huge as mountain summits, torn, mangled, and pierced\r\nby Partha, are falling down like veritable hills. Those cars, looking\r\nlike the changeful forms of vapour in the sky, with their royal riders\r\nslain, are falling down like the celestial cars of the denizens of heaven\r\nupon the exhaustion of the latter's merits. Behold, the army is\r\nexceedingly agitated by the diadem-decked Arjuna, like herds of countless\r\ncattle by a maned lion. There the Pandava heroes, advancing for the\r\nattack, are slaying kings and large numbers of elephants and steeds and\r\ncar-warriors and foot-soldiers of thy army engaged in battle. There\r\nPartha, shrouded (by friends and foes and weapons and dust) is not to be\r\nseen, like the Sun shrouded by clouds. Only the top of his standard may\r\nbe seen and the twang of his bow-string may be heard. Thou art sure, O\r\nKarna, to behold today that hero of white steed with Krishna for his\r\ndriver, engaged in slaughtering his foes in battle. Thou art sure of\r\nbeholding him about whom thou hadst been enquiring. Today, O Karna, thou\r\nart sure to behold those two tigers among men, both of red eyes, both\r\nchastisers of foes, viz., Vasudeva and Arjuna, stationed on the same car.\r\nIf, O son of Radha, thou succeedest in slaying him that hath Keshava for\r\nhis driver and Gandiva for his bow, then thou shalt be our king.\r\nChallenged by the samsaptakas, Partha now proceedeth against them. That\r\nmighty warrior is engaged in making a great slaughter of his foes in\r\nbattle.\" Unto the ruler of the Madras who was saying so, Karna, in rage,\r\nsaid, \"Behold, Partha is assailed on all sides by the angry samsaptakas.\r\nLike the Sun shrouded by the clouds, Partha is no longer visible.\r\nPlunged, into that ocean of warriors, O Shalya, Arjuna is sure to perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Who is there that would slay Varuna with water, or quench\r\nfire with fuel? Who is there that would seize the wind, or drink off the\r\nocean? I regard thy act of afflicting Partha to be even such. Arjuna is\r\nincapable of being vanquished in battle by the very gods and the Asuras\r\nunited together and having Indra himself at their head. Or, suffer\r\nthyself to be gratified, and be of easy mind, having said those words\r\n(about thy capacity to slay Partha) Partha cannot be conquered in battle.\r\nAccomplish some other purpose thou mayst have in thy mind. He that would\r\nuplift this Earth on his two arms, or burn all creatures in wrath, or\r\nhurl the gods from heaven, may vanquish Arjuna in battle. Behold that\r\nother heroic son of Kunti, viz., Bhima, who is never fatigued with\r\nexertion, blazing with resplendence, mighty-armed, and standing like\r\nanother Meru. With wrath ever kindled and longing for revenge, Bhima of\r\ngreat energy stands there desirous of victory in battle, and remembering\r\nall his injuries. There that foremost of virtuous men, viz., king\r\nYudhishthira the just, that subjugator of hostile towns, stands difficult\r\nof being resisted by foes in battle. There stand those two tigers among\r\nmen, the twin Ashvinis, the two uterine brothers Nakula and Sahadeva,\r\nboth invincible in battle. Yonder may be seen the five sons of Krishna,\r\nthat have the features of Pancala princes. All of them, equal to Arjuna\r\nin battle, are standing, desirous of fight. There the sons of Drupada,\r\nheaded by Dhristadyumna, swelling with pride and energy,--heroes endued\r\nwith great energy,--have taken up their stand. There, that foremost one\r\namong the Satwatas, viz., Satyaki, irresistible like Indra, advanceth\r\nagainst us, from desire of fight, like the destroyer himself in wrath\r\nbefore our eyes.\" While those two lions among men were thus addressing\r\neach other, the two armies mingled fiercely in battle, like the currents\r\nof the Ganga and Yamuna.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the two armies, duly arrayed, thus mingled\r\nwith each other for battle, O Sanjaya, how did Partha assail the\r\nsamsaptakas, and how Karna assail the Pandavas? Tell me the incidents of\r\nthe battle in detail, for thou art skilled in narration. Listening to the\r\naccounts of the prowess of heroes in battle, I am never satiated.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Observing the vast hostile force stationed in that\r\nmanner, Arjuna arrayed his troops in proper form, in consequence of the\r\nevil policy of thy son. The vast Pandava force then, teeming with\r\nhorsemen and elephants and foot-soldiers and cars, and headed by\r\nDhrishtadyumna, looked exceedingly magnificent. With his steeds white as\r\npigeons, the son of Prishata, equal in splendour to the Sun or the Moon,\r\narmed with bow, looked resplendent like Death himself in embodied form.\r\nThe sons of Draupadi, desirous of battle, stood by the side of the son of\r\nPrishata. They were clad in excellent coats of mail, and armed with\r\nexcellent weapons, and all of them were endued with the prowess of\r\ntigers. Possessed of effulgent bodies, they followed their maternal uncle\r\nlike the stars appearing with the Moon. Beholding the samsaptakas\r\nstanding in array, Arjuna, with wrath excited, rushed against them,\r\ndrawing his bow Gandiva. The samsaptakas then, desirous of slaying\r\nArjuna, rushed against Partha, firmly resolved on victory, and making\r\ndeath their goal. That brave host of heroes, teeming with men, steeds,\r\ninfuriate elephants, and cars, began very quickly to afflict Arjuna.\r\nTheir encounter with Kiritin (Arjuna) became exceedingly furious. That\r\nencounter resembled the one that took place between Arjuna and the\r\nNivatakavachas, as we have heard. Partha cut off cars and steeds and\r\nstandards and elephants and foot-soldiers engaged in fight, with shafts\r\nand bows and swords and discs and battle axes, and uplifted arms with\r\nweapons in grasp, and the heads also of foes, by thousands upon\r\nthousands. The samsaptakas, regarding the car of Partha sunk in that deep\r\nvortex of warriors, uttered loud roars. Partha, however, slaying all his\r\nfoes in front, slew those that stood further off, and then those that\r\nwere on his right and his back, like Rudra himself in rage slaughtering\r\nall created things endued with life. The encounter that took place when\r\nthe Pancalas, the Cedis, and the Srinjayas faced thy troops was\r\nexceedingly fierce. Kripa and Kritavarma, and Shakuni the son of Subala,\r\nthose heroes difficult of defeat in battle, accompanied by troops that\r\nwere all cheerful, themselves filled with rage, and capable of smiting\r\ndown thick ranks of cars, fought with the Koshalas, the Kasis, the\r\nMatsyas, the Karusas, the Kaikayas, and the Surasenas, all of whom were\r\npossessed of great courage. That battle fraught with great slaughter and\r\ndestructive of body, life and sins, became conducive to fame, heaven, and\r\nvirtue, in respect of the Kshatriya, the Vaishya, and the Shudra heroes\r\nthat were engaged in it. Meanwhile the Kuru king Duryodhana with his\r\nbrothers, O bull of Bharata's race, and supported by many Kuru heroes and\r\nmany mighty Madraka car-warriors, protected Karna while the latter was\r\nengaged in battle with the Pandavas, the Pancalas, the Cedis, and\r\nSatyaki. Destroying that vast division with his sharp arrows, and\r\ncrushing many foremost of car-warriors Karna succeeded in afflicting\r\nYudhishthira. Cutting off the armour, the weapons, and the bodies of\r\nthousands of foes and slaying his foes by thousands and sending them to\r\nheaven and making them earn great fame, Karna caused his friends great\r\njoy. Thus, O sire, that battle destructive of men, steeds, and cars,\r\nbetween the Kurus and the Srinjayas, resembled the battle between the\r\ngods and the Asuras of old.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, how Karna, having caused a\r\ngreat slaughter penetrated into the midst of the Pandava troops, and\r\nstruck and afflicted king Yudhishthira. Who were those foremost of heroes\r\namong the Parthas that resisted Karna? Who were they whom Karna crushed\r\nbefore he could succeed in afflicting Yudhishthira?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the Parthas headed by Dhrishtadyumna stationed\r\nfor battle, that crusher of foes, viz., Karna, rushed impetuously against\r\nthe Pancalas. Like swans rushing towards the sea, the Pancalas, longing\r\nfor victory, rushed as quickly against that high-souled warrior advancing\r\nto the encounter. Then the blare of thousands of conchs, as if piercing\r\nthe heart by its shrillness, arose from both hosts, and the fierce peal\r\nalso of thousands of drums. The sound also of diverse musical instruments\r\nand the noise made by elephants and steeds and cars, and the leonine\r\nshouts of heroes, that arose there, became exceedingly awful. It seemed\r\nthat the whole Earth with her mountains and trees and oceans, the entire\r\nwelkin covered with wind-tossed clouds, and the whole firmament with the\r\nSun, the Moon, and the stars, trembled with that sound. All creatures\r\nregarded that noise to be even such and became agitated. Those amongst\r\nthem that were endued with little strength fell dead. Then Karna, excited\r\nwith great wrath, quickly invoking his weapons, began to smite the\r\nPandava army like Maghavat smiting the army of the Asuras. Penetrating\r\nthen into the Pandava host and shooting his arrows, Karna slew seven and\r\nseventy foremost of warriors among the Prabhadrakas. Then that foremost\r\nof car-warriors, with five and twenty sharp shafts equipped with goodly\r\nwings, slew five and twenty Pancalas. With many cloth-yard shafts\r\nequipped with wings of gold and capable of piercing the bodies of all\r\nfoes, that hero slew the Cedis by hundreds and thousands. While he was\r\nemployed in achieving those superhuman feats in battle, large throngs of\r\nPancala cars, O king, quickly surrounded him on all sides. Aiming then, O\r\nBharata, five irresistible shafts, Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana or\r\nVrisha, slew five Pancala warriors. The five Pancalas, O Bharata, that he\r\nslew in that battle were Bhanudeva and Citrasena and Senavindu and Tapana\r\nand Surasena. While the Pancala heroes were thus being slaughtered with\r\narrows in that great battle, loud cries of \"Oh\" and \"Alas\" arose from\r\namong the Pancala host. Then ten car-warriors among the Pancalas, O\r\nmonarch, surrounded Karna. Them, too, Karna speedily slew with his\r\nshafts. The two protectors of Karna's car wheels, viz., his two\r\ninvincible sons, O sire, that were named Sushena and Satyasena, began to\r\nfight, reckless of their very lives. The eldest son of Karna, viz., the\r\nmighty car-warrior Vrishasena, himself protected his father's rear. Then\r\nDhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, and the five sons of Draupadi, and Vrikodara,\r\nJanamejaya, and Shikhandi, and many foremost warriors among the\r\nPrabhadrakas, and many amongst the Cedis, the Kaikayas, and the Pancalas,\r\nthe twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and the Matsyas, all clad in mail,\r\nrushed fiercely upon Radha's son, skilled in smiting, from desire of\r\nslaying him. Pouring upon him diverse kinds of weapons and thick showers\r\nof arrows, they began to afflict him like the clouds afflicting the\r\nmountain breast in the season of rains. Desirous of rescuing their\r\nfather, the sons of Karna, all of whom were effectual smiters, and many\r\nother heroes, O king, of thy army, resisted those (Pandava) heroes.\r\nSushena, cutting off with a broad-headed arrow the bow of Bhimasena,\r\npierced Bhima himself with seven cloth-yard shafts in the chest, and\r\nuttered a loud roar. Then Vrikodara of terrible prowess, taking up\r\nanother tough bow and stringing it quickly, cut off Sushena's bow.\r\nExcited with rage and as if dancing (on his car), he quickly pierced\r\nSushena himself with ten arrows, and then pierced Karna, within the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, with seventy sharp shafts. With ten other shafts,\r\nBhima then felled Bhanusena, another son of Karna, with his steeds,\r\ndriver, weapons, and standard, in the very sight of the latter's friends.\r\nThe sightly head of that youth, graced with a face as beautiful as the\r\nMoon, cut off with a razor-headed arrow, looked like a lotus plucked from\r\nits stalk. Having slain Karna's son, Bhima began to afflict thy troops\r\nonce more. Cutting off the bows then of Kripa and Hridika's son, he began\r\nto afflict those two also. Piercing Duhshasana with three arrows made\r\nwholly of iron, and Shakuni with six, he deprived both Uluka and his\r\nbrother Patatri of their cars. Addressing Sushena next in these words,\r\nviz., \"Thou art slain.\" Bhima took up an arrow. Karna, however, cut off\r\nthat arrow and struck Bhima himself with three shafts. Then Bhima took up\r\nanother straight arrow of great impetuosity and sped it at Sushena. But\r\nVrisha cut that arrow also. Then Karna, desirous of rescuing his son, and\r\nwishing to make an end of the cruel Bhimasena, struck the latter with\r\nthree and seventy fierce arrows. Then Sushena taking up an excellent bow\r\ncapable of bearing a great strain, pierced Nakula with five arrows in the\r\narms and the chest. Nakula, then piercing his antagonist with twenty\r\nstrong shafts capable of bearing a great strain, uttered a loud roar and\r\ninspired Karna with fright. The mighty car-warrior Sushena, however, O\r\nking, piercing Nakula with ten shafts, quickly cut off the latter's bow\r\nwith a razor-headed arrow. Then Nakula, insensate with rage, took up\r\nanother bow, and resisted Sushena in that battle with nine shafts. That\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, O king, shrouding all the quarters with showers\r\nof arrows, slew Sushena's driver, and piercing Sushena himself again with\r\nthree shafts, and then with three other broad-headed arrows, cut off his\r\nbow of great strength into three fragments. Sushena also, deprived of his\r\nsenses in rage, took up another bow and pierced Nakula with sixty arrows\r\nand Sahadeva with seven. The battle raged fiercely, like that of the gods\r\nand the Asuras between those heroes striking one another. Satyaki,\r\nslaying the driver of Vrishasena with three arrows, cut off the latter's\r\nbow with a broad-headed shaft and struck his steeds with seven arrows.\r\nCrushing his standard then with another arrow, he struck Vrishasena\r\nhimself with three arrows in the chest. Thus struck, Vrishasena became\r\nsenseless on his car, but within the twinkling of an eye, stood up again.\r\nDeprived of his driver and steeds and car standard by Yuyudhana\r\n(Satyaki), Vrishasena then, armed with sword and shield, rushed against\r\nYuyudhana from desire of slaying him. Satyaki, however, as his antagonist\r\nrushed towards him, struck at his sword and shield with ten arrows\r\nequipped with heads like a boar's ear. Then Duhshasana, beholding\r\nVrishasena made carless and weaponless, quickly caused him to ascend his\r\nown car, and bearing him away from the spot, caused him to ride another\r\nvehicle. The mighty car-warrior Vrishasena then, riding on another\r\nvehicle, pierced the five sons of Draupadi with seventy and Yuyudhana\r\nwith five, and Bhimasena with four and sixty, and Sahadeva with five, and\r\nNakula with thirty, and Satanika with seven arrows, and Shikhandi with\r\nten, and king Yudhishthira with a hundred. These and many other foremost\r\nof heroes, O king, all inspired with desire of victory that great bowman,\r\nviz., the son of Karna, O monarch, continued to afflict with his shafts.\r\nThen, in that battle, the invincible Vrishasena continued to protect the\r\nrear of Karna. The grandson of Sini, having made Duhshasana driverless\r\nand steedless and carless by means of nine times nine arrows made wholly\r\nof iron, struck Duhshasana with ten shafts in the forehead. The Kuru\r\nprince then, riding on another car that was duly equipped (with all\r\nnecessary implements), once more began to fight with the Pandavas, from\r\nwithin the division of Karna. Then Dhristadyumna pierced Karna with ten\r\narrows, and the sons of Draupadi pierced him with three and seventy, and\r\nYuyudhana with seven. And Bhimasena pierced him with four and sixty\r\narrows, and Sahadeva with seven. And Nakula pierced him with thirty\r\narrows, and Satanika with seven. And the heroic Shikhandi pierced him\r\nwith ten and king Yudhishthira with a hundred. These and other foremost\r\nof men, O monarch, all inspired with desire of victory, began to grind\r\nthat great bowman, viz., the Suta's son, in that dreadful battle. That\r\nchastiser of foes, viz., the Suta's son of great heroism, performing\r\nquick evolutions with his car, pierced every one of those warriors with\r\nten arrows. We then, O king, witnessed the lightness of hand displayed by\r\nthe high-souled Karna and the power of his weapons. Indeed, what we saw\r\nappeared to be highly wonderful. People could not notice when he took up\r\nhis arrows, when he aimed them, and when he let them off. They only\r\nbeheld his enemies dying fast in consequence of his wrath. The sky, the\r\nfirmament, the Earth, and all the quarters seemed to be entirely shrouded\r\nwith sharp arrows. The firmament looked resplendent as if covered with\r\nred clouds. The valiant son of Radha, armed with the bow, and as if\r\ndancing (on his car), pierced each of his assailants with thrice as many\r\narrows as each of them had pierced him with. And once more piercing each\r\nof them, and his steeds, driver, car, and standard with ten arrows, he\r\nuttered a loud roar. His assailants then gave him a way (through which he\r\npassed out). Having crushed those mighty bowmen with showers of arrows,\r\nthe son of Radha, that crusher of foes, then penetrated, unresisted, into\r\nthe midst of the division commanded by the Pandava king. Having destroyed\r\nthirty cars of the unreturning Cedis, the son of Radha struck\r\nYudhishthira with many sharp arrows. Then many Pandava warriors, O king,\r\nwith Shikhandi and Satyaki, desirous of rescuing the king from the son of\r\nRadha, surrounded the former. Similarly all the brave and mighty bowmen\r\nof thy army resolutely protected the irresistible Karna in that battle.\r\nThe noise of diverse musical instrument arose then, O king, and the\r\nleonine shouts of brave warriors rent the sky. And the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas once more fearlessly encountered each other, the former headed\r\nby the Suta's son and the latter by Yudhishthira.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Piercing through the Pandava host, Karna, surrounded by\r\nthousands of cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers, rushed\r\ntowards king Yudhishthira the just. Cutting off with hundreds of fierce\r\nshafts the thousands of weapons sped at him by his foes, Vrisha\r\nfearlessly pierced through that host. Indeed, the Suta's son cut off the\r\nheads, the arms and the thighs of his enemies, who, deprived of life,\r\nfell down on the Earth. Others, finding their divisions broken, fled\r\naway. The Dravida, the Andhaka, and the Nishada foot-soldiers, urged on\r\nby Satyaki, once more rushed towards Karna in that battle, from desire of\r\nslaying him. Deprived of arms and head-gears, and slain by Karna with his\r\nshafts, they fell down simultaneously on the Earth, like a forest of Sala\r\ntree cut down (with the axe). Thus hundreds, thousands and ten thousands\r\nof combatants, deprived of life and filling the whole welkin with their\r\nfame, fell down with their bodies on the Earth. The Pandus and the\r\nPancalas obstructed Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, who careered\r\nwrathfully in battle like the Destroyer himself, even as people seek to\r\nobstruct a disease with incantations and drugs. Crushing all those\r\nassailants Karna once more rushed towards Yudhishthira, like an\r\nirresistible disease unchecked by incantations and drugs and\r\n(propitiatory) rites. At last checked by the Pandus, the Pancalas, and\r\nthe Kekayas, all of whom were desirous of rescuing the king, Karna could\r\nnot succeed in passing them over, like Death that is unable to vanquish\r\npersons conversant with Brahma. Then Yudhishthira, with eyes red in\r\nwrath, addressed Karna, that slayer of hostile heroes, who was held in\r\ncheck at a little distance from him, and said these words \"O Karna, O\r\nKarna, O thou of vain sight, O son of a Suta, listen to my words. Thou\r\nalways challengest the active Phalguna in battle. Obedient to the\r\ncounsels of Dhritarashtra's son, thou always seekest to oppose us.\r\nMustering thy great prowess, show thou today all thy might, all thy\r\nenergy, and all the hatred thou bearest towards the sons of Pandu. Today\r\nin dreadful encounter, I will purge thee of thy desire for battle.\"\r\nHaving said these words, the son of Pandu, O king, pierced Karna with ten\r\nshafts made entirely of iron and equipped with wings of gold. That\r\nchastiser of foes, and great bowman, viz., the Suta's son, O Bharata,\r\npierced Yudhishthira, with the greatest care, in return, with ten arrows\r\nequipped with heads like the calf's tooth. Thus pierced by the Suta's son\r\nin contempt, O sire, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira, blazed up with wrath\r\nlike a fire upon receiving butter. Bending his formidable bow decked with\r\ngold, the son of Pandu placed on his bow-string a whetted arrow capable\r\nof piercing the very hills. Drawing the bow to its fullest stretch, the\r\nking quickly sped that arrow, fatal as the rod of the Destroyer, from\r\ndesire of slaying the Suta's son. Sped by the king endued with great\r\nmight, that arrow whose whizz resembled the noise of the thunder,\r\nsuddenly pierced Karna, that mighty car-warrior, on his left side. Deeply\r\nafflicted by the violence of that stroke, the mighty-armed Karna with\r\nweakened limbs, fell into a swoon on his car, his bow dropping from his\r\nhand. Beholding Karna in that plight, the vast Dhartarashtra host uttered\r\ncries of \"Oh\" and \"Alas,\" and the faces of all the combatants became\r\ncolourless. Beholding the prowess of their king, on the other hand, O\r\nmonarch, amongst the Pandavas, leonine roars and shouts and confused\r\ncries of joy arose. The son of Radha, however, of cruel prowess,\r\nrecovering his senses soon enough, set his heart on the destruction of\r\nYudhishthira. Drawing his formidable bow called Vijaya that was decked\r\nwith gold, the Suta's son of immeasurable soul began to resist the son of\r\nPandu with his sharp shafts. With a couple of razor-headed arrows he slew\r\nin that encounter Candradeva and Dandadhara, the two Pancala princes,\r\nthat protected the two car wheels of the high-souled Yudhishthira. Each\r\nof those heroes, standing by the side of Yudhishthira's car, looked\r\nresplendent like the constellation Punarvasu by the side of the moon.\r\nYudhishthira, however, once more pierced Karna with thirty arrows. And he\r\nstruck Sushena and Satyasena, each with three arrows. And he pierced\r\neveryone of the protectors of Karna with three straight arrows. The son\r\nof Adhiratha then, laughing and shaking his bow inflicted a cutting wound\r\non the king's body with a broad-headed arrow, and again pierced him with\r\nsixty arrows and then uttered a loud shout. Then many foremost heroes\r\namongst the Pandavas, desirous of rescuing the king, rushed in wrath\r\ntowards Karna and began to grind him with their arrows. Satyaki and\r\nChekitana and Yuyutsu and Shikhandi and the sons of Draupadi and the\r\nPrabhadrakas, and the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva) and Bhimasena and\r\nShishupala and the Karushas, Matsyas, the Suras, the Kaikayas, the Kasis\r\nand the Kosalas, all these brave heroes, endued with great activity,\r\nassailed Vasusena. The Pancala prince Janamejaya then pierced Karna with\r\nmany arrows. The Pandava heroes, armed with diverse kinds of arrows and\r\ndiverse weapons and accompanied by cars and elephants and steeds, rushing\r\ntowards Karna, encompassed him on all sides, from desire of slaying him.\r\nThus assailed on all sides by the foremost of Pandava warriors, Karna\r\ninvoked into existence the brahmastra and filled all the points of the\r\ncompass with arrows. The heroic Karna then, like unto a blazing fire\r\nhaving shafts for its scorching flame, careered in battle, burning that\r\nforest of Pandavas troops. The high-souled Karna, that great bowman,\r\naiming some mighty weapons, and laughing the while, cut off the bow of\r\nthat foremost of men, Yudhishthira. Then aiming ninety straight arrows\r\nwithin the twinkling of an eye, Karna cut off, with those sharp shafts,\r\nthe armour of his antagonist. That armour, decked with gold and set with\r\ngems, looked beautiful, as it fell down, like a wind-tossed cloud\r\npenetrated by the rays of the Sun. Indeed, that armour, adorned with\r\ncostly brilliants, fallen off from the body of that foremost of men,\r\nlooked beautiful like the firmament in the night, bespangled with stars.\r\nHis armour cut off with those arrows, the son of Pritha, covered with\r\nblood, wrathfully hurled at the son of Adhiratha a dart made wholly of\r\niron. Karna, however, cut (into pieces) that blazing dart, as it coursed\r\nthrough the welkin, with seven shafts. That dart, thus cut off with those\r\nshafts of great bowman, fell down on the Earth. Then Yudhishthira,\r\nstriking Karna with four lances in his two arms and forehead and chest,\r\nrepeatedly uttered loud shouts. Thereupon blood spouted forth from the\r\nwounds of Karna, and the latter, filled with rage and breathing like a\r\nsnake, cut off his antagonist's standard and pierced the Pandava himself\r\nwith three broad-headed arrows. And he also cut off the couple of quivers\r\n(that his foe had) and the car (he rode) into minute fragments. Thereupon\r\nthe king, riding on another car unto which were yoked those steeds, white\r\nas ivory and having black hair on their tails, that used to bear him (to\r\nbattle), turned his face and began to fly. Thus did Yudhishthira began to\r\nretreat. His Parshni driver had been slain. He became exceedingly\r\ncheerless and unable to stay before Karna. The son of Radha then,\r\npursuing Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, cleansed himself by touching him\r\nin the shoulder with his own fair hand (the palm of which was) graced\r\nwith the auspicious signs of the thunderbolt, the umbrella, the hook, the\r\nfish, the tortoise, and the conchshell, and desired to seize him by\r\nforce. He then remembered the words of Kunti. Then Shalya addressed him,\r\nand said, \"Do not, O Karna, seize this best of kings. As soon as thou\r\nseizest him, he will reduce both thee and me to ashes.\" Then Karna, O\r\nking, laughing in mockery, addressed the son of Pandu and thus spoke unto\r\nhim disparagingly. \"How, indeed, born though thou art in a noble race,\r\nand observant though thou art of Kshatriya duties, wouldst thou leave the\r\nbattle in fear, desiring to save thy life? I think that thou art not\r\nwell-acquainted with the duties of Kshatriyas. Endued with Brahma-force,\r\nthou art indeed devoted to the study of the Vedas and the performance of\r\nsacrificial rites. Do not, O son of Kunti, fight again, and do not again\r\napproach brave warriors. Do not use harsh language towards heroes and do\r\nnot come to great battles. Thou mayst use such words, O sire, towards\r\nothers, but thou shouldst never address persons like us in that way. By\r\nusing such words towards persons like us, thou wouldst in battle meet\r\nwith this and other kinds of behaviour. Go back to thy quarters, O son of\r\nKunti, or thither where those two, viz., Keshava and Arjuna, are. Indeed,\r\nO king, Karna will never slay one like thee.\" Having said these words\r\nunto the son of Pritha, the mighty Karna, setting Yudhishthira free,\r\nbegan to slaughter the Pandava host like the wielder of the thunderbolt\r\nslaughtering the Asura host. That ruler of men, (viz., Yudhishthira,)\r\nthen, O king, quickly fled away. Beholding the king flying away, the\r\nCedis, the Pandavas, the Pancalas, and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki,\r\nall followed that monarch of unfading glory. And the sons of Draupadi,\r\nand the Suras, and the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, also followed the\r\nking. Beholding the division of Yudhishthira retreating, the heroic Karna\r\nbecame highly glad with all the Kurus and began to pursue the retreating\r\nforce. The din of battle-drums and conchs and cymbals and bows, and\r\nleonine shouts, arose from among the Dhartarashtra troops. Meanwhile\r\nYudhishthira, O thou of Kuru's race, quickly riding on the car of\r\nSrutakirti, began to behold the prowess of Karna. Then king Yudhishthira,\r\nthe just, seeing his troops fast slaughtered, became filled with rage,\r\nand addressing his warriors, commanded them, saying, \"Slay these enemies.\r\nWhy are ye inactive?\" Then the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas,\r\nheaded by Bhimasena, thus commanded by the king, all rushed against thy\r\nsons. The shouts then, O Bharata, of the warriors (of both hosts), and\r\nthe noise made by cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers, and\r\nthe clash of weapons, became tremendous. \"Exert,\" \"Strike,\" \"Face the\r\nfoe,\" were the words that the combatants addressed to one another as they\r\nbegan to slay one another in that dreadful battle. And in consequence of\r\nthe showers of shafts shot by them a shadow as that of the clouds seemed\r\nto spread over the field. And in consequence of those rulers of men,\r\ncovered with arrows, striking one another, they became divested of\r\nbanners and standards and umbrellas and steeds and drivers and weapons in\r\nthat battle. Indeed, those lords of Earth, deprived of life and limbs,\r\nfell down on the Earth. Looking like the mountain-summits in consequence\r\nof their uneven backs, huge elephants with their riders, deprived of\r\nlife, fell down like mountains riven by thunder. Thousands of steeds,\r\nwith their armour, equipments, and adornments all torn and broken and\r\ndisplaced, fell down, along with their heroic riders, deprived of life.\r\nCar-warriors with weapons loosened from their grasp, and deprived by\r\n(hostile) car-warriors of cars and life, and large bands of\r\nfoot-soldiers, slain by hostile heroes in that dreadful clash, fell down\r\nin thousands. The Earth became covered with the heads of heroic\r\ncombatants intoxicated with battle, heads that were adorned with large\r\nand expansive eyes of coppery hue and faces as beautiful as the lotus or\r\nthe moon. And people heard noises as loud in the sky as on the surface of\r\nthe Earth, in consequence of the sound of music and song proceeding from\r\nlarge bands of Apsaras on their celestial cars, with which those bands of\r\nheavenly choristers continually greeted the newly-arrived heroes slain in\r\nhundreds and thousands by brave enemies on Earth, and with which, placing\r\nthem on celestial cars, they repaired on those vehicles (towards the\r\nregion of Indra). Witnessing with their own eyes those wonderful sights,\r\nand actuated by the desire of going to heaven, heroes with cheerful\r\nhearts speedily slew one another. Car-warriors fought beautifully with\r\ncar-warriors in that battle, and foot-soldiers with foot-soldiers, and\r\nelephants with elephants, and steeds with steeds. Indeed, when that\r\nbattle, destructive of elephants and steeds and men, raged in this way,\r\nthe field became covered with the dust raised by the troops. Then enemies\r\nslew enemies and friends slew friends. The combatants dragged one another\r\nby their locks, bit one another with their teeth, tore one another with\r\ntheir nails, and struck one another with clenched fists, and fought one\r\nanother with bare arms in that fierce battle destructive of both life and\r\nsins. Indeed, as that battle, fraught with carnage of elephants and\r\nsteeds and men, raged on so fiercely, a river of blood ran from the\r\nbodies of (slain) human beings and steeds and elephants. And that current\r\ncarried away a large number of dead bodies of elephants and steeds and\r\nmen. Indeed, in that vast host teeming with men, steeds, and elephants,\r\nthat river formed by the blood of men and steeds and elephants and\r\nhorsemen and elephant-men, became miry with flesh and exceedingly\r\nterrible. And on that current, inspiring the timid with terror, floated\r\nthe bodies of men and steeds and elephants. Impelled by the desire of\r\nvictory, some combatants forded it and some remained on the other side.\r\nAnd some plunged into its depths, and some sank in it and some rose above\r\nits surface as they swam through it. Smeared all over with blood, their\r\narmour and weapons and robes--all became bloody. Some bathed in it and\r\nsome drank the liquid and some became strengthless, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace. Cars and steeds, and men and elephants and weapons and ornaments,\r\nand robes and armour, and combatants that were slain or about to be\r\nslain, and the Earth, the welkin, the firmament, and all the points of\r\nthe compass, became red. With the odour, the touch, the taste, and the\r\nexceedingly red sight of that blood and its rushing sound, almost all the\r\ncombatants, O Bharata, became very cheerless. The Pandava heroes then,\r\nheaded by Bhimasena and Satyaki, once more rushed impetuously against\r\nthat army already beaten. Beholding the impetuosity of that rush of the\r\nPandava heroes to be irresistible, the vast force of thy sons, O king,\r\nturned its back on the field. Indeed, that host of thine, teeming with\r\ncars and steeds and elephants and men no longer in compact array, with\r\narmour and coats of mail displaced and weapons and bows loosened from\r\ntheir grasp, fled away in all directions, whilst being agitated by the\r\nenemy, even like a herd of elephants in the forest afflicted by lions.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the Pandava heroes rushing impetuously towards\r\nthy host, Duryodhana, O monarch, endeavoured to check the warriors of his\r\narmy on all sides, O bull of Bharata race. Although, however, thy son\r\ncried at the top of his voice, his flying troops, O king, still refused\r\nto stop. Then one of the wings of the army and its further wing, and\r\nShakuni, the son of Subala, and the Kauravas well-armed turned against\r\nBhimasena in that battle. Karna also, beholding the Dhartarashtra force\r\nwith all its kings flying away, addressed the ruler of the Madras,\r\nsaying, \"Proceed towards the car of Bhima.\" Thus addressed by Karna, the\r\nruler of the Madras began to urge those foremost of steeds, of the hue of\r\nswans, towards the spot where Vrikodara was. Thus urged by Shalya, that\r\nornament of battle, those steeds approaching the car of Bhimasena,\r\nmingled in battle. Meanwhile, Bhima, beholding Karna approach, became\r\nfilled with rage, and set his heart on the destruction of Karna, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race. Addressing the heroic Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna, the\r\nson of Prishata, he said, \"Go you to protect king Yudhishthira of\r\nvirtuous soul. With difficulty he escaped from a situation of great peril\r\nbefore my very eyes. In my sight have the armour and robes of the king\r\nbeen cut off and torn, for Duryodhana's gratification, by Radha's son of\r\nwicked soul. I shall today reach the end of that woe, O son of Prishata.\r\nToday, either I shall slay Karna in battle, or he will slay me in\r\ndreadful battle. I tell thee truly. Today I make over the king to you as\r\nsacred pledge. With cheerful hearts exert ye today for protecting the\r\nking.\" Having said these words, the mighty-armed Bhima proceeded towards\r\nAdhiratha's son, making all the points of the compass resound with a loud\r\nleonine shout. Beholding Bhima, that delighter in battle, advancing\r\nquickly, the puissant king of the Madras addressed the Suta's son in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Behold, O Karna, the mighty-armed son of Pandu, who is\r\nfilled with rage. Without doubt, he is desirous of vomiting upon thee\r\nthat wrath which he has cherished for many years. Never before did I see\r\nhim assume such a form, not even when Abhimanyu was slain and the\r\nRakshasa Ghatotkaca. Filled with wrath, the form he hath now assumed,\r\nendued with the splendour of the all-destroying fire at the end of the\r\nYuga, is such that it seems he is capable of resisting the three worlds\r\nunited together.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'While the ruler of the Madras was saying these words\r\nunto the son of Radha, Vrikodara, excited with rage, came upon Karna.\r\nBeholding Bhima, that delighter in battle, approaching him in that way,\r\nthe son of Radha laughingly said unto Shalya these words, \"The words that\r\nthou, O ruler of the Madras, hast today spoken to me regarding Bhima, O\r\nlord, are without doubt all true. This Vrikodara is brave and is a hero\r\nfull of wrath. He is reckless in protecting his body, and in strength of\r\nlimbs he is superior to all. While leading a life of concealment in the\r\ncity of Virata, relying then on the might of his bare arms, for doing\r\nwhat was agreeable to Draupadi, he secretly slew Kichaka with all his\r\nrelatives. Even he stands today at the head of battle clad in mail and\r\ninsensate with wrath. He is ready to engage in battle with the Destroyer\r\narmed with uplifted mace. This desire, however, hath been cherished\r\nthrough all my days, viz., that either I shall slay Arjuna or Arjuna will\r\nslay me. That desire of mine may be fulfilled today in consequence of my\r\nencounter with Bhima. If I slay Bhima or make him carless, Partha may\r\ncome against me. That will be well for me. Settle that without delay\r\nwhich thou thinkest to be suitable to the hour.\" Hearing these words of\r\nRadha's son of immeasurable energy Shalya replied, saying, \"O thou of\r\nmighty arms, proceed against Bhimasena of great might. Having checked\r\nBhimasena, thou mayst then obtain Phalguna. That which is thy purpose,\r\nthat desire which for many long years thou hast cherished in thy heart,\r\nwill be accomplished, O Karna. I tell the truth.\" Thus addressed, Karna\r\nonce more said unto Shalya, \"Either I shall slay Arjuna in battle, or he\r\nwill slay me. Setting thy heart on battle proceed to the spot where\r\nVrikodara is.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then, O king, Shalya speedily proceeded on that car\r\nto the spot where that great bowman, viz., Bhima, was engaged in routing\r\nthy army. There rose then the blare of trumpets and the peal of drums, O\r\nmonarch, when Bhima and Karna met. The mighty Bhimasena, filled with\r\nrage, began to scatter thy troops difficult of defeat, with his sharp and\r\npolished shafts, to all sides. That collision in battle, O monarch,\r\nbetween Karna and the son of Pandu became, O king, fierce and awful, and\r\nthe noise that arose was tremendous. Beholding Bhima coming towards him,\r\nKarna, otherwise called Vaikartana or Vrisha, filled with rage, struck\r\nhim with shafts in the centre of the chest. And once more, Karna of\r\nimmeasurable soul, covered him with a shower of arrows. Thus pierced by\r\nthe Suta's son, Bhima covered the former with winged arrows. And he once\r\nmore pierced Karna with nine straight and keen shafts. Then Karna, with a\r\nnumber of arrows, cut in twain Bhima's bow at the handle. And after\r\ncutting off his bow, he pierced him once again in the centre of the chest\r\nwith a shaft of great keenness and capable of penetrating every kind of\r\narmour. Then Vrikodara, taking up another bow, O king, and knowing full\r\nwell what the vital parts of the body are, pierced the Suta's son with\r\nmany keen arrows. Then Karna pierced him with five and twenty arrows,\r\nlike a hunter striking a proud and infuriate elephant in the forest with\r\na number of blazing brands. His limbs mangled with those shafts, his eyes\r\nred with rage and the desire of revenge, the son of Pandu, insensate with\r\nwrath, and impelled by the desire of slaying the Suta's son, fixed on his\r\nbow an excellent shaft of great impetuosity, capable of bearing a great\r\nstrain, and competent to pierce the very mountains. Forcibly drawing the\r\nbow-string to his very ear, the son of the Wind-god, that great bowman,\r\nfilled with wrath and desirous of making an end of Karna, sped that\r\nshaft. Thus sped by the mighty Bhima, that shaft, making a noise loud as\r\nthat of the thunder, pierced through thunderbolt Karna in that battle,\r\nlike the thunderbolt itself piercing through a mountain. Struck by\r\nBhimasena, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, the Suta's son, that commander\r\n(of thy forces), sat down senseless on the terrace of his car. The ruler\r\nof the Madras then, beholding the Suta's son deprived of his senses, bore\r\nthat ornament of battle away on his car, from that fight. Then after\r\nKarna's defeat, Bhimasena began to rout the vast Dhartarashtra host like\r\nIndra routing the danavas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Exceedingly difficult of accomplishment was that\r\nfeat, O Sanjaya, which was achieved by Bhima who caused the mighty-armed\r\nKarna himself to measure his length on the terrace of his car. There is\r\nonly one person, Karna, who will slay the Pandavas along with the\r\nSrinjayas--even this is what Duryodhana, O Suta, used very often to say\r\nunto me. Beholding, however, that son of Radha now defeated by Bhima in\r\nbattle, what did my son Duryodhana next do?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Radha's son of the Suta caste turned back from\r\nthe fight in that great battle, thy son, O monarch, addressed his uterine\r\nbrothers, saying, \"Go ye quickly, blessed be ye, and protect the son of\r\nRadha who is plunged into that fathomless ocean of calamity represented\r\nby the fear of Bhimasena.\" Thus commanded by the king, those princes,\r\nexcited with wrath and desirous of slaying Bhimasena, rushed towards him\r\nlike insects towards a blazing fire. They were Srutarvan and Durddhara\r\nand Kratha and Vivitsu and Vikata and Soma, and Nishangin and Kavashin\r\nand Pasin and Nanda and Upanandaka, and Duspradharsha and Suvahu and\r\nVatavega and Suvarchasas, and Dhanurgraha and Durmada and Jalasandha and\r\nSala and Saha. Surrounded by a large car-force, those princes, endued\r\nwith great energy and might, approached Bhimasena and encompassed him on\r\nall sides. They sped at him from every side showers of arrows of diverse\r\nkinds. Thus afflicted by them, Bhima of great strength, O king, quickly\r\nslew fifty foremost car-warriors with five hundred others, amongst those\r\nsons of thine that advanced against him. Filled with rage, Bhimasena\r\nthen, O king, with a broad-headed arrow, struck off the head of Vivitsu\r\nadorned with earrings and head-gear, and graced with a face resembling\r\nthe full moon. Thus cut off, that prince fell down on the Earth.\r\nBeholding that heroic brother of theirs slain, the (other) brothers\r\nthere, O lord, rushed in that battle, from every side, upon Bhima of\r\nterrible prowess. With two other broad-headed arrows then, Bhima of\r\nterrible prowess took the lives of two other sons of thine in that\r\ndreadful battle. Those two, Vikata and Saha, looking like a couple of\r\ncelestial youths, O king, thereupon fell down on the Earth like a couple\r\nof trees uprooted by the tempest. Then Bhima, without losing a moment,\r\ndespatched Kratha to the abode of Yama, with a long arrow of keen point.\r\nDeprived of life, that prince fell down on the Earth. Loud cries of woe\r\nthen, O ruler of men, arose there when those heroic sons of thine, all\r\ngreat bowmen, were being thus slaughtered. When those troops were once\r\nmore agitated, the mighty Bhima, O monarch, then despatched Nanda and\r\nUpananda in that battle to Yama's abode. Thereupon thy sons, exceedingly\r\nagitated and inspired with fear, fled away, seeing that Bhimasena in that\r\nbattle behaved like the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga.\r\nBeholding those sons of thine slain, the Suta's son with a cheerless\r\nheart once more urged his steeds of the hue of swans to that place where\r\nthe son of Pandu was. Those steeds, O king, urged on by the ruler of\r\nMadras, approached with great speed the car of Bhimasena and mingled in\r\nbattle. The collision, O monarch, that once more took place between Karna\r\nand the son of Pandu in battle, became, O king, exceedingly fierce and\r\nawful and fraught with a loud din. Beholding, O king, those two mighty\r\ncar-warriors close with each other, I became very curious to observe the\r\ncourse of the battle. Then Bhima, boasting of his prowess in battle,\r\ncovered Karna in that encounter, O king, with showers of winged shafts in\r\nthe very sight of thy sons. Then Karna, that warrior acquainted with the\r\nhighest of weapons, filled with wrath, pierced Bhima with nine\r\nbroad-headed and straight arrows made entirely of iron. Thereupon the\r\nmighty-armed Bhima of terrible prowess, thus struck by Karna, pierced his\r\nassailant in return with seven shafts sped from his bow-string drawn to\r\nhis ear. Then Karna, O monarch, sighing like a snake of virulent poison,\r\nshrouded the son of Pandu with a thick shower of arrows. The mighty Bhima\r\nalso, shrouding that mighty car-warrior with dense arrowy downpours in\r\nthe very sight of the Kauravas, uttered a loud shout. Then Karna, filled\r\nwith rage, grasped his strong bow and pierced Bhima with ten arrows\r\nwhetted on stone and equipped with kanka feathers. With another\r\nbroad-headed arrow of great sharpness, he also cut off Bhima's bow. Then\r\nthe mighty-armed Bhima of great strength, taking up a terrible parigha,\r\ntwined round with hempen cords and decked with gold and resembling a\r\nsecond bludgeon of Death himself, and desiring to slay Karna outright,\r\nhurled it at him with a loud roar. Karna, however, with a number of\r\narrows resembling snakes of virulent poison, cut off into many fragments\r\nthat spiked mace as it coursed towards him with the tremendous peal of\r\nthunder. Then Bhima, that grinder of hostile troops, grasping his bow\r\nwith greater strength, covered Karna with keen shafts. The battle that\r\ntook place between Karna and the son of Pandu in that meeting became\r\nawful for a moment, like that of a couple of huge lions desirous of\r\nslaying each other. Then Karna, O king, drawing the bow with great force\r\nand stretching the string to his very ear, pierced Bhimasena with three\r\narrows. Deeply pierced by Karna, that great bowman and foremost of all\r\npersons endued with might then took up a terrible shaft capable of\r\npiercing through the body of his antagonist. That shaft, cutting through\r\nKarna's armour and piercing through his body, passed out and entered the\r\nEarth like a snake into ant-hill. In consequence of the violence of that\r\nstroke, Karna felt great pain and became exceedingly agitated. Indeed, he\r\ntrembled on his car like a mountain during an earthquake. Then Karna, O\r\nking, filled with rage and the desire to retaliate, struck Bhima with\r\nfive and twenty shafts, and then with many more. With one arrow he then\r\ncut off Bhimasena's standard, and with another broad-headed arrow he\r\ndespatched Bhima's driver to the presence of Yama. Next quickly cutting\r\noff the bow of Pandu's son with another winged arrow, Karna deprived\r\nBhima of terrible feats of his car. Deprived of his car, O chief of\r\nBharata's race, the mighty-armed Bhima, who resembled the Wind-god (in\r\nprowess) took up a mace and jumped down from his excellent vehicle.\r\nIndeed, jumping down from his car with great fury, Bhima began to slay\r\nthy troops, O king, like the wind destroying the clouds of autumn.\r\nSuddenly the son of Pandu, that scorcher of foes, filled with wrath,\r\nrouted seven hundred elephants, O king, endued with tusks as large as\r\nplough-shafts, and all skilled in smiting hostile troops. Possessed of\r\ngreat strength and a knowledge of what the vital parts of an elephant\r\nare, he struck them on their temples and frontal globes and eyes and the\r\nparts above their gums. Thereupon those animals, inspired with fear, ran\r\naway. But urged again by their drivers they surrounded Bhimasena once\r\nmore, like the clouds covering the Sun. Like Indra felling mountains with\r\nthunder, Bhima with his mace prostrated those seven hundred elephants\r\nwith their riders and weapons and standards. That chastiser of foes, the\r\nson of Kunti, next pressed down two and fifty elephants of great strength\r\nbelonging to the son of Subala. Scorching thy army, the son of Pandu then\r\ndestroyed a century of foremost cars and several hundreds of\r\nfoot-soldiers in that battle. Scorched by the Sun as also by the\r\nhigh-souled Bhima, thy army began to shrink like a piece of leather\r\nspread over a fire. Those troops of thine, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nfilled with anxiety through fear of Bhimasena, avoided Bhima in that\r\nbattle and fled away in all directions. Then five hundred car-warriors,\r\ncased in excellent mail, rushed towards Bhima with loud shouts, shooting\r\nthick showers of arrows on all sides. Like Vishnu destroying the Asuras,\r\nBhima destroyed with his mace all those brave warriors with their drivers\r\nand cars and banners and standards and weapons. Then 3,000 horsemen,\r\ndespatched by Shakuni, respected by all brave men and armed with darts\r\nand swords and lances, rushed towards Bhima. That slayer of foes,\r\nadvancing impetuously towards them, and coursing in diverse tracks, slew\r\nthem with his mace. Loud sounds arose from among them while they were\r\nbeing assailed by Bhima, like those that arise from among herd of\r\nelephants struck with large pieces of rocks. Having slain those 3,000\r\nexcellent horses of Subala's son in that way, he rode upon another car,\r\nand filled with rage proceeded against the son of Radha. Meanwhile, Karna\r\nalso, O king, covered Dharma's son (Yudhishthira) that chastiser of foes,\r\nwith thick showers of arrows, and felled his driver. Then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior beholding Yudhishthira fly away in that battle, pursued him,\r\nshooting many straight-coursing shafts equipped with Kanka feathers. The\r\nson of the Wind-god, filled with wrath, and covering the entire welkin\r\nwith his shafts, shrouded Karna with thick showers of arrows as the\r\nlatter pursued the king from behind. The son of Radha then, that crusher\r\nof foes, turning back from the pursuit, quickly covered Bhima himself\r\nwith sharp arrows from every side. Then Satyaki, of immeasurable soul, O\r\nBharata, placing himself on the side of Bhima's car, began to afflict\r\nKarna who was in front of Bhima. Though exceedingly afflicted by Satyaki,\r\nKarna still approached Bhima. Approaching each other those two bulls\r\namong all wielders of bows, those two heroes endued with great energy,\r\nlooked exceedingly resplendent as they sped their beautiful arrows at\r\neach other. Spread by them, O monarch, in the welkin, those flights of\r\narrows, blazing as the backs of cranes, looked exceedingly fierce and\r\nterrible. In consequence of those thousands of arrows, O king, neither\r\nthe rays of the Sun nor the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, could any longer be noticed either by ourselves or by the\r\nenemy. Indeed, the blazing effulgence of the Sun shining at mid-day was\r\ndispelled by those dense showers of arrows shot by Karna and the son of\r\nPandu. Beholding the son of Subala, and Kritavarma, and Drona's son, and\r\nAdhiratha's son, and Kripa, engaged with the Pandavas, the Kauravas\r\nrallied and came back to the fight. Tremendous became the din, O monarch,\r\nthat was made by that host as it rushed impetuously against their foes,\r\nresembling that terrible noise that is made by many oceans swollen with\r\nrains. Furiously engaged in battle, the two hosts became filled with\r\ngreat joy as the warriors beheld and seized one another in that dreadful\r\nmelee. The battle that commenced at that hour when the Sun had reached\r\nthe meridian was such that its like had never been heard or seen by us.\r\nOne vast host rushed against another, like a vast reservoir of water\r\nrushing towards the ocean. The din that arose from the two hosts as they\r\nroared at each other, was loud and deep as that which may be heard when\r\nseveral oceans mingle with one another. Indeed, the two furious hosts,\r\napproaching each other, mingled into one mass like two furious rivers\r\nthat run into each other.\r\n\r\n\"'The battle then commenced, awful and terrible, between the Kurus and\r\nthe Pandavas, both of whom were inspired with the desire of winning great\r\nfame. A perfect Babel of voices of the shouting warriors was incessantly\r\nheard there, O royal Bharata, as they addressed one another by name. He\r\nwho had anything, by his father's or mother's side or in respect of his\r\nacts or conduct, that could furnish matter for ridicule, was in that\r\nbattle made to hear it by his antagonist. Beholding those brave warriors\r\nloudly rebuking one another in that battle, I thought, O king, that their\r\nperiods of life had been run out. Beholding the bodies of those angry\r\nheroes of immeasurable energy a great fear entered my heart, respecting\r\nthe dire consequences that would ensue. Then the Pandavas, O king, and\r\nthe Kauravas also, mighty car-warriors all, striking one another, began\r\nto mangle one another with their keen shafts.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Those Kshatriyas, O monarch, harbouring feelings of\r\nanimosity against one another and longing to take one another's life,\r\nbegan to slay one another in that battle. Throngs of cars, and large\r\nbodies of horses, and teeming divisions of infantry and elephants in\r\nlarge numbers mingled with one another, O king, for battle. We beheld the\r\nfalling of maces and spiked bludgeons and Kunapas and lances and short\r\narrows and rockets hurled at one another in that dreadful engagement.\r\nArrowy showers terrible to look at coursed like flights of locusts.\r\nElephants approaching elephants routed one another. Horsemen encountering\r\nhorsemen in that battle, and car-warriors encountering car-warriors, and\r\nfoot-soldiers encountering foot-soldiers, and foot-soldiers meeting with\r\nhorsemen, and foot-soldiers meeting with cars and elephants, and cars\r\nmeeting with elephants and horsemen, and elephants of great speed meeting\r\nwith the three other kinds of forces, began, O king, to crush and grind\r\none another. In consequence of those brave combatants striking one\r\nanother and shouting at the top of their voices, the field of battle\r\nbecame awful, resembling the slaughter-ground of creatures (of Rudra\r\nhimself). The Earth, O Bharata, covered with blood, looked beautiful like\r\na vast plain in the season of rains covered with the red coccinella.\r\nIndeed, the Earth assumed the aspect of a youthful maiden of great\r\nbeauty, attired in white robes dyed with deep red. Variegated with flesh\r\nand blood, the field of battle looked as if decked all over with gold.\r\nLarge numbers of heads severed from trunks and arms and thighs and\r\nearrings and other ornaments displaced from the bodies of warriors, O\r\nBharata, and collars and cuirasses and bodies of brave bowmen, and coats\r\nof mail, and banners, lay scattered on the ground. Elephants coming\r\nagainst elephants tore one another with their tusks, O king. Struck with\r\nthe tusks of hostile compeers, elephants looked exceedingly beautiful.\r\nBathed in blood, those huge creatures looked resplendent like moving\r\nhills decked with metals, down whose breasts ran streams of liquid chalk.\r\nLances hurled by horsemen, or those held horizontally by hostile\r\ncombatants, were seized by many of those beasts, while many amongst them\r\ntwisted and broke those weapons. Many huge elephants, whose armour had\r\nbeen cut off with shafts, looked, O king, like mountains divested of\r\nclouds at the advent of winter. Many foremost of elephants pierced with\r\narrows winged with gold, looked beautiful like mountains, O sire, whose\r\nsummits are lighted with blazing brands. Some of those creatures, huge as\r\nhills, struck by hostile compeers, fell down in that battle, like winged\r\nmountains (when clipped of their wings). Others, afflicted with arrows\r\nand much pained by their wounds, fell down touching the Earth, in that\r\ndreadful battle, at their frontal globes or the parts between their\r\ntusks. Others roared aloud like lions. And many, uttering terrible\r\nsounds, ran hither and thither, and many, O king, uttered cries of pain.\r\nSteeds also, in golden trappings, struck with arrows, fell down, or\r\nbecame weak, or ran in all directions. Others, struck with arrows and\r\nlances or dragged down, fell on the Earth and writhed in agony, making\r\ndiverse kinds of motion. Men also, struck down, fell on the Earth,\r\nuttering diverse cries of pain, O sire; others, beholding their relatives\r\nand sires and grandsires, and others seeing retreating foes, shouted to\r\none another their well-known names and the names of their races. The arms\r\nof many combatants, decked with ornaments of gold, cut off, O king, by\r\nfoes, writhed on the ground, making diverse kinds of motions. Thousands\r\nof such arms fell down and sprang up, and many seemed to dart forward\r\nlike five-headed snakes. Those arms, looking like the tapering bodies of\r\nsnakes, and smeared with sandal paste, O king, looked beautiful, when\r\ndrenched with blood, like little standards of gold. When the battle,\r\nbecoming general, raged so furiously on all sides, the warriors fought\r\nwith and slew one another without distinct perceptions of those they\r\nfought with or struck. A dusty cloud overspread the field of battle, and\r\nthe weapons used fell in thick showers. The scene being thus darkened,\r\nthe combatants could no longer distinguish friends from foes. Indeed,\r\nthat fierce and awful battle proceeded thus. And soon there began to flow\r\nmany mighty rivers of the bloody currents. And they abounded with the\r\nheads of combatants that formed their rocks. And the hair of the warriors\r\nconstituted their floating weeds and moss. Bones formed the fishes with\r\nwhich they teemed, and bows and arrows and maces formed the rafts by\r\nwhich to cross them. Flesh and blood forming their mire, those terrible\r\nand awful rivers, with currents swelled by blood, were thus formed there,\r\nenhancing the fears of the timid and the joy of the brave. Those awful\r\nrivers led to the abode of Yama. Many plunged into those streams\r\ninspiring Kshatriyas with fear, and perished. And in consequence of\r\nvarious carnivorous creatures, O tiger among men, roaring and yelling on\r\nall sides, the field of battle became terrible like the domains of the\r\nking of the dead. And innumerable headless trunks rose up on all sides.\r\nAnd terrible creatures, gorging on flesh and drinking fat, and blood, O\r\nBharata, began to dance around. And crows and vultures and cranes,\r\ngratified with fat and marrow and other animals relishing flesh, were\r\nseen to move about in glee. They, however, O king, that were heroes,\r\ncasting off all fear which is so difficult of being cast off, and\r\nobserving the vow of warriors, fearlessly did their duty. Indeed, on that\r\nfield where countless arrows and darts coursed through the air, and which\r\nwas crowded with carnivorous creatures of diverse kinds, brave warriors\r\ncareered fearlessly, displaying their prowess. Addressing one another, O\r\nBharata, they declared their names and families. And many amongst them,\r\ndeclaring the names of their sires and families, O lord, began to crush\r\none another, O king, with darts and lances and battle-axes. During the\r\nprogress of that fierce and awful battle, the Kaurava army became\r\nstrengthless and unable to bear up any longer like a foundered vessel on\r\nthe bosom of the ocean.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that battle in which so many\r\nKshatriyas sank down, the loud twang of Gandiva, O sire, was heard above\r\nthe din on that spot, O king, where the son of Pandu was engaged in\r\nslaughtering the samsaptakas, the Kosalas, and the Narayana forces.\r\nFilled with rage and longing for victory, the samsaptakas, in that\r\nbattle, began to pour showers of arrows on Arjuna's head. The puissant\r\nPartha, however, quickly checking those arrowy showers, O king, plunged\r\ninto that battle, and began to slay many foremost of car-warriors.\r\nPlunging into the midst of that division of cars with the aid of his\r\nwhetted shafts equipped with Kanka feathers, Partha came upon Susharma of\r\nexcellent weapons. That foremost of car-warriors poured on Arjuna thick\r\nshowers of arrows. Meanwhile the samsaptakas also covered Partha with\r\ntheir shafts. Then Susharma, piercing Partha with ten shafts, struck\r\nJanardana with three in the right arm. With a broad-headed arrow then, O\r\nsire, he pierced the standard of Arjuna. Thereupon that foremost of apes,\r\nof huge dimensions, the handiwork of the celestial artificer himself,\r\nbegan to utter loud sounds and roared very fiercely, affrighting thy\r\ntroops. Hearing the roars of the ape, thy army became inspired with fear.\r\nIndeed, under the influence of a great fear, that army became perfectly\r\ninactive. That army then, as it stood inactive, O king, looked beautiful\r\nlike the Citraratha forest with its flowery burthen of diverse kinds.\r\nThen those warriors, recovering their senses, O chief of the Kurus, began\r\nto drench Arjuna with their arrowy downpours like the clouds drenching\r\nthe mountains. Then all of them encompassed the great car of the Pandava.\r\nAssailing him, they uttered loud roars although all the while they were\r\nbeing struck and slaughtered with sharp shafts. Assailing his steeds, his\r\ncar-wheels, his car-shaft, and every other limb of his vehicle, with\r\ngreat force, O sire, they uttered many leonine roars. Some among them\r\nseized the massive arms of Keshava, and some among them, O king, seized\r\nPartha himself with great joy as he stood on his car. Then Keshava,\r\nshaking his arms on the field of battle, threw down all those that had\r\nseized them, like a wicked elephant shaking down all the riders from his\r\nback. Then Partha, encompassed by those great car-warriors, and beholding\r\nhis car assailed and Keshava attacked in that manner became filled with\r\nrage, and overthrew a large number of car-warriors and foot-soldiers. And\r\nhe covered all the combatants that were close to him with many arrows,\r\nthat were fit for close encounters. Addressing Keshava then, he said,\r\n\"Behold, O Krishna, O thou of mighty arms, these countless samsaptakas\r\nengaged in accomplishing a fearful task although slaughtered in\r\nthousands. O bull amongst the Yadus, there is none on Earth, save myself,\r\nthat would be able to bear such a close attack on his car.\" Having said\r\nthese words, Vibhatsu blew his conch. Then Krishna also blew his conch\r\nfilling the welkin with its blare. Hearing that blare the army of the\r\nsamsaptakas began to waver, O king, and became inspired with great\r\nfright. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Pandu,\r\nparalysed the legs of the samsaptakas by repeatedly invoking, O monarch,\r\nthe weapon called Naga. Thus tied with those foot-tying bands by the\r\nhigh-souled son of Pandu, all of them stood motionless, O king, as if\r\nthey had been petrified. The son of Pandu then began to slay those\r\nmotionless warriors like Indra in days of yore slaying the Daityas in the\r\nbattle with Taraka. Thus slaughtered in that battle, they set the car\r\nfree, and commenced to throw down all their weapons. Their legs being\r\nparalysed, they could not, O king, move a step. Then Partha slew them\r\nwith his straight arrows. Indeed, all these warriors in that battle,\r\naiming at whom Partha had invoked that foot-tying weapon, had their lower\r\nlimbs encircled with snakes. Then the mighty car-warrior Susharma, O\r\nmonarch, beholding his army thus paralysed, quickly invoked the weapon\r\ncalled Sauparna. Thereupon numerous birds began to come down and devour\r\nthose snakes. The latter again, at the sight of rangers of the sky,\r\nbegan, O king, to fly away. Freed from that foot-tying weapon, the\r\nSamsaptaka force, O monarch, looked like the Sun himself giving light\r\nunto all creatures, when freed from clouds. Thus liberated, those\r\nwarriors once more shot their arrows, O sire, and hurled their weapons at\r\nArjuna's car. And all of them pierced Partha with numerous weapons.\r\nCutting off with his own arrowy downpour that shower of mighty weapons\r\nVasava's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, began to slaughter those\r\nwarriors. Then Susharma, O king, with a straight arrow, pierced Arjuna in\r\nthe chest, and then he pierced him with three other shafts. Deeply\r\npierced therewith, and feeling great pain, Arjuna sat down on the terrace\r\nof his car. Then all the troops loudly cried out, saying, \"Partha is\r\nslain.\" At this the blare of conchs, and the peal of drums, and the sound\r\nof diverse musical instruments, and loud leonine shouts, arose there.\r\nRecovering his senses, Partha of immeasurable soul, owning white steeds\r\nand having Krishna for his driver, speedily invoked the Aindra weapon.\r\nThen thousands of arrows, O sire, issuing from that weapon, were seen on\r\nall sides to slay kings and elephants. And steeds and warriors, in\r\nhundreds and thousands, were also seen to be slaughtered in that battle,\r\nwith these weapons. Then while the troops were thus being slaughtered, a\r\ngreat fear entered the hearts of all the samsaptakas and Gopalas, O\r\nBharata. There was no man amongst them that could fight with Arjuna.\r\nThere in the very sight of all the heroes, Arjuna began to destroy thy\r\ntroops. Beholding that slaughter, all of them remained perfectly\r\ninactive, without putting forth their prowess. Then the son of Pandu\r\nhaving slain full 10,000 combatants in that battle, looked resplendent, O\r\nmonarch, like a blazing fire without smoke. And then he slew full 14,000\r\nwarriors, and 3,000 warriors, and 3,000 elephants. Then the samsaptakas\r\nonce more encompassed Dhananjaya, making death or victory their goal. The\r\nbattle then that took place there between thy warriors and that mighty\r\nhero, viz., the diadem-decked son of Pandu became awful.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Kritavarma, and Kripa, and the son of Drona and the\r\nSuta's son, O sire, and Uluka, and Subala's son (Shakuni), and the king\r\nhimself, with his uterine brothers, beholding the (Kuru) army afflicted\r\nwith the fear of Pandu's son, unable to stand together, like a vessel\r\nwrecked on the ocean, endeavoured to rescue it with great speed. For a\r\nshort space of time, O Bharata, the battle that once more took place\r\nbecame exceedingly fierce, enhancing as it did the fears of timid and the\r\njoy of the brave. The dense showers of arrows shot in battle by Kripa,\r\nthick, as flights of locusts, covered the Srinjayas. Then Shikhandi,\r\nfilled with rage, speedily proceeded against the grandson of Gautama\r\n(Kripa) and poured upon that bull amongst Brahmanas his arrowy downpours\r\nfrom all sides. Acquainted with the highest weapons Kripa then checked\r\nthat arrowy downpour, and wrathfully pierced Shikhandi with ten arrows in\r\nthat battle. Then Shikhandi filled with rage, deeply pierced Kripa, in\r\nthat encounter, with seven straight arrows equipped with Kanka feathers.\r\nThe twice-born Kripa then, that great car-warrior, deeply pierced with\r\nthose keen arrows, deprived Shikhandi of his steeds, driver and car.\r\nJumping down from his steedless vehicle, the mighty car-warrior\r\n(Shikhandi) rushed impetuously at the Brahmana, having taken up a sword\r\nand a shield. As the Pancala prince advanced, Kripa quickly covered him\r\nwith many straight arrows in that encounter, which seemed exceedingly\r\nwonderful. Indeed, exceedingly wonderful was the sight that we then\r\nbeheld, even like the flying of rocks, for Shikhandi, O king, (thus\r\nassailed) remained perfectly inactive in that battle. Beholding Shikhandi\r\ncovered (with arrows) by Kripa, O best of the kings, the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Dhrishtadyumna speedily proceeded against Kripa. The great\r\ncar-warrior Kritavarma, however, rushing impetuously received\r\nDhrishtadyumna as the latter proceeded against the son of Sharadvata\r\n(Kripa). Then Drona's son checked Yudhishthira as the latter, with his\r\nson and troops, was rushing towards the car of Sharadvata's son. Thy son\r\nDuryodhana, shooting a shower of arrows, received and checked Nakula and\r\nSahadeva, those two great car-warriors endued with celerity. Karna too,\r\notherwise called Vaikartana, O Bharata, in that battle, resisted\r\nBhimasena, and the Karushas, the Kaikayas, and the Srinjayas. Meanwhile\r\nSharadvata's son, in that battle, O sire, with great activity, sped many\r\narrows at Shikhandi, as if for the purpose of burning him outright. The\r\nPancala prince, however, whirling his sword repeatedly, cut off all those\r\narrows, decked with gold, that had been sped at him by Kripa from all\r\nsides. The grandson of Gautama (Kripa) then quickly cut off with his\r\narrows the shield of Prishata's son, that was decked with hundred moons.\r\nAt this feat of his, the troops made a loud uproar. Deprived of his\r\nshield, O monarch, and placed under Kripa's power Shikhandi still rushed,\r\nsword in hand, (towards Kripa), like a sick man towards the jaws of\r\nDeath. Then Suketu, the son of Citraketu, O king, quickly proceeded\r\ntowards the mighty Shikhandi plunged into such distress and assailed in\r\nthat manner by Kripa with his arrows. Indeed, the young prince of\r\nimmeasurable soul rushed towards the car of Sharadvata's son and poured\r\nupon that Brahmana, in that battle, innumerable shafts of great keenness.\r\nBeholding that Brahmana observant of vows thus engaged in battle (with\r\nanother), Shikhandi, O best of kings, retreated hastily from that spot.\r\nMeanwhile Suketu, O king, piercing the son of Gautama with nine arrows,\r\nonce more pierced him with seventy and again with three. Then the prince,\r\nO sire, cut off Kripa's bow with arrow fixed thereon, and with another\r\nshaft struck hard the latter's driver in a vital limb. The grandson of\r\nGautama then, filled with rage, took up a new and very strong bow and\r\nstruck Suketu with thirty arrows in all his vital limbs. All his limbs\r\nexceedingly weakened, the prince trembled on his excellent car like a\r\ntree trembling exceedingly during an earthquake. With a razor-headed\r\narrow then, Kripa struck off from the prince's trunk, while the latter\r\nwas still trembling, his head decked with a pair of blazing earrings and\r\nhead-protector. That head thereupon fell down on the Earth like a piece\r\nof meat from the claws of a hawk, and then his trunk also fell down, O\r\nthou of great glory. Upon the fall of Suketu, O monarch, his troops\r\nbecame frightened, and avoiding Kripa, fled away on all sides.\r\n\r\n\"'Encompassing the mighty Dhrishtadyumna, Kritavarma cheerfully addressed\r\nhim saying, \"Wait, Wait!\" The encounter then that took place between the\r\nVrishni and the Pancala warriors in that battle became exceedingly\r\nfierce, like that between two hawks, O king, for a piece of meat. Filled\r\nwith rage, Dhrishtadyumna, in that battle, struck the son of Hridika\r\n(Kritavarma, the ruler of Bhoja) with nine arrows in the chest, and\r\nsucceeded in afflicting him greatly. Then Kritavarma, thus deeply struck\r\nby Prishata's son in that encounter, covered his assailant, his steeds,\r\nand his car with his shafts. Thus shrouded, O king, along with his car,\r\nDhrishtadyumna became invisible, like the Sun shrouded by rain-charged\r\nclouds. Baffling all those shafts decked with gold, Dhrishtadyumna, O\r\nking, looked resplendent in that battle in his wounds. The commander of\r\nthe Pandava forces, viz., the son of Prishata, then, filled with rage,\r\napproached Kritavarma and poured upon him a fierce shower of arrows. The\r\nson of Hridika, however, in that battle, with many thousands of his own\r\narrows, destroyed that fierce arrowy shower coursing towards him with\r\ngreat impetuosity. Beholding his irresistible shower of arrows checked in\r\nthat battle by Kritavarma, the son of Prishata, approaching his\r\nantagonist, began to resist him. And soon he despatched Kritavarma's\r\ndriver to Yama's abode with a broad-headed arrow of great sharpness.\r\nDeprived of life, the driver fell down from the car. The mighty\r\nDhrishtadyumna, having vanquished his mighty antagonist, began then to\r\nresist the Kauravas with shafts, without losing a moment. Then thy\r\nwarriors, O king, rushed towards Dhrishtadyumna, uttering loud leonine\r\nroars. At this a battle once more took place between them.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile the son of Drona (Ashvatthama), beholding\r\nYudhishthira protected by the grandson of Sini (Satyaki) and by the\r\nheroic sons of Draupadi, cheerfully advanced against the king, scattering\r\nmany fierce arrows equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone, and\r\ndisplaying diverse manoeuvres of his car and the great skill he had\r\nacquired and his exceeding lightness of hands. He filled the entire\r\nwelkin with shafts inspired with the force of celestial weapons.\r\nConversant with all weapons, Drona's son encompassed Yudhishthira in that\r\nbattle. The welkin being covered with the shafts of Drona's son, nothing\r\ncould be seen. The vast space in front of Ashvatthama became one expanse\r\nof arrows. The welkin then, thus covered with that dense shower of arrows\r\ndecked with gold, looked beautiful, O chief of the Bharatas, as if a\r\ncanopy embroidered with gold had been spread there. Indeed, the\r\nfirmament, O king, having been covered with that bright shower of arrows,\r\na shadow, as that of the clouds, appeared there on the occasion.\r\nWonderful was the sight that we then beheld when the sky had thus become\r\none expanse of arrows, for not one creature ranging the sky could course\r\nthrough his element. Then Satyaki, though struggling resolutely, and\r\nPandu's son king Yudhishthira the just, as also all the other warriors,\r\ncould not display their prowess. Beholding the great lightness of hands\r\ndisplayed by the son of Drona, the mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava\r\narmy) were filled with wonder. All the kings became incapable of even\r\nlooking at Ashvatthama, O monarch, who then resembled the scorching Sun\r\nhimself in the sky. While the Pandava troops were thus being slaughtered,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, viz., the sons of Draupadi, and Satyaki, and\r\nking Yudhishthira the just, and the Pancala warriors, all uniting\r\ntogether, cast off their fears of death and rushed against the son of\r\nDrona. Then Satyaki, piercing the son of Drona with seventy arrows, once\r\nmore pierced him with seven long shafts decked with gold. And\r\nYudhishthira pierced him with three and seventy arrows, and Prativindya\r\nwith seven, and Srutakarman pierced him with three arrows and Srutakirti\r\nwith five. And Sutasoma pierced him with nine arrows, and Satanika with\r\nseven. And many other heroes pierced him with many arrows from every\r\nside. Filled then with rage and breathing, O king, like a snake of\r\nvirulent poison, Drona's son pierced Satyaki in return with five and\r\ntwenty arrows whetted on stone. And he pierced Srutakirti with nine\r\narrows and Sutasoma with five, and with eight arrows he pierced\r\nSrutakarman, and Prativindya with three. And he pierced Satanika with\r\nnine arrows, and Dharma's son (Yudhishthira) with five. And each of the\r\nother warriors he pierced with a couple of shafts. With some keen arrows\r\nhe then cut off the bow of Srutakirti. The latter then, that great\r\ncar-warrior, taking up another bow, pierced Drona's son, first with three\r\narrows and then with many others equipped with sharp points. Then, O\r\nmonarch, the son of Drona covered the Pandava troops, O sire, with thick\r\nshowers of arrows, O bull of Bharata's race. Of immeasurable soul, the\r\nson of Drona, next smiling the while, cut off the bow of king\r\nYudhishthira the just, and then pierced him with three arrows. The son of\r\nDharma then, O king, taking up another formidable bow, pierced Drona's\r\nson with seventy arrows in the arms and the chest. Then Satyaki, filled\r\nwith rage in that battle, cut off the bow of Drona's son, that great\r\nsmiter, with a sharp crescent-shaped arrow and uttered a loud roar. His\r\nbow cut off, that foremost of mighty men viz., the son of Drona, quickly\r\nfelled Satyaki's driver from his car with a dart. The valiant son of\r\nDrona then, taking up another bow, covered the grandson of Sini, O\r\nBharata, with a shower of arrows. His driver having been slain, Satyaki's\r\nsteeds were seen to run hither and thither, O Bharata, in that battle.\r\nThen the Pandava warriors headed by Yudhishthira, shooting sharp shafts,\r\nall rushed with impetuosity towards Drona's son, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons. That scorcher of foes, however, viz., the son of\r\nDrona, beholding those warriors wrathfully advancing against him received\r\nthem all in that dreadful battle. Then like a fire in the forest\r\nconsuming heaps of dry grass and straw, that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nDrona's son, having showers of arrows for his flames, consumed the\r\nPandava troops in that battle, who resembled a heap of dry grass and\r\nstraw. That army of Pandu's son, thus scorched by the son of Drona,\r\nbecame exceedingly agitated, O chief of the Bharatas, like the mouth of a\r\nriver by a whale. People then, O monarch, beholding the prowess of\r\nDrona's son, regarded all the Pandavas as already slain by him. Then\r\nYudhishthira, that great car-warrior and disciple of Drona, filled with\r\nrage and the desire to retaliate, addressed Drona's son, saying \"O tiger\r\namong men, thou hast no affection, thou hast no gratitude, since thou\r\ndesirest to slay me today. The duties of a Brahmana are asceticism and\r\ngift and study. The bow should be bent by the Kshatriya only. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that thou art a Brahmana in name only. In thy very sight,\r\nhowever. O thou of mighty arms, I will vanquish the Kauravas in battle.\r\nDo what thou canst in battle. I tell thee that thou art a wretch amongst\r\nBrahmanas.\" Thus addressed, the son of Drona. smiling, and reflecting\r\nupon what was proper and true, gave no reply. Without saying anything, he\r\ncovered the son of Pandu in that battle with a shower of arrows like the\r\ndestroyer himself in wrath while engaged in annihilating creatures. Thus\r\ncovered by Drona's son. O sire, the son of Pritha quickly went away from\r\nthat spot, leaving that large division of his. After Yudhishthira, the\r\nson of Dharma, had gone away, the high-souled son of Drona also, O king,\r\nleft that spot. Then Yudhishthira, O king, avoiding the son of Drona in\r\nthat great battle proceeded against thy army, resolved to achieve the\r\ncruel task of slaughter.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Vikartana himself, resisting Bhimasena\r\nsupported by the Pancalas and the Cedis and the Kaikayas, covered him\r\nwith many arrows. In the very sight of Bhimasena, Karna, slew in that\r\nbattle many mighty car-warriors among the Cedis, the Karushas, and the\r\nSrinjayas. Then Bhimasena, avoiding Karna, that best of car-warriors,\r\nproceeded against the Kaurava troops like a blazing fire towards a heap\r\nof dry grass. The Suta's son also in that battle, began to slay the\r\nmighty bowmen amongst the Pancalas, the Kaikayas, and the Srinjayas, in\r\nthousands. Indeed, the three mighty car-warriors viz., Partha and\r\nVrikodara and Karna, began to exterminate the samsaptakas, the Kauravas,\r\nand the Pancalas, respectively. In consequence of thy evil policy, O\r\nking, all these Kshatriyas, scorched with excellent shafts by those three\r\ngreat warriors, began to be exterminated in that battle. Then Duryodhana,\r\nO chief of the Bharatas, filled with rage, pierced Nakula and his four\r\nsteeds with nine arrows. Of immeasurable soul, thy son next, O ruler of\r\nmen, cut off the golden standard of Sahadeva with a razor-faced shaft.\r\nFilled with wrath, Nakula then, O king, struck thy son with three and\r\nseventy arrows in that battle, and Sahadeva struck him with five. Each of\r\nthose foremost warriors of Bharata's race and foremost of all bowmen, was\r\nstruck by Duryodhana in rage with five arrows. With a couple of\r\nbroad-headed arrows, then, he cut off the bows of both those warriors;\r\nand then he suddenly pierced each of the twins with three and seventy\r\narrows. Taking up then two other beautiful and foremost of bows each of\r\nwhich resembled the bow of Indra himself, those two heroes looked\r\nbeautiful like a pair of celestial youths in that battle. Then those two\r\nbrothers, both endued with great activity in battle, poured upon their\r\ncousin, O king, ceaseless showers of terrible shafts like two masses of\r\nclouds, pouring rain upon a mountain breast. Thereupon thy son, that\r\ngreat car-warrior, O king filled with rage, resisted those two great\r\nbowmen, viz., the twin sons of Pandu, with showers of winged arrows. The\r\nbow of Duryodhana in that battle, O Bharata, seemed to be continuously\r\ndrawn into a circle, and shafts seemed to issue from it ceaselessly on\r\nall sides. Covered with Duryodhana's shafts the two sons of Pandu ceased\r\nto shine brightly, like the Sun and the Moon in the firmament, divested\r\nof splendour, when shrouded by masses of clouds. Indeed, those arrows, O\r\nking, equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone, covered all the\r\npoints of the compass like the rays of the Sun, when the welkin was thus\r\nshrouded and all that was seen was one uniform expanse of the Destroyer\r\nhimself, at the end of the Yuga. Beholding on the other hand, the prowess\r\nof thy son, the great car-warriors all regarded the twin sons of Madri to\r\nbe in the presence of Death. The commander then, O king, of the Pandava\r\narmy, viz., the mighty car-warrior Parshata (Son of Prishata) proceeded\r\nto that spot where Duryodhana was. Transgressing those two great\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the two brave sons of Madri, Dhrishtadyumna began to\r\nresist thy son with his shafts. Of immeasurable soul, that bull among\r\nmen, viz., thy son, filled with the desire to retaliate, and smiling the\r\nwhile, pierced the prince of Pancala with five and twenty arrows. Of\r\nimmeasurable soul and filled with the desire to retaliate, thy son once\r\nmore pierced the prince of Pancala with sixty shafts and once again with\r\nfive, and uttered a loud roar. Then the king, with a sharp razor-faced\r\narrow, cut off, in that battle, O sire, the bow with arrow fixed thereon\r\nand the leathern fence of his antagonist. Casting aside that broken bow,\r\nthe prince of Pancala, that crusher of foes, quickly took up another bow\r\nthat was new and capable of bearing a great strain. Blazing with\r\nimpetuosity, and with eyes red as blood from rage, the great bowman\r\nDhrishtadyumna, with many wounds on his person looked resplendent on his\r\ncar. Desirous of slaying Duryodhana, O chief of the Bharatas, the Pancala\r\nhero sped five and ten cloth-yard shafts that resembled hissing snakes.\r\nThose shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with the feathers of Kankas\r\nand peacocks, cutting through the armour decked with gold of the king\r\npassed through his body and entered the Earth in consequence of the force\r\nwith which they had been shot. Deeply pierced, O monarch, thy son looked\r\nexceedingly beautiful like a gigantic Kinsuka in the season of spring\r\nwith its flowery weight. His armour pierced with those shafts, and all\r\nhis limbs rendered exceedingly infirm with wounds, he became filled with\r\nrage and cut off Dhrishtadyumna's bow, with a broad-headed arrow. Having\r\ncut off his assailant's bow the king then, O monarch, with great speed,\r\nstruck him with ten shafts on the forehead between the two eyebrows.\r\nThose shafts, polished by the hands of the smith, adorned\r\nDhrishtadyumna's face like a number of bees, desirous of honey, adorning\r\na full-blown lotus. Throwing aside that broken bow, the high-souled\r\nDhrishtadyumna quickly took up another, and with it, sixteen broad-headed\r\narrows. With five he slew the four steeds and the driver of Duryodhana,\r\nand he cut off with another his bow decked with gold. With the remaining\r\nten shafts, the son of Prishata cut off the car with the upashkara, the\r\numbrella, the dart, the sword, the mace, and the standard of thy son.\r\nIndeed, all the kings beheld the beautiful standard of the Kuru king,\r\ndecked with golden Angadas and bearing the device of an elephant worked\r\nin jewels, cut off by the prince of the Pancalas. Then the uterine\r\nbrothers of Duryodhana, O bull of Bharata's race, rescued the carless\r\nDuryodhana who had all his weapons, besides, cut off in that battle. In\r\nthe very sight of Dhrishtadyumna, Durdhara, O monarch, causing that ruler\r\nof men to ride upon his car quickly bore him away from the battle.\r\n\r\n\"'Meanwhile the mighty Karna, having vanquished Satyaki and desirous of\r\nrescuing the (Kuru) king, proceeded straight against the face of Drona's\r\nslayer, that warrior of fierce shafts. The grandson of Sini, however,\r\nquickly pursued him from behind, striking him with his arrows, like an\r\nelephant pursuing a rival and striking him at the hinder limbs with his\r\ntusks. Then, O Bharata, fierce became the battle that raged between the\r\nhigh-souled warriors of the two armies, in the space that intervened\r\nbetween Karna and the son of Prishata. Not a single combatant of either\r\nthe Pandavas nor ourselves turned his face from the battle. Then Karna\r\nproceeded against the Pancalas with great speed. At that hour when the\r\nSun had ascended the meridian, great slaughter, O best of men, of\r\nelephants and steeds and men, took place on both sides. The Pancalas, O\r\nking, inspired with the desire of victory, all rushed with speed against\r\nKarna like birds towards a tree. The son of Adhiratha, of great energy,\r\nfilled with rage, began from their front to strike those Pancalas, with\r\nthe keen points of his shafts, singling out their leaders, viz.,\r\nVyaghraketu and Susharma and Citra and Ugrayudha and Jaya and Sukla and\r\nRochamana and the invincible Singhasena. Those heroes, speedily advancing\r\nwith their cars, encompassed that foremost of men, and poured their\r\nshafts upon that angry warrior, viz., Karna, that ornament of battle.\r\nThat foremost of men endued with great valour, viz., the son of Radha,\r\nafflicted those eight heroes engaged in battle with eight keen shafts.\r\nThe Suta's son possessed of great prowess, O king, then slew many\r\nthousands of other warriors skilled in fight. Filled with rage, the son\r\nof Radha then slew Jishnu, and Jishnukarman, and Devapi, O king, in that\r\nbattle, and Citra, and Citrayudha, and Hari, and Singhaketu and Rochamana\r\nand the great car-warrior Salabha, and many car-warriors among the Cedis\r\nbathed the form of Adhiratha's son in blood, while he himself was engaged\r\nin taking the lives of those heroes. There, O Bharata, elephants,\r\nassailed with arrows by Karna, fled away on all sides in fear and caused\r\na great agitation on the field of battle. Others assailed with the shafts\r\nof Karna, uttered diverse cries, and fell down like mountains riven with\r\nthunder. With the fallen bodies of elephants and steeds and men and with\r\nfallen cars, the Earth became strewn along the track of Karna's car.\r\nIndeed, neither Bhishma, nor Drona, nor any other warrior of thy army had\r\never achieved such feats as were then achieved by Karna in that battle.\r\nAmongst elephants, amongst steeds, amongst cars and amongst men, the\r\nSuta's son caused a very great carnage, O tiger among men. As a lion is\r\nseen to career fearlessly among a herd of deer, even so Karna careered\r\nfearlessly among the Pancalas. As a lion routeth a herd of terrified deer\r\nto all points of the compass, even so Karna routed those throngs of\r\nPancala cars to all sides. As a herd of deer that have approached the\r\njaws of a lion can never escape with life, even so those great\r\ncar-warriors that approached Karna could not escape with their lives. As\r\npeople are certainly burnt if they come in contact with a blazing fire,\r\neven so the Srinjayas, O Bharata, were burnt by the Karna-fire when they\r\ncame in contact with it. Many warriors among the Cedis and the Pancalas,\r\nO Bharata, that were regarded as heroes, were slain by the single-handed\r\nKarna in that battle who fought with them, proclaiming his name, in every\r\ninstance. Beholding the prowess of Karna, O king, I thought that a single\r\nPancala even would not, in that battle, escape from the son of Adhiratha.\r\nIndeed, the Suta's son in that battle repeatedly routed the Pancalas.\r\n\r\n\"'Beholding Karna thus slaughtering the Pancalas in that dreadful battle,\r\nKing Yudhishthira the just rushed in wrath towards him; Dhrishtadyumna\r\nand the sons of Draupadi also, O sire, and hundreds of warriors,\r\nencompassed that slayer of foes viz., the son of Radha. And Shikhandi,\r\nand Sahadeva, and Nakula, and Nakula's son, and Janamejaya, and the\r\ngrandson of Sini, and innumerable Prabhadrakas, all endued with\r\nimmeasurable energy, advancing with Dhrishtadyumna in their van, looked\r\nmagnificent as they struck Karna with shafts and diverse weapons. Like\r\nGaruda falling upon a large number of snakes, the son of Adhiratha,\r\nsinglehanded, fell upon all those Cedis and Pancalas and Pandavas in that\r\nencounter. The battle that took place between them and Karna, O monarch,\r\nbecame exceedingly fierce like that which had occurred in days of old\r\nbetween the gods and the Danavas. Like the Sun dispelling the surrounding\r\ndarkness, Karna fearlessly and alone encountered all those great bowmen\r\nunited together and pouring upon him repeated showers of arrows. While\r\nthe son of Radha was thus engaged with the Pandavas, Bhimasena, filled\r\nwith rage, began to slaughter the Kurus with shafts, every one of which\r\nresembled the lord of Yama. That great bowman, fighting single-handed\r\nwith the Bahlikas, and the Kaikayas, the Matsyas, the Vasatas, the\r\nMadras, and Saindhavas, looked exceedingly resplendent. There, elephants,\r\nassailed in their vital limbs by Bhima with his cloth-yard shafts fell\r\ndown, with their riders slain, making the Earth tremble with the violence\r\nof their fall. Steeds also, with their riders slain, and foot-soldiers\r\ndeprived of life, lay down, pierced with arrows and vomiting blood in\r\nlarge quantities. Car-warriors in thousands fell down, their weapons\r\nloosened from their hands. Inspired with the fear of Bhima, they lay\r\ndeprived of life, their bodies mangled with sounds. The Earth became\r\nstrewn with car-warriors and horsemen and elephant-men and drivers and\r\nfoot-soldiers and steeds and elephants all mangled with the shafts of\r\nBhimasena. The army of Duryodhana, O king, cheerless and mangled and\r\nafflicted with the fear of Bhimasena, stood as if stupefied. Indeed that\r\nmelancholy host stood motionless in that dreadful battle like the Ocean,\r\nO king, during a calm in autumn. Stupefied, that host stood even like the\r\nOcean in calm. However endued with wrath and energy and might, the army\r\nof thy son then, divested of its pride, lost all its splendour. Indeed,\r\nthe host, whilst thus being slaughtered became drenched with gore and\r\nseemed to bathe in blood. The combatants, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\ndrenched with blood, were seen to approach and slaughter one another. The\r\nSuta's son, filled with rage, routed the Pandava division, while\r\nBhimasena in rage routed the Kurus. And both of them, while thus\r\nemployed, looked exceedingly resplendent. During the progress of that\r\nfierce battle filling the spectators with wonder, Arjuna, that foremost\r\nof various persons, having slain a large number of samsaptakas in the\r\nmidst of their array, addressed Vasudeva, saying, \"This struggling force\r\nof samsaptakas, O Janardana, is broken. Those great car-warriors amongst\r\nthe samsaptakas are flying away with their followers, unable to bear my\r\nshafts, like deer unable to bear the roar of the lion. The vast force of\r\nthe Srinjayas also seems to break in this great battle. There that banner\r\nof the intelligent Karna, bearing the device of the elephant's rope, O\r\nKrishna, is seen in the midst of Yudhishthira's division, where he is\r\ncareering with activity. The other great car-warriors (of our army) are\r\nincapable of vanquishing Karna. Thou knowest that Karna is possessed of\r\ngreat energy as regards prowess in battle. Proceed thither where Karna is\r\nrouting our force. Avoiding (other warriors) in battle, proceed against\r\nthe Suta's son, that mighty car-warrior. This is what I wish, O Krishna.\r\nDo, however, that which thou likest.\" Hearing these words of his, Govinda\r\nsmiled, and addressing Arjuna, said, \"Slay the Kauravas, O son of Pandu,\r\nwithout delay.\" Then those steeds, white as swans, urged by Govinda, and\r\nbearing Krishna and the son of Pandu penetrated thy vast force. Indeed,\r\nthy host broke on all sides as those white steeds in trappings of gold,\r\nurged by Keshava, penetrated into its midst. That ape-bannered car, the\r\nclatter of whose wheels resembled the deep roar of the clouds and whose\r\nflags waved in the air, penetrated into the host like a celestial car\r\npassing through the welkin. Keshava and Arjuna, filled with rage, and\r\nwith eyes red as blood, as they penetrated, piercing through thy vast\r\nhost, looked exceedingly resplendent in their splendour. Both delighting\r\nin battle, as those two heroes, challenged by the Kurus, came to the\r\nfield, they looked like the twin Ashvinis invoked with proper rites in a\r\nsacrifice by the officiating priests. Filled with rage, the impetuosity\r\nof those two tigers among men increased like that of two elephants in a\r\nlarge forest, enraged at the claps of hunters. Having penetrated into the\r\nmidst of that car-force and those bodies of horse, Phalguna careered\r\nwithin those divisions like the Destroyer himself, armed with the fatal\r\nnoose. Beholding him put forth such prowess within his army, thy son, O\r\nBharata, once more urged the samsaptakas against him. Thereupon, with a\r\n1,000 cars, and 300 elephants, and 14,000 horses, and 200,00 of\r\nfoot-soldiers armed with the bow, endued with great courage, of sureness\r\nof aim and conversant with all the ways of battle, the leaders of the\r\nsamsaptakas rushed (from every side) towards the son of Kunti (in the\r\ngreat battle) covering the Pandava, O monarch, with showers of arrows\r\nfrom all sides. Thus covered with shafts in that battle, Partha, that\r\ngrinder of hostile forces, exhibited himself in a fierce form like the\r\nDestroyer himself, armed with the noose. While engaged in slaughtering\r\nthe samsaptakas, Partha became a worthy object of sight to all. Then the\r\nwelkin became filled with shafts decked with gold and possessed of the\r\neffulgence of lightning that were ceaselessly short by the diadem-decked\r\nArjuna. Indeed, everything completely shrouded with mighty shafts sped\r\nfrom Arjuna's arms and falling ceaselessly all around, looked\r\nresplendent, O lord, as if covered with snakes. The son of Pandu, of\r\nimmeasurable soul, shot on all sides his straight shafts equipped with\r\nwings of gold and furnished with keen points. In consequence of the sound\r\nof Partha's palms, people thought that the Earth, or the vault of the\r\nwelkin, or all the points of the compass, or the several oceans, or the\r\nmountains seemed to split. Having slain 10,000 kshatriyas, Kunti's son,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior, then quickly proceeded to the further wing of\r\nthe samsaptakas. Repairing to that further wing which was protected by\r\nthe Kambojas, Partha began to grind it forcibly with his arrows like\r\nVasava grinding the Danavas. With broad-headed arrows he began to quickly\r\ncut off the arms, with weapons in grasp, and also the heads of foes\r\nlonging to slay him. Deprived of diverse limbs, and of weapons, they\r\nbegan to fall down on the Earth, like trees of many boughs broken by a\r\nhurricane. While he was engaged in thus slaughtering elephants and steeds\r\nand car-warriors and foot-soldiers, the younger brother of Sudakshina\r\n(the chief of the Kambojas) began to pour showers of arrows on him. With\r\na couple of crescent-shaped arrows, Arjuna cut off the two arms, looking\r\nlike spiked maces, of his striking assailant, and then his head graced\r\nwith a face as beautiful as the full moon, with a razor-headed arrow.\r\nDeprived of life, he fell down from his vehicle, his body bathed in\r\nblood, like the thunder-riven summit of a mountain of red arsenic.\r\nIndeed, people saw the tall and exceedingly handsome younger brother of\r\nSudakshina, the chief of the Kambojas, of eyes resembling lotus petals,\r\nslain and fall down like a column of gold or like a summit of the golden\r\nSumeru. Then commenced a battle there once more that was fierce and\r\nexceedingly wonderful. The condition of the struggling combatants varied\r\nrepeatedly. Each slain with a single arrow, and combatants of the\r\nKamboja, the Yavana, and the Saka races, fell down bathed in blood, upon\r\nwhich the whole field of battle became one expanse of red, O monarch. In\r\nconsequence of car-warriors deprived of steeds and drivers, and steeds\r\ndeprived of riders, and elephants deprived of riders, and riders deprived\r\nof elephants, battling with one another, O king, a great carnage took\r\nplace. When the wing and the further wing of the samsaptakas had thus\r\nbeen exterminated by Savyasaci, the son of Drona quickly proceeded\r\nagainst Arjuna, that foremost of victorious warriors. Indeed, Drona's son\r\nrushed, shaking his formidable bow, and taking with him many terrible\r\narrows like the Sun himself appearing with his own rays. With mouth wide\r\nopen from rage and with the desire to retaliate, and with red eyes, the\r\nmighty Ashvatthama looked formidable like death himself, armed with his\r\nmace and filled with wrath as at the end of the Yuga. He then shot\r\nshowers of fierce shafts. With those shafts sped by him, he began to rout\r\nthe Pandava army. As soon as he beheld him of Dasharha's race (Keshava)\r\non the car, O king, he once more sped at him, and repeated showers of\r\nfierce shafts. With those falling shafts, O monarch, sped by Drona's son,\r\nboth Krishna and Dhananjaya were completely shrouded on the car. Then the\r\nvaliant Ashvatthama, with hundreds of keen arrows, stupefied both Madhava\r\nand the son of Pandu in that battle. Beholding those two protectors of\r\nall mobile and immobile creatures thus covered with arrows, the universe\r\nof mobile and immobile beings uttered cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" Crowds\r\nof Siddhas and Charanas began to repair to that spot from every side,\r\nmentally uttering this prayer, viz., \"Let good be to all the worlds.\"\r\nNever before, O king, did I see prowess like that of Drona's son in that\r\nbattle while he was engaged in shrouding the two Krishnas with shafts.\r\nThe sound of Ashvatthama's bow, inspiring foes with terror, was\r\nrepeatedly heard by us in that battle, O king, to resemble that of a\r\nroaring lion. While careering in that battle and striking right and left\r\nthe string of his bow looked beautiful like flashes of lightning in the\r\nmidst of a mass of clouds. Though endued with great firmness and\r\nlightness of hand the son of Pandu, for all that, beholding the son of\r\nDrona then, became greatly stupefied. Indeed, Arjuna then regarded his\r\nown prowess to be destroyed by his high-souled assailant. The form of\r\nAshvatthama became such in that battle that men could with difficulty\r\ngaze at it. During the progress of that dreadful battle between Drona's\r\nson and the Pandava, during that time when the mighty son of Drona, O\r\nmonarch, thus prevailed over his antagonist and the son of Kunti lost his\r\nenergy, Krishna became filled with rage. Inspired with wrath he drew deep\r\nbreaths, O king, and seemed to burn with his eyes both Ashvatthama and\r\nPhalguna as he looked at them repeatedly. Filled with rage, Krishna\r\naddressed Partha in an affectionate tone, saying, \"This, O Partha, that I\r\nbehold in battle regarding thee, is exceedingly strange, since Drona's\r\nson, O Partha, surpasseth thee today! Hast thou not now the energy and\r\nthe might of thy arms thou hadst before? Hast thou not that Gandiva still\r\nin thy hands, and dost thou not stay on thy car now? Are not thy two arms\r\nsound? Hath thy fist suffered any hurt? Why is it then that I see the son\r\nof Drona prevail over thee in battle? Do not, O Partha, spare thy\r\nassailant, regarding him as the son of thy preceptor, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace. This is not the time for sparing him.\" Thus addressed by Krishna,\r\nPartha speedily took up four and ten broad-headed arrows at a time, when\r\nspeed was of the highest moment, and with them he cut off Ashvatthama's\r\nbow and standard and umbrella and banners and car and dart and mace. With\r\na few calf-toothed arrows he then deeply struck the son of Drona in the\r\nlatter's shoulder. Thereupon overcome with a deep swoon, Ashvatthama sat\r\ndown, supporting himself on his flagstaff. The latter's driver then, O\r\nmonarch, desirous of protecting him from Dhananjaya, bore him away\r\ninsensible and thus deeply afflicted by the foe. Meanwhile that scorcher\r\nof foes, viz., Vijaya, slaughtered thy troops by hundreds and thousands,\r\nin the very sight of that hero, viz., thy son, O sire. Thus, O king, in\r\nconsequence of thy evil counsels, a cruel and awful destruction and\r\ncarnage commenced as thy warriors were engaged with the enemy. Within a\r\nshort time Vibhatsu routed the samsaptakas: Vrikodara, the Kurus, and\r\nVasusena, the Pancalas. During the progress of the battle destructive of\r\ngreat heroes, there rose many headless trunks all around. Meanwhile\r\nYudhishthira, O chief of the Bharatas, in great pain owing to his wounds,\r\nretreating about two miles from the battle, rested himself for some\r\ntime.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Duryodhana, O chief of Bharatas, repairing to Karna,\r\nsaid unto him as also unto the ruler of the Madras and the other lords of\r\nEarth present there, these words, \"Without seeking hath this occasion\r\narrived, when the gates of heaven have become wide open. Happy are those\r\nKshatriyas, O Karna, that obtain such a battle. Brave heroes fighting in\r\nbattle with brave Kshatriyas equal to them in might and prowess, obtain\r\ngreat good, O son of Radha. The occasion that hath come is even such.\r\nEither let these brave Kshatriyas, slaying the Pandavas in battle, obtain\r\nthe broad Earth, or let them, slain in battle by the foe, win the blessed\r\nregion reserved for heroes.\" Hearing these words of Duryodhana, those\r\nbulls among Kshatriyas cheerfully uttered loud shouts and beat and blew\r\ntheir musical instruments. When Duryodhana's force became thus filled\r\nwith joy, the son of Drona, gladdening all thy warriors further said, \"In\r\nthe very sight of all the troops, and before the eyes of you all, my\r\nfather after he had laid aside his weapons, was slain by Dhrishtadyumna.\r\nBy that wrath which such an act might kindle, and for the sake also of my\r\nfriend, ye kings, I swear truly before you all. Listen then to that oath\r\nof mine. Without slaying Dhrishtadyumna I shall not doff my armour. If\r\nthis vow of mine be not fulfilled, let me not go to heaven. Be it Arjuna,\r\nbe it Bhimasena, or be it anybody else, whoever will come against me I\r\nwill crush him or all of them. There is no doubt in this.\" After\r\nAshvatthama had uttered these words, the entire Bharata army, united\r\ntogether, rushed against the Pandavas, and the latter also rushed against\r\nthe former. The collision of brave leaders of car-divisions, O Bharata,\r\nbecame exceedingly awful. A destruction of life then set in at the van of\r\nthe Kurus and the Srinjayas, that resembled what takes place at the last\r\ngreat universal dissolution. Upon the commencement of that\r\npassage-at-arms, various (superior) beings, with the gods, came there\r\naccompanied by the Apsaras, for beholding those foremost of men. Filled\r\nwith joy, the Apsaras began to cover those foremost of men devoted to the\r\nduties of their order, with celestial garlands, with diverse kinds of\r\ncelestial perfumes, and with diverse species of gems. Soft winds bore\r\nthose excellent odours to the nostrils of all the foremost of warriors.\r\nHaving smelt those perfumes in consequence of the action of the wind, the\r\nwarriors once more engaged in battle, and striking one another began to\r\nfall down on the Earth. Strewn with celestial flowers, with beautiful\r\nshafts equipped with wings of gold, and with many foremost of warriors,\r\nthe Earth looked beautiful like the firmament bespangled with myriads of\r\nstars. Then in consequence of cheers coming from the welkin and the noise\r\nof musical instruments, the furious passage-at-arms distinguished by\r\ntwang of bows and clatter of car-wheels and shouts of warriors became\r\nexceedingly fierce.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thus raged that great battle between those lords of Earth\r\nwhen Arjuna and Karna and Bhimasena, the son of Pandu became angry.\r\nHaving vanquished the son of Drona, and other great car-warriors, Arjuna,\r\nO king, addressing Vasudeva, said, \"Behold, O Krishna of mighty arms, the\r\nPandava army is flying away. Behold, Karna is slaying our great\r\ncar-warriors in this battle. I do not, O thou of Dasaratha's race, see\r\nking Yudhishthira the just. Nor is the standard of Dharma's son, foremost\r\nof warriors, visible. The third part of the day still remaineth,\r\nJanardana. No one amongst the Dhartarashtras cometh against me for fight.\r\nFor doing, therefore, what is agreeable to me, proceed to the spot where\r\nYudhishthira is. Beholding Dharma's son safe and sound with his younger\r\nbrothers in battle, I will again fight with the foe, O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace.\" At these words of Vibhatsu, Hari (Krishna) quickly proceeded on\r\nthat car to that spot where king Yudhishthira, along with the mighty\r\nSrinjaya car-warriors of great strength, were fighting with the foe,\r\nmaking death their goal. During the progress of that great carnage,\r\nGovinda, beholding the field of battle, addressed Savyasaci, saying,\r\n\"Behold, O Partha, how great and awful is this carnage, O Bharata, of\r\nKshatriyas on Earth for the sake of Duryodhana. Behold, O Bharata, the\r\ngold-backed bows of slain warriors, as also their costly quivers\r\ndisplaced from their shoulders. Behold those straight shafts equipped\r\nwith wings of gold, and those clothyard arrows washed with oil and\r\nlooking like snakes freed from their sloughs. Behold, O Bharata, those\r\nscimitars, decked with gold, and having ivory handles, and those\r\ndisplaced shields embossed with gold. Behold those lances decked with\r\ngold, those darts having golden ornaments, and those huge maces twined\r\nround with gold. Behold those swords adorned with gold, those axes with\r\ngolden ornaments, and the heads of those battle-axes fallen off from\r\ntheir golden handles. Behold those iron Kuntas, those short clubs\r\nexceedingly heavy, those beautiful rockets, those huge bludgeons with\r\nspiked heads, those discs displaced from the arms of their wielders, and\r\nthose spears (that have been used) in this dreadful battle. Endued (while\r\nliving) with great activity, warriors that came to battle, having taken\r\nup diverse weapons, are lying, though deprived of life, as if still\r\nalive. Behold, thousands of warriors lying on the field, with limbs\r\ncrushed by means of maces, or heads broken by means of heavy clubs, or\r\ntorn and mangled by elephants and steeds and cars. The field of battle is\r\ncovered with shafts and darts and swords and axes and scimitars and\r\nspiked maces and lances and iron Kuntas and battle-axes, and the bodies\r\nof men and steeds and elephants, hacked with many wounds and covered with\r\nstreams of blood and deprived of life, O slayer of foes. The Earth looks\r\nbeautiful, O Bharata, with arms smeared with sandal, decked with Angadas\r\nof gold and with Keyuras, and having their ends cased in leathern fences.\r\nWith hands cased in leathern fences, with displaced ornaments, with\r\nsevered thighs looking like elephants' trunks of many active warriors,\r\nwith fallen heads, decked with costly gems and earrings, of heroes having\r\nlarge expansive eyes, the Earth looks exceedingly beautiful. With\r\nheadless trunks smeared all over with blood with severed limbs and heads\r\nand hips, the Earth looks, O best of the Bharatas, like an altar strewn\r\nwith extinguished fires. Behold those beautiful cars with rows of golden\r\nbells, broken in diverse ways, and those slain steeds lying scattered on\r\nthe field, with arrows yet sticking to their bodies. Behold those bottoms\r\nof cars, those quivers, those banners, those diverse kinds of standards,\r\nthose gigantic conchs of car-warriors, white in hue and scattered all\r\nover the field. Behold those elephants, huge as hills, lying on the\r\nEarth, with tongues lolling out, and those other elephants and steeds,\r\ndeprived of life and decked with triumphal banners. Behold those housings\r\nof elephants, and those skins and blankets, and those other beautiful and\r\nvariegated and torn blankets. Behold those rows of bells torn and broken\r\nin diverse ways in consequence of falling elephants of gigantic size, and\r\nthose beautiful goads set with stones of lapis lazuli, and those hooks\r\nfalling upon the ground. Behold those whips, adorned with gold, and\r\nvariegated with gems, still in the grasp of (slain) horsemen, and those\r\nblankets and skins of the Ranku deer falling on the ground but which had\r\nserved for seats on horse back. Behold those gems for adorning the\r\ndiadems of kings, and those beautiful necklaces of gold, and those\r\ndisplaced umbrellas and yak-tails for fanning. Behold the Earth, miry\r\nwith blood, strewn with the faces of heroes, decked with beautiful\r\nearrings and well-cut beards and possessed of the splendour of the moon\r\nand stars. Behold those wounded warriors in whom life is not yet extinct\r\nand who, lying all around, are uttering wails of woe. Their relatives, O\r\nprince, casting aside their weapons are tending them, weeping\r\nincessantly. Having covered many warriors with arrows and deprived them\r\nof life, behold those combatants, endued with activity longing for\r\nvictory, and swelling with rage, are once more proceeding for battle\r\nagainst their antagonists. Others are running hither and thither on the\r\nfield. Being begged for water by fallen heroes, others related to them\r\nhave gone in quest of drink. Many, O Arjuna, are breathing their last\r\nmeanwhile. Returning their brave relatives, seeing them become senseless\r\nare throwing down the water they brought and are running wildly, shouting\r\nat one another. Behold, many have died after having slaked their thirst,\r\nand many, O Bharata, are dying while drinking. Others, though\r\naffectionate towards relatives, are still seen to rush towards foes in\r\ngreat battle deserting their dear relatives. Others, again, O best of\r\nmen, biting their nether lips, and with faces rendered terrible in\r\nconsequence of the contraction of their brows, are surveying the field\r\nall around.\" While saying these words unto Arjuna, Vasudeva proceeded\r\ntowards Yudhishthira. Arjuna also, beholding the king in that great\r\nbattle, repeatedly urged Govinda, saying, \"Proceed, Proceed.\" Having\r\nshown the field of battle to Partha, Madhava, while proceeding quickly,\r\nslowly said unto Partha once more, \"Behold those kings rushing towards\r\nking Yudhishthira. Behold Karna, who resembles a blazing fire, on the\r\narena of the battle. Yonder the mighty-bowman Bhima is proceeding to\r\nbattle. They that are the foremost among the Pancalas, the Srinjayas, and\r\nthe Pandavas--they, that is, that have Dhrishtadyumna for their head, are\r\nfollowing Bhima. The vast army of the enemy is again broken by the\r\nrushing Parthas. Behold, O Arjuna, Karna is trying to rally the flying\r\nKauravas. Resembling the Destroyer himself in impetuosity and Indra\r\nhimself in prowess, yonder proceedeth Drona's son, O thou of Kuru's race,\r\nthat hero who is the foremost of all wielders of weapons. The mighty\r\ncarwarrior Dhrishtadyumna is rushing against that hero. The Srinjayas are\r\nfollowing the lead of Dhristadyumna. Behold, the Srinjayas are falling.\"\r\nThus did the invincible Vasudeva describe everything unto the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna. Then, O king, commenced a terrible and awful\r\nbattle. Loud leonine shouts arose as the two hosts encountered each\r\nother, O monarch, making death their goal. Even thus, O king, in\r\nconsequence of thy evil counsels, did that destruction set in on Earth, O\r\nlord of Earth, of both thy warriors and those of the enemy.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then the Kurus and the Srinjayas once more fearlessly\r\nencountered each other in battle, the Parthas being headed by\r\nYudhishthira, and ourselves headed by the Suta's son. Then commenced a\r\nterrible battle, making the hair to stand on end, between Karna and the\r\nPandavas, that increased the population of Yama's kingdom. After that\r\nfurious battle, producing rivers of blood, had commenced, and when a\r\nremnant only of the brave samsaptakas, O Bharata, were left\r\nunslaughtered, Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, with all the kings (on the\r\nPandava side) and those mighty car-warriors--the Pandavas themselves, all\r\nrushed against Karna only. Like the mountain receiving a vast body of\r\nwater, Karna, unaided by anyone, received in that battle all those\r\nadvancing warriors filled with joy and longing for victory. Those mighty\r\ncar-warriors encountering Karna, were beat off and broken like a mass of\r\nwater, and beat back on all sides when it encounters a mountain. The\r\nbattle, however, that took place between them and Karna made the hair\r\nstand on end. Then Dhrishtadyumna assailed the son of Radha with a\r\nstraight shaft in that battle, and addressing him said, \"Wait, Wait.\" The\r\nmighty car-warrior Karna, filled with rage, shook his foremost of bows\r\ncalled Vijaya, and cutting off the bow of Dhrishtadyumna, as also his\r\narrows resembling snakes of virulent poison assailed Dhrishtadyumna\r\nhimself with nine arrows. Those arrows, O sinless one, piercing through\r\nthe gold-decked armour of the high-souled son of Prishata, became bathed\r\nin blood and looked beautiful like so many cochineal. The mighty\r\ncar-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, casting aside that broken bow, took up\r\nanother bow and a number of shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison.\r\nWith those straight shafts numbering seventy, he pierced Karna.\r\nSimilarly, O king, Karna, in that battle, covered Prishata's son, that\r\nscorcher of foes, with many shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison.\r\nThe slayer of Drona, that great bowman, retaliated by piercing Karna with\r\nmany keen shafts. Filled with rage, Karna then, O monarch, sped at his\r\nantagonist a gold-decked shaft that resembled a second rod of death. That\r\nterrible shaft, O monarch, as it coursed impetuously towards Prishata's\r\nson, the grandson of Sini, O king, cut off into seven fragments,\r\ndisplaying great lightness of hand. Beholding his shaft baffled by the\r\narrows of Satyaki, O king, Karna resisted Satyaki with showers of arrows\r\nfrom every side. And he pierced Satyaki in that encounter with seven\r\nclothyard shafts. The grandson of Sini, however, pierced him in return\r\nwith many arrows decked with gold. The battle then that took place, O\r\nking, between those two warriors was such as to fill both spectators and\r\nlisteners with fear. Though awful, soon it became beautiful and deserving\r\nobjects of sight. Beholding the feats, in that encounter, of Karna and\r\nthe grandson of Sini, the hair of all the creatures there present seemed\r\nto stand on end. Meanwhile the mighty son of Drona rushed against\r\nPrishata's son, that chastiser of foes and queller of the prowess of all\r\nenemies. Filled with rage, Drona's son, that subjugator of hostile towns,\r\naddressing Dhrishtadyumna, said, \"Wait, wait, O slayer of a Brahmana,\r\nthou shalt not escape me today with life.\" Having said these words, that\r\nmighty car-warrior of great lightness of hand striving resolutely, deeply\r\npierced the brave son of Prishata, who also strove to the utmost of his\r\nprowess, with many keen and terrible shafts endued with great\r\nimpetuosity. As Drona (while alive), beholding the son of Prishata, O\r\nsire, had become cheerless and regarded him as his death, even so the son\r\nof Prishata, that slayer of hostile heroes, beholding Drona's son in that\r\nbattle, now regarded him as his death. Soon, however, remembering that he\r\nwas unslayable in battle by means of weapons, he rushed with great speed\r\nagainst Drona's son, like the Destroyer running against the Destroyer at\r\nthe time of the universal dissolution. Drona's heroic son, however, O\r\nmonarch, beholding Dhrishtadyumna stationed before him, drew deep\r\nbreaths, in wrath, and rushed towards him. Both of them were filled with\r\ngreat rage at the sight of each other. Endued with great activity, the\r\nvaliant son of Drona then, O monarch, said these words unto\r\nDhrishtadyumna staying not far from him, \"O wretch amongst the Pancalas,\r\nI shall today despatch thee to Yama. The sin thou hast committed before\r\nby slaying Drona will fill thee today with regret, to thy great evil, if\r\nthou stayest in battle without being protected by Partha, or if thou dost\r\nnot fly away, O fool, I tell thee truly.\" Thus addressed, the valiant\r\nDhrishtadyumna replied, saying, \"That same sword of mine which answered\r\nthy sire, resolutely engaged in battle, will today answer this speech of\r\nthine. If Drona could be slain by me, O thou that art a Brahmana in name\r\nonly, why should I not then, putting forth my prowess, slay thee also in\r\nbattle today?\" Having said these words, the wrathful commander of the\r\nPandava forces, viz., the son of Prishata, pierced Drona's son with a\r\nkeen arrow. Then Drona's son filled with great rage, shrouded every side\r\nof Dhrishtadyumna, O king, in that battle, with straight arrows. Shrouded\r\nwith thousands of arrows, neither the welkin, nor the points of the\r\ncompass, nor the combatants all around, could, O monarch, be any longer\r\nseen. Similarly, the son of Prishata, O king, shrouded Drona's son, that\r\nornament of battle, with arrows, in the very sight of Karna. The son of\r\nRadha, too, O monarch, singly resisted the Pancalas and the Pandavas and\r\nthe (five) sons of Draupadi and Yudhamanyu and the mighty car-warrior\r\nSatyaki, in consequence of which feat he became the cynosure of all eyes.\r\nThen Dhrishtadyumna in that battle cut off the very tough and formidable\r\nbow of Drona's son, as also all his arrows resembling snakes of virulent\r\npoison. Drona's son, however, with his arrows, destroyed within the\r\ntwinkling of an eye the bow, the dart, the mace, the standard, the\r\nsteeds, the driver, and the car of Prishata's son. Bowless and carless\r\nand steedless and driverless, the son of Prishata then took up a huge\r\nscimitar and a blazing shield decked with a hundred moons. Endued with\r\ngreat lightness of hand, and possessed of mighty weapons, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the heroic son of Drona, O king, quickly cut off, in\r\nthat battle, with many broad-headed arrows, those weapons also of\r\nDhrishtadyumna before the latter could come down from his car. All this\r\nseemed exceedingly wonderful. The mighty car-warrior Ashvatthama,\r\nhowever, though struggling vigorously, could not, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, slay the carless and steedless and bowless Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nalthough pierced and exceedingly mangled with many arrows. When,\r\ntherefore, O king, the son of Drona found that he could not slay his\r\nenemy with arrows, he laid aside his bow and quickly proceeded towards\r\nthe son of Prishata. The impetuosity of that high-souled one, as he\r\nrushed towards his foe, resembled that of Garuda swooping down for\r\nseizing a large snake. Meanwhile Madhava, addressing Arjuna, said,\r\n\"Behold, O Partha, how the son of Drona is rushing with great speed\r\ntowards the car of Prishata's son. Without doubt, he will slay the\r\nprince. O mighty-armed one, O crusher of foes, rescue the son of\r\nPrishata, who is now within the jaws of Drona's son as if within the jaws\r\nof Death himself.\" Having said these words, the valiant Vasudeva urged\r\nthe steeds towards that spot where Drona's son was. Those steeds, of the\r\nsplendour of the moon, urged by Keshava, proceeded towards the car of\r\nDrona's son, devouring the very skies. Beholding those two of great\r\nenergy, viz., Krishna and Dhananjaya, coming towards him, the mighty\r\nAshvatthama made great efforts for slaying Dhrishtadyumna soon. Seeing\r\nDhrishtadyumna dragged, O ruler of men by his enemy, the mighty Partha\r\nsped many arrows at the son of Drona. Those arrows, decked with gold and\r\nsped from Gandiva, approached the son of Drona and pierced him deeply\r\nlike snakes penetrating into an ant-hill. Thus pierced with those\r\nterrible arrows, the valiant son of Drona, O king, abandoned the Pancala\r\nprince of immeasurable energy. Indeed, the hero, thus afflicted with\r\nDhananjaya's shafts, mounted on his car, and taking up his own excellent\r\nbow, began to pierce Partha with many shafts. Meanwhile, the heroic\r\nSahadeva, O ruler of men, bore away on his car the son of Prishata, that\r\nscorcher of foes. Arjuna then, O king, pierced Drona's son with many\r\narrows. Filled with rage, Drona's son struck Arjuna in the arms and the\r\nchest. Thus provoked, Partha, in that battle, sped at Drona's son, a long\r\nshaft that resembled a second rod of Death, or rather, Death himself.\r\nThat arrow of great splendour fell upon the shoulder of the Brahmana\r\nhero. Exceedingly agitated, O monarch, in that battle, by the violence of\r\nthe stroke, he sat down on the terrace of his car and swooned away. Then\r\nKarna, O monarch, shook his bow Vijaya and, filled with rage, repeatedly\r\neyed Arjuna in that battle, desiring a single combat with him. Meanwhile\r\nthe driver of Drona's son, beholding the latter senseless, quickly bore\r\nhim away on his car from the field of battle. Beholding Prishata's son\r\nrescued and Drona's son afflicted, the Pancalas, O king, expectant of\r\nvictory, began to utter loud shouts. Thousands of sweet instruments began\r\nto be sounded. Seeing such wonderful feats in battle, the combatants\r\nuttered leonine roars. Having achieved that feat, Partha addressed\r\nVasudeva, saying \"Proceed, O Krishna, towards the samsaptakas, for this\r\nis greatly desired by me.\" Hearing those words of Pandu's son, he of\r\nDasharha's race proceeded on that car graced with many banners and whose\r\nspeed resembled that of the wind or the mind.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Krishna, pointing out king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, unto Kunti's son Partha, addressed him in these words: \"Yonder, O\r\nson of Pandu, your brother (Yudhishthira) is being pursued by many mighty\r\nand great bowmen amongst the Dhartarashtras, all inspired with the desire\r\nof slaughtering him. The mighty Pancalas, difficult of defeat in battle,\r\nare proceeding after the high-souled Yudhishthira from desire of rescuing\r\nhim. Yonder, Duryodhana, O Partha, the king of the whole world, clad in\r\nmail and accompanied by a large car force, is pursuing the Pandava king.\r\nImpelled by the desire of slaughtering his rival, the mighty Duryodhana,\r\nO tiger among men, is pursuing him, accompanied by his brothers, the\r\ntouch of whose weapons is as fatal as that of poisonous snakes and who\r\nare all conversant with every mode of warfare. Those Dhartarashtra\r\nelephants and horses and car-warriors and foot-soldiers are advancing to\r\nseize Yudhishthira like poor men after a precious gem. Behold, checked by\r\nSatyaki and Bhima, they have again been stupefied, like the Daityas, that\r\ndesired to take away the Amrita, made motionless by Sakra and Agni. The\r\nmighty car-warriors (of the Kuru army), however, in consequence of the\r\nvastness of their numbers, are again proceeding towards Yudhishthira like\r\na vast quantity of water in the season of rains rushing towards the\r\nocean. Those mighty bowmen are uttering leonine roars, blowing their\r\nconchs, and shaking their bows. I regard Kunti's son Yudhishthira, thus\r\nbrought under the influence of Duryodhana, to be already within the jaws\r\nof Death or already poured as a libation on the sacrificial fire. The\r\narmy of Dhritarashtra's son, O Pandava, is arrayed and equipped duly.\r\nSakra himself, coming within the range of its arrows, can scarcely\r\nescape. Who will in battle bear the impetuosity of the heroic Duryodhana\r\nwho shoots showers of arrows with the greatest celerity and who, when\r\nangry, resembles the Destroyer himself? The force of the heroic\r\nDuryodhana's shafts, or Drona's son's or Kripa's or Karna's would break\r\ndown the very mountains. That scorcher of foes, viz., king Yudhishthira,\r\nwas once compelled by Karna to turn his back upon the field. The son of\r\nRadha is endued with great might and great lightness of hand. Possessed\r\nof great skill, he is accomplished in battle. He is competent to afflict\r\nthe eldest son of Pandu in fight, specially when he is united with the\r\nmighty and brave son of Dhritarashtra. Of rigid vows, when the son of\r\nPritha (Yudhishthira) had been engaged in battle with all those warriors,\r\nother great car-warriors had struck him and contributed to his defeat.\r\nThe king, O best of the Bharatas, is exceedingly emaciated in consequence\r\nof his fasts. He is endued with Brahma-force, but the puissant one is not\r\nendued with much of Kshatriya-might. Assailed, however, by Karna, the\r\nroyal son of Pandu, Yudhishthira, that scorcher of foes, hath been placed\r\nin a situation of great peril. I think, O Partha, that king Yudhishthira\r\nhas fallen. Indeed, since that chastiser of foes, the wrathful Bhimasena,\r\ncoolly heareth the leonine roars of the frequently shouting\r\nDhartarashtra's longing for victory and blowing their conchs, I think, O\r\nbull among men, that Pandu's son Yudhishthira is dead. Yonder Karna urges\r\nforward the mighty car-warriors of the Dhartarashtras towards the son of\r\nPritha with the weapons called Sthunakarna, Indrasjaha and Pasupata, and\r\nwith clubs and other weapons. The king, O Bharata, must be deeply\r\nafflicted and exceedingly weakened, because the Pancalas and the\r\nPandavas, those foremost of all wielders of weapons, are seen to proceed\r\nwith great speed towards him at a time when speed is of the highest\r\nmoment like strong men rushing to the rescue of a person sinking in a\r\nbottomless sea. The king's standard is no longer visible. It has probably\r\nbeen struck down by Karna with his shafts. In the very sight of the\r\ntwins, O Partha, and of Satyaki and Shikhandi, and Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nBhima and Satanika, O lord, as also of all the Pancalas and the Cedis, O\r\nBharata, yonder Karna is destroying the Pandava division with his arrows,\r\nlike an elephant destroying an assemblage of lotuses. There, those\r\ncar-warriors of thy army, O son of Pandu, are flying away. See, see, O\r\nPartha, how those great warriors are retreating. Those elephants, O\r\nBharata, assailed by Karna in battle, are flying away in all directions,\r\nuttering cries of pain. There those crowds of car-warriors, routed in\r\nbattle, O Partha, by Karna, that crusher of foes, are flying away in all\r\ndirections. Behold, O Partha, that foremost of standards, of the Suta's\r\nson, on his car, bearing the device of the elephant's rope, is seen to\r\nmove all over the field. There, the son of Radha is now rushing against\r\nBhimasena, scattering hundreds of shafts as he proceeds and slaughtering\r\nthy army therewith. There, those mighty car-warriors of the Pancalas are\r\nbeing routed (by Karna) even as the Daityas had been routed by Sakra in\r\ndreadful battle. There, Karna, having vanquished the Pancalas, the\r\nPandus, and the Srinjayas, is casting his eyes on all sides, I think, for\r\nseeking thee. Behold, O Partha, Karna, as he beautifully draws his\r\nforemost of bows, looketh exceedingly beautiful even as Sakra in the\r\nmidst of the celestials, after vanquishing his foes. There the Kauravas,\r\nbeholding the prowess of Karna, are roaring and inspiring the Pandus and\r\nthe Srinjayas with fear on every side. There, Karna himself, terrifying\r\nthe Pandus with his whole soul, in dreadful battle, is addressing all the\r\ntroops, O giver of honours, saying, 'Blessed be ye, advance, ye Kauravas\r\nand rush with such speed that no Srinjaya may, in this battle escape with\r\nlife. United together, do this all of you. As regards ourselves, we will\r\nfollow behind you.' Saying these words, he is advancing behind (his\r\ntroops), scattering his shafts. Behold Karna, adorned with his white\r\numbrella in this battle and looking like the Udaya hills adorned by the\r\nmoon. With his beautiful umbrella of a hundred ribs, resembling the moon\r\nin full, held over his head, O Bharata, in this battle, Karna, O prince,\r\nis casting his glances after thee. Without doubt, he will, in this\r\nbattle, come hither, with great speed. Behold him, O mighty-armed one, as\r\nhe shaketh his formidable bow and shooteth, in this dreadful battle, his\r\nshafts resembling snakes of virulent poison. There, the son of Radha\r\nturneth towards this direction, beholding thy banner bearing the ape, and\r\ndesiring, O Partha, an encounter with thee, O scorcher of foes. Indeed,\r\nhe cometh for his own destruction, even like an insect into the mouth of\r\na lamp. Wrathful and brave, he is ever engaged in the good of\r\nDhritarashtra's son. Of wicked understanding, he is always unable to put\r\nup with thee. Beholding Karna alone and unsupported, Dhritarashtra's son,\r\nO Bharata, turneth towards him with great resolution, accompanied by his\r\ncar-force, for protecting him. Let that wicked-souled one, along with all\r\nthose allies of his, be slain by thee, putting forth thy vigour, from\r\ndesire of winning fame, kingdom and happiness. Both of you are endued\r\nwith great strength. Both of you are possessed of great celebrity. When\r\nencountering each other in battle, O Partha, like a celestial and a\r\nDanava in the great battle between the gods and the Asuras, let all the\r\nKauravas behold thy prowess. Beholding thee filled with great rage and\r\nKarna also excited to fury, O bull of Bharata's race, Duryodhana in wrath\r\nwill not be able to do anything. Remembering thyself to be of purified\r\nsoul, O bull of Bharata's race, and remembering also that the son of\r\nRadha harboureth a great animosity for the virtuous Yudhishthira, achieve\r\nthat, O son of Kunti, which should now be achieved. Righteously setting\r\nthy heart on battle, advance against that leader of car-warriors. There,\r\nfive hundred foremost of car-warriors, O thou best of car-warriors, that\r\nare endued with great might and fierce energy, and 5,000 elephants, and\r\ntwice as many horses, and innumerable foot-soldiers, all united together,\r\nO son of Kunti, and protecting one another, O hero, are advancing against\r\nthee. Show thyself, of thy own will, unto that great bowman, viz., the\r\nSuta's son. Advance, O bull of Bharata's race, towards him with great\r\nspeed. There, Karna, filled with great wrath is rushing against the\r\nPancalas. I see his standard approaching towards the car of\r\nDhrishtadyumna. I think he will exterminate the Pancalas. I will tell\r\nthee, O bull of Bharata's race, some good news, O Partha. King\r\nYudhishthira the just is living. There, the mighty-armed Bhima, having\r\nreturned, is stationed at the head of the army, supported by the\r\nSrinjayas and by Satyaki, O Bharata. There, the Kauravas are being\r\nslaughtered with keen shafts by Bhimasena, O son of Kunti, and the\r\nhigh-souled Pancalas. The troops of Dhritarashtra's son, with their faces\r\nturned from the field, and with blood streaming down from their wounds,\r\nare speedily flying away from battle, struck by Bhima with his shafts.\r\nBathed in blood, the Bharata army, O chief of Bharata's race, presents an\r\nexceedingly cheerless aspect like that of the Earth when divested of\r\ncrops. Behold, O son of Kunti, Bhimasena, that foremost of combatants,\r\nfilled with rage like a snake of virulent poison, and engaged in routing\r\nthe (Kaurava) host. Yellow and red and black and white banners, adorned\r\nwith stars and moons and suns as also many umbrellas, O Arjuna, lie\r\nscattered about. Made of gold or silver or brass and other metals,\r\nstandards are lying about, and elephants and steeds also, scattered all\r\nover the field. There, those car-warriors are falling from their cars,\r\ndeprived of life by the unreturning Pancalas with shafts of diverse\r\nkinds. There the Pancalas of great speed, O Dhananjaya, are rushing\r\nagainst the riderless Dhartarashtra elephants and steeds and cars.\r\nReckless of their very lives, O chastiser of foes, those warriors,\r\ndifficult of defeat in battle aided by the might of Bhimasena are\r\ncrushing, O tiger among men, the hostile force. There, the Pancalas are\r\nuttering loud roars and blowing their conchs as they are rushing against\r\ntheir foes and crushing them with their shafts in battle. Behold their\r\ngreat energy and power. Through sheer valour, the Pancalas are\r\nslaughtering the Dhartarashtras like angry lions slaying elephants.\r\nUnarmed they are snatching the weapons of their armed foes and with those\r\nweapons thus snatched, they are slaying their foes that are effectual\r\nsmiters, and uttering loud roars. The heads and arms of their foes are\r\nbeing struck off and felled on the field. The Pancala cars and elephants\r\nand horses are all worthy of the highest praise. Like swans of great\r\nspeed leaving the Manasa lake and rushing into the Ganga, the Pancalas\r\nare rushing against the Kauravas, and every part of the vast\r\nDhartarashtra force is assailed by them. Like bulls resisting bulls, the\r\nheroic Kripa and Karna and other leaders are putting forth all their\r\nvalour for resisting the Pancalas. The Pancala heroes headed by\r\nDhrishtadyumna are slaying thousands of their foes, viz., the great\r\ncar-warriors of the Dhartarashtra army already sinking in the ocean of\r\nBhima's weapons. Beholding the Pancalas overwhelmed by their foes, the\r\nfearless son of the Wind-god, assailing the hostile force, is shooting\r\nhis shafts and uttering loud roars. The greater portion of the vast\r\nDhartarashtra army has become exceedingly frightened. Behold those\r\nelephants, pierced by Bhima with his cloth-yard shafts, are falling down\r\nlike mountain summits riven by the thunderbolt of Indra. There, those\r\nhuge elephants, deeply pierced with the straight shafts of Bhimasena are\r\nflying away, crushing their own ranks. Dost thou not recognise the\r\nunbearable leonine shouts, O Arjuna, of the terribly-roaring Bhimasena\r\ninspired with desire of victory in battle? There, the prince of the\r\nNishadas, filled with rage, is coming against the son of Pandu, on his\r\nforemost of elephants, from desire of slaying him with his lances, even\r\nlike Destroyer himself armed with his bludgeon. Struck by Bhima with ten\r\nkeen cloth-yard shafts endued with the splendour of the fire or the Sun,\r\nthe two arms of the roaring prince, with lances in grasp, are lopped off.\r\nStaying the prince, Bhima proceedeth against other elephants looking like\r\nmasses of blue clouds and ridden by riders guiding them with skill.\r\nBehold those riders striking Vrikodara with darts and lances in\r\nprofusion. Slaying with his keen shafts those elephants, seven at a time,\r\ntheir triumphal standards also, O Partha, are cut down by thy elder\r\nbrother. As regards those other elephants, each of them is being slain\r\nwith ten shafts by him. The shouts of the Dhartarashtras are no longer\r\nheard, now that Bhima, O bull of Bharata's race, who is equal to\r\nPurandara himself, is engaged in battle. Full three akshauhinis of\r\nDuryodhana's soldiers had been assembled together (in front of Bhima).\r\nThey have all been checked by that lion among men, Bhimasena, in wrath.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Behold that feat, difficult of accomplishment,\r\nachieved by Bhimasena. Arjuna, with his keen shafts, destroyed the\r\nremnant of his foes. The mighty samsaptakas, O lord, slaughtered in\r\nbattle and routed (by Arjuna), fled away in all directions, overcome with\r\nfear. Many amongst them (that fell) became the guests of Shakra and\r\nattained to great happiness. As regards Partha, that tiger among men, he\r\ncontinued, with his straight shafts, to slaughter the Dhartarashtra host\r\nconsisting of four kinds of forces.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When Bhima and Pandu's son Yudhishthira were\r\nengaged in battle, when my troops were being slaughtered by the Pandus\r\nand the Srinjayas, when, indeed, my vast army being broken and routed\r\nrepeatedly became cheerless, tell me, O Sanjaya, what the Kauravas did.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the mighty-armed Bhima, the Suta's son of great\r\nvalour, with eyes red in wrath, O king, rushed towards him. Seeing thy\r\narmy fly away from Bhimasena, the mighty Karna, O king, rallied it with\r\ngreat efforts. The mighty-armed Karna, having rallied thy son's host,\r\nproceeded against the Pandavas, those heroes difficult of defeat in\r\nbattle. The great car-warriors of the Pandavas also, shaking their bows\r\nand shooting their shafts, proceeded against the son of Radha. Bhimasena,\r\nand the grandson of Sini, and Shikhandi and Janamejaya, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna of great strength, and all the Prabhadrakas, and those\r\ntigers among men, the Pancalas, filled with rage and inspired with desire\r\nof victory, rushed in that battle from every side against thy army.\r\nSimilarly, the great car-warriors of thy army, O king, quickly proceeded\r\nagainst the Pandava host, desirous of slaughtering it. Teeming with cars\r\nand elephants and horses, and abounding with foot-soldiers and standards,\r\nthe two armies then, O tiger among men, assumed a wonderful aspect.\r\nShikhandi proceeded against Karna, and Dhrishtadyumna proceeded against\r\nthy son Duhshasana, accompanied by a large force. Nakula proceeded\r\nagainst Vrishasena, while Yudhishthira against Citrasena. Sahadeva, O\r\nking, in that battle, proceeded against Uluka. Satyaki proceeded against\r\nShakuni, and the sons of Draupadi against the other Kauravas. The mighty\r\ncar-warrior Ashvatthama proceeded, with great care, against Arjuna.\r\nSharadvata's son Kripa proceeded against the mighty bowman Yudhamanyu,\r\nwhile Kritavarma of great strength proceeded against Uttamauja. The\r\nmighty-armed Bhimasena, O sire, alone and unsupported, resisted all the\r\nKurus and thy sons at the head of their division. The slayer of Bhishma,\r\nShikhandi, then, O monarch, with his winged arrows, resisted Karna,\r\ncareering fearlessly in that battle. Held in check, Karna then, his lips\r\ntrembling in rage, assailed Shikhandi with three arrows in the midst of\r\nhis eyebrows. With those three arrows sticking on his forehead, Shikhandi\r\nlooked highly beautiful like a silver mountain with three elevated\r\ncrests. Deeply pierced by the Suta's son in that encounter, the mighty\r\nbowman Shikhandi pierced Karna, in return, with ninety keen shafts. The\r\nmighty car-warrior Karna then, slaying Shikhandi's steeds and next his\r\ndriver with three arrows, cut off his standard with a razor-faced arrow.\r\nThat mighty car-warrior then, that scorcher of foes, filled with rage,\r\njumped down from his steedless car and hurled a dart at Karna. Cutting\r\noff that dart with three shafts in that encounter, Karna then, O Bharata,\r\npierced Shikhandi with nine keen arrows. Avoiding then the shafts sped\r\nfrom Karna's bow, that best of men, Shikhandi, exceedingly mangled,\r\nretreated speedily from that spot. Then Karna, O monarch, began to\r\nscatter the troops of the Pandavas, like a mighty wind scattering a heap\r\nof cotton. Meanwhile Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, afflicted by thy son,\r\npierced Duhshasana, in return, with three arrows in the centre of the\r\nchest. Then Duhshasana, O sire, pierced his assailant's left arm with a\r\nbroad-headed shaft, sharp and straight and equipped with wings of gold.\r\nThus pierced, Dhrishtadyumna, filled with wrath and the desire to\r\nretaliate, sped a terrible shaft, O Bharata, at Duhshasana. Thy son,\r\nhowever, O king, with three shafts of his, cut off that impetuous arrow\r\nsped by Dhrishtadyumna as it coursed towards him. Approaching\r\nDhrishtadyumna then, he struck him in the arms and the chest with\r\nseventeen other broad-headed shafts adorned with gold. Thereat Prishata's\r\nson, filled with rage, cut off Duhshasana's bow, O sire, with a sharp\r\nrazor-headed arrow, at which all the troops there uttered a loud shout.\r\nTaking up then another bow, thy son, as if smiling, held Dhrishtadyumna\r\nin check with showers of arrows from every side. Beholding the prowess of\r\nthat high-souled son of thine, the combatants, as also the siddhas and\r\nthe apsaras, became all filled with wonder. We then saw the mighty\r\nDhrishtadyumna thus assailed by Duhshasana to resemble a huge elephant,\r\nheld in check by a lion. Then many Pancala car-warriors and elephants and\r\nhorses, O elder brother of Pandu, desirous of rescuing the commander (of\r\nthe Pandava army) encompassed thy son. The battle that commenced, O\r\nscorcher of foes, between thy warriors and the enemy, presented as\r\nfrightful a sight as that which may be seen at the destruction of all\r\ncreatures at the end of the Yuga.\r\n\r\n\"'Vrishasena, staying by the side of his father, having pierced Nakula\r\nwith five arrows made wholly of iron, pierced him once again with three\r\nother arrows. The heroic Nakula then, as if smiling, deeply pierced\r\nVrishasena in the chest with a cloth-yard shaft of great keenness. Thus\r\npierced by his mighty foe, that scorcher of foes, viz., Vrishasena,\r\npierced his assailant with twenty arrows and was himself pierced by him\r\nwith five. Then those two bulls among men shrouded each other with\r\nthousands of arrows, at which the divisions that supported them broke.\r\nBeholding the troops of Dhritarashtra's son flying away, the Suta's son,\r\nfollowing them, O king, began to forcibly stop them. After Karna had gone\r\naway, Nakula proceeded against the Kauravas. Karna's son also, avoiding\r\nNakula, proceeded quickly, O sire, to where his father, the son of Radha,\r\nwas for protecting his car-wheel.\r\n\r\n\"'The angry Uluka was held in check by Sahadeva. Having slain his four\r\nsteeds, the valiant Sahadeva then despatched his foe's driver to the\r\nabode of Yama. Uluka then, that delighter of his father, jumping down\r\nfrom his car, O king, quickly proceeded and entered the division of the\r\nTrigartas. Satyaki, having pierced Shakuni with twenty keen arrows,\r\neasily cut off the standard of Subala's son with a broad-headed arrow.\r\nThe valiant son of Subala, filled with rage, O king, in that encounter,\r\npierced Satyaki's armour and then cut off his golden standard. Then\r\nSatyaki pierced him in return with many keen arrows, and struck his\r\ndriver, O monarch, with three arrows. With great speed then, he\r\ndespatched with other shafts the steeds of Shakuni to Yama's abode.\r\nSpeedily alighting then, O bull among men, from his car, Shakuni, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, quickly ascended the car of Uluka. The latter then\r\nbore away with great speed his father from Sini's grandson, that warrior\r\nskilled in battle. Then Satyaki, O king, rushed in that battle against\r\nthy army with great impetuosity, at which that army broke. Shrouded with\r\nthe arrows of Sini's grandson, thy army, O monarch, fled away on all\r\nsides with great speed, and fell down deprived of life.\r\n\r\n\"'Thy son resisted Bhimasena in that battle, in a trice Bhima made that\r\nruler of men steedless and driverless and carless and standardless, at\r\nwhich the (Pandava) troops became highly glad. Then thy son, O king, went\r\naway from Bhimasena's presence. The whole Kuru army, at this, rushed\r\nagainst Bhimasena. Tremendous became the din made by those combatants\r\ninspired with the desire of slaying Bhimasena. Yudhamanyu, piercing\r\nKripa, quickly cut off his bow. Then Kripa, that foremost of all wielders\r\nof weapons, taking up another bow, felled Yudhamanyu's standard and\r\ndriver and umbrella on the Earth. At this, the mighty car-warrior\r\nYudhamanyu retreated on his car, driving it himself. Uttamauja covered\r\nthe terrible son of Hridika, endued with terrible prowess, with a thick\r\nshower of arrows like a cloud pouring torrents of rain on a mountain. The\r\nbattle between them, O scorcher of foes, became so awful that its like, O\r\nmonarch, I had never seen before. Then Kritavarma, O king, in that\r\nencounter, suddenly pierced Uttamauja in the chest, at which the latter\r\nsat down on the terrace of his car. His driver then bore away that\r\nforemost of car-warriors. Then the whole Kuru army rushed at Bhimasena.\r\nDuhshasana and Subala's son, encompassing the son of Pandu with a large\r\nelephant force, began to strike him with small arrows. Then Bhima,\r\ncausing the wrathful Duryodhana to turn his back on the field by means of\r\nhundreds of arrows, quickly rushed towards that elephant force. Beholding\r\nthat elephant-force advance impetuously against him, Vrikodara became\r\nfilled with great rage and invoked his celestial weapons. And he began to\r\nstrike elephants with elephants like Indra striking the Asuras. While\r\nengaged in slaughtering those elephants, Vrikodara, in that battle,\r\ncovered the welkin with his shafts like myriads of insects covering a\r\nfire. Like the wind scattering masses of clouds, Bhima quickly scattered\r\nand destroyed crowds of elephants united together in thousands. Covered\r\nall over with networks of gold, as also with many gems, the elephants\r\nlooked exceedingly beautiful in that battle like clouds charged with\r\nlightning. Slaughtered by Bhima, those elephants, O king, began to fly\r\naway. Some amongst them, with their hearts pierced, fell down on the\r\nEarth. With those fallen and failing elephants adorned with gold, the\r\nEarth looked beautiful there, as if strewn with broken mountains. With\r\nthe fallen elephant-warriors of blazing resplendence and adorned with\r\ngems, the Earth looked beautiful as if strewn with planets of exhausted\r\nmerit. Then elephants, with their temples, frontal globes, and trunks\r\ndeeply pierced, fled in hundreds in that battle, afflicted with the\r\nshafts of Bhimasena. Some amongst them, huge as hills, afflicted with\r\nfear and vomiting blood, ran away, their limbs mangled with arrows, and\r\nlooked on that account, like mountains with liquid metals running down\r\ntheir sides. People then beheld the two arms of Bhima, resembling two\r\nmighty snakes, smeared with sandal-paste and other pounded unguents,\r\ncontinually employed in drawing the bow. Hearing the sound of his\r\nbow-string and palms that resembled the peal of thunder, those elephants,\r\nejecting urine and excreta, ran away in fear. The feats of the\r\nsingle-handed Bhima of great intelligence, on that occasion, shone like\r\nthose of Rudra, himself, while engaged in destroying all creatures.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The handsome Arjuna then, on that foremost car of his,\r\nunto which were yoked white steeds, and which was urged by Narayana\r\nhimself, appeared on the scene. Like the tempest agitating the ocean,\r\nVijaya, O foremost of kings, in that battle, agitated that host of thine\r\nteeming with horsemen. When the white-steeded Arjuna was otherwise\r\nengaged, thy son Duryodhana, filled with rage and surrounded by half his\r\ntroops, approached suddenly, and encompassed the advancing Yudhishthira\r\ninspired with the desire of revenge. The Kuru king then pierced the son\r\nof Pandu with three and seventy razor-headed arrows. At this,\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, became inflamed with ire, and quickly\r\nstruck thy son with thirty broad-headed arrows. The Kaurava troops then\r\nrushed impetuously for seizing Yudhishthira. Understanding the wicked\r\nintentions of the enemy, the great car-warriors of the Pandava army,\r\nuniting together, rushed towards Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, for\r\nrescuing him. Indeed, Nakula and Sahadeva and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of\r\nPrishata, surrounded by a full Akshauhini of troops, thus proceeded\r\ntowards Yudhishthira. Bhimasena also, in that battle, crushing the great\r\ncar-warriors of thy army, proceeded towards the king surrounded by foes.\r\nKarna, otherwise called Vaikartana, O king, shooting dense showers of\r\narrows, checked, single-handed, all those mighty bowmen thus advancing\r\n(to the rescue). Though they shot dense showers of arrows and hurled\r\ninnumerable lances, fighting with determination, yet they were unable\r\neven to look at the son of Radha. Indeed, the son of Radha, that master\r\nof all weapons offensive and defensive, by shooting dense showers of\r\nshafts checked all those great bowmen. The high-souled Sahadeva, however,\r\nquickly approaching (the spot where Duryodhana was), and invoking without\r\nloss of time a (celestial) weapon, pierced Duryodhana with twenty arrows.\r\nThus pierced by Sahadeva, the Kuru king, covered with blood, looked\r\nbeautiful, like a huge elephant of split temples. Beholding thy son\r\ndeeply pierced with many arrows of great energy, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the son of Radha, filled with rage, rushed to that\r\nspot. Seeing Duryodhana reduced to that plight, Karna, invoking his\r\nweapons quickly, began to slaughter the troops of Yudhishthira and\r\nPrishata's son. Thus slaughtered by the high-souled Karna, Yudhishthira's\r\ntroops, O king, afflicted with the arrows of the Suta's son, soon fled\r\naway. Showers of shafts fell together. Indeed, those sped subsequently\r\nfrom the bow of the Suta's son touched with their heads the wings of\r\nthose sped before. In consequence of those falling showers, of shafts, O\r\nmonarch, colliding with one another, a conflagration seemed to blaze\r\nforth in the welkin. Soon Karna shrouded the ten points of the compass, O\r\nking, with arrows capable of piercing the bodies of foes, as if with\r\nadvancing flights of locusts. Displaying the highest weapons, Karna began\r\nto wave with great force his two arms smeared with red sandal-paste and\r\nadorned with jewels and gold. Then stupefying all sides, O king, with his\r\nshafts, Karna deeply afflicted Yudhishthira the just. Filled with rage at\r\nthis, Dharma's son Yudhishthira struck Karna with fifty keen shafts. In\r\nconsequence then of the darkness caused by those showers of arrows, the\r\nbattle became awful to look at. Loud cries of woe arose from among thy\r\ntroops, O monarch, whilst they were being slaughtered by Dharma's son, O\r\nsire, with diverse kinds of keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers and\r\nwhetted on stone, with numerous broad-headed arrows, and with diverse\r\nkinds of darts and swords and clubs. Thither where Pandu's son of\r\nvirtuous soul cast his eyes with the desire of producing evil, thither\r\nthy army broke, O bull of Bharata's race. Inflamed with great rage, Karna\r\nalso, of immeasurable soul, inspired with the desire of retaliating, his\r\nface flushed in anger, rushed in that battle against Pandu's son, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, shooting cloth-yard shafts and crescent-shaped\r\narrows and those equipped with heads like the calf's tooth. Yudhishthira\r\nalso pierced him with many whetted arrows equipped with wings of gold. As\r\nif smiling the while, Karna pierced the royal son of Pandu in the chest\r\nwith three broad-headed arrows, whetted on stone, and equipped with Kanka\r\nfeathers. Deeply afflicted therewith, king Yudhishthira the just, sitting\r\ndown on the terrace of his car, ordered his driver to retreat. Thereupon\r\nall the Dhartarashtras, with their king, set up a loud shout, saying,\r\n\"Seize! Seize!\" and all of them then pursued the (Pandava) king. Then\r\nseventeen hundred Kekaya troops, skilled in smiting, united with a body\r\nof the Pancala troops, O king, checked the Dhartarashtras. During the\r\nprogress of that fierce and terrible battle, Duryodhana and Bhima, those\r\ntwo warriors endued with great might, encountered each other.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Karna also began, with his arrowy showers, to\r\nafflict the mighty car-warriors of the Kaikayas, viz., those great bowmen\r\nthat stood before him. Indeed, the son of Radha despatched to Yama's\r\nabode full five hundred of those warriors that were employed in checking\r\nhim in that battle. Beholding the son of Radha to be irresistible in that\r\nbattle, those warriors, afflicted with the arrows of their assailant,\r\nrepaired to the presence of Bhimasena. Breaking that car-force into many\r\nparts by means of his arrows, Karna, singly and riding on that same car\r\nof his, pursued Yudhishthira, who then, exceedingly mangled with arrows\r\nand almost insensible, was proceeding slowly for reaching the Pandava\r\nencampment with Nakula and Sahadeva on his two sides. Having approached\r\nthe king, the Suta's son, from desire of doing good to Duryodhana,\r\npierced the son of Pandu with three formidable arrows. In return, the\r\nking pierced Radha's son in the centre of the chest and then his driver\r\nwith three shafts. Then those two scorchers of foes, viz., the twin sons\r\nof Madri, those two protectors of Yudhishthira's car-wheels, rushed\r\ntowards Karna so that the latter might not succeed in slaying the king.\r\nThen Nakula and Sahadeva, both shooting showers of shafts with great\r\ncare, covered the son of Radha therewith. The valiant son of the Suta,\r\nhowever, in return, pierced those two high-souled chastisers of foes with\r\ntwo broad-headed arrows of great sharpness. The son of Radha then slew\r\nYudhishthira's excellent steeds, white as ivory and fleet as the mind,\r\nand having black hair in their tails. Then, smiling the while, the Suta's\r\nson, that great bowman, with another broadheaded shaft, felled the\r\nhead-gear of Kunti's son. Similarly, the valiant Karna, having slain the\r\nsteeds of Nakula, cut off the car shafts and bow of that intelligent son\r\nof Madri. Those two steedless and carless sons of Pandu,--those two\r\nbrothers,--thereupon ascended the car of Sahadeva. Beholding those two\r\nbrothers made carless, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., their\r\nmaternal uncle, the ruler of the Madras, moved by compassion, addressed\r\nthe son of Radha and said, \"Thou art to fight today with Pritha's son\r\nPhalguna. Why dost thou then, with rage inflamed to such a pitch, battle\r\nwith Dharma's royal son? Thou art suffering thy weapons to be exhausted.\r\nThy own armour is being weakened. With thy shafts reduced, and without\r\nquivers, with thy driver and steeds fatigued, and thyself mangled by foes\r\nwith weapons, when thou wilt approach Partha, O son of Radha, thou wilt\r\nbe an object of derision and mirth.\" Though thus addressed by the ruler\r\nof the Madras, Karna still, filled with rage, continued to assail\r\nYudhishthira in battle. And he continued to pierce the two sons of Madri\r\nby Pandu with many keen arrows. Smiling the while, by means of his shafts\r\nhe made Yudhishthira turn his face from the battle. Then Shalya,\r\nlaughing, once more said unto Karna as the latter, excited with great\r\nwrath and resolved upon Yudhishthira's destruction stood on his car,\r\nthese words, \"Him for whose sake Dhritarashtra's son always honours thee,\r\nslay that Partha, O son of Radha. What wouldst thou gain by slaying\r\nYudhishthira? The two Krishnas are blowing their conchs, whose loud blare\r\nis being heard. The twang also of Arjuna's bow is being heard, like the\r\nroar of the clouds in the season of rains. There, Arjuna, striking down\r\nthe foremost of our car-warriors with his arrowy down-pours, is devouring\r\nall our troops. Behold him, O Karna, in this battle. The two that are\r\nprotecting his rear are Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja. The brave Satyaki is\r\nprotecting his left wheel, and Dhrishtadyumna is protecting his right\r\nwheel. There, Bhimasena is fighting with the royal son of Dhritarashtra.\r\nAct in such way, O son of Radha, that Bhima may not be able to slay the\r\nking today in the sight of us all,--that the king may, indeed, escape\r\nhim. Behold, Duryodhana is brought under the power of Bhimasena, that\r\nornament of battle. Approaching if thou canst rescue him, it will,\r\nindeed, be a very wonderful feat. Going thither, rescue the king, for a\r\ngreat peril has overtaken him. What wilt thou gain by slaying the sons of\r\nMadri or king Yudhishthira?\" Hearing these words of Shalya, O lord of\r\nEarth, and beholding Duryodhana overpowered by Bhima in that dreadful\r\nbattle, the valiant son of Radha, thus urged by the words of Shalya and\r\nexceedingly desirous of rescuing the king, left Ajatasatru and the twin\r\nsons of Madri by Pandu, and rushed for rescuing thy son. He was borne by\r\nhis steeds that were fleet as birds and that were urged by the ruler of\r\nthe Madras. After Karna had gone away, Kunti's son Yudhishthira\r\nretreated, borne, O sire, by the fleet steeds of Sahadeva. With his twin\r\nbrothers accompanying him, that ruler of men, quickly repairing in shame\r\nto the (Pandava) camp, his body exceedingly mangled with shafts, alighted\r\nfrom the car and hastily sat down on an excellent bed. The, arrows then\r\nbeing extracted from his body, the royal son of Pandu, his heart\r\nexceedingly afflicted with sorrow's dart, addressed his two brothers,\r\nviz., those two mighty car-warriors, the sons of Madri, saying, \"Repair\r\nquickly to the division of Bhimasena. Roaring like a cloud, Vrikodara is\r\nengaged in battle.\" Riding another car, Nakula, that bull among\r\ncar-warriors, and Sahadeva of great energy,--those two brothers, those\r\ntwo crushers of foes,--both endued with great might, then proceeded\r\ntowards Bhima, borne by steeds of the utmost fleetness. Indeed, the\r\nbrothers having together repaired to Bhimasena's division, took up their\r\nplaces there.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Drona's son, surrounded by a large car-force, O\r\nking, suddenly proceeded to that spot where Partha was. Like the\r\ncontinent withstanding the surging ocean, the heroic Partha having Saurin\r\n(Krishna) for his help-mate withstood the impetuously rushing\r\nAshvatthama. Then, O monarch, the valiant son of Drona, filled with rage,\r\ncovered both Arjuna and Vasudeva with his shafts. Beholding the two\r\nKrishnas shrouded with arrows, the great car-warriors (of the Pandava\r\narmy), as also the Kurus that witnessed it, wondered exceedingly. Then\r\nArjuna, as if smiling, invoked into existence a celestial weapon. The\r\nbrahmana Ashvatthama, however, O Bharata, baffled that weapon in that\r\nbattle. Indeed, all those weapons that Arjuna sped from desire of slaying\r\nthe son of Drona were baffled by the latter, that great bowman, in that\r\nencounter. During the progress of that awful encounter of weapons, O\r\nking, we beheld the son of Drona to resemble the Destroyer himself, with\r\ngaping mouth. Having covered all the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, with straight arrows, he pierced Vasudeva with three arrows\r\nin the right arm. Then Arjuna, slaying all the steeds of his high-souled\r\nassailant, caused the Earth in that battle to be covered with a river of\r\nblood that was exceedingly awful that led towards the other world, and\r\nthat had diverse kinds of creatures floating on it. All the spectators\r\nbeheld a large number of car-warriors along with their cars, belonging to\r\nthe division of Ashvatthama, slain and destroyed by means of the arrows\r\nsped from Partha's bow. Ashvatthama also, slaying his enemies, caused a\r\nterrible river of blood to flow there that led to Yama's domains. During\r\nthe progress of that fierce and awful battle between Drona's son and\r\nPartha, the combatants fought without showing any regard for one another,\r\nand rushed hither and thither. In consequence of cars having their steeds\r\nand drivers slain, and steeds having their riders slain, and elephants\r\nhaving their riders and guides slain, an awful carnage, O king, was made\r\nby Partha in that battle! Car-warriors, deprived of life with shafts sped\r\nfrom Partha's bow, fell down. Steeds freed from their trappings ran\r\nhither and thither. Beholding those feats of Partha, that ornament of\r\nbattle, that valiant son of Drona quickly approached the former, that\r\nforemost of victorious men, shook his formidable bow decked with gold,\r\nand then pierced him from every side with many sharp arrows. Once more\r\nbending the bow, O king, the son of Drona cruelly struck Arjuna, aiming\r\nat the chest, with a winged arrow. Deeply pierced by Drona's son, O\r\nBharata, in that encounter, the wielder of gandiva, that hero of great\r\nintelligence forcibly covered the son of Drona with showers of arrows,\r\nand then cut off his bow. His bow cut off Drona's son then, taking up a\r\nspiked mace whose touch resembled that of thunder's, hurled it, in that\r\nencounter, at the diadem-decked Arjuna. The son of Pandu, however, O\r\nking, as if smiling the while, suddenly cut off that spiked mace decked\r\nwith gold, as it advanced towards him. Thus cut off with Partha's shafts,\r\nit fell down on the Earth, like a mountain, O king, broken into pieces,\r\nstruck with the thunderbolt. Filled with rage at this, Drona's son, that\r\ngreat car-warrior, began to cover Vibhatsu, aided by the energy of the\r\naindra weapon. Beholding that shower of arrows spread over the welkin\r\nthrough the aindra weapon, Partha, endued with great activity, O king,\r\ntaking up his bow gandiva, and fixing on his bowstring a mighty weapon\r\ncreated by Indra, destroyed that aindra-shower of arrows. Having baffled\r\nthat arrowy shower caused by the aindra weapon, Partha soon covered the\r\ncar of Drona's son (with his own arrows). The son of Drona, however,\r\noverwhelmed with Partha's shafts, penetrated through that shower of\r\narrows shot by the son of Pandu, and approaching the latter, invoked a\r\nmighty weapon and suddenly pierced Krishna with hundred shafts and Arjuna\r\nwith three hundred small arrows. Then Arjuna pierced the son of his\r\npreceptor with a hundred arrows in all his vital limbs. And then he\r\npoured many arrows on the steeds and driver and the bowstring of Drona's\r\nson in the very sight of thy warriors. Having pierced Drona's son in\r\nevery vital part, Pandu's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, then felled\r\nhis adversary's driver from the car-niche with a broad-headed arrow.\r\nDrona's son, however, himself, taking up the reins, covered Krishna with\r\nmany arrows. The activity of prowess that we then beheld in Drona's son\r\nwas exceedingly wonderful, since he guided his steeds while he fought\r\nwith Phalguni. That feat of his in battle, O king, was applauded by all\r\nthe warriors. Then Vibhatsu, otherwise called Jaya, smiling the while,\r\nquickly cut off the traces of Ashvatthama's steeds in that battle, with a\r\nrazor-faced arrow. Already afflicted by the energy of Arjuna's shafts,\r\nthe steeds of Drona's son thereupon ran away. Then a loud noise arose\r\nfrom thy troops, O Bharata! Meanwhile the Pandavas, having obtained the\r\nvictory, and desiring to improve it, rushed against thy troops, shooting\r\nfrom all sides sharp arrows at them. The vast Dhartarashtra host, then, O\r\nking, was repeatedly broken by the heroic Pandavas inspired with desire\r\nof victory, in the very sight, O monarch, of thy sons, conversant with\r\nall modes of warfare, and of, Shakuni the son of Subala, and of Karna, O\r\nking! Though sought to be stopped, O king, by thy sons, that great army,\r\nafflicted on all sides, stayed not on the field. Indeed, a confusion set\r\nin among the vast terrified host of thy son in consequence of many\r\nwarriors flying away on all sides. The Suta's son loudly cried out,\r\nsaying \"Stay, Stay!\" but thy army, slaughtered by many high-souled\r\nwarriors, did not stay on the field. Loud shouts were uttered then, O\r\nmonarch, by the Pandavas, inspired with this desire of victory, on\r\nbeholding the Dhartarashtra host flying away on all sides. Then\r\nDuryodhana addressing Karna from affection, \"Behold, O Karna, how our\r\narmy, exceedingly afflicted by the Pandavas, though thou art here, is\r\nflying away from battle! Knowing this, O thou of mighty arms, do that\r\nwhich is suited to the hour, O chastiser of foes! Thousands of (our)\r\nwarriors, routed by the Pandavas, are O hero, calling after thee only, O\r\nbest of men!\" Hearing these grave words of Duryodhana, the son of Radha,\r\nas if smiling, said these words unto the ruler of the Madras, \"Behold the\r\nprowess of my arms and the energy of my weapons, O ruler of men! Today I\r\nwill slay all the Pancalas and the Pandavas in battle! Cause the steeds\r\nto proceed with my car, O tiger among men! Without doubt, everything will\r\nbe as I have said!\" Having said these words, the Suta's son of great\r\nvalour, that hero, taking up his ancient and foremost of bows called\r\nVijaya, stringed it and rubbed the string repeatedly. Bidding the troops\r\nstay on the field after having assured them upon his truth and by an\r\noath, the mighty Karna of immeasurable soul fixed on his bow-string the\r\nweapon known by the name of Bhargava. From that weapon flowed, O king,\r\nmillions and millions of keen arrows in that great battle. Entirely\r\nshrouded with those blazing and terrible arrows winged with feathers of\r\nKankas and peacocks, the Pandava army could not see anything. Loud wails\r\nof woe arose from among the Pancalas, O king, afflicted, in that battle,\r\nwith the mighty Bhargava weapon. In consequence then of elephants, O\r\nking, and steeds, by thousands, and cars, O monarch, and men, falling on\r\nall sides, deprived of life, the Earth began to tremble. The vast force\r\nof the Pandavas became agitated from one extremity to another. Meanwhile\r\nKarna, that scorcher of foes, that foremost of warriors, that tiger among\r\nmen, while consuming his foes, looked resplendent like a smokeless fire.\r\nThus slaughtered by Karna, the Pancalas and the Cedis began to lose their\r\nsenses all over the field like elephants during the conflagration in a\r\nforest. Those foremost of men, O tiger among men, uttered loud roars like\r\nthose of the tiger. Loud became the wails of woe, like those of living\r\ncreatures at the universal dissolution that were uttered by those crying\r\ncombatants struck with panic and running wildly on all sides, O king, of\r\nthe field of battle and trembling with fear. Beholding them thus\r\nslaughtered, O sire, by the Suta's son, all creatures, even beasts and\r\nbirds, were filled with fear. The Srinjayas then, thus slaughtered in\r\nbattle by the Suta's son, repeatedly called upon Arjuna and Vasudeva like\r\nthe spirits of the dead within Yama's dominions calling upon Yama to\r\nrescue them. Hearing those wails of the troops slaughtered with Karna's\r\nshafts, and beholding the terrible bhargava weapon invoked into existence\r\nKunti's son Dhananjaya said unto Vasudeva these words, \"Behold, O Krishna\r\nof mighty arms, the prowess of the bhargava weapon! It cannot, by any\r\nmeans, be baffled! Behold the Suta's son also, O Krishna, filled with\r\nrage in this great battle and resembling the Destroyer himself, in\r\nprowess and employed in achieving such a fierce feat! Urging his steeds\r\nincessantly, he is repeatedly casting angry glances upon me! I will never\r\nbe able to fly away from Karna in battle! The person that is living, may,\r\nin battle, meet with either victory or defeat. To the man, however, that\r\nis dead, O Hrishikesha, even death is victory. How can defeat be his that\r\nis dead?\" Thus addressed by Partha, Krishna replied unto that foremost of\r\nintelligent men and chastiser of foes, these words that were suitable to\r\nthe occasion, \"The royal son of Kunti hath been deeply wounded and\r\nmangled by Karna. Having seen him first and comforted him, thou wilt\r\nthen, O Partha, slay Karna?\" Then Keshava proceeded, desirous of\r\nbeholding Yudhishthira, thinking that Karna meanwhile, O monarch, would\r\nbe overwhelmed with fatigue! Then Dhananjaya, himself desirous of\r\nbeholding the king afflicted with arrows, quickly proceeded on that car,\r\navoiding the battle, at Keshava's command. While the son of Kunti was\r\nthus proceeding from desire of seeing king Yudhishthira the just, he cast\r\nhis eyes on every part of the army but failed to find his eldest brother\r\nanywhere on the field. The son of Kunti proceeded, O Bharata, having\r\nfought with the son of his preceptor Drona, and having vanquished that\r\nhero incapable of being resisted by the wielder of the thunderbolt\r\nhimself.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having vanquished the son of Drona and achieved a mighty\r\nand heroic feat that is exceedingly difficult of accomplishment,\r\nDhananjaya, irresistible by foes, and with bow outstretched in his hands,\r\ncast his eyes among his own troops. The brave Savyasaci, gladdening those\r\nwarriors of his that were still battling at the head of their divisions\r\nand applauding those among them that were celebrated for their former\r\nachievements, caused the carwarriors of his own army to continue to stand\r\nin their posts. Not seeing his brother Yudhishthira of Ajamida's race,\r\nthe diadem-decked Arjuna, adorned, besides, with a necklace of gold,\r\nspeedily approached Bhima and enquired of him the whereabouts of the\r\nking, saying, \"Tell me, where is the king?\" Thus asked, Bhima said, \"King\r\nYudhishthira the just, hath gone away from this place, his limbs scorched\r\nwith Karna's shafts. It is doubtful whether he still liveth!\" Hearing\r\nthose words, Arjuna said, \"For this reason go thou quickly from the spot\r\nfor bringing intelligence of the king, that best of all the descendants\r\nof Kuru! Without doubt, deeply pierced by Karna with shafts, the king\r\nhath gone to the camp! In that fierce passage at arms, though deeply\r\npierced by Drona with keen shafts, the king endued with great activity,\r\nhad still stayed in battle, expectant of victory, until Drona was slain!\r\nThat foremost one among the Pandavas, possessed of great magnanimity, was\r\ngreatly imperilled by Karna in today's battle! For ascertaining his\r\ncondition, quickly go hence, O Bhima! I will stay here, checking all our\r\nfoes!\" Thus addressed, Bhima said, \"O thou of great glory, go thyself for\r\nascertaining the condition of the king, that bull amongst the Bharatas!\r\nIf, O Arjuna, I go there, many foremost of heroes will then say that I am\r\nfrightened in battle!\" Then Arjuna said unto Bhimasena, \"The samsaptakas\r\nare before my division! Without slaying those assembled foes first, it is\r\nimpossible for me to stir from this place!' Then Bhimasena said unto\r\nArjuna, 'Relying upon my own might, O foremost one among the Kurus, I\r\nwill fight with all the samsaptakas in battle! Therefore, O Dhananjaya,\r\ndo thou go thyself!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing in the midst of foes, those words of his\r\nbrother Bhimasena that were difficult of accomplishment, Arjuna, desiring\r\nto see the king, addressed the Vrishni hero, saying, \"Urge the steeds, O\r\nHrishikesha, leaving this sea of troops! I desire, O Keshava to see king\r\nAjatasatru!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Just as he was on the point of urging the steeds,\r\nKeshava, that foremost one of the Dasharhas, addressed Bhima, saying,\r\n\"This feat is not at all wonderful for thee, O Bhima! I am about to go\r\n(hence). Slay these assembled foes of Partha!\" Then Hrishikesha proceeded\r\nwith very great speed to the spot where king Yudhishthira was, O king,\r\nborne by those steeds that resembled Garuda, having stationed Bhima, that\r\nchastiser of foes, at the head of the army and having commanded him, O\r\nmonarch, to fight (with the samsaptakas). Then those two foremost of men,\r\n(Krishna and Arjuna), proceeding on their car, approached the king who\r\nwas lying alone on his bed. Both of them, alighting from that car,\r\nworshipped the feet of king Yudhishthira the just. Beholding that bull of\r\ntigers among men safe and sound, the two Krishnas became filled with joy,\r\nlike the twin Ashvinis on seeing Vasava. The king then congratulated them\r\nboth like Vivasvat congratulating the twin Ashvinis, or like Brihaspati\r\ncongratulating Sankara and Vishnu after the slaughter of the mighty asura\r\nJambha. King Yudhishthira the just, thinking that Karna had been slain,\r\nbecame filled with joy, and that scorcher of foes thereupon addressed\r\nthem in these words in a voice choked with delight.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"Welcome, O thou that hast Devaki for thy mother,\r\nand welcome to thee, O Dhananjaya! The sight of both of you, O Acyuta and\r\nArjuna, is exceedingly agreeable! I see that without being wounded\r\nyourselves, you two, his foes, have slain the mighty car-warrior Karna!\r\nHe was in battle like unto a snake of virulent poison. He was\r\naccomplished in all weapons. The leader of all the Dhartarashtras, he was\r\ntheir armour and protector! While fighting he was always protected by\r\nVrishasena and by Sushena, both of whom are great bowmen! Of great\r\nenergy, he had received lessons from Rama in weapons! He was invincible\r\nin battle! The foremost one in all the world, as a car-warrior he was\r\ncelebrated throughout all the worlds. He was the saviour of the\r\nDhartarashtras, and the proceeder in their van! A slayer of hostile\r\ntroops, he was the crusher of large bands of foes. Ever engaged in\r\nDuryodhana's good, he was always prepared to inflict woe on us! He was\r\ninvincible in battle by the very gods with Vasava at their head. In\r\nenergy and might he was equal unto the god of fire and the god of wind.\r\nIn gravity he was unfathomable as the Nether world. The enhancer of the\r\njoys of friends, he was like the Destroyer himself unto foes! Having\r\nslain Karna (who was even so) in dreadful battle, by good luck it is that\r\nyou two have come, like a couple of celestials after vanquishing an\r\nAsura! Today, O Acyuta and Arjuna, a great battle was fought between\r\nmyself exerting with might and that hero resembling the Destroyer\r\nhimself, while seeking to exterminate all creatures! My standard was cut\r\ndown, and my two Parshni drivers also were slain by him. I was also made\r\nsteedless and carless by him in the very sight of Yuyudhana, of\r\nDhrishtadyumna, of the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), of the heroic\r\nShikhandi, as also in the very sight of the sons of Draupadi, and all the\r\nPancalas! Having vanquished those innumerable foes, Karna of mighty\r\nenergy then vanquished me, O thou of mighty arms, although I exerted\r\nmyself resolutely in battle! Pursuing me then and without doubt,\r\nvanquishing all my protectors, that foremost of warriors addressed me in\r\ndiverse harsh speeches. That I am still alive, O Dhananjaya, is due to\r\nthe prowess of Bhimasena. What more need I say? I am unable to bear that\r\nhumiliation! For thirteen years, O Dhananjaya, through fear of Karna, I\r\ndid not obtain any sleep by night or any comfort by day! Filled with\r\nhatred of Karna, I burn, O Dhananjaya! Like the bird Vaddhrinasa I fled\r\nfrom Karna, knowing that the time for my own destruction had come. The\r\nwhole of my time had passed in the thought as to how I would accomplish\r\nthe destruction of Karna in battle! Awake or asleep, O son of Kunti, I\r\nalways beheld Karna (with my mind's eye). Wherever I was, the universe\r\nappeared to me to be full of Karna! Inspired with the fear of Karna,\r\nwherever I used to go, O Dhananjaya, thither I beheld Karna standing\r\nbefore my eyes! Vanquished in battle, with my steeds and car, by that\r\nhero who never retreated from battle, alive I was let off by him! What\r\nuse have I of life or of kingdom either, since Karna, that ornament of\r\nbattle, today cried fie on me? That which I had never before met with at\r\nthe hands of Bhishma or Kripa or Drona in battle, that I met with today\r\nat the hands of the Suta's son, that mighty car-warrior! It is for this,\r\nO son of Kunti, that I ask thee today about thy welfare! Tell me in\r\ndetail how thou hast slain Karna today! In battle Karna was equal unto\r\nSakra himself. In prowess he was equal unto Yama. In weapons he was equal\r\nunto Rama. How then hath he been slain? He was regarded as a mighty\r\ncar-warrior, conversant with all modes of warfare. He was the foremost of\r\nall bowmen, and the one man amongst all men! O prince, the son of Radha\r\nwas always worshipped by Dhritarashtra and his son, for thy sake! How\r\nthen hath he been slain by thee? In all engagements, Dhritarashtra's son,\r\nO Arjuna, used to regard Karna as thy death, O bull among men! How then,\r\nO tiger among men, hath that Karna been slain by thee in battle? Tell me,\r\nO son of Kunti, how that Karna hath been slain by thee! How, while he was\r\nengaged in battle, didst thou, O tiger among men, strike off his head in\r\nthe very sight of all his friends like a tiger tearing off the head of a\r\nruru deer? That Suta's son who in battle searched all the points of the\r\ncompass for finding thee, that Karna who had promised to give a car with\r\nsix bulls of elephantine proportions unto him that would point thee out,\r\nI ask: doth that Karna of wicked soul lie today on the bare ground, slain\r\nwith thy keen arrows equipped with kanka feathers? Having slain the\r\nSuta's son in battle, thou hast accomplished a deed highly agreeable to\r\nme! Encountering him in battle, hast thou really slain that Suta's son,\r\nwho, filled with arrogance and pride and bragging of his heroism, used to\r\nsearch everywhere on the field of battle for thee? Hast thou, O sire,\r\nreally slain in battle that sinful wretch who used to always challenge\r\nthee and who was desirous for thy sake of giving unto others a\r\nmagnificent car, made of gold along with a number of elephants and bulls\r\nand steeds? Hast thou really slain today that sinful wight who was\r\nexceedingly dear to Suyodhana, and who, intoxicated with pride of\r\nheroism, used always to brag in the assembly of the Kurus? Encountered in\r\nbattle, doth that wretch lie today on the field, his limbs exceedingly\r\nmangled with sky-ranging shafts sped by thee from thy bow and all steeped\r\nin blood? Have the two arms of Dhritarashtra's son been (at last) broken?\r\nHave those words been unfulfilled, uttered from folly by him who, filled\r\nwith pride, used to always boast in the midst of the kings for gladdening\r\nDuryodhana, saying, 'I will slay Phalguna'? O son of Indra, hath that\r\nKarna of little understanding been slain by thee today, that Suta's son\r\nwho made the vow that he would not wash his feet as long as Partha lived?\r\nThat Karna of wicked understanding who in the assembly; before the Kuru\r\nchiefs, had addressed Krishna, saying, 'Why, O Krishna, dost thou not\r\nabandon the Pandavas that are divested of might, exceedingly weak, and\r\nfallen?' That Karna who had vowed for thy sake, saying that he would not\r\nreturn from battle without having slain Krishna and Partha. I ask, doth\r\nthat Karna of sinful understanding lie today on the field, his body\r\npierced with shafts? Thou knowest the nature of the battle that took\r\nplace when the Srinjayas and the Kauravas encountered each other, the\r\nbattle in which I was brought to that distressful plight. Encountering\r\nthat Karna, hast thou slain him today? O Savyasaci, hast thou today, with\r\nblazing shafts sped from gandiva, cut off from the trunk of that Karna of\r\nwicked understanding his resplendent head decked with earrings? Pierced\r\nwith Karna's shafts today, I had, O hero, thought of thee (that thou\r\nwouldst slay him)! Hast thou then, by the slaughter of Karna, made that\r\nthought of mine true? In consequence of the protection granted him by\r\nKarna, Suyodhana, filled with pride, always recked us little. Displaying\r\nthy prowess, hast then today destroyed that refuge of Suyodhana? That\r\nSuta's son of wicked soul, that Karna of great wrath, who had formerly,\r\nin the presence of the Kauravas and in the midst of the assembly called\r\nus sesame seeds without kernel, encountering that Karna in battle, hast\r\nthou slain him today? That Suta's son of wicked soul who had, laughing\r\nthe while, commanded Duhshasana to forcibly drag Yajnasena's daughter won\r\nin gambling by Subala's son, hath he been slain today by thee? That Karna\r\nof little understanding who, having been counted as only half a\r\ncar-warrior during the tale of rathas and atirathas, had upbraided that\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons on Earth, our grandsire Bhishma, hath\r\nhe been slain by thee? Extinguish, O Phalguna, this fire in my heart that\r\nis born of vindictiveness and is fanned by the wind of humiliation, by\r\ntelling me that thou hast slain Karna today, having encountered him in\r\nbattle! The news of Karna's slaughter is exceedingly agreeable to me.\r\nTell me, therefore, how the Suta's son hath been slain! Like the divine\r\nVishnu waiting for the arrival of Indra with the intelligence of Vritra's\r\nslaughter, I had so long waited for thee, O hero!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the righteous king who had been\r\nfilled with anger, that high-souled atiratha, Jishnu of infinite energy,\r\nreplied unto the invincible Yudhishthira of great might, saying, \"While\r\nbattling with the samsaptakas today, Drona's son who always proceedeth at\r\nthe head of the Kuru troops, O king, suddenly came before me, shooting\r\nshafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison. Beholding my car, of\r\nrattle deep as the roar of clouds, all the troops began to encompass it.\r\nSlaying full five hundred of those, I then, O foremost of kings,\r\nproceeded against Drona's son. Approaching me, O king, that hero with\r\ngreat resolution rushed against me like a prince of elephants against a\r\nlion, and desired to rescue, O monarch, the Kaurava car-warriors that\r\nwere being slaughtered by me. Then, in that battle, O Bharata, the\r\npreceptor's son, that foremost of heroes among the Kurus, incapable of\r\nbeing made to tremble, began to afflict me and Janardana with whetted\r\nshafts resembling poison or fire. While engaged in battle with me, eight\r\ncarts, each drawn by eight bullocks, carried his hundreds of arrows. He\r\nshot them all at me, but like a wind destroying the clouds I destroyed\r\nwith my shafts that arrowy shower of his. He then shot at me, with skill\r\nand force and resolution, thousands of other arrows, all sped from his\r\nbow-string stretched to his very ear, even like a black cloud in the\r\nseason of rains pouring in torrents the water with which it is charged.\r\nSo quickly did Drona's son career in that battle that we could not\r\ndiscern from which side, the left or the right, he shot his arrows, nor\r\ncould we notice when he took up his arrows and when he let them off.\r\nIndeed, the bow of Drona's son was seen by us to be incessantly drawn to\r\na circle. At last, the son of Drona pierced me with five whetted arrows\r\nand Vasudeva also with five whetted arrows. Within the twinkling of an\r\neye, however, I afflicted him with the force of thunderbolts. Exceedingly\r\nafflicted with those shafts sped by me, he soon assumed the form of a\r\nporcupine. All his limbs became bathed in blood. Beholding his troops,\r\nthose foremost of warriors all covered with blood and overwhelmed by me,\r\nhe then entered the car-division of the Suta's son. Seeing the troops\r\noverwhelmed by me in battle, and struck with fear, and beholding the\r\nelephants and steeds flying away, that grinder (of hostile hosts), viz.,\r\nKarna approached me quickly with fifty great carwarriors. Slaying them\r\nall and avoiding Karna, I have quickly come hither for seeing thee. All\r\nthe Pancalas are afflicted with fear at sight of Karna like kine at the\r\nscent of a lion. The Prabhadrakas also, O king, having approached Karna,\r\nare like persons that have entered the wide open jaws of Death. Karna has\r\nalready despatched to Yama's abode full seventeen hundred of those\r\ndistressed car-warriors. Indeed, O king, the Suta's son did not become\r\ncheerless till he had a sight of us. Thou hadst first been engaged with\r\nAshvatthama and exceedingly mangled by him. I heard that after that thou\r\nwert seen by Karna. O thou of inconceivable feats, I thought that thou\r\nmust have, O king, been enjoying rest (in the camp), having come away\r\nfrom the cruel Karna. I have seen, O son of Pandu, the great and\r\nwonderful (Bhargava) weapon of Karna displayed in the van of battle.\r\nThere is now no other warrior among the Srinjayas that is able to resist\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Karna. Let Sini's grandson Satyaki and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O king, be the protectors of my car-wheels. Let the\r\nheroic princes Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja protect my rear. O thou of great\r\nglory, encountering that heroic and invincible car-warrior, viz., the\r\nSuta's son, staying in the hostile army, like Sakra encountering Vritra,\r\nO foremost of kings, I will, O Bharata, fight with the Suta's son if he\r\ncan be found in this battle today. Come and behold me and the Suta's son\r\ncontending with each other in battle for victory. There, the Prabhadrakas\r\nare rushing towards the face of a mighty bull. There, O Bharata, 6,000\r\nprinces are sacrificing themselves in battle today, for the sake of\r\nheaven. If, putting forth my strength, I do not, O king, slay Karna today\r\nwith all his relatives while engaged in battle with him, then that end\r\nwill be mine, O lion among kings, which is his that does not accomplish a\r\nvow taken by him. I beg of thee, bless me, saying that victory will be\r\nmine in battle. Yonder, the Dhartarashtras are about to devour Bhima. I\r\nwill, O lion among kings, slay the Suta's son and his troops and all our\r\nfoes!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing that Karna of mighty energy was still alive,\r\nPritha's son Yudhishthira of immeasurable energy, exceedingly angry with\r\nPhalguna and burning with the shafts of Karna, said these words unto\r\nDhananjaya, \"O sire, thy army is fled and hath been beaten in a way that\r\nis scarcely honourable! Inspired with fear and deserting Bhima, thou hast\r\ncome hither since thou hast been unable to slay Karna. Thou hast, by\r\nentering her womb, rendered the conception of Kunti abortive. Thou hast\r\nacted improperly by deserting Bhima, because thou wert unable to slay the\r\nSuta's son. Thou hadst, O Partha, said unto me in the Dwaita woods that\r\nthou wouldst, on a single car, slay Karna. Why, then, through fear of\r\nKarna hast come hither, avoiding Karna and deserting Bhima? If in the\r\nDwaita woods thou hadst said unto me, 'O king, I shall not be able to\r\nfight with Karna,' we would then, O Partha, have made other arrangements\r\nsuitable to the circumstances. Having promised me the slaughter of Karna,\r\nthou hast not, O hero, kept that promise. Bringing us into the midst of\r\nfoes, why hast thou broken us into pieces by throwing us down on a hard\r\nsoil? Expecting diverse good things and benefits from thee, O Arjuna, we\r\nhave always uttered blessings on thee. All those expectations, however, O\r\nprince, have proved vain like those of persons expectant of fruit getting\r\ninstead of a tree burthened only with flowers! Like a fish-hook hid\r\nwithin a piece of meat, or poison overlaid with food, thou didst, for\r\ndisappointing us at last, point out destruction in the shape of kingdom\r\nunto ourselves covetous of kingdom! For these thirteen years, O\r\nDhananjaya, we have, from hope, lived relying on thee, like seeds sown on\r\nearth in expectation of the showers sent by the gods in season! Even\r\nthese were the words that a voice in the skies had said unto Pritha on\r\nthe seventh day after thy birth, O thou of foolish understanding! 'This\r\nson of thine that is born will have the prowess of Vasava himself! He\r\nwill vanquish all his heroic foes! Endued with superior energy, he will\r\nat Khandava vanquish all the celestials united together and diverse other\r\ncreatures. This one will subjugate the Madras, the Kalingas, and the\r\nKaikeyas. This one will, in the midst of many kings, slay the Kurus.\r\nThere will be no bowman superior to him, and no creature will ever be\r\nable to vanquish him. With his senses under control, and having obtained\r\nmastery over all branches of knowledge, this one, by merely desiring it,\r\nwill bring all creatures under subjection to himself. This high-souled\r\nson that is born of thee, O Kunti, will in beauty be the rival of Soma,\r\nin speed of the god of wind, in patience of Meru, in forgiveness of\r\nEarth, in splendour of Surya, in prosperity of the Lord of treasures, in\r\ncourage of Sakra, and in might of Vishnu. He will be the slayer of all\r\nfoes like Vishnu, the son of Aditi. Endued with immeasurable energy, he\r\nwill be celebrated for the destruction he will deal to foes and the\r\nsuccess he will win for friends. He will, besides, be the founder of a\r\nrace!' Even thus, in the skies, on the summit of the Satasringa\r\nmountains, in the hearing of many ascetics, that voice spoke. All that,\r\nhowever, hath not come to pass. Alas, it shows that the gods even may\r\nspeak untruths! Hearing also the words of praise always uttered about\r\nthee by many foremost of Rishis, I never expected that Suyodhana would\r\nwin success and prosperity or that thou thyself wouldst be afflicted with\r\nthe fear of Karna! Thou ridest upon an excellent car constructed by the\r\ncelestial artificer himself, with axles that do not creak, and with\r\nstandard that bears the ape. Thou bearest a sword attached to thy belt of\r\ngold and silk. This thy bow Gandiva is full six cubits long. Thou hast\r\nKeshava for thy driver. Why, then, through fear of Karna hast thou come\r\naway from battle, O Partha? If, O thou of wicked soul, thou hadst given\r\nthis bow to Keshava and become his driver, then Keshava could have (by\r\nthis time) slain the fierce Karna like the lord of the Maruts (Sakra)\r\nslaying with his thunder the Asura Vritra. If thou art unable to resist\r\nthe fierce son of Radha today, as he is careering in battle, give this\r\nthy Gandiva today to some other king, that may be thy superior in (the\r\nuse and knowledge of) weapons. If that be done, the world will not then\r\nbehold us bereft of sons and wives, deprived of happiness in consequence\r\nof the loss of kingdom, and sunk, O son of Pandu, in an unfathomable hell\r\nof great misery. It would have been better for thee if thou hadst never\r\nbeen born in the womb of Kunti, or having taken thy birth there, if thou\r\nhadst come out on the fifth month an abortion, than to have, O prince,\r\nthus come away from battle, O thou of wicked soul! Fie on thy Gandiva,\r\nfie on the might of thy arms, fie on thy inexhaustible arrows! Fie on thy\r\nbanner with the gigantic ape on it, and fie on thy car given thee by the\r\ngod of fire!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, Kunti's son owning white\r\nsteeds, filled with rage, drew his sword for slaying that bull of\r\nBharata's race. Beholding his wrath, Keshava, conversant with the\r\nworkings of the (human) heart said, \"Why, O Partha, dost thou draw thy\r\nsword? I do not, O Dhananjaya, behold anyone here with whom thou hast to\r\nfight! The Dhartarashtras have now been assailed by the intelligent\r\nBhimasena. Thou comest from battle, O son of Kunti, for seeing the king.\r\nThe king has been seen by thee. Indeed, Yudhishthira is well. Having seen\r\nthat tiger among kings who is endued with prowess equal to that of a\r\ntiger, why this folly at a time when thou shouldst rejoice? I do not see\r\nhere, O son of Kunti, the person whom thou mayst slay. Why then dost thou\r\ndesire to strike? What is this delusion of thy mind? Why dost thou, with\r\nsuch speed, take up that formidable sword? I ask thee this, O son, of\r\nKunti! What is this that thou art about, inasmuch as, O thou of\r\ninconceivable prowess, thou graspest that sword in anger?\" Thus addressed\r\nby Krishna, Arjuna, casting his eyes on Yudhishthira, and breathing like\r\nan angry snake, said unto Govinda, \"I would cut off the head of that man\r\nwho would tell me 'Give thy Gandiva to another person.\" Even this is my\r\nsecret vow. Those words have been spoken by this king, O thou of\r\nimmeasurable prowess, in thy presence, O Govinda! I dare not forgive\r\nthem. I will for that slay this king who himself fears the slightest\r\nfalling from virtue. Slaying this best of men, I will keep my vow. It is\r\nfor this that I have drawn the sword, O delighter of the Yadus. Even I,\r\nslaying Yudhishthira, will pay off my debt to truth. By that I will\r\ndispel my grief and fever, O Janardana. I ask thee, what do you think\r\nsuitable to the circumstances that have arisen? Thou, O sire, knowest the\r\nentire past and future of this universe. I will do what thou wilt tell\r\nme.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Govinda then said, \"Fie, fie,\" unto Partha and once\r\nmore continued to say, \"I now know, O Partha, that thou hast not waited\r\nupon the old, since, O tiger among men, thou hast yielded to wrath at a\r\ntime when thou shouldst not have done so. No one that is acquainted with\r\nthe distinctions of morality would act in the way, O Dhananjaya, in which\r\nthou, O son of Pandu, that art unacquainted with them, art acting today!\r\nHe, O Partha, is the worst of men who committeth acts that should not be\r\ndone and doeth acts that are apparently proper but condemned by the\r\nscriptures. Thou knowest not the decisions of those learned men who,\r\nwaited upon by pupils, declare their opinions, following the dictates of\r\nmorality. The man that is not acquainted with those rulings becomes\r\nconfounded and stupefied, O Partha, even as thou hast been stupefied, in\r\ndiscriminating between what should be done and what should not. What\r\nshould be done and what should not cannot be ascertained easily.\r\nEverything can be ascertained by the aid of the scriptures. Thou,\r\nhowever, art not acquainted with the scriptures. Since (believing\r\nthyself) conversant with morality, thou art desirous of observing\r\nmorality (in this way, it seems) thou art actuated by ignorance. Thou\r\nbelievest thyself to be conversant with virtue, but thou dost not know, O\r\nPartha, that the slaughter of living creatures is a sin. Abstention from\r\ninjury to animals is, I think, the highest virtue. One may even speak an\r\nuntruth, but one should never kill. How then, O foremost of men, couldst\r\nthou wish, like an ordinary person, to slay thy eldest brother, the King,\r\nwho is conversant with morality? The slaughter of a person not engaged in\r\nbattle, or of a foe, O Bharata who has turned his face from battle or who\r\nflies away or seeks protection or joins his hands or yields himself up or\r\nis careless, is never applauded by the righteous. All these attributes\r\nare in thy superior. This vow, O Partha, was adopted by thee before from\r\nfoolishness. In consequence of that vow thou art now, from folly,\r\ndesirous of perpetrating a sinful act. Why, O Partha, dost thou rush\r\ntowards thy reverend superior for slaying him, without having resolved\r\nthe exceedingly subtle course of morality that is, again, difficult of\r\nbeing understood? I will now tell thee, O son of Pandu, this mystery\r\nconnected with morality, this mystery that was declared by Bhishma, by\r\nthe righteous Yudhishthira, by Vidura otherwise called Kshatri, and by\r\nKunti, of great celebrity. I will tell thee that mystery in all its\r\ndetails. Listen to it, O Dhananjaya! One who speaks truth is righteous.\r\nThere is nothing higher than truth. Behold, however, truth as practised\r\nis exceedingly difficult to be understood as regards its essential\r\nattributes. Truth may be unutterable, and even falsehood may be utterable\r\nwhere falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood. In a\r\nsituation of peril to life and in marriage, falsehood becomes utterable.\r\nIn a situation involving the loss of one's entire property, falsehood\r\nbecomes utterable. On an occasion of marriage, or of enjoying a woman, or\r\nwhen life is in danger, or when one's entire property is about to be\r\ntaken away, or for the sake of a Brahmana, falsehood may be uttered.\r\nThese five kinds of falsehood have been declared to be sinless. On these\r\noccasions falsehood would become truth and truth would become falsehood.\r\nHe is a fool that practises truth without knowing the difference between\r\ntruth and falsehood. One is said to be conversant with morality when one\r\nis able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. What wonder then in\r\nthis that a man of wisdom, by perpetrating even a cruel act, may obtain\r\ngreat merit like Valaka by the slaughter of the blind beast? What wonder,\r\nagain, in this that a foolish and ignorant person, from even the desire\r\nof winning merit, earns great sin like Kausika (living) among the rivers?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Arjuna said, \"Tell me, O holy one, this story that I may understand it,\r\nviz., this illustration about Valaka and about Kausika (living) among\r\nrivers.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"There was a certain hunter of animals, O Bharata, of\r\nthe name of Valaka. He used, for the livelihood of his son and wives and\r\nnot from will, to slay animals. Devoted to the duties of his own order\r\nand always speaking the truth and never harbouring malice, he used also\r\nto support his parents and others that depended upon him. One day,\r\nsearching for animals even with perseverance and care, he found none. At\r\nlast he saw a beast of prey whose sense of smell supplied the defect of\r\nhis eyes, employed in drinking water. Although he had never seen such an\r\nanimal before, still he slew it immediately. After the slaughter of that\r\nblind beast, a floral shower fell from the skies (upon the head of the\r\nhunter). A celestial car also, exceedingly delightful and resounding with\r\nthe songs of Apsaras and the music of their instruments, came from heaven\r\nfor taking away that hunter of animals. That beast of prey, having\r\nundergone ascetic austerities, had obtained a boon and had become the\r\ncause of the destruction of all creatures. For this reason he was made\r\nblind by the Self-born. Having slain that animal which had resolved to\r\nslay all creatures, Valaka went to heaven. Morality is even so difficult\r\nof being understood. There was an ascetic of the name of Kausika without\r\nmuch knowledge of the scriptures. He lived in a spot much removed from a\r\nvillage, at a point where many rivers met. He made a vow, saying, 'I must\r\nalways speak the truth.' He then became celebrated, O Dhananjaya, as a\r\nspeaker of truth. At that time certain persons, from fear of robbers,\r\nentered that wood (where Kausika dwelt). Thither even, the robbers,\r\nfilled with rage, searched for them carefully. Approaching Kausika then,\r\nthat speaker of truth, they asked him saying, 'O holy one, by which path\r\nhave a multitude of men gone a little while before? Asked in the name of\r\nTruth, answer us. If thou hast seen them, tell us this'. Thus adjured,\r\nKausika told them the truth, saying, 'Those men have entered this wood\r\ncrowded with many trees and creepers and plants'. Even thus, O Partha,\r\ndid Kausika give them the information. Then those cruel men, it is heard,\r\nfinding out the persons they sought, slew them all. In consequence of\r\nthat great sin consisting in the words spoken, Kausika, ignorant of the\r\nsubtilities of morality, fell into a grievous hell, even as a foolish\r\nman, of little knowledge, and unacquainted with the distinctions of\r\nmorality, falleth into painful hell by not having asked persons of age\r\nfor the solution of his doubts. There must be some indications for\r\ndistinguishing virtue from sin. Sometimes that high and unattainable\r\nknowledge may be had by the exercise of reason. Many persons say, on the\r\none hand, that the scriptures indicate morality. I do not contradict\r\nthis. The scriptures, however, do not provide for every case. For the\r\ngrowth of creatures have precepts of morality been declared. That which\r\nis connected with inoffensiveness is religion. Dharma protects and\r\npreserves the people. So it is the conclusion of the Pandits that what\r\nmaintains is Dharma. O Partha, I have narrated to you the signs and\r\nindications of Dharma. Hearing this, you decide whether Yudhishthira is\r\nto be slaughtered by you or not.\" Arjuna said, \"Krishna, your words are\r\nfraught with great intelligence and impregnated with wisdom. Thou art to\r\nus like our parents and our refuge. Nothing is unknown to thee in the\r\nthree worlds, so thou art conversant with the canons of morality. O\r\nKeshava of the Vrishni clan, thou knowest my vow that whoever among men\r\nwould tell me, 'Partha, give thy Gandiva to some one braver than you,' I\r\nshall at once put an end to his life. Bhima has also made a promise that\r\nwhoever would call him 'tularak', would be slaughtered by him there and\r\nthen. Now the King has repeatedly used those very words to me in thy\r\npresence, O hero, viz., 'Give thy bow.' If I slay him, O Keshava, I will\r\nnot be able to live in this world for even a moment. Having intended\r\nagain the slaughter of the king through folly and the loss of my mental\r\nfaculties, I have been polluted by sin. It behoveth thee today, O\r\nforemost of all righteous persons, to give me such counsel that my vow,\r\nknown throughout the world, may become true while at the same time both\r\nmyself and the eldest son of Pandu may live.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"The king was fatigued, and under the influence of\r\ngrief, He had been mangled in battle by Karna with numerous arrows. After\r\nthat, O hero, he was repeatedly struck by the Suta's son (with his\r\nshafts), while he was retreating from battle. It was for this that,\r\nlabouring under a load of sorrow, he spoke those improper words unto thee\r\nin wrath. He provoked thee by those words so that thou mightest slay\r\nKarna in battle. The son of Pandu knows that the wretched Karna is\r\nincapable of being borne by any one else in the world (save thee). It was\r\nfor this, O Partha, that the king in great wrath said those harsh words\r\nto thy face. The stake in the game of today's battle has been made to lie\r\nin the ever alert and always unbearable Karna. That Karna being slain,\r\nthe Kauravas would necessarily be vanquished. Even this is what the royal\r\nson of Dharma had thought. For this the son of Dharma does not deserve\r\ndeath. Thy vow also, O Arjuna, should be kept. Listen now to my counsels\r\nthat will be agreeable to thee, to counsels in consequence of which\r\nYudhishthira without being actually deprived of life may yet be dead. As\r\nlong as one that is deserving of respect continues to receive respect,\r\none is said to live in the world of men. When, however, such a person\r\nmeets with disrespect, he is spoken of as one that is dead though alive.\r\nThis king hath always been respected by thee and by Bhima and the twins,\r\nas also by all heroes and all persons in the world that are venerable for\r\nyears. In some trifle then show him disrespect. Therefore, O Partha,\r\naddress this Yudhishthira as 'thou' when his usual form of address is\r\n'your honour.' A superior, O Bharata, by being addressed as 'thou,' is\r\nkilled though not deprived of life. Bear thyself thus, O son of Kunti,\r\ntowards king Yudhishthira, the just. Adopt this censurable behaviour, O\r\nperpetuator of Kuru's race! This best audition of all auditions, hath\r\nbeen declared by both Atharvan and Angiras. Men desiring good should\r\nalways act in this way without scruples of any kind. Without being\r\ndeprived of life a superior is yet said to be killed if that venerable\r\none is addressed as 'thou.' Conversant with duty as thou art, address\r\nking Yudhishthira the just, in the manner I have indicated. This death, O\r\nson of Pandu, at thy hands, king Yudhishthira will never regard as an\r\noffence committed by thee. Having addressed him in this way, thou mayst\r\nthen worship his feet and speak words of respect unto this son of Pritha\r\nand soothe his wounded honour. Thy brother is wise. The royal son of\r\nPandu, therefore, will never be angry with thee. Freed from falsehood as\r\nalso from fratricide, thou wilt then, O Partha, cheerfully slay the\r\nSuta's son Karna!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by Janardana, Pritha's son Arjuna,\r\napplauding those counsels of his friend, then vehemently addressed king\r\nYudhishthira the just, in language that was harsh and the like of which\r\nhe had never used before.\r\n\r\n\"'Arjuna said, \"Do thou not, O king, address these upbraidings to me,\r\nthou that art passing thy time full two miles away from battle. Bhima,\r\nhowever, who is battling with the foremost heroes of the world may\r\nupbraid me. Having afflicted his foes at the proper time in battle, and\r\nslain many brave lords of earth and many foremost of car-warriors and\r\nhuge elephants and many heroic horsemen and countless brave combatants,\r\nhe hath, in addition, slain a 1,000 elephants and 10,000 Kamboja\r\nmountaineers, and is uttering loud roars in battle like a lion after\r\nslaying innumerable smaller animals. That hero achieveth the most\r\ndifficult feats, the like of which thou canst never achieve. Jumping down\r\nfrom his car, mace in hand, he hath destroyed a large number of steeds\r\nand cars and elephants in battle. With also his foremost of swords he\r\nhath destroyed many horsemen and cars and steeds and elephants. With the\r\nbroken limbs of cars, and with his bow also, he consumeth his foes.\r\nEndued with the prowess of Indra, with his feet and also his bare arms he\r\nslayeth numerous foes. Possessed of great might and resembling Kuvera and\r\nYama, he destroyeth the hostile army, putting forth his strength. That\r\nBhimasena hath the right to upbraid me, but not thou that art always\r\nprotected by friends. Agitating the foremost of car-warriors and\r\nelephants and steeds and foot-soldiers, Bhima, single-handed, is now in\r\nthe midst of the Dhartarashtras. That chastiser of foes hath the right to\r\nupbraid me. The chastiser of foes who is slaying the Kalingas, the\r\nVangas, the Angas, the Nishadas, and the Magadhas, and large numbers of\r\nhostile elephants that are ever infuriated and that look like masses of\r\nblue clouds, is competent to upbraid me. Riding on a suitable car,\r\nshaking his bow at the proper time, and with shafts in his (other) hand,\r\nthat hero poureth showers of arrows in great battle like the clouds\r\npouring torrents of rain. Eight hundred elephants, I have seen, with\r\ntheir frontal globes split open and the ends of their tusks cut off, have\r\ntoday been slain by Bhima with shafts in battle. That slayer of foes is\r\ncompetent to tell me harsh words. The learned say that the strength of\r\nthe foremost of Brahmanas lies in speech, and that the Kshatriya's\r\nstrength is in his arms. Thou, O Bharata, art strong in words and very\r\nunfeeling. Thou thinkest me to be like thyself. I always strive to do\r\nthee good with my soul, life, sons and wives. Since, not withstanding all\r\nthis, thou still piercest me with such wordy darts, it is evident that we\r\ncannot expect any happiness from thee. Lying on Draupadi's bed thou\r\ninsultest me, though for thy sake I slay the mightiest of car-warriors.\r\nThou art without any anxiety, O Bharata, and thou art cruel. I have never\r\nobtained any happiness from thee. It was for thy good, O chief of men,\r\nthat Bhishma, firmly devoted to truth, himself told thee the means of his\r\ndeath in battle, and was slain by the heroic and high-souled Shikhandi,\r\nthe son of Drupada, protected by me. I do not derive any pleasure from\r\nthe thought of thy restoration to sovereignty, since thou art addicted to\r\nthe evil practice of gambling. Having thyself committed a wicked act to\r\nwhich they only are addicted that are low, thou desirest now to vanquish\r\nthy foes through our aid. Thou hadst heard of the numerous faults and the\r\ngreat sinfulness of dice that Sahadeva spoke about. Yet dice, which are\r\nworshipped by the wicked, thou couldst not abandon. It was for this that\r\nall of us have fallen into hell. We have never derived any happiness from\r\nthee since thou wert engaged in gambling with dice. Having, O son of\r\nPandu, thyself caused all this calamity, thou art, again, addressing\r\nthese harsh words to me. Slain by us, hostile troops are lying on the\r\nfield, with mangled bodies and uttering loud wails. It was thou that\r\ndidst that cruel act in consequence of which the Kauravas have become\r\noffenders and are being destroyed. Nations from the North, the West, the\r\nEast, and the South, are being struck, wounded and slain, after the\r\nperformance of incomparable feats in battle by great warriors of both\r\nsides. It was thou that hadst gambled. It was for thee that we lost our\r\nkingdom. Our calamity arose from thee, O king! Striking us, again, with\r\nthe cruel goad of thy speeches, O king, do not provoke our wrath.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having addressed these harsh and exceedingly bitter words\r\nunto his eldest brother and thereby committed a venial sin, the\r\nintelligent Savyasaci of calm wisdom, who is ever actuated by the fear of\r\ndefection from virtue, became very cheerless. The son of the chief of the\r\ncelestials became filled with remorse and breathing heavily, drew his\r\nsword. Seeing this, Krishna asked him, \"What is this? Why dost thou again\r\nunsheathe thy sword blue as the sky? Tell me what thy answer is, for then\r\nI shall give thee counsel for the gratification of thy object.\" Thus\r\naddressed by that foremost of men, Arjuna, in great sorrow answered\r\nKeshava, saying, \"I shall, putting forth my strength, slay my own self by\r\nwhom this wicked act hath been done.\" Hearing those words of Partha,\r\nKeshava, that foremost of all righteous persons said this unto\r\nDhananjaya, \"Having said these words unto the king, why hast thou become\r\nso cheerless? O slayer of foes, thou desirest now to destroy thy own\r\nself. This, however, Kiritin, is not approved by the righteous. If, O\r\nhero among men, thou hadst today, from fear of sin, slain this thy eldest\r\nbrother of virtuous soul, what would then have been thy condition and\r\nwhat wouldst thou not then have done? Morality is subtle, O Bharata, and\r\nunknowable, especially by those that are ignorant. Listen to me as I\r\npreach to thee. By destroying thy own self, thou wouldst sink into a more\r\nterrible hell than if thou hadst slain thy brother. Declare now, in\r\nwords, thy own merit. Thou shalt then, O Partha, have slain thy own\r\nself.\" Applauding these words and saying, \"Let it be so, O Krishna,\"\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Sakra, lowering his bow, said unto Yudhishthira,\r\nthat foremost of virtuous persons, \"Listen, O king, there is no other\r\nbowman, O ruler of men, like unto myself, except the deity that bears\r\nPinaka; I am regarded by even that illustrious deity. In a moment I can\r\ndestroy this universe of mobile and immobile creatures. It was I, O king,\r\nthat vanquished all the points of the compass with all the kings ruling\r\nthere, and brought all to thy subjection. The Rajasuya (performed by\r\nthee), brought to completion by gift of Dakshina, and the celestial\r\npalace owned by thee, were both due to my prowess. In my hands are (marks\r\nof) sharp shafts and a stringed bow with arrow fixed thereon. On both my\r\nsoles are the signs of cars with standards. No one can vanquish a person\r\nlike me in battle. Nations from the North, the West, the East and the\r\nSouth, have been struck down, slain, exterminated and destroyed. A small\r\nremnant only of the samsaptakas is alive. I alone have slain half of the\r\nentire (hostile) army. Slaughtered by me, the Bharata host that\r\nresembled, O king, the very host of the celestials, is lying dead on the\r\nfield. I slay those with (high) weapons that are conversant with high\r\nweapons. For this reason I do not reduce the three worlds to ashes.\r\nRiding upon my terrible and victorious car, Krishna and myself will soon\r\nproceed for slaying the Suta's son. Let this king become cheerful now. I\r\nwill surely slay Karna in battle, with my arrows. Either the Suta dame\r\nwill today be made childless by me, or Kunti will be made childless by\r\nKarna. Truly do I say it that I will not put off my armour before I have\r\nslain Karna with my arrows in battle.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having said these words unto that foremost of virtuous\r\npersons, viz., Yudhishthira, Partha threw down his weapons and cast aside\r\nhis bow and quickly thrust his sword back into its sheath. Hanging down\r\nhis head in shame, the diadem-decked Arjuna, with joined hands, addressed\r\nYudhishthira, and said, \"Be cheerful, O king, forgiving me. What I have\r\nsaid, you will understand a little while after. I bow to thee.\" Thus\r\nseeking to cheer that royal hero capable of bearing all foes, Arjuna,\r\nthat foremost of men, standing there, once more said, \"This task will not\r\nbe delayed. It will be accomplished soon. Karna cometh towards me. I\r\nshall proceed against him. I shall, with my whole soul, proceed for\r\nrescuing Bhima from the battle and for slaying the Suta's son. I tell\r\nthee that I hold my life for thy good. Know this for the truth, O king.\"\r\nHaving said so, the diadem-decked Arjuna of blazing splendour touched the\r\nking's feet and rose for proceeding to the field. Hearing, however, those\r\nharsh words of his brother Phalguna, Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira, the\r\njust, rising up from that bed (on which he had been sitting), said these\r\nwords unto Partha, with his heart filled with sorrow, \"O Partha, I have\r\nacted wickedly. For that, ye have been overwhelmed with terrible\r\ncalamity. Do thou strike off, therefore, this my head today. I am the\r\nworst of men, and the exterminator of my race. I am a wretch. I am\r\naddicted to wicked courses. I am of foolish understanding. I am idle and\r\na coward. I am an insulter of the old. I am cruel. What wouldst thou gain\r\nby always being obedient to a cruel person like me? A wretch that I am, I\r\nshall this very day retire into the woods. Live you happily without me.\r\nThe high-souled Bhimasena is fit to be king. A eunuch that I am, what\r\nshall I do with sovereignty? I am incapable of bearing these harsh\r\nspeeches of thee excited with wrath. Let Bhima become king. Having been\r\ninsulted thus, O hero, what use have I with life.\" Having said these\r\nwords, the king, leaving that bed, suddenly stood up and desired to go to\r\nthe woods. Then Vasudeva, bowing down, said unto him, \"O king, the\r\ncelebrated vow of the wielder of Gandiva who is ever devoted to truth\r\nabout his Gandiva, is known to thee. That man in the world who would tell\r\nhim, 'Give thy Gandiva to another', would be slain by him. Even those\r\nvery words were addressed to him by you. Therefore, for keeping that\r\nearnest vow, Partha, acting also at my instance, inflicted you this\r\ninsult, O lord of Earth. Insult to superiors is said to be their death.\r\nFor this reason, O thou of mighty arms, it behoveth thee to forgive me\r\nthat beseech and bow to thee this transgression, O king, of both myself\r\nand Arjuna, committed for maintaining the truth. Both of us, O great\r\nking, throw ourselves on thy mercy. The Earth shall today drink the blood\r\nof the wretched son of Radha. I swear truly to thee. Know the Suta's son\r\nas slain today. He, whose slaughter thou desirest, hath today lost his\r\nlife.\" Hearing those words of Krishna, king Yudhishthira the just, in a\r\ngreat fury, raised the prostrate Hrishikesha and joining his hands, said\r\nin haste, \"It is even so as thou hast said. I have been guilty of a\r\ntransgression, I have now been awakened by thee, O Govinda. I am saved by\r\nthee, O Madhava. By thee, O Acyuta, we have today been rescued from a\r\ngreat calamity. Both of us stupefied by folly, viz., myself and Arjuna,\r\nhave been rescued from an ocean of distress, having obtained thee as our\r\nlord. Indeed, having obtained the raft of thy intelligence today, we\r\nhave, with our relatives and allies, passed over an ocean of sorrow and\r\ngrief. Having obtained thee, O Acyuta, we are not masterless.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having heard these joyful words of king Yudhishthira,\r\nGovinda of virtuous soul, that delighter of the Yadus, then addressed\r\nPartha. The latter, however, having at the instance of Krishna addressed\r\nthose words unto Yudhishthira, became exceedingly cheerless for having\r\ncommitted a trivial sin. Then Vasudeva, smiling, said unto the son of\r\nPandu, \"What would have been thy condition, O Partha, if, observant of\r\nvirtue thou hadst slain the son of Dharma with thy sharp sword? Having\r\nonly addressed the king as thou, such cheerlessness hath possessed thy\r\nheart. If thou hadst slain the king, O Partha, what wouldst thou have\r\ndone after that? Morality is so inscrutable, especially by persons of\r\nfoolish understanding. Without doubt great grief would have been thine in\r\nconsequence of thy fear of sin. Thou wouldst have sunk also in terrible\r\nhell in consequence of the slaughter of thy brother. Gratify now this\r\nking of virtuous behaviour, this foremost of all practisers of virtue,\r\nthis chief of Kuru's race. Even this is my wish. Gratifying the king with\r\ndevotion, and after Yudhishthira will have been made happy, we two will\r\nproceed against the car of the Suta's son for fighting him. Slaying Karna\r\ntoday with thy keen shafts in battle, do thou, O giver of honours, give\r\ngreat happiness to Dharma's son. Even this, O mighty-armed one, is what I\r\nthink to be suitable to this hour. Having done this, thy purpose will be\r\nachieved.\" Then Arjuna, O monarch, in shame, touched king Yudhishthira's\r\nfeet with his head. And he repeatedly said unto that chief of the\r\nBharatas, \"Be pleased with me, Forgive, O king, all that I have said from\r\ndesire of observing virtue and from fear of sins.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes, lying weeping\r\nat his feet, O bull of Bharata's race, king Yudhishthira the just raised\r\nhis brother. And king Yudhishthira, that lord of the earth, then embraced\r\nhis brother affectionately and wept aloud. The two brothers, of great\r\nsplendour, having wept for a long while, at last became freed from grief,\r\nO monarch, and as cheerful as before. Then embracing him once more with\r\naffection and smelling his head, the son of Pandu, exceedingly gratified,\r\napplauded his brother Jaya and said, \"O thou of mighty arms, in the very\r\nsight of all the troops, my armour, standard, bow, dart, steeds, and\r\narrows, were cut off in battle, O great bowman, by Karna with his shafts,\r\nalthough I exerted myself with care. Thinking of and seeing his feats in\r\nbattle, O Phalguna, I lose my energies in grief. Life itself is no longer\r\ndear to me. If thou dost not slay that hero in battle today, I will cast\r\naway my life breaths. What use have I with life?\" Thus addressed, Vijaya,\r\nreplied, O bull of Bharata's race, saying, \"I swear by Truth, O king, and\r\nby thy grace, by Bhima, O best of men, and by the twins, O lord of the\r\nearth, that today I shall slay Karna, in battle, or, being myself slain\r\nby him fall down on the earth. Swearing truly, I touch my weapons.\"\r\nHaving said these words unto the king, he addressed Madhava, saying,\r\n\"Without doubt, O Krishna, I will slay Karna in battle today. Aided by\r\nthy intelligence, blessed be thou, the slaughter of that wicked-souled\r\none is certain.\" Thus addressed, Keshava, O best of kings, said unto\r\nPartha, \"Thou art competent, O best of the Bharatas, to slay the mighty\r\nKarna. Even this hath ever been my thought, O mighty car-warrior, as to\r\nhow, O best of men thou, wouldst slay Karna in battle.\" Endued with great\r\nintelligence, Madhava once more addressed the son of Dharma, saying, \"O\r\nYudhishthira, it behoveth thee to comfort Vibhatsu, and command him to\r\nslaughter Karna of wicked soul. Having heard that thou hadst been\r\nafflicted with shafts of Karna, myself and this one came hither, O son of\r\nPandu, for ascertaining thy plight. By good luck, O king, thou wert not\r\nslain. By good luck thou wert not seized. Comfort thy Vibhatsu, and bless\r\nhim, O sinless one, with thy wishes for his victory.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"Come, Come, O Partha, O Vibhatsu, and embrace me, O\r\nson of Pandu. Thou hast told me beneficial words that deserved to be\r\nsaid, and I have forgiven thee. I command thee, O Dhananjaya, go and slay\r\nKarna. Do not, O Partha, be angry for the harsh words I said unto thee.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Dhananjaya, O king, bowed unto Yudhishthira by\r\nbending his head, and seized with his two hands, O sire, the feet of his\r\neldest brother. Raising him and embracing him closely, the king smelt his\r\nhead and once more said these words unto him, \"O Dhananjaya, O thou of\r\nmighty arms, I have been greatly honoured by thee. Do thou ever win\r\ngreatness and victory.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Arjuna said, \"Approaching Radha's son today that is proud of his might,\r\nI shall slay that man of sinful deeds with my shafts in battle, along\r\nwith all his kinsmen and followers. He who, having bent the bow strongly,\r\nafflicted thee with his shafts, I say, that Karna, will obtain today the\r\nbitter fruit of that act of his. Having slain Karna, O lord of the earth,\r\nI shall today come back from the dreadful battle to pay thee my respects\r\nby walking behind thee. I tell thee this truly. Without having slain\r\nKarna I shall not come back today from the great battle. Truly do I swear\r\nthis by touching thy feet, O lord of the universe.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto the diadem-decked (Arjuna) who was speaking in\r\nthat way, Yudhishthira, with a cheerful heart, said these words of grave\r\nimport, \"Do thou obtain imperishable fame, and such a period of life as\r\naccordeth with thy own desire, and victory, and energy, and the\r\ndestruction of thy foes. Let the gods grant thee prosperity. Obtain thou\r\nall these to the measure desired by me. Go quickly to battle, and slay\r\nKarna, even as Purandara slew Vritra for his own aggrandisement.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having with a cheerful heart gratified king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, Partha, prepared to slay the Suta's son, addressed Govinda,\r\nsaying, \"Let my car be once more equipped and let my foremost of steeds\r\nbe yoked thereto. Let all kinds of weapon be placed upon that great\r\nvehicle. The steeds have rolled on the ground. They have been trained by\r\npersons skilled in horse lore. Along with the other equipment of the car,\r\nlet them be quickly brought and decked in their trappings. Proceed\r\nquickly, O Govinda, for the slaughter of the Suta's son.\" Thus addressed,\r\nO monarch, by the high-souled Phalguna, Krishna commanded Daruka, saying,\r\n\"Do all that Arjuna, that chief of Bharata's race and that foremost of\r\nall wielders of the bow, hath said.\" Thus ordered by Krishna, Daruka, O\r\nbest of kings, yoked those steeds unto that car covered with tiger-skins\r\nand ever capable of scorching all foes. He then represented unto the\r\nhigh-souled son of Pandu the fact of having equipped his vehicle.\r\nBeholding the car equipped by the high-souled Daruka, Phalguna, obtaining\r\nYudhishthira's leave and causing the Brahmanas to perform propitiatory\r\nrites and utter benedictions on him, ascended that excellent vehicle.\r\nKing Yudhishthira the just, of great wisdom, also blessed him. After\r\nthis, Phalguna proceeded towards Karna's car. Beholding that great bowman\r\nthus proceeding, all creatures, O Bharata, regarded Karna as already\r\nslain by the high-souled Pandava. All the points of the compass, O king,\r\nbecame serene. King-fishers and parrots and herons, O king, wheeled\r\naround the son of Pandu. A large number of beautiful and auspicious\r\nbirds, O king, called Pung, causing Arjuna (by their timely appearance)\r\nto put forth greater speed in battle, cheerfully uttered their cries\r\naround him. Terrible Kankas and vultures, and cranes and hawks and\r\nravens, O king, tempted by the prospect of food, proceeded in advance of\r\nhis car, and indicated auspicious omens foreboding the destruction of the\r\nhostile host and the slaughter of Karna. And while Partha proceeded, a\r\ncopious perspiration covered his body. His anxiety also became very great\r\nas to how he would achieve his vow. The slayer of Madhu then, beholding\r\nPartha filled with anxiety as he proceeded, addressed the wielder of\r\nGandiva and said these words.\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"O wielder of Gandiva, save thee there exists no other\r\nman that could vanquish those whom thou hast vanquished with this bow of\r\nthine. We have seen many heroes, who, endued with prowess like that\r\nSakra, have attained to the highest regions, encountering thy heroic self\r\nin battle! Who else, O puissant one, that is not equal to thee, would be\r\nsafe and sound after encountering Drona and Bhishma and Bhagadatta, O\r\nsire, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti and Sudakshina, the chief of the\r\nKambojas and Srutayudha of mighty energy and Acyutayudha as well? Thou\r\nhast celestial weapons, and lightness of hand and might, and thou art\r\nnever stupefied in battle! Thou hast also that humility which is due to\r\nknowledge! Thou canst strike with effect! Thou hast sureness of aim, and\r\npresence of mind as regards the selection of means, O Arjuna! Thou art\r\ncompetent to destroy all mobile and immobile creatures including the very\r\ngods with the Gandharvas! On earth, O Partha, there is no human warrior\r\nwho is equal to thee in battle. Amongst all Kshatriyas, invincible in\r\nbattle, that wield the bow, amongst the very gods, I have not seen or\r\nheard of even one that is equal to thee. The Creator of all beings, viz.,\r\nBrahma himself created the great bow Gandiva with which thou fightest, O\r\nPartha! For this reason there is no one that is equal to thee. I must,\r\nhowever, O son of Pandu, say that which is beneficial to thee. Do not. O\r\nmighty-armed one, disregard Karna, that ornament of battle! Karna is\r\npossessed of might. He is proud and accomplished in weapons. He is a\r\nmaharatha. He is accomplished (in the ways of battle) and conversant with\r\nall modes of warfare. He is also well-acquainted with all that suits\r\nplace and time. What need is there of saying much? Hear in brief, O son\r\nof Pandu! I regard the mighty car-warrior Karna as thy equal, or perhaps,\r\nthy superior! With the greatest care and resolution shouldst thou slay\r\nhim in great battle. In energy he is equal to Agni. As regards speed, he\r\nis equal to the impetuosity of the wind. In wrath, he resembles the\r\nDestroyer himself. Endued with might, he resembles a lion in the\r\nformation of his body. He is eight ratnis in stature. His arms are large.\r\nHis chest is broad. He is invincible. He is sensitive. He is a hero. He\r\nis, again, the foremost of heroes. He is exceedingly handsome. Possessed\r\nof every accomplishment of a warrior, he is a dispeller of the fears of\r\nfriends. Engaged in the good of Dhritarashtra's son, he always hates the\r\nsons of Pandu. No one, not even the gods with Vasava at their head, can\r\nslay the son of Radha, save thee, as I think. Slay, therefore, the Suta's\r\nson today. No one possessed of flesh and blood, not even the gods\r\nfighting with great care, not all the warriors (of the three worlds)\r\nfighting together can vanquish that car-warrior. Towards the Pandavas he\r\nis always of wicked soul and sinful behaviour, and cruel, and of wicked\r\nintelligence. In his quarrel with the sons of Pandu, he is actuated by no\r\nconsideration affecting his own interests. Slaying that Karna, therefore,\r\nfulfill thy purpose today. Despatch today unto Yama's presence that\r\nSuta's son, that foremost of car-warriors, whose death is near. Indeed,\r\nslaying that Suta's son, that first of car-warriors, show the love for\r\nYudhishthira the just. I know thy prowess truly, O Partha, which is\r\nincapable of being resisted by the gods and Asuras. The Suta's son of\r\nwicked soul, from exceeding pride, always disregards the sons of Pandu. O\r\nDhananjaya, slay that man today for whose sake the wretched Duryodhana\r\nregardeth himself a hero, that root of all (those) sinful persons, that\r\nson of a Suta. Slay, O Dhananjaya, that tiger among men, that active and\r\nproud Karna, who hath a sword for his tongue, a bow for his mouth, and\r\narrows for his teeth. I know thee well as regards the energy and the\r\nmight that are in thee. Slay the brave Karna in battle, like a lion\r\nslaying an elephant. Slay in battle today, O Partha, that Karna,\r\notherwise called Vaikartana, in consequence of whose energy\r\nDhritarashtra's son disregards thine.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Once more Keshava of immeasurable soul said these words\r\nunto Arjuna, who, O Bharata, was advancing (to battle), firmly resolved\r\nupon slaying Karna, 'Today is the seventeenth day, O Bharata, of this\r\nterrible massacre of men and elephants and steeds. At the outset vast was\r\nthe host that belonged to you. Encountering the foe in battle, that host\r\nhas been very much reduced in numbers, O king! The Kauravas also, O\r\nPartha, were numerous at first, teeming with elephants and steeds.\r\nEncountering thee, however, as their foe, they have been nearly\r\nexterminated in the van of battle! These lords of Earth and these\r\nSrinjayas, united together, and these Pandava troops also, obtaining thy\r\ninvincible self as their leader, are maintaining their ground on the\r\nfield. Protected by thee, O slayer of foes, the Pancalas, the Matsyas,\r\nthe Karushas, and the Cedis, have caused a great destruction of thy foes.\r\nWho is there that can vanquish the assembled Kauravas in battle? On the\r\nother hand, who is there that can vanquish the mighty car-warriors of the\r\nPandavas protected by thee? Thou, however, art competent to vanquish in\r\nbattle the three worlds consisting of the gods, the asuras, and human\r\nbeings, united together. What need I say then of the Kaurava host? Save\r\nthee, O tiger among men, who else is there, even if he resemble Vasava\r\nhimself in prowess, that could vanquish king Bhagadatta? So also, O\r\nsinless one, all the lords of earth, united together, are incapable, O\r\nPartha, of even gazing at this vast force that is protected by thee. So\r\nalso, O Partha, it is owing to their having been always protected by thee\r\nthat Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi succeeded in slaying Drona and Bhishma.\r\nWho, indeed, O Partha, could vanquish in battle those two mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Bharatas, Bhishma and Drona, both of whom were endued\r\nwith prowess equal to that of Sakra himself? Save thee, O tiger among\r\nmen, what other man in this world is able to vanquish those fierce lords\r\nof akshauhinis, those unreturning and invincible heroes, all accomplished\r\nin weapons and united together, Shantanu's son Bhishma, and Drona, and\r\nVaikartana, and Kripa, and Drona's son, and king Duryodhana himself?\r\nInnumerable divisions of soldiers have been destroyed (by thee), their\r\nsteeds and cars and elephants having been mangled (with thy shafts).\r\nNumberless Kshatriyas also, wrathful and fierce, hailing from diverse\r\nprovinces, have been destroyed by thee. Teeming with horses and\r\nelephants, large bodies of combatants of diverse Kshatriya clans, such as\r\nthe Govasas, the Dasamiyas, the Vasatis, O Bharata, and the Easterners,\r\nthe Vatadhanas, and the Bhojas that are very sensitive of their honour,\r\napproaching thee and Bhima, O Bharata, have met with destruction. Of\r\nterrible deeds and exceedingly fierce, the Tusharas, the Yavanas, the\r\nKhasas, the Darvabhisaras, the Daradas, the Sakas, the Kamathas, the\r\nRamathas, the Tanganas the Andhrakas, the Pulindas, the Kiratas of fierce\r\nprowess, the Mlecchas, the Mountaineers, and the races hailing from the\r\nsea-side, all endued with great wrath and great might, delighting in\r\nbattle and armed with maces, these all--united with the Kurus and\r\nfighting wrathfully for Duryodhana's sake were incapable of being\r\nvanquished in battle by anybody else save thee, O scorcher of foes! What\r\nman, unprotected by thee, could advance, beholding the mighty and\r\nswelling host of the Dhartarashtras arrayed in order of battle? Protected\r\nby thee, O puissant one, the Pandavas, filled with wrath, and penetrating\r\ninto its midst, have destroyed that host shrouded with dust and\r\nresembling a swollen sea. Seven days have elapsed since the mighty\r\nJayatsena, the ruler of the Magadhas, was slain in battle by Abhimanyu.\r\nAfter that, 10,000 elephants, of fierce feats, that used to follow that\r\nking, were slain by Bhimasena with his mace. After that, other elephants,\r\nand car-warriors, by hundreds, have been destroyed by Bhima in that\r\nexercise of his might. Even thus, O Partha, during the progress of this\r\nawful battle, the Kauravas, with their steeds and carwarriors and\r\nelephants, encountering Bhimasena and thee, O son of Pandu, have from\r\nhence repaired to the region of Death. The van of the Kaurava army, O\r\nPartha, having been struck down by the Pandavas, Bhishma shot showers of\r\nfierce shafts, O sire! Conversant with the highest weapons, he shrouded\r\nthe Cedis, the Pancalas, the Karushas, the Matsyas, and the Kaikayas with\r\nthe shafts, and deprived them of life! The welkin became filled with\r\ngold-winged and straight coursing shafts, capable of piercing the bodies\r\nof all foes, that issued out of his bow. He slew thousands of\r\ncar-warriors, shooting showers of shafts at a time. In all, he slew a\r\n100,000 men and elephants of great might. Abandoning the diverse motions,\r\neach of a new kind, in which they careered, those wicked kings and\r\nelephants, while perishing, destroyed many steeds and cars and elephants.\r\nIndeed, numberless were the shafts that Bhishma shot in battle.\r\nSlaughtering the Pandava host for ten days together, Bhishma made the\r\nterraces of numberless cars empty and deprived innumerable elephants and\r\nsteeds of life. Having assumed the form of Rudra or of Upendra in battle,\r\nhe afflicted the Pandava divisions and caused a great carnage amongst\r\nthem. Desirous of rescuing the wicked Suyodhana who was sinking in a\r\nraftless sea, he slaughtered many lords of Earth among the Cedis, the\r\nPancalas, and the Kaikayas, and caused a great massacre of the Pandava\r\narmy teeming with cars and steeds and elephants. Innumerable\r\nfoot-soldiers among the Srinjayas, all well-armed, and other lords of\r\nearth, were incapable of even looking at that hero when he careered in\r\nbattle like the Sun himself of scorching splendour. At last the Pandavas,\r\nwith all their resources, made a mighty effort, and rushed against that\r\nwarrior who, inspired with the desire of victory, used to career in\r\nbattle even in this way. Without availing himself of any aid, he routed,\r\nhowever, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas in battle, and came to be\r\nregarded as the one foremost hero in the world. Encountering him,\r\nShikhandi, protected by thee, slew that tiger among men with his straight\r\nshafts. Having obtained thee that art a tiger among men (as his foe),\r\nthat grandsire is now stretched on a bed of arrows, like Vritra when he\r\nobtained Vasava for his foe. The fierce Drona also slaughtered the\r\nhostile army for five days together. Having made an impenetrable array\r\nand caused many mighty car-warriors to be slain, that great car-warrior\r\nhad protected Jayadratha (for some time). Fierce as the Destroyer\r\nhimself, he caused a great carnage in the nocturnal battle. Endued with\r\ngreat valour, the heroic son of Bharadwaja consumed innumerable\r\ncombatants with his arrows. At last, encountering Dhrishtadyumna, he\r\nattained to the highest end. If, on that day, thou hadst not checked in\r\nbattle all the (Dhartarashtra) car-warriors headed by the Suta's son,\r\nDrona then would never have been slain. Thou heldst in check the whole\r\nDhartarashtra force. It was for this, O Dhananjaya, that Drona could be\r\nslain by the son of Prishata. What other Kshatriya, save thee, could in\r\nbattle achieve such feats for compassing the slaughter of Jayadratha.\r\nChecking the vast (Kaurava) army and slaying many brave kings, thou\r\nkilledest king Jayadratha, aided by the might and energy of thy weapons.\r\nAll the kings regarded the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus to have\r\nbeen exceedingly wonderful. I, however, do not regard it so; thou didst\r\nit and thou art a great car-warrior. If this vast assemblage of\r\nKshatriyas, obtaining thee as a foe, suffer extermination in course of\r\neven a whole day, I should, I think, still regard these Kshatriyas to be\r\ntruly mighty. When Bhishma and Drona have been slain, the terrible\r\nDhartarashtra host, O Partha, may be regarded to have lost all its\r\nheroes. Indeed, with all its foremost warriors slain, with its steeds,\r\ncars, and elephants destroyed, the Bharata army looketh today like the\r\nfirmament, reft of the Sun, the Moon, and stars. Yonder host of fierce\r\nprowess, O Partha, hath been shorn of its splendours today like the Asura\r\nhost in days of yore shorn of its splendours by Sakra's prowess. The\r\nremnant of that grand master now consists of only five great\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Ashvatthama, Kritavarma, Karna, Shalya, and Kripa.\r\nSlaying those five great car-warriors today, O tiger among men, be thou a\r\nhero that hath killed all his foes, and bestow thou the Earth with all\r\nher islands and cities on king Yudhishthira. Let Pritha's son\r\nYudhishthira of immeasurable energy and prosperity, obtain today the\r\nwhole earth with the welkin above it, the waters on it, and the nether\r\nregions below it. Slaying this host like Vishnu in days of yore slaying\r\nthe Daityas and the Danavas, bestow the Earth on the king like Hari\r\nbestowing (the three worlds) on Sakra. Let the Pancalas rejoice today,\r\ntheir foes being slain, like the celestials rejoicing after the slaughter\r\nof the Danavas by Vishnu. If in consequence of thy regard for that\r\nforemost of men, viz., thy preceptor Drona, thou cherishest compassion\r\nfor Ashvatthama, if, again, thou hast any kindness for Kripa for the sake\r\nof respect that is due to a preceptor, if, approaching Kritavarma, thou\r\ndost not despatch him today to Yama's abode in consequence of the honour\r\nthat is due to one's kinsmen by the mother's side, if, O lotus-eyed one,\r\napproaching thy mother's brother, viz., Shalya, the ruler of the Madras,\r\nthou dost not from compassion slay him, I ask thee, do thou, with keen\r\nshafts, O foremost of men slay Karna today with speed, that vile wretch\r\nof sinful heart who cherisheth the fiercest hate for the son of Pandu.\r\nThis is thy noblest duty. There is nothing in it that would be improper.\r\nWe approve of it, and here is no fault in the act. The wicked-souled\r\nKarna is the root, O thou of unfading glory, of that attempt, O sinless\r\none, made in the night for burning thy mother with all her children, and\r\nof that conduct which Suyodhana adopted towards you in consequence of\r\nthat match at dice. Suyodhana always hopeth for deliverance through\r\nKarna. Filled with rage, he endeavours to afflict me also (in consequence\r\nof that support). It is the firm belief of Dhritarashtra's royal son, O\r\ngiver of honours, that Karna, without doubt, will slay all the Prithas in\r\nbattle. Though fully acquainted with thy might, still, O son of Kunti,\r\nDhritarashtra's son hath selected war with you in consequence of his\r\nreliance on Karna. Karna also always says, 'I will vanquish the assembled\r\nParthas and that mighty car-warrior, viz., Vasudeva of Dasharha's race'.\r\nBuoying up the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra, the wicked Karna\r\nalways roareth in the (Kuru) assembly. Slay him today, O Bharata. In all\r\nthe acts of injury, of which Dhritarashtra's son hath been guilty towards\r\nyou, the wicked-souled Karna of sinful understanding hath been the\r\nleader. I saw the heroic son of Subhadra of eyes like those of a bull,\r\nslain by six mighty car-warriors of cruel heart belonging to the\r\nDhritarashtra army. Grinding those bulls among men, viz., Drona, Drona's\r\nson, Kripa and other heroes, he deprived elephants of their riders and\r\nmighty car-warriors of their cars. The bull-necked Abhimanyu, that\r\nspreader of the fame of both the Kurus and the Vrishnis, deprived steeds\r\nalso of their riders and foot-soldiers of weapons and life. Routing the\r\n(Kaurava) divisions and afflicting many mighty car-warriors, he\r\ndespatched innumerable men and steeds and elephants to Yama's abode. I\r\nswear by Truth to thee, O friend, that my limbs are burning at the\r\nthought that while the son of Subhadra was thus advancing, consuming the\r\nhostile army with his shafts, even on that occasion the wicked-souled\r\nKarna was engaged in acts of hostility to that hero, O lord! Unable, O\r\nPartha, to stay in that battle before Abhimanyu's face, mangled with the\r\nshafts of Subhadra's son, deprived of consciousness, and bathed in blood,\r\nKarna drew deep breaths, inflamed with rage. At last, afflicted with\r\narrows, he was obliged to turn his back upon the field. Eagerly desirous\r\nof flying away and becoming hopeless of life, he stayed for some time in\r\nbattle, perfectly stupefied and exhausted with the wounds he had\r\nreceived. At last hearing those cruel words of Drona in battle--words\r\nthat were suited to the hour--Karna cut off Abhimanyu's bow. Made bowless\r\nby him in that battle, five great car-warriors then, well-versed in the\r\nways of foul warfare, slew that hero with showers of shafts. Upon the\r\nslaughter of that hero, grief entered the heart of everyone. Only, the\r\nwicked-souled Karna and Suyodhana laughed in joy. (Thou rememberest also)\r\nthe harsh and bitter words that Karna cruelly said unto Krishna in the\r\n(Kuru) assembly, in the presence of the Pandavas and Kurus, 'The\r\nPandavas, O Krishna, are dead! They have sunk into eternal hell! O thou\r\nof large hips, choose other lords now, O thou of sweet speeches! Enter\r\nnow the abode of Dhritarashtra as a serving woman, for, O thou of curving\r\neye-lashes, thy husbands are no more! The Pandavas will not, O Krishna,\r\nbe of any service to thee today! Thou art the wife of men that are\r\nslaves, O princess of Pancala, and thou art thyself, O beautiful lady, a\r\nslave! Today only Duryodhana is regarded as the one king on earth; all\r\nother kings of the world are worshipping the agency by which his\r\nadministration is kept up. Behold now, O amiable one, how all the sons of\r\nPandu have equally fallen! Overwhelmed by the energy of Dhritarashtra's\r\nson, they are now silently eyeing one another. It is evident that they\r\nare all sesame seeds without kernel, and have sunk into hell. They will\r\nhave to serve the Kaurava (Duryodhana), that king of kings, as his\r\nslaves.' Even these were the foul words that that wretch, viz., the\r\nsinful Karna of exceedingly wicked heart, spoke on that occasion, in thy\r\nhearing, O Bharata! Let gold-decked shafts whetted on stone and capable\r\nof taking the life of him at whom they are sped, shot by thee, quench\r\n(the fire of) those words and all the other wrongs that that\r\nwicked-souled wight did unto thee. Let thy shafts quench all those wrongs\r\nand the life also of that wicked wight. Feeling the touch of terrible\r\narrows sped from Gandiva, let the wicked-souled Karna recollect today the\r\nwords of Bhishma and Drona! Let foe-killing cloth-yard shafts, equipped\r\nwith the effulgence of lightning, shot by thee, pierce his vital limbs\r\nand drink his blood! Let fierce and mighty shafts, of great impetuosity,\r\nsped by thy arms, penetrate the vitals of Karna today and despatch him to\r\nYama's abode. Let all the kings of the earth, cheerless and filled with\r\ngrief and uttering wails of woe, behold Karna fall down from his car\r\ntoday, afflicted with thy arrows. Let his kinsmen, with cheerless faces,\r\nbehold Karna today, fallen down and stretched at his length on the earth,\r\ndipped in gore and with his weapons loosened from his grasp! Let the\r\nlofty standard of Adhiratha's son, bearing the device of the elephant's\r\nrope, fall fluttering on the earth, cut off by thee with a broad-headed\r\narrow. Let Shalya fly away in terror, abandoning the gold-decked car (he\r\ndrives) upon seeing it deprived of its warrior and steeds and cut off\r\ninto fragments with hundreds of shafts by thee. Let thy enemy Suyodhana\r\ntoday, beholding Adhiratha's son slain by thee, despair of both his life\r\nand kingdom. Yonder, O Partha, Karna, equal unto Indra in energy, or,\r\nperhaps, Sankara himself, is slaughtering thy troops with his shafts.\r\nThere the Pancalas, though slaughtered by Karna with his whetted shafts,\r\nare yet, O chief of Bharata's race, rushing (to battle), for serving the\r\ncause of the Pandavas. Know, O Partha, that is prevailing over the\r\nPancalas, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nShikhandi, and the sons of Dhrishtadyumna, and Satanika, the son of\r\nNakula, and Nakula himself, and Sahadeva, and Durmukha, and Janamejaya,\r\nand Sudharman, and Satyaki! The loud uproar made by those allies of\r\nthine, viz., the Pancalas, O scorcher of foes, as they are being struck\r\nby Karna in dreadful battle, is heard. The Pancalas have not at all been\r\ninspired with fear, nor do they turn away their faces from the battle.\r\nThose mighty bowmen are utterly reckless of death in great battle.\r\nEncountering even that Bhishma who, single-handed, had encompassed the\r\nPandava army with a cloud of shafts, the Pancalas did not turn away their\r\nfaces from him. Then again, O chastiser of foes, they always strove with\r\nalacrity to vanquish forcibly in battle their great foe, viz., the\r\ninvincible Drona, that preceptor of all wielders of the bow, that blazing\r\nfire of weapons, that hero who always burnt his foes in battle. They have\r\nnever turned their faces from battle, afraid of Adhiratha's son. The\r\nheroic Karna, however, with his shafts, is taking the lives of the\r\nPancala warriors endued with great activity as they are advancing against\r\nhim, like a blazing fire taking the lives of myriads of insects. The son\r\nof Radha, in this battle, is destroying in hundreds the Pancalas that are\r\nadvancing against him,--those heroes, that are resolved to lay down their\r\nlives for the sake of their allies! It behoveth thee, O Bharata, to\r\nbecome a raft and rescue those brave warriors, those great bowmen, that\r\nare sinking in the raftless ocean represented by Karna. The awful form of\r\nthat weapon which was obtained by Karna from that foremost of sages,\r\nviz., Rama of Bhrigu's race, hath been displayed. Scorching all the\r\ntroops, that weapon of exceedingly fierce and awful form is blazing with\r\nits own energy, surrounding our vast army. Those arrows, sped from\r\nKarna's bow, are coursing in battle thick as swarm of bees, and scorching\r\nthy troops. Encountering Karna's weapon in battle, that is irresistible\r\nby persons not having their souls under control, there the Pancalas, O\r\nBharata, are flying away in all directions! Yonder, Bhima, of\r\nunappeasable wrath, surrounded on all sides by the Srinjayas, is fighting\r\nwith Karna, O Partha, afflicted by the latter with keen shafts! If\r\nneglected, Karna will, O Bharata, exterminate the Pandavas, the\r\nSrinjayas, and the Pancalas, like a neglected disease whose germ has\r\nentered the body. Save thee I do not see another in Yudhishthira's army\r\nthat would come home safe and sound, having encountered the son of Radha\r\nin battle. Slaying that Karna today with thy keen shafts, O bull among\r\nmen, act according to thy vow, O Partha, and win great fame. I tell thee\r\ntruly, thou only art able to vanquish in battle the Kaurava host with\r\nKarna amongst them, and no one else, O foremost of warriors! Achieving\r\nthis great feat, viz., slaying the mighty car-warrior Karna, attain thy\r\nobject, O Partha, and crowned with success, be happy, O best of men!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Keshava, O Bharata, Vibhatsu soon\r\ncast off his anxiety and became cheerful. Rubbing then the string of\r\ngandiva and stretching it, he held his bow for the destruction of Karna,\r\nand addressed Keshava, saying, 'With thee for my protector, O Govinda,\r\nand when thou that art acquainted with the past and the future art\r\ngratified with me today, victory is sure to be mine. Aided by thee, O\r\nKrishna, I can, in great battle, destroy the three worlds assembled\r\ntogether, what need be said of Karna then? I see the Pancala host is\r\nflying away, O Janardana. I see also Karna careering fearlessly in\r\nbattle. I see too the bhargava weapon careering in all directions, having\r\nbeen invoked by Karna, O thou of Vrishni's race, like the puissant\r\nthunder invoked by Shakra. This is that battle in which Karna will be\r\nslain by me and of which all creatures will speak as long as the earth\r\nwill last. Today, O Krishna, unbarbed arrows, impelled by my arms and\r\nsped from the gandiva, mangling Karna, will take him to Yama. Today king\r\nDhritarashtra will curse that intelligence of his in consequence of which\r\nhe had installed Duryodhana, who was undeserving of sovereignty, on the\r\nthrone. Today, O mighty-armed one, Dhritarashtra will be divested of\r\nsovereignty, happiness, prosperity, kingdom, city, and sons. I tell thee\r\ntruly, O Krishna, that today, Karna being slain, Duryodhana will become\r\nhopeless of both life and kingdom. Today, beholding Karna cut in pieces\r\nby me with my arrows, like Vritra in days of yore by Indra in the battle\r\nbetween the gods and the asuras, let king Duryodhana call to mind the\r\nwords thou hast spoken for bringing about peace. Today let the son of\r\nSubala, O Krishna, know that my shafts are dice, my gandiva the box for\r\nthrowing them, and my car, the chequered cloth. O Govinda, slaying Karna\r\nwith keen shafts I will dispel the long sleeplessness of Kunti's son.\r\nToday the royal son of Kunti, upon the slaughter of the Suta's son by me,\r\nshall be gratified and be of cheerful heart and obtain happiness for\r\never. Today, O Keshava, I will shoot an irresistible and unrivalled arrow\r\nthat will deprive Karna of life. Even this, O Krishna, was the vow of\r\nthat wicked-souled one about my slaughter, viz., 'I will not wash my feet\r\ntill I slay Phalguna.' Falsifying this vow of that wretch, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, I will, with straight shafts, throw down his body today from his\r\ncar. Today the earth will drink the blood of that Suta's son who in\r\nbattle condemns all other men on earth! With Dhritarashtra's approbation,\r\nthe Suta's son Karna, boasting of his own merits, had said, 'Thou hast no\r\nhusband now, O Krishna!' My keen shafts will falsify that speech of his.\r\nLike angry snakes of virulent poison, they will drink his life-blood.\r\nCloth-yard shafts, of the effulgence of the lightning, shot by myself\r\npossessed of mighty arms, sped from Gandiva, will send Karna on his last\r\njourney. Today the son of Radha will repent for those cruel words that he\r\nsaid unto the princess of Pancala in the midst of the assembly, in\r\ndisparagement of the Pandavas! They that were on that occasion sesame\r\nseeds without kernel, will today become seeds with kernel after the fall\r\nof the Suta's son Karna of wicked soul, otherwise called Vaikartana! 'I\r\nwill save ye from the sons of Pandu!'--even these were the words that\r\nKarna, bragging of his own merits, said unto the sons of Dhritarashtra!\r\nMy keen shafts will falsify that speech of his! Today, in the very sight\r\nof all the bowmen, I will slay that Karna who said, 'I will slay all the\r\nPancalas with their sons.' Today, O slayer of Madhu, I will slay that\r\nKarna, that son of Radha, relying on whose prowess the proud son of\r\nDhritarashtra, of wicked understanding, always disregarded us. Today, O\r\nKrishna, after Karna's fall, the Dhartarashtras with their king, struck\r\nwith panic, will fly away in all directions, like deer afraid of the\r\nlion. Today let king Duryodhana repent upon the slaughter of Karna, with\r\nhis sons and relatives, by me in battle. Today, beholding Karna slain,\r\nlet the wrathful son of Dhritarashtra, O Krishna, know me to be the\r\nforemost of all bowmen in battle. Today, I will make king Dhritarashtra,\r\nwith his sons and grandsons and counsellors and servants, shelterless.\r\nToday, cranes and other carnivorous birds will, O Keshava, sport over the\r\nlimbs of Karna cut off into pieces with my shafts. Today, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, I will cut off in battle the head of Radha's son Karna, in the\r\nvery sight of all the bowmen. Today, O slayer of Madhu, I will cut off in\r\nbattle the limbs of Radha's son of wicked soul with keen vipathas and\r\nrazor-faced arrows. Today, the heroic king Yudhishthira will cast off a\r\ngreat pain and a great sorrow cherished long in his heart. Today, O\r\nKeshava, slaying the son of Radha, with all his kinsmen, I will gladden\r\nking Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma. Today, I will slay the cheerless\r\nfollowers of Karna in battle, with shafts resembling the blazing fire or\r\nthe poison of the snake. Today, with my straight shafts equipped with\r\nvulturine feathers, I will, O Govinda, cause the earth to be strewn with\r\n(the bodies of) kings cased in golden armour. Today, O slayer of Madhu, I\r\nwill, with keen shafts, crush the bodies and cut off the heads of all the\r\nfoes of Abhimanyu. Today, I will bestow the earth, divested of\r\nDhartarashtras on my brother, or, perhaps, thou, O Keshava, wilt walk\r\nover the earth divested of Arjuna! Today, O Krishna, I will free myself\r\nfrom the debt I owe to all bowmen, to my own wrath, to the Kurus, to my\r\nshafts, and to gandiva. Today, I will be freed from the grief that I have\r\ncherished for thirteen years, O Krishna, by slaying Karna in battle like\r\nMaghavat slaying Samvara. Today, after I have slain Karna in battle, let\r\nthe mighty car-warriors of the Somakas, who are desirous of accomplishing\r\nthe task of their allies, regard their task as accomplished. I do not\r\nknow what will be the measure, O Madhava, of the joy of Sini's grandson\r\ntoday after I shall have slain Karna and won the victory. Today, I will\r\nslay Karna in battle as also his son, that mighty car-warrior, and give\r\njoy to Bhima and the twins and Satyaki. Today, slaying Karna in dreadful\r\nbattle, I will pay off my debt, O Madhava, to the Pancalas with\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi! Today let all behold the wrathful\r\nDhananjaya fight with the Kauravas in battle and slay the Suta's son.\r\nOnce more there is none equal to me in the world. In prowess also, who is\r\nthere that resembles me? What other man is there that is equal to me in\r\nforgiveness? In wrath also, there is no one that is equal to me. Armed\r\nwith the bow and aided by the prowess of my arms, I can vanquish the\r\nAsuras and the gods and all creatures united together. Know that my\r\nprowess is higher than the highest. Alone assailing all the Kurus and the\r\nBahlikas with the fire of my shafts issuing from Gandiva, I will, putting\r\nforth my might, burn them with their followers like a fire in the midst\r\nof a heap of dry grass at the close of winter. My palms bear these marks\r\nof arrows and this excellent and outstretched bow with arrow fixed on the\r\nstring. On each of the soles of my feet occur the mark of a car and a\r\nstandard. When a person like me goeth forth to battle, he cannot be\r\nvanquished by any one.\" Having said these words unto Acyuta, that\r\nforemost of all heroes, that slayer of foes, with blood red eyes,\r\nproceeded quickly to battle, for rescuing Bhima and cutting off the head\r\nfrom Karna's trunk.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'In that awful and fathomless encounter of the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas with the warriors of my army, when Dhananjaya,\r\nO sire, proceeded for battle, how, indeed, did the fight occur?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The innumerable divisions of the Pandava army, decked\r\nwith lofty standards and swelling (with pride and energy) and united\r\ntogether in battle, began to roar aloud, drums and other instruments\r\nconstituting their mouth, like masses of clouds at the close of summer\r\nuttering deep roars. The battle that ensued resembled a baneful shower\r\nout of season, cruel and destructive of living creatures. Huge elephants\r\nwere its clouds; weapons were the water they were to pour; the peal of\r\nmusical instruments, the rattle of car-wheels, and the noise of palms,\r\nconstituted their roar; diverse weapons decked with gold formed their\r\nflashes of lightning; and arrows and swords and cloth-yard shafts and\r\nmighty weapons constituted their torrents of rain. Marked by impetuous\r\nonsets blood flowed in streams in that encounter. Rendered awful by\r\nincessant strokes of the sword, it was fraught with a great carnage of\r\nKshatriyas. Many car-warriors, united together, encompassed one\r\ncar-warrior and despatched him to Yama's presence. Or, one foremost of\r\ncar-warriors despatched a single adversary, or one despatched many\r\nadversaries united together. Again, some one car-warrior despatched to\r\nYama's abode some one adversary along with his driver and steeds. Some\r\none rider, with a single elephant, despatched many car-warriors and\r\nhorsemen. Similarly, Partha, with clouds of shafts, despatched large\r\nnumber of cars with drivers and steeds, of elephants and horses with\r\ntheir riders, and of foot-soldiers, belonging to the enemy. Kripa and\r\nShikhandi encountered each other in that battle, while Satyaki proceeded\r\nagainst Duryodhana. And Srutasravas was engaged with Drona's son, and\r\nYudhamanyu with Citrasena. The great Srinjaya car-warrior Uttamauja was\r\nengaged with Karna's son Sushena, while Sahadeva rushed against Shakuni,\r\nthe king of the Gandharas, like a hungry lion against a mighty bull. The\r\nyouthful Satanika, the son of Nakula, rushed against the youthful\r\nVrishasena, the son of Karna, shooting showers of shafts. The heroic son\r\nof Karna struck that son of the princess of Pancala with many arrows.\r\nConversant with all modes of warfare, Madri's son Nakula, that bull among\r\ncar-warriors, assailed Kritavarma. The king of the Pancalas,\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the son of Yajnasena, attacked Karna, the commander of\r\nthe Kaurava army, with all his forces. Duhshasana, O Bharata, with the\r\nswelling host of the samsaptakas forming a portion of the Bharata army,\r\nfiercely attacked in that battle Bhima, that foremost of warriors of\r\nirresistible impetuosity. The heroic Uttamauja, putting forth his\r\nstrength struck the son of Karna and cut off his head which fell down on\r\nthe earth, filling the earth and the welkin with a loud noise. Beholding\r\nthe head of Sushena lying on the ground, Karna became filled with grief.\r\nSoon, however, in rage he cut off the steeds, the car, and the standard,\r\nof his son's slayer with many keen shafts. Meanwhile Uttamauja, piercing\r\nwith his keen shafts and cutting off with his bright sword the steeds of\r\nKripa and those warriors also that protected Kripa's sides, quickly\r\nascended the car of Shikhandi. Beholding Kripa deprived of his car,\r\nShikhandi who was on his vehicle, wished not to strike him with his\r\nshafts. The son of Drona then, covering with his own the car of Kripa,\r\nrescued the latter like a bull sunk in a mire. Meanwhile Bhima, the son\r\nof the Wind-god clad in golden mail, began to scorch with his keen arrows\r\nthe troops of thy sons like the mid-day sun scorching everything in the\r\nsummer season.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of the fierce engagement, Bhima,\r\nwhile fighting along, being encompassed by innumerable foes, addressed\r\nhis driver, saying, \"Bear me into the midst of the Dhartarashtra host.\r\nProceed, O charioteer, with speed, borne by these steeds. I will despatch\r\nall these Dhartarashtras to the presence of Yama.\" Thus urged by\r\nBhimasena, the charioteer proceeded, quickly and with great impetuosity,\r\nagainst thy son's host to that spot whence Bhima desired to slaughter it.\r\nThen a large number of Kaurava troops, with elephants and cars and horse\r\nand foot, advanced against him from all sides. They then, from every\r\nside, began to strike that foremost of vehicles belonging to Bhima, with\r\nnumerous arrows. The high-souled Bhima, however, with his own shafts of\r\ngolden wings, cut off all those advancing arrows of his enemies. Thus cut\r\noff into two or three fragments with Bhima's arrows, those shafts,\r\nequipped with golden wings, of his enemies, fell down on the earth. Then,\r\nO king, amongst those foremost of Kshatriyas, struck with Bhima's shafts,\r\nthe elephants and cars and horse and foot, set up a loud wail, O monarch,\r\nthat resembled the din made by mountains when riven with thunder. Thus\r\nstruck by Bhima, those foremost of Kshatriyas, their limbs pierced with\r\nBhima's powerful shafts, rushed against Bhima in that battle from every\r\nside, like new-fledged birds towards a tree. When thy troops thus rushed\r\nagainst him, Bhima of furious impetuosity displayed all his vim like\r\nDestroyer himself armed with a mace when he burns and exterminates all\r\ncreatures at the end of the Yuga. Thy soldiers were unable to resist in\r\nthat battle that fierce forcible energy of Bhima endued with fierce\r\nimpetuosity, like that of the Destroyer himself of wide open mouth when\r\nhe rusheth at the end of the Yuga for exterminating all creatures. Then,\r\nO Bharata, like masses of clouds scattered by the tempest the Bharata\r\nhost, thus mangled and burnt in that battle by the high-souled Bhima,\r\nbroke and fled in fear in all directions. Then the mighty Bhimasena of\r\ngreat intelligence once more cheerfully said unto his charioteer,\r\n\"Ascertain, O Suta, whether those assembled cars and standards that are\r\nadvancing towards me, are ours or the enemy's. Absorbed in battle, I am\r\nunable to distinguish them. Let me not shroud our own troops with my\r\nshafts. O Visoka, beholding hostile warriors and cars and the tops of\r\ntheir standards on all sides, I am greatly afflicted. The king is in\r\npain. The diadem-decked Arjuna also has not yet come. These things, O\r\nSuta, fill my heart with sorrow. Even this is my grief, O charioteer,\r\nthat king Yudhishthira the just should have gone away, leaving me in the\r\nmidst of the enemy. I do not know whether he, as also Vibhatsu, is alive\r\nor dead. This adds to my sorrow. I shall, however, though filled with\r\ngreat grief, destroy those hostile troops of great might. Thus\r\nslaughtering in the midst of battle my assembled foes, I shall rejoice\r\nwith thee today. Examining all the quivers containing my arrows, tell me,\r\nO Suta, ascertaining the matter well, what quantity of arrows is still\r\nleft on my car, that is, how much of what sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Thus commanded, Visoka said, \"Of arrows, O hero, thou hast yet 60,000,\r\nwhile thy razor-headed shafts number 10,000, and broad-headed ones number\r\nas much. Of cloth-yard shafts thou hast still 2,000, O hero, and of\r\nPradaras thou hast still, O Partha, 3,000! Indeed, of the weapons, O son\r\nof Pandu, the portion that still remains is not capable of being borne,\r\nif placed on carts, by six bullocks. Shoot and hurl them, O learned one,\r\nfor of maces and swords and other weapons used with the arms alone, thou\r\nhast thousands upon thousands, as also lances and scimitars and darts and\r\nspears! Never fear that thy weapons will be exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Bhima said, \"Behold, O Suta, today this awful battle in which\r\neverything will be shrouded with my impetuous arrows sped fiercely from\r\nmy bow and, mangling all my foes, and in consequence of which the very\r\nsun will disappear from the field, making the latter resemble the domains\r\nof Death! Today, even this will be known to all the Kshatriyas including\r\nthe very children, O Suta, that Bhimasena hath succumbed in battle or\r\nthat, alone, he hath subjugated all the Kurus! Today, let all the\r\nKauravas fall in battle or let all the world applaud me, beginning with\r\nthe feats of my earliest years. Alone, I will overthrow them all, or let\r\nall of them strike Bhimasena down. Let the gods that aid in the\r\nachievement of the best acts bless me. Let that slayer of foes Arjuna\r\ncome here now like Sakra, duly invoked, quickly coming to a sacrifice.\r\nBehold, the Bharata host is breaking! Why do those kings fly away? It is\r\nevident that Savyasaci, that foremost of men, is quickly shrouding that\r\nhost with his shafts. Behold, those standards, O Visoka, and elephants\r\nand steeds and bands of foot-soldiers are flying away. Behold, these\r\ncars, assailed with shafts and darts, with those warriors riding on them,\r\nare being scattered, O Suta! Yonder, the Kaurava host, assailed with the\r\nshafts, equipped with wings of gold and feathers of peacocks, of\r\nDhananjaya, and resembling thunderbolts in force, though slaughtered\r\nextensively, is repeatedly filling its gaps. There, cars and steeds and\r\nelephants are flying away, crushing down bands of foot-soldiers. Indeed,\r\nall the Kauravas, having lost their sense, are flying away, like\r\nelephants filled with panic at a forest conflagration, and uttering cries\r\nof woe. These huge elephants, again, O Visoka, are uttering loud cries,\r\nassailed with shafts.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Visoka said, \"How is it, O Bhima, that thou dost not hear the loud\r\ntwang of the yawning Gandiva stretched by Partha in wrath? Are these two\r\nears of thine gone? All thy wishes, O son of Pandu, have been fulfilled!\r\nYonder the Ape (on Arjuna's banner) is seen in the midst of the elephant\r\nforce (of the enemy). Behold, the string of Gandiva is flashing\r\nrepeatedly like lightning amid blue clouds. Yonder the Ape on\r\nDhananjaya's standard-top is everywhere seen to terrify hostile divisions\r\nin this dreadful battle. Even I, looking at it, am struck with fear.\r\nThere the beautiful diadem of Arjuna is shining brilliantly. There, the\r\nprecious jewel on the diadem, endued with the splendour of the sun,\r\nlooketh exceedingly resplendent. There, beside him, behold his conch\r\nDevadatta of loud blare and the hue of a white cloud. There, by the side\r\nof Janardana, reins in hand, as he penetrates into the hostile army,\r\nbehold his discus of solar effulgence, its nave hard as thunder, and its\r\nedge sharp as a razor. Behold, O hero, that discus of Keshava, that\r\nenhancer of his fame, which is always worshipped by the Yadus. There, the\r\ntrunks, resembling lofty trees perfectly straight, of huge elephants, cut\r\noff by Kiritin, are falling upon the earth. There those huge creatures\r\nalso, with their riders, pierced and split with shafts, are falling down,\r\nlike hills riven with thunder. There, behold, O son of Kunti, the\r\nPanchajanya of Krishna, exceedingly beautiful and of the hue of the moon,\r\nas also the blazing Kaustubha on his breast and his triumphal garland.\r\nWithout doubt, that first and foremost of all car-warriors, Partha, is\r\nadvancing, routing the hostile army as he comes, borne by his foremost of\r\nsteeds, of the hue of white clouds, and urged by Krishna. Behold those\r\ncars and steeds and bands of foot-soldiers, mangled by thy younger\r\nbrother with the energy of the chief of the celestials. Behold, they are\r\nfalling down like a forest uprooted by the tempest caused by Garuda's\r\nwings. Behold, four hundred car-warriors, with their steeds and drivers,\r\nand seven hundred elephants and innumerable foot-soldiers and horsemen\r\nslain in this battle by Kiritin with his mighty shafts. Slaughtering the\r\nKurus, the mighty Arjuna is coming towards thy side even like the\r\nconstellation Citra. All thy wishes are fulfilled. Thy foes are being\r\nexterminated. Let thy might, as also the period of thy life, ever\r\nincrease.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Bhima said, \"Since, O Visoka, thou tellest me of Arjuna's arrival, I\r\nwill give thee four and ten populous villages and a hundred female slaves\r\nand twenty cars, being pleased with thee, O Suta, for this agreeable\r\nintelligence imparted by thee!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing the roars of cars and the leonine shouts (of the\r\nwarriors) in battle, Arjuna addressed Govinda, saying, \"Urge the steeds\r\nto greater speed.\" Hearing these words of Arjuna, Govinda said unto him,\r\n\"I am proceeding with great speed to the spot where Bhima is stationed.\"\r\nThen many lions among men (belonging to the Kaurava army), excited with\r\nwrath and accompanied by a large force of cars and horse and elephants\r\nand foot-soldiers and making the earth resound with the whizz of their\r\narrows, the rattle of their car wheels, and the tread of their horses'\r\nhoofs, advanced against Jaya (Arjuna) as the latter proceeded for\r\nvictory, borne by his steeds white as snow or conchs and decked in\r\ntrappings of gold and pearls and gems like the chief of the celestials in\r\ngreat wrath proceeding, armed with the thunder, against (the asura)\r\nJambha for slaying him. Between them and Partha, O sire, occurred a great\r\nbattle destructive of body, life, and sin, like the battle between the\r\nasuras and the god Vishnu, that foremost of victors for the sake of the\r\nthree worlds. Alone, Partha, decked with diadem and garlands, cut off the\r\nmighty weapons sped by them, as also their heads and arms in diverse\r\nways, with his razor-faced and crescent-shaped and broad-headed arrows of\r\ngreat keenness. Umbrellas, and yak-tails for fanning, and standards, and\r\nsteeds, and cars, and bands of foot-soldiers, and elephants, fell down on\r\nthe earth, mutilated in diverse ways, like a forest broken down by a\r\ntempest. Huge elephants, decked in caparisons of gold and equipped with\r\ntriumphal standards and warriors (on their backs), looked resplendent, as\r\nthey were pierced with shafts of golden wings, like mountains ablaze with\r\nlight. Piercing elephants and steeds and cars with excellent shafts\r\nresembling Vasava's thunder, Dhananjaya proceeded quickly for the\r\nslaughter of Karna, even as Indra in days of yore for riving (the asura)\r\nVala. Then that tiger among men, that mighty-armed chastiser of foes,\r\npenetrated into thy host like a makara into the ocean. Beholding the son\r\nof Pandu, thy warriors, O king, accompanied by cars and foot-soldiers and\r\na large number of elephants and steeds, rushed against him. Tremendous\r\nwas the din made by them as they advanced against Partha, resembling that\r\nmade by the waters of the ocean lashed into fury by the tempest. Those\r\nmighty car-warriors, resembling tigers (in prowess) all rushed in that\r\nbattle against that tiger among men, abandoning all fear of death.\r\nArjuna, however, routed the troops of those leaders of the Kurus as they\r\nadvanced, shooting at him showers of weapons, like a tempest driving off\r\nmasses of congregated clouds. Those great bowmen, all skilled in smiting,\r\nunited together and proceeded against Arjuna with a large number of cars\r\nand began to pierce him with keen shafts. Then Arjuna, with his shafts,\r\ndespatched to Yama's abode several thousands of cars and elephants and\r\nsteeds. While those great car-warriors in that battle were thus struck\r\nwith shafts sped from Arjuna's bow, they were filled with fear and seemed\r\nto disappear one after another from their cars. In all, Arjuna, with his\r\nsharp arrows, slew four hundred of those heroic car-warriors exerting\r\nthemselves vigorously in battle. Thus struck in that battle with sharp\r\nshafts of diverse kinds, they fled away on all sides, avoiding Arjuna.\r\nTremendous was the uproar made at the van of the army by those warriors\r\nas they broke and fled, like that made by the surging sea when it breaks\r\nupon a rock. Having routed with his arrows that army struck with fright,\r\nPritha's son Arjuna then proceeded, O sire, against the division of the\r\nSuta's son. Loud was the noise with which Arjuna faced his foes, like\r\nthat made by Garuda in days of yore when swooping down for snakes.\r\nHearing that sound, the mighty Bhimasena, desirous as he had been of\r\nobtaining a sight of Partha, became filled with joy. As soon as the\r\nvaliant Bhimasena heard of Partha's arrival, he began, O monarch, to\r\ngrind thy troops, reckless of his very life. Possessed of prowess equal\r\nto that of the wind, the valiant Bhima, the son of the Wind-god, began to\r\ncareer in that battle like the wind itself. Afflicted by him, O monarch,\r\nthy army, O king, began to reel like a wrecked vessel on the bosom of the\r\nsea. Displaying his lightness of hands, Bhima began to cut and mangle\r\nthat host with his fierce arrows and despatch large numbers to the abode\r\nof Yama. Beholding on that occasion the superhuman might of Bhima, O\r\nBharata, like that of the Destroyer at the end of the Yuga, thy warriors\r\nbecame filled with fright. Seeing his mightiest soldiers thus afflicted\r\nby Bhimasena, O Bharata, king Duryodhana addressed all his troops and\r\ngreat bowmen, O bull of Bharata's race, commanding them to slay Bhima in\r\nthat battle, since upon Bhima's fall he would regard the Pandava troops\r\nalready exterminated. Accepting that command of thy son, all the kings\r\nshrouded Bhima with showers of shafts from every side. Innumerable\r\nelephants, O king, and men inspired with desire of victory, and cars, and\r\nhorse, O monarch, encompassed Vrikodara. Thus encompassed by those brave\r\nwarriors on all sides, O king, that hero, that chief of Bharata's race,\r\nlooked resplendent like the Moon surrounded by the stars. Indeed, as the\r\nMoon at full within his corona looks beautiful, even so that best of men,\r\nexceedingly handsome, looked beautiful in that battle. All those kings,\r\nwith cruel intent and eyes red in wrath, inflicted upon Vrikodara their\r\narrowy downpours, moved by the desire of slaying him. Piercing that\r\nmighty host with straight shafts, Bhima came out of the press like a fish\r\ncoming out of a net, having slain 10,000 unretreating elephants, 200,200\r\nmen, O Bharata, and 5,000 horses, and a hundred car-warriors. Having\r\nslaughtered these, Bhima caused a river of blood to flow there. Blood\r\nconstituted its water, and cars its eddies; and elephants were the\r\nalligators with which it teemed. Men were its fishes, and steeds its\r\nsharks, and the hair of animals formed its woods and moss. Arms lopped\r\noff from trunks formed its foremost of snakes. Innumerable jewels and\r\ngems were carried along by the current. Thighs constituted its gravels,\r\nand marrow its mire. And it was covered with heads forming its rocks. And\r\nbows and arrows constituted the rafts by which men sought to cross that\r\nterrible river, and maces and spiked bludgeons formed its snakes. And\r\numbrellas and standards formed its swans, and head-gears its foam.\r\nNecklaces constituted its lotuses, and the earthy dust that arose formed\r\nits waves. Those endued with noble qualities could cross it with ease,\r\nwhile those that were timid and affrighted found it exceedingly difficult\r\nto cross. Warriors constituting its crocodiles and alligators, it ran\r\ntowards the region of Yama. Very soon, indeed, did that tiger among men\r\ncause that river to flow. Even as the terrible Vaitarani is difficult of\r\nbeing crossed by persons of unrefined souls, that bloody river, terrible\r\nand enhancing the fears of the timid, was difficult to cross. Thither\r\nwhere that best of car-warriors, the son of Pandu, penetrated, thither he\r\nfelled hostile warriors in hundreds and thousands. Seeing those feats\r\nachieved in battle by Bhimasena, Duryodhana, O monarch, addressing\r\nShakuni, said, \"Vanquish, O uncle, the mighty Bhimasena in battle. Upon\r\nhis defeat the mighty host of the Pandavas may be regarded as defeated.\"\r\nThus addressed, O monarch, the valiant son of Subala, competent to wage\r\ndreadful battle, proceeded, surrounded by his brothers. Approaching in\r\nthat battle Bhima of terrible prowess, the heroic Shakuni checked him\r\nlike the continent resisting the ocean. Though resisted with keen shafts,\r\nBhima, disregarding them all, proceeded against the sons of Subala. Then\r\nShakuni, O monarch, sped a number of cloth-yard shafts equipped with\r\nwings of gold and whetted on stone, at the left side of Bhima's chest.\r\nPiercing through the armour of the high-souled son of Pandu, those fierce\r\nshafts, O monarch, equipped with feathers of Kankas and peacocks, sunk\r\ndeep into his body. Deeply pierced in that battle, Bhima, O Bharata,\r\nsuddenly shot at Subala's son a shaft decked with gold. The mighty\r\nShakuni however, that scorcher of foes, O king, endued with great\r\nlightness of hands, cut off into seven fragments that terrible arrow as\r\nit coursed towards him. When his shaft fell down on the earth, Bhima, O\r\nking, became highly enraged, and cut off with a broad-headed arrow the\r\nbow of Subala's son with the greatest ease. The valiant son of Subala\r\nthen, casting aside that broken bow, quickly took up another and six and\r\nten broad-headed arrows. With two of those straight and broad-headed\r\narrows, O monarch, he struck Bhima himself, with one he cut off Bhima's\r\nstandard, and with two, his umbrella. With the remaining four, the son of\r\nSubala pierced the four steeds of his antagonist. Filled with rage at\r\nthis, the valiant Bhima, O monarch, hurled in that battle a dart made of\r\niron, with its staff adorned with gold. That dart, restless as the tongue\r\nof a snake, hurled from Bhima's arms, speedily fell upon the car of the\r\nhigh-souled son of Subala. The latter then, filled with wrath, O monarch,\r\ntook up that same gold-decked dart and hurled it back at Bhimasena.\r\nPiercing through the left arm of the high-souled son of Pandu, it fell\r\ndown on the earth like lightning flashed down from the sky. At this, the\r\nDhartarashtras, O monarch, set up a loud roar all around. Bhima, however,\r\ncould not bear that leonine roar of his foes endued with great activity.\r\nThe mighty son of Pandu then, quickly taking up another stringed bow, in\r\na moment, O monarch, covered with shafts the soldiers of Subala's son in\r\nthat battle, who were fighting reckless of their very lives. Having slain\r\nhis four steeds, and then his driver, O king, Bhima of great prowess next\r\ncut off his antagonist's standard with a broad-headed arrow without\r\nlosing a moment. Abandoning with speed that steedless car, Shakuni, that\r\nforemost of men, stood on the ground, with his bow ready drawn in his\r\nhands, his eyes red like blood in rage, and himself breathing heavily. He\r\nthen, O king, struck Bhima from every side with innumerable arrows. The\r\nvaliant Bhima, baffling those shafts, cut off Shakuni's bow in rage and\r\npierced Shakuni himself, with many keen arrows. Deeply pierced by his\r\npowerful antagonist, that scorcher of foes, O king, fell down on the\r\nearth almost lifeless. Then thy son, O monarch, seeing him stupefied,\r\nbore him away from battle on his car in the very sight of Bhimasena. When\r\nthat tiger among men, Shakuni was thus taken up on Duryodhana's car, the\r\nDhartarashtra troops, turning their faces from battle, fled away on all\r\nsides inspired with fear on that occasion of great terror due to\r\nBhimasena. Upon the defeat of Subala's son, O king, by that great bowman,\r\nBhimasena, thy son Duryodhana, filled with great fright, retreated, borne\r\naway by his fleet steeds, from regard for his maternal uncle's life.\r\nBeholding the king himself turn away from the battle, the troops, O\r\nBharata, fled away, from the encounters in which each of them had been\r\nengaged. Seeing all the Dhartarashtra troops turn away from battle and\r\nfly in all directions, Bhima rushing impetuously, fell upon them,\r\nshooting many hundreds of shafts. Slaughtered by Bhima, the retreating\r\nDhartarashtras, O king, approaching the spot where Karna was, once more\r\nstood for battle, surrounding him. Endued with great might and great\r\nenergy, Karna then became their refuge. Finding Karna, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, thy troops became comforted and stood cheerfully, relying\r\nupon one another, like shipwrecked mariners, O tiger of men, in their\r\ndistressful plight, when at last they reach an island. They then, once\r\nmore, making death itself their goal, proceeded against their foes for\r\nbattle.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When our troops were broken in battle by Bhimasena,\r\nwhat, O Sanjaya, did Duryodhana and Subala's son say? Or, what did Karna,\r\nthat foremost of victors, or the warriors of my army in that battle, or\r\nKripa, or Kritavarma, or Drona's son Duhshasana, say? Exceedingly\r\nwonderful, I think, is the prowess of Pandu's son, since, single-handed,\r\nhe fought in battle with all the warriors of my army. Did the son of\r\nRadha act towards the (hostile) troops according to his vow? That slayer\r\nof foes, Karna, O Sanjaya, is the prosperity, the armour, the fame, and\r\nthe very hope of life, of the Kurus. Beholding the army broken by Kunti's\r\nson of immeasurable energy, what did Karna, the son of Adhiratha and\r\nRadha, do in that battle? What also did my sons, difficult of defeat in\r\nbattle, do, or the other kings and mighty car-warriors of our army? Tell\r\nme all this, O Sanjaya, for thou art skilled in narration!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'In that afternoon, O monarch, the Suta's son of great\r\nvalour began to smite all the Somakas in the very sight of Bhimasena.\r\nBhima also of great strength began to destroy the Dhartarashtra troops.\r\nThen Karna, addressing (his driver) Shalya, said unto him, \"Bear me to\r\nthe Pancalas.\" Indeed, beholding his army in course of being routed by\r\nBhimasena of great intelligence, Karna once more addressed his driver,\r\nsaying, 'Bear me to the Pancalas only.' Thus urged, Shalya, the ruler of\r\nthe Madras, endued with great might, urged those white steeds that were\r\nfleet as thought, towards the Cedis, the Pancalas and the Karushas.\r\nPenetrating then into that mighty host, Shalya, that grinder of hostile\r\ntroops, cheerfully conducted those steeds into every spot that Karna,\r\nthat foremost of warriors, desired to go to. Beholding that car cased in\r\ntiger skins and looking like a cloud, the Pandus and the Pancalas, O\r\nmonarch, became terrified. The rattle then of that car, like unto the\r\npeal of thunder or the sound of a mountain splitting into fragments,\r\nbecame audible in that dreadful battle. With hundreds upon hundreds of\r\nkeen arrows sped from the bow-string drawn to his ear, Karna then smote\r\nhundreds and thousands of warriors belonging to the Pandava army. While\r\nthe unvanquished Karna was employed in achieving those feats, many mighty\r\nbowmen and great car-warriors among the Pandavas encompassed him on all\r\nsides. Indeed, Shikhandi, and Bhima, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of\r\nPrishata, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and\r\nSatyaki, surrounded the son of Radha, pouring showers of arrows upon him,\r\nfrom desire of despatching him to the other world. The heroic Satyaki,\r\nthat best of men, struck Karna in that engagement with twenty keen shafts\r\nin the shoulder-joint. Shikhandi struck him with five and twenty shafts,\r\nand Dhrishtadyumna struck him with seven, and the sons of Draupadi with\r\nfour and sixty, and Sahadeva with seven, and Nakula with a hundred, in\r\nthat battle. The mighty Bhimasena, in that encounter, filled with rage,\r\nstruck the son of Radha in the shoulder-joint with ninety straight\r\nshafts. The son of Adhiratha, then, of great might laughing in scorn, and\r\ndrawing his excellent bow let off many keen shafts, afflicting his foes.\r\nThe son of Radha pierced each of them in return with five arrows. Cutting\r\noff the bow of Satyaki, as also his standard, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nKarna pierced Satyaki himself with nine shafts in the centre of the\r\nchest. Filled with wrath, he then pierced Bhimasena with thirty shafts.\r\nWith a broad-headed arrow, O sire, he next cut off the standard of\r\nSahadeva, and with three other arrows, that chastiser of foes afflicted\r\nSahadeva's driver. Within the twinkling of an eye he then deprived the\r\n(five) sons of Draupadi of their cars, O bull of Bharata's race, which\r\nseemed exceedingly wonderful. Indeed, with his straight shafts casting\r\nthose heroes to turn back from the fight, the heroic Karna began to slay\r\nthe Pancalas and many mighty car-warriors among the Cedis. Thus struck in\r\nthat battle. O monarch, the Cedis and the Matsyas, rushing against Karna\r\nalone, poured upon him showers of shafts. The Suta's son, however, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, began to smite them with his keen shafts. I beheld\r\nthis exceedingly wonderful feat. O Bharata, viz., that the Suta's son of\r\ngreat prowess, alone and unsupported in that battle, fought with all\r\nthose bowmen who contended with him to the utmost of their prowess, and\r\nchecked all those Pandava warriors, O monarch, with his shafts. With the\r\nlightness of hand, O Bharata, of the high-souled Karna on that occasion,\r\nall the gods as also the Siddhas and the Charanas were gratified. All the\r\ngreat bowmen among the Dhartarashtras also, O best of men, applauded\r\nKarna, that foremost of great car-warriors, that first of all bowmen.\r\nThen Karna, O monarch, burnt the hostile army like a mighty and blazing\r\nconflagration consuming a heap of dry grass in the summer season. Thus\r\nslaughtered by Karna, the Pandava troops, struck with fear, fled in all\r\ndirections, at the very sight of Karna. Loud wails arose there among the\r\nPancalas in that great battle, while they were thus struck with the keen\r\nshafts sped from Karna's bow. Struck with fear at the noise, the vast\r\nhost of the Pandavas, those enemies of Karna, regarded him as the one\r\nwarrior in that battle. Then that crusher of foes, viz., the son of\r\nRadha, once more achieved an exceedingly wonderful feat, inasmuch as all\r\nthe Pandavas, united together, were unable to even gaze at him. Like a\r\nswelling mass of water breaking when it comes in contact with a mountain,\r\nthe Pandava army broke when it came in contact with Karna. Indeed, O\r\nking, the mighty-armed Karna in that battle, burning the vast host of the\r\nPandavas, stood there like a blazing fire without smoke. With great\r\nactivity that hero, with his shafts, cut off the arms and the heads of\r\nhis brave foes, O king, and their ears decked with earrings. Swords with\r\nhilts of ivory, and standards, and darts, and steeds, and elephants, and\r\ncars of diverse kind, O king, and banners, and axles, and yokes, and\r\nwheels of many kinds, were cut off in various ways by Karna, observant of\r\na warrior's vow. There, O Bharata, with elephants and steeds slain by\r\nKarna, the earth became impassable and miry with flesh and blood. The\r\nuneven and even spots also of the field, in consequence of slain horse\r\nand foot and broken cars and dead elephants, could no longer be\r\ndistinguished. The combatants could not distinguish friends from foes in\r\nthat thick darkness caused by shafts when Karna's (celestial) weapon was\r\ndisplayed. The mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, O monarch, were\r\ncompletely shrouded with shafts, decked with gold, that were sped from\r\nKarna's bow. Those mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, O king, in that\r\nbattle, though struggling vigorously, were repeatedly broken by the son\r\nof Radha, even as a herd of deer in the forest is routed by an angry\r\nlion. Routing the foremost of Pancala car-warriors and (other) foes,\r\nKarna of great fame, in that battle, slew the Pandava warriors like a\r\nwolf slaying smaller animals. Beholding the Pandava army turn away from\r\nbattle, the Dhartarashtra bowmen of great might rushed against the\r\nretreating host uttering terrible shouts. Then Duryodhana, O monarch,\r\nfilled with great delight, caused diverse musical instruments to be\r\nbeaten and blown in all parts of the army. The great bowmen amongst the\r\nPancalas, those foremost of men, though broken, returned heroically to\r\nthe fight, making death their goal. The son of Radha, however, that bull\r\namong men and scorcher of foes, O monarch, in that battle, broke those\r\nreturned heroes in diverse ways. There, O Bharata twenty car-warriors\r\namong the Pancalas and more than a hundred Cedi warriors were slain by\r\nKarna with his shafts. Making the terraces of cars and the backs of\r\nsteeds empty, O Bharata, and slaying the combatants that fought from the\r\nnecks of elephants, and routing the foot-soldiers, that scorcher of foes,\r\nthe Suta's son of great bravery, became incapable of being gazed at like\r\nthe mid-day sun and looked resplendent like the Destroyer himself at the\r\nend of the Yuga. Thus, O monarch, that slayer of foes, that mighty\r\nbowmen, Karna, having slain foot, horse, car-warriors, and elephants,\r\nstood there on his car. Indeed, like the Destroyer himself of great might\r\nstanding after slaying all creatures, the mighty car-warrior Karna stood\r\nalone, having slain the Somakas. The prowess that we then beheld of the\r\nPancalas seemed to be exceedingly wonderful, for, though thus struck by\r\nKarna, they refused to fly away from that hero at the head of battle. At\r\nthat time, the king (Duryodhana), and Duhshasana, and Kripa, the son of\r\nSharadvata, and Ashvatthama, and Kritavarma, and Shakuni also of great\r\nmight, slaughtered the Pandava warriors in hundreds and thousands. The\r\ntwo sons also of Karna, O monarch, those two brothers of prowess\r\nincapable of being baffled, filled with rage, slaughtered the Pandava\r\narmy in several parts of the field. The battle at that place was dreadful\r\nand cruel and the carnage that occurred was very great. Similarly the\r\nPandava heroes, Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the (five) sons of\r\nDraupadi, filled with rage, slaughtered thy host. Even thus a great\r\ndestruction took place among the Pandavas everywhere on the field, and\r\neven thus thy army also suffered great loss at the hands of the mighty\r\nBhima.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Arjuna, O monarch, having slain the four kinds\r\nof forces (of the enemy), and having obtained a sight of the angry son of\r\nthe Suta in that dreadful battle, caused a river of blood to flow there\r\nthat was tawny with flesh and marrow and bones. Human heads constituted\r\nits rocks and stones. Elephants and steeds formed its banks. Full of the\r\nbones of heroic combatants, it resounded with the cries of ravens and\r\nvultures. Umbrellas were its swans or rafts. And that river ran, bearing\r\naway heroes like trees along its current. (Even) necklaces constituted\r\nits assemblage of lotuses, and head-gears formed its excellent foam. Bows\r\nand shafts constituted its fishes; and the crowns of crushed men floated\r\non its surface. Shields and armour were its eddies, and cars were the\r\nrafts with which it teemed. And it could be easily forded by persons\r\ndesirous of victory, while to those that were cowards it was unfordable.\r\nHaving caused that river to flow, Vibhatsu, that slayer of hostile heroes\r\nand bull among men, addressing Vasudeva said, \"Yonder, O Krishna, the\r\nstandard of the Suta's son is visible. There, Bhimasena and others are\r\nfighting with that great car-warrior. There, the Pancalas, afraid of\r\nKarna, are flying away, O Janardana. Yonder, king Duryodhana, with the\r\nwhite umbrella over his head, along with Karna, looketh exceedingly\r\nresplendent as he is engaged in routing the Pancalas. There Kripa, and\r\nKritavarma, and Drona's son, that mighty car-warrior, are protecting king\r\nDuryodhana, themselves protected by the Suta's son. There, O Krishna,\r\nShalya, well conversant with holding the reins, looketh exceedingly\r\nresplendent as, seated on the terrace of Karna's car, he guideth that\r\nvehicle. Bear me to that mighty car-warrior, for even such is the wish\r\ncherished by me. Without slaying Karna in this battle I will never\r\nreturn. Otherwise, the son of Radha, O Janardana, will, in my sight,\r\nexterminate the mighty car-warriors of the Parthas and the Srinjayas.\"\r\nThus addressed, Keshava quickly proceeded on his car, towards the mighty\r\nbowman Karna, for causing a single combat to take place between Karna and\r\nSavyasaci. Indeed, the mighty-armed Hari, at the command of Pandu's son,\r\nproceeded on his car, assuring (by that very act) all the Pandava troops.\r\nThe rattle then of Arjuna's vehicle rose loud in that battle, resembling,\r\nO sire, the tremendous peal of Vasu's thunder. Beholding Arjuna of white\r\nsteeds and having Krishna for his driver thus advance, and seeing the\r\nstandard of that high-souled one, the king of the Madras, addressing\r\nKarna, said, \"There cometh that car-warrior having white steeds yoked\r\nunto his vehicle and having Krishna for his driver, slaying his foes in\r\nbattle. There cometh he about whom thou wert enquiring, holding his bow\r\nGandiva. If thou canst slay him today, great good may then be done to us.\r\nHe cometh, O Karna, desirous of an encounter with thee, slaying, as he\r\ncometh, our chief warriors. Do thou proceed against that hero of\r\nBharata's race. Avoiding all our warriors, Dhananjaya advanceth with\r\ngreat speed, for, as I think, an encounter with thee, judging by his form\r\nswelling with rage and energy. Blazing with wrath, Partha will not stop\r\nfrom desire of battle with anybody else save thee, especially when\r\nVrikodara is being so much afflicted (by thee). Learning that king\r\nYudhishthira the just hath been exceedingly mangled and made carless by\r\nthee, and seeing (the plight of) Shikhandi, and Satyaki, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and\r\nYudhamanyu, and Uttamauja, and the brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, that\r\nscorcher of foes, Partha, advanceth impetuously on a single car against\r\nthee. Without doubt, he is advancing with speed against us, avoiding\r\nother combatants. Do thou, O Karna, proceed against him, for there is no\r\nother bowman (among us that can do so). I do not behold any arrangements\r\nmade for his protection, either on his flanks or at his rear. He\r\nadvanceth alone against thee. Look after thy success now. Thou alone art\r\nable to encounter the two Krishnas in battle. Proceed, therefore, against\r\nDhananjaya. Thou art the equal of Bhishma, of Drona, of Drona's son, of\r\nKripa. Do thou resist in this great battle the advancing Savyasaci.\r\nIndeed, O Karna, slay this Dhananjaya that resembles a snake frequently\r\ndarting out its tongue, or a roaring bull, or a tiger in the forest.\r\nThere, those kings, those mighty car-warriors of the Dhritarashtra's\r\narmy, through fear of Arjuna, are quickly flying away, regardless of one\r\nanother. Save thee, O Suta's son, there is no other man, O hero, that\r\ncan, in battle, dispel the fears of those retreating combatants. All\r\nthose Kurus, O tiger among men, obtaining thee as their refuge in this\r\nbattle, stand depending on thee and desirous of thy protection. Mustering\r\nthy great prowess, O mighty-armed one, proceed against Vrishni's race,\r\nwho is always gratified by the diadem-decked (Arjuna).\"\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"Thou seemest now to be in thy usual frame of mind and thou\r\nart now agreeable to me. Do not, O mighty-armed one, entertain any fear\r\nof Dhananjaya. Behold the might of my arms today, and behold my skill.\r\nSingle-handed, I will today destroy the mighty host of the Pandavas, as\r\nalso those two lions among men, the two Krishnas! I say this truly unto\r\nthee. I will never return from the field today without slaying two\r\nheroes. Or, slain by those two, I shall today sleep on the field of\r\nbattle. Victory is uncertain in battle. Slaying or slain, I shall today\r\nachieve my purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"All great car-warriors, O Karna, say that this foremost\r\nof car-warriors, (Arjuna), even when alone, is invincible. When again, he\r\nis protected by Krishna, who will venture to vanquish him?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said, \"As far as I have heard, such a superior car-warrior has\r\nnever been born on earth! Behold my prowess, since I will contend in\r\nbattle with even that Partha who is such. This prince of Kuru's line,\r\nthis foremost of car-warriors, careers in battle, borne by his steeds\r\nwhite in hue. Perhaps he will despatch me to Yama's abode today. Know,\r\nhowever, that with Karna's death, these all will be exterminated. The two\r\narms of this prince are never covered with sweat. They never tremble.\r\nThey are massive and covered with cicatrices. Firm in the use of weapons,\r\nhe is possessed of great skill and endued with great lightness of hands.\r\nIndeed, there is no warrior equal to the son of Pandu. He taketh a large\r\nnumber of arrows and shooteth them as if they were one. Quickly fixing\r\nthem on the bow-string, he propelleth them to the distance of two miles.\r\nThey always fall on the foe. What warriors is there on earth that is\r\nequal to him? That Atiratha, endued with great activity, with Krishna as\r\nhis ally, gratified the god Agni at Khandava. There, on that occasion,\r\nthe high-souled Krishna obtained his discus, and Savyasaci, the son of\r\nPandu, obtained his bow Gandiva. There that mighty-armed one, endued with\r\nmight that knows no decay, also obtained his terrible car unto which are\r\nyoked those white steeds, as also his two great celestial and\r\ninexhaustible quivers, and many celestial weapons, from the God of Fire.\r\nIn the region of Indra he obtained his conch Devadatta and slew\r\ninnumerable Daityas, and all the Kalakeyas. Who is there on earth that is\r\nsuperior to him? Possessed of greatness of soul, he gratified Mahadeva\r\nhimself in fair fight, and obtained from him the terrible and mighty\r\nweapon Pasupata that is capable of destroying the three worlds. The\r\nseveral Regents of the world, united together gave him their weapons of\r\nimmeasurable energy, with which that lion among men quickly destroyed in\r\nbattle those united Asuras, the Kalakhanjas. So also, in Virata's city,\r\nmoving on a single car he vanquished all of us, and snatched from us that\r\nwealth of kine, and took from all the foremost of car-warriors (portions\r\nof) their garments. Challenging that foremost of Kshatriyas, that hero\r\nhaving him of Vrishni's race for his ally, that warrior who is endued\r\nwith such energy and such attributes, I regard myself, O Shalya, to be\r\nthe foremost of persons in all the world in point of courage. He is,\r\nagain, protected by that Keshava of great energy, who is Narayana himself\r\nand who is without a rival, that high-souled Vasudeva, that\r\never-victorious Vishnu armed with conch, discus, and mace, whose\r\nattributes all the world united together, cannot (in narrating) exhaust\r\nin 10,000 years. Beholding the two Krishnas together on the same car,\r\nfear entereth my heart together with courage. Partha is the foremost of\r\nall bowmen, while Narayana is unrivalled in encounters with the discus.\r\nEven such are Vasudeva, and the son of Pandu. Indeed, the mountains of\r\nHimavat may move from the spot where they stand but not the two Krishnas.\r\nBoth of them are heroes, possessed of great skill, firm in the use of\r\nweapons, and mighty car-warriors. Both of them have adamantine frames.\r\nWho else, O Shalya, save myself, would proceed against Phalguna and\r\nVasudeva that are even such? The desire cherished by me today, viz., that\r\nof a battle with the son of Pandu, O ruler of the Madras, will be\r\nfulfilled without delay. Soon will that wonderful and matchless and\r\nbeautiful battle take place. Either I will overthrow those two in battle\r\ntoday, or the two Krishnas will today overthrow me.\" Saying these words\r\nunto Shalya, Karna, that slayer of foes, began to utter loud roars in\r\nthat battle, like those of the clouds. Approaching then thy son, that\r\nforemost one among the Kurus, and saluted respectfully by him, Karna said\r\nunto that prince as also unto those two mighty-armed warriors, Kripa and\r\nthe Bhoja chief Kritavarma, and the ruler of the Gandharvas with his son,\r\nand the preceptors and his own younger brothers, and all the\r\nfoot-soldiers and horsemen and elephant-riders, these words, \"Rush\r\ntowards Acyuta and Arjuna and close up their path all around, and cause\r\nthem to be tired with exertion, so that, ye lords of the earth, I may\r\neasily slay those two after ye all will have mangled them deeply.\"\r\nSaying, \"So be it!\" those foremost of heroes, desirous of slaying Arjuna,\r\nspeedily proceeded against him. Those mighty car-warriors then, obeying\r\nthe behest of Karna, began to strike Dhananjaya with innumerable arrows\r\nin that battle. Like the great ocean containing a vast quantity of water\r\nreceiving all rivers with their tributaries Arjuna received all those\r\nwarriors in battle. His foes could not notice when he fixed his excellent\r\narrows on the bow-string and when he let them off. All that could be seen\r\nwas that men and steeds and elephants, pierced with the arrows sped by\r\nDhananjaya, continually fell down, deprived of life. Like men with\r\ndiseased eyes that are unable to gaze at the sun, the Kauravas on that\r\noccasion could not gaze at Jaya who seemed to be possessed of the energy\r\nof the all-destroying Sun that rises at the end of the Yuga, having\r\narrows for his rays, and Gandiva for his beautiful circular disc. Smiling\r\nthe while, Partha with his own showers of arrows cut off the excellent\r\narrows sped at him by those mighty car-warriors. In return, he struck\r\nthem with innumerable arrows, drawing his bow Gandiva to a complete\r\ncircle. As the sun of fierce rays between the months of Jyaishtha and\r\nAshadha easily drieth up the waters (of the earth), even so Arjuna,\r\nbaffling the arrows of his foes, consumed thy troops, O king of kings!\r\nThen Kripa, and the chief of the Bhojas, and thy son himself shooting\r\nshowers of shafts, rushed towards him. Drona's son also, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, rushed towards him, shooting his shafts. Indeed, all of them\r\nrained their arrows on him, like the clouds pouring torrents of rain on a\r\nmountain. The son of Pandu, however, with great activity and speed, cut\r\noff with his own shafts those excellent arrows sped at him with great\r\ncare in that dreadful battle by those accomplished warriors desirous of\r\nslaying him, and pierced the chest of each of his adversaries with three\r\nshafts. Having arrows for his fierce rays, the Arjuna sun, with gandiva\r\ndrawn to its fullest stretch constituting his corona, looked resplendent,\r\nas he scorched his foes, like the Sun himself between the months of\r\nJyeshtha and Ashadha, within his bright corona. Then Drona's son pierced\r\nDhananjaya with ten foremost of shafts, and Keshava with three, and the\r\nfour steeds of Dhananjaya with four, and showered many shafts on the Ape\r\non Arjuna's banner. For all that, Dhananjaya cut off the full drawn bow\r\nin his adversary's hand with three shafts, the head of his driver with a\r\nrazor-faced arrow, and his four steeds with his four other shafts and his\r\nstandard with three other arrows and felled him from his car. The son of\r\nDrona then, filled with wrath, took up another costly bow, bright as the\r\nbody of Takshaka, and decked with gems and diamonds and gold, and\r\nresembling a mighty snake caught from the foot of a mountain. Stringing\r\nthat bow as he stood on the earth, and bringing out one after another\r\nshafts and weapons, Drona's son, that warrior who excelled in many\r\naccomplishments, began to afflict those two unvanquished and foremost of\r\nmen and pierce them from a near point with many shafts. Then those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, Kripa and Bhoja and thy son, standing at the van of battle,\r\nfell upon and shrouded that bull among the Pandavas, shooting showers of\r\nshafts, like clouds shrouding the dispeller of darkness. Possessed of\r\nprowess equal to that of the thousand-armed (Kartavirya), Partha then\r\nshowered his shafts on Kripa's bow with arrow fixed on it, his steeds,\r\nhis standard, and his driver, like the wielder of the thunder in days of\r\nyore showering his shafts on (the asura) Vali. His weapons destroyed by\r\nPartha's shafts, and his standard also having been crushed in that great\r\nbattle, Kripa was afflicted with as many thousands of arrows by Arjuna as\r\nGanga's son Bhishma before them (on the day of his fall) by the same\r\ndiademdecked warrior. The valiant Partha then, with his shafts, cut off\r\nthe standard and the bow of thy roaring son. Destroying next the handsome\r\nsteeds of Kritavarma, he cut off the latter's standard as well. He then\r\nbegan to destroy with great speed the elephants of the hostile force, as\r\nalso its cars with their steeds and drivers and bows and standards.\r\nThereupon that vast host of thine broke into a hundred parts like an\r\nembankment washed off by the waters. Then Keshava, quickly urging\r\nArjuna's car, placed all his afflicted foes on his right side. Then other\r\nwarriors, desirous of an encounter, with their well-equipped cars bearing\r\nlofty standards, followed Dhananjaya who was proceeding with great speed\r\nlike Indra proceeding for the slaughter of Vritra. Then those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, Shikhandi and Satyaki and the twins, proceeding in the\r\ndirection of Dhananjaya, checked those foes and, piercing them with keen\r\narrows, uttered terrible roars. Then the Kuru heroes and the Srinjayas,\r\nencountering one another with rage, slew one another with straight shafts\r\nof great energy, like the Asuras and the celestials in days of yore in\r\ngreat battle. Elephant-warriors and horsemen and car-warriors,--all\r\nchastisers of foes,--inspired with desire of victory or impatient of\r\nproceeding to heaven, fell fast on the field. Uttering loud shouts, they\r\npierced one another vigorously with well-shot arrows. In consequence of\r\nthose high-souled warriors of great courage shooting their arrows at one\r\nanother in that dreadful battle and by that means causing a darkness\r\nthere, the points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary became\r\nenveloped in gloom and the very effulgence of the sun became totally\r\nshrouded.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then, O king, Dhananjaya, desirous of rescuing Kunti's\r\nson Bhima who, assailed by many, foremost of warriors of the Kuru army,\r\nseemed to sink (under that attack), avoided, O Bharata, the troops of the\r\nSuta's son and began, with his shafts, to despatch those hostile heroes\r\n(that were opposed to Bhima) to the regions of death. Successive showers\r\nof Arjuna's shafts were seen overspread on the sky, while others were\r\nseen to slay thy army. Filling the welkin with his shafts that resembled\r\ndense flights of feathery creatures, Dhananjaya, O monarch, at that time,\r\nbecame the very Destroyer unto the Kurus. With his broad-headed arrows,\r\nand those equipped with heads flat and sharp as razors, and cloth-yard\r\nshafts of bright polish, Partha mangled the bodies of his foes and cut\r\noff their heads. The field of battle became strewn with falling warriors,\r\nsome with bodies cut and mangled, some divested of armour and some\r\ndeprived of heads. Like the great Vaitarani (separating the regions of\r\nlife from those of the dead), the field of battle, O king, became uneven\r\nand impassable and unsightly and terrible, in consequence of steeds and\r\ncars and elephants, which struck with Dhananjaya's shafts, were mangled\r\nand crushed and cut off in diverse ways. The earth was also covered with\r\nbroken shafts and wheels and axles, and with cars that were steedless or\r\nthat had their steeds and others that were driverless or that had their\r\ndrivers. Then four hundred well-trained and ever-furious elephants,\r\nexcited with wrath, and ridden by warriors cased in mail of golden hue\r\nand adorned with ornaments of gold, and urged by fierce guides with\r\npressure of heels and toes, fell down, struck by the diadem-decked Arjuna\r\nwith his shafts, like loosened summits, peopled with living creatures, of\r\ngigantic mountains. Indeed, the earth became covered with (other) huge\r\nelephants struck down by Dhananjaya with his arrows. Like the sun\r\npiercing through masses of clouds, Arjuna's car passed through dense\r\nbodies of elephants with juicy secretions flowing down their bodies and\r\nlooking like masses of clouds. Phalguna caused his track to be heaped up\r\nwith slain elephants and steeds, and with cars broken in diverse ways,\r\nand with lifeless heroes deprived of weapons and engines and of armour,\r\nas also with arms of diverse kinds loosened from hands that held them.\r\nThe twang of Gandiva became tremendously loud, like the peal of thunder\r\nin the welkin. The (Dhartarashtra) army then, smitten with the shafts of\r\nDhananjaya, broke, like a large vessel on the bosom of the ocean\r\nviolently lashed by the tempest. Diverse kinds of fatal shafts, sped from\r\nGandiva, and resembling burning brands and meteors and thunderbolts,\r\nburnt thy army. That mighty host, thus afflicted with Dhananjaya's\r\nshafts, looked beautiful like a blazing forest of bamboos on a mountain\r\nin the night. Crushed and burnt and thrown into confusion, and mangled\r\nand massacred by the diadem-decked Arjuna with his arrows, that host of\r\nthine then fled away on all sides. Indeed, the Kauravas, burnt by\r\nSavyasaci, dispersed on all sides, like animals in the great forest\r\nfrightened at a forest conflagration. The Kuru host then (that had\r\nassailed Bhimasena) abandoning that mighty-armed hero, turned their faces\r\nfrom battle, filled with anxiety. After the Kurus had been routed, the\r\nunvanquished Vibhatsu, approaching Bhimasena, stayed there for a moment.\r\nHaving met Bhima and held a consultation with him, Phalguna informed his\r\nbrother that the arrows had been extracted from Yudhishthira's body and\r\nthat the latter was perfectly well.\r\n\r\n\"'With Bhimasena's leave, Dhananjaya then proceeded (once more against\r\nhis foes), causing the earth and the welkin, O Bharata, to resound with\r\nthe rattle of his car. He was then surrounded by ten heroic and foremost\r\nof warriors, viz., thy sons, all of whom were Duhshasana's juniors in\r\nage. Afflicting Arjuna with their shafts like hunters afflicting an\r\nelephant with burning brands, those heroes, with outstretched bow, seemed\r\nto dance, O Bharata, (on their cars). The slayer of Madhu then, guiding\r\nhis, car placed all of them to his right. Indeed, he expected that Arjuna\r\nwould very soon send all of them to Yama's presence. Beholding Arjuna's\r\ncar proceeding in a different direction, those heroes rushed towards him.\r\nSoon, however, Partha, with a number of cloth-yard shafts and\r\ncrescent-shaped arrows, cut off their standards and steeds and bows and\r\narrows, causing them to fall down on the earth. Then with some\r\nbroad-headed arrows he cut off and felled their heads decked with lips\r\nbit and eyes blood-red in rage. Those faces looked beautiful like an\r\nassemblage of lotuses. Having slain those ten Kauravas cased in golden\r\nmail, with ten broad-headed shafts endued with great, impetuosity and\r\nequipped with wings of gold that slayer of foes, Arjuna continued to\r\nproceed.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile ninety Kaurava car-warriors rushed for battle\r\nagainst the ape-bannered Arjuna who was advancing, borne by his steeds of\r\nexceeding fleetness. Those tigers among men, having sworn a terrible oath\r\nabout the other world, encompassed that tiger among men, Arjuna. Krishna,\r\nhowever, (without minding those warriors), urged the white steeds of\r\nArjuna, endued with great speed and adorned with ornaments of gold and\r\ncovered with networks of pearls, towards Karna's car. Those ninety\r\nSamsaptaka cars pursued Dhananjaya, that slayer of foes, pouring upon him\r\nshowers of shafts, as he proceeded towards Karna's car. Then Arjuna, with\r\nhis keen shafts, cut off those ninety assailants endued with great\r\nactivity, along with their drivers and bows and standards. Slain by the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna with diverse kinds of shafts, they fell down like\r\nSiddhas falling down, with their cars, from heaven upon the exhaustion of\r\ntheir merits. After this, many Kauravas, with cars and elephants and\r\nsteeds, fearlessly advanced against that foremost one of Kuru's race,\r\nthat chief of the Bharatas, Phalguna. That large force of thy sons,\r\nteeming with struggling men and steeds, and swelling with foremost of\r\nelephants, then encompassed Dhananjaya, checking his further progress.\r\nThe mighty Kaurava bowmen shrouded that descendant of Kuru's race with\r\ndarts and swords and lances and spears and maces and scimitars and\r\narrows. Like the Sun destroying the darkness with his rays, the son of\r\nPandu destroyed with his own shafts that shower of weapons over-spread in\r\nthe welkin. Then a force of Mlecchas riding thirteen hundred\r\never-infuriated elephants, at the command of thy son, assailed Partha in\r\nthe flank. With barbed arrows and Nalikas and cloth-yard shafts and\r\nlances and spears and darts and Kampanas and short arrows, they afflicted\r\nPartha on his car. That matchless shower of weapons, some of which were\r\nhurled by the elephants with their tusks, Phalguna cut off with his\r\nbroad-headed shafts and crescent-shaped arrows of great keenness. With\r\nexcellent arrows of diverse kinds, he struck all those elephants and\r\ntheir standards and banners and riders, like Indra striking mountains\r\nwith thunderbolts. Afflicted with gold-winged shafts, those huge\r\nelephants decked with necklaces of gold fell down deprived of life, like\r\nmountains ablaze with volcanic fires. Amid that roaring and shouting and\r\nwailing army of men and elephants and steeds, the twang of Gandiva, O\r\nmonarch, rose high. Elephants, O king, struck (with shafts), fled away on\r\nall sides. Steeds also, their riders slain, wandered in all directions.\r\nCars, O monarch, looking like the changeful forms of vapour in the sky,\r\ndeprived of riders and steeds, were seen in thousands. Horsemen, O\r\nmonarch, wandering hither and thither, were seen to fall down deprived of\r\nlife by the shafts of Partha. At that time the might of Arjuna's arms was\r\nseen. (So great was that might) that alone, in that battle, he vanquished\r\nhorsemen and elephants and car-warriors (that had been assailing him from\r\nevery side). Then Bhimasena, beholding the diadem-decked Phalguna\r\nencompassed, O bull of Bharata's race, by a large (Kaurava) host\r\nconsisting of three kinds of forces, abandoned the small unslaughtered\r\nremnant of the Kaurava car-warriors with whom he had been engaged, and\r\nrushed impetuously, O king, to the spot where Dhananjaya's car was.\r\nMeanwhile the Kaurava force that still remained after heavy slaughter,\r\nexceedingly weakened, fled away, Bhima (as already said) beholding\r\nArjuna, proceeded towards his brother. The unfatigued Bhima, armed with a\r\nmace, destroyed, in that battle, the portion that still remained after\r\nthe greater part had been slaughtered by Arjuna, of the Kaurava host\r\npossessed of great might. Fierce as the death-night, subsisting upon men\r\nand elephants and steeds as its food, and capable of crushing walls and\r\nmansions and gates of cities, that exceedingly terrible mace of Bhima\r\nincessantly descended on men and elephants and steeds around him. That\r\nmace, O sire, slew numberless steeds and riders. With that mace the son\r\nof Pandu crushed men and steeds cased in steel armour. Struck therewith,\r\nthey fell down with great noise. Biting the earth with their teeth, and\r\nbathed in blood, these, with the crowns of their heads and bows and lower\r\nlimbs crushed, laid themselves down on the field, supplying all\r\ncarnivorous creatures with food. Satiated with blood and flesh and\r\nmarrow, and eating bones as well, that mace (of Bhimasena) became, like\r\nthe death-night, difficult of being gazed at. Having slain 10,000 horses\r\nand numerous foot-soldiers, Bhima ran hither and thither in rage, armed\r\nwith his mace. Then, O Bharata, thy troops, beholding Bhima mace in hand,\r\nthought that Yama himself, armed with his fatal bludgeon, was in their\r\nmidst. The son of Pandu then, excited with rage, and resembling an\r\ninfuriated elephant, penetrated into the elephant division (of the\r\nKauravas), like a Makara entering the ocean. Having, with his formidable\r\nmace, penetrated into that elephant division, the enraged Bhima, within a\r\nvery short time, despatched it to Yama's abode. We then beheld those\r\ninfuriated elephants with spiked plates on their bodies falling on every\r\nside, with their riders and standards, like winged mountains. Having\r\ndestroyed that elephant division, the mighty Bhimasena, once more riding\r\non his car, followed Arjuna at his rear. That great host, thus\r\nslaughtered, filled with cheerlessness and about to fly away, stood\r\nalmost inactive, O monarch, assailed on all sides with weapons. Beholding\r\nthat host looking humble and standing inactive and almost motionless,\r\nArjuna covered it with life-scorching shafts. Men and steeds and\r\nelephants, pierced in that battle with showers of shafts by the wielder\r\nof Gandiva, looked beautiful like Kadamva flowers with their filaments.\r\nThus struck with Arjuna's shafts that quickly slew men and steeds and\r\ncars and elephants, loud wails, O king, arose from the Kuru army. With\r\ncries of \"Oh\" and \"Alas,\" and exceedingly frightened, and huddling close\r\nto one another, thy army began to turn round with great speed. The\r\nbattle, however, continued between the Kurus and the Pandavas of great\r\nmight. There was not a single car-warrior or horseman or elephant-warrior\r\nor steed or elephant that was unwounded. Their coats of mail pierced with\r\nshafts and themselves bathed in blood, the troops looked blazing like a\r\nforest of flowering Asokas. Beholding Savyasaci putting forth his valour\r\non that occasion, the Kauravas became hopeless of Karna's life. Regarding\r\nthe touch of Arjuna's shafts to be unbearable, the Kauravas, vanquished\r\nby the wielder of Gandiva, fled from the field. Deserting Karna in that\r\nbattle as they were being thus struck with Arjuna's shafts, they fled\r\naway in fear on all sides, loudly calling upon the Suta's son (to rescue\r\nthem). Partha, however, pursued them, shooting hundreds of shafts and\r\ngladdening the Pandava warriors headed by Bhimasena. Thy sons then, O\r\nmonarch, proceeded towards the car of Karna. Sinking, as they seemed to\r\nbe, in a fathomless ocean, Karna then became an island unto them. The\r\nKauravas, O monarch, like snakes without poison, took Karna's shelter,\r\nmoved by the fear of the wielder of Gandiva. Indeed, even as creatures, O\r\nsire, endued with actions, from fear of death, take the shelter of\r\nvirtue, thy sons, O ruler of men, from fear of the high-souled son of\r\nPandu, took shelter with the mighty bowman Karna. Then, Karna, uninspired\r\nwith fear, addressed those distressed warriors afflicted with arrows and\r\nbathed in blood, saying, 'Do not fear! Come to me!\" Beholding thy army\r\nvigorously broken by Partha, Karna, stretching his bow, stood desirous of\r\nslaughtering the foe. Seeing that the Kurus had left the field, Karna,\r\nthat foremost of all wielders of weapons, reflecting a little, set his\r\nheart upon the slaughter of Partha and began to draw deep breaths.\r\nBending his formidable bow, Adhiratha's son Vrisha once more rushed\r\nagainst the Pancalas, in the very sight of Savyasaci. Soon, however, many\r\nlords of the earth, with eyes red as blood, poured their arrowy downpours\r\non him like clouds pouring rain upon a mountain. Then thousands of\r\narrows, O foremost of living creatures, shot by Karna, O sire, deprived\r\nmany Pancalas of their lives. Loud sounds of wailing were uttered by the\r\nPancalas, O thou of great intelligence, while they were being thus\r\nsmitten by the Suta's son, that rescuer of friends, for the sake of his\r\nfriends.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the Kurus, O king, had been put to flight by the\r\nmighty car-warrior Arjuna of white steeds, the Suta's son Karna began to\r\ndestroy the sons of the Pancalas with his mighty shafts, like the tempest\r\ndestroying congregated masses of clouds. Felling Janamejaya's driver with\r\nbroad-faced shafts called Anjalikas, he next slew the steeds of that\r\nPancala warrior. With a number of broad-headed arrows he then pierced\r\nboth Satanika and Sutasoma and then cut off the bows of both those\r\nheroes. Next he pierced Dhrishtadyumna with six arrows, and then, without\r\nthe loss of a moment, he slew in that encounter the steeds of that\r\nprince. Having slain next the steeds of Satyaki, the Suta's son then slew\r\nVisoka, the son of the ruler of the Kaikayas. Upon the slaughter of the\r\nKaikaya prince, the commander of the Kaikaya division, Ugrakarman, rushed\r\nwith speed and striking Prasena, the son of Karna, with many shafts of\r\nfierce impetuosity caused him to tremble. Then Karna, with three\r\ncrescent-shaped arrows, cut off the arms and the head of his son's\r\nassailant, whereupon the latter, deprived of life, fell down upon the\r\nground from his car, like a Sala tree with its branches lopped off with\r\nan axe. Then Prasena, with many keen arrows of straight course, covered\r\nthe steedless grandson of Sini, and seemed to dance upon his car. Soon,\r\nhowever, the son of Karna, struck by the grandson of Sini, fell down.\r\nUpon the slaughter of his son, Karna, with heart filled with rage,\r\naddressed that bull among the Sinis from desire of slaying him, saying,\r\n\"Thou art slain, O grandson of Sini!' and sped at him an arrow capable of\r\nslaying all foes. Then Shikhandi cut off that arrow with three shafts of\r\nhis, and struck Karna himself with three other shafts. The fierce son of\r\nthe Suta then, cutting off with a couple of razor-faced arrows the bow\r\nand the standard of Shikhandi, struck and pierced Shikhandi himself with\r\nsix shafts, and then cut off the head of Dhrishtadyumna's son. The\r\nhigh-souled son of Adhiratha then pierced Sutasoma with a very keen\r\nshaft. During the progress of that fierce battle, and after\r\nDhrishtadyumna's son had been slain, Krishna, O lion among kings,\r\naddressed Partha, saying, \"The Pancalas are being exterminated. Go, O\r\nPartha, and slay Karna.\" Thus addressed the mighty-armed Arjuna, that\r\nforemost of men, smiled and then proceeded on his car towards the car of\r\nAdhiratha's son desirous, on that occasion of terror, of rescuing the\r\nPancalas slaughtered by Karna, that leader of car-warriors. Stretching\r\nhis Gandiva of loud twang and fiercely striking his palms with her\r\nbow-string, he suddenly created a darkness by means of his arrows and\r\ndestroyed large numbers of men and steeds and cars and standards. The\r\nechoes (of that twang) travelled through the welkin. The birds, (no\r\nlonger finding room in their own element), took shelter in the caverns of\r\nmountains. With his full-drawn bow, Arjuna looked resplendent. Indeed, as\r\nthe diadem-decked Partha, at that terrible moment, fell upon the foe,\r\nBhimasena, that foremost of heroes, proceeded on his car behind that son\r\nof Pandu, protecting his rear. Those two princes then, on their cars,\r\nproceeded with great speed towards Karna, encountering their foes along\r\nthe way. During that interval, the Suta's son fought fiercely, grinding\r\nthe Somakas. He slew a large number of car-warriors and steeds and\r\nelephants, and covered the ten points of the compass with his shafts.\r\nThen Uttamauja and Janamejaya, and the enraged Yudhamanyu and Shikhandi,\r\nuniting with Prishata's son (Dhrishtadyumna) and uttering loud roars,\r\npierced Karna with many shafts. Those five foremost of Pancala\r\ncar-warriors rushed against Karna otherwise called Vaikartana, but they\r\ncould not shake him off his car like the objects of the senses failing to\r\nshake off the person of purified soul from abstinence. Quickly cutting\r\noff their bows, standards, steeds, drivers and banners, with his shafts,\r\nKarna struck each of them with five arrows and then uttered a loud roar\r\nlike a lion, People then became exceedingly cheerless, thinking that the\r\nvery earth, with her mountains and trees, might split at the twang of\r\nKarna's bow while that hero, with shafts in hand touching the bow-string,\r\nwas employed in shooting at his assailants and slaying his foes. Shooting\r\nhis shafts with that large and extended bow of his that resembled the bow\r\nof Sakra himself, the son of Adhiratha looked resplendent like the sun,\r\nwith his multitude of blazing rays, within his corona. The Suta's son\r\nthen pierced Shikhandi with a dozen keen shafts, and Uttamauja with half\r\na dozen, and Yudhamanyu with three, and then each of the other two, viz.,\r\nSomaka (Janamejaya) and Prishata's son (Dhrishtadyumna) with three\r\nshafts. Vanquished in dreadful battle by the Suta's son, O sire, those\r\nfive mighty car-warriors then stood inactive, gladdening their foes, even\r\nas the objects of the senses are vanquished by a person of purified soul.\r\nThe five sons of Draupadi then, with other well-equipped cars, rescued\r\nthose maternal uncles of theirs that were sinking in the Karna ocean,\r\nlike persons rescuing from the depths of the ocean ship-wrecked merchants\r\nin the sea by means of other vessels. Then that bull among the Sinis,\r\ncutting off with his own keen shafts the innumerable arrows sped by\r\nKarna, and piercing Karna himself with many keen arrows made entirely of\r\niron, pierced thy eldest son with eight shafts. Then Kripa, and the Bhoja\r\nchief (Kritavarma), and thy son, and Karna himself, assailed Satyaki in\r\nreturn with keen shafts. That foremost one, however, of Yadu's race\r\nfought with those four warriors like the chief of the Daityas fighting\r\nwith the Regents of the (four) quarters. With his twanging bow stretched\r\nto its fullest limits, and from which shafts flowed incessantly, Satyaki\r\nbecame exceedingly irresistible like the meridian Sun in the autumnal\r\nsky. Those scorchers of foes then, viz., the mighty car-warriors among\r\nthe Pancalas, once more riding on their cars and clad in mail and united\r\ntogether, protected that foremost one among the Sinis, like the Maruts\r\nprotecting Sakra while engaged in afflicting his foes in battle. The\r\nbattle fraught with the slaughter of men and steeds and elephants that\r\nthen ensued between thy foes and the warriors of thy army, became so\r\nfierce that it resembled the encounter in days of old between the gods\r\nand the Asuras. Car-warriors and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers,\r\ncovered with showers of diverse weapons, began to move from one point to\r\nanother. Struck by one another, they reeled or uttered wails of woe in\r\naffliction or fell down deprived of life. When such was the state of\r\naffairs, thy son Duhshasana, the younger brother of the king, fearlessly\r\nadvanced against Bhima, shooting showers of shafts. Vrikodara also rushed\r\nimpetuously against him, like a lion springing towards a large Ruru deer.\r\nThe encounter then that took place between those two heroes incensed with\r\neach other and who engaged in battle's sport making life itself the\r\nstake, became exceedingly fierce, resembled that between Samvara and\r\nSakra in days of old. They struck each other deeply with shafts possessed\r\nof great energy and capable of piercing each other's body, like two\r\nmighty elephants excited with lust and with juicy secretions incessantly\r\ntrickling down their bodies, fighting with each other in the vicinity of\r\na she-elephant in her season. Vrikodara, with great speed, cut off, with\r\na couple of razor-headed arrows, the bow and the standard of thy son.\r\nWith another winged arrow he pierced his antagonist's forehead and then\r\n(with a fourth) cut off from his trunk the head of the latter's driver.\r\nPrince Duhshasana, taking up another bow, pierced Vrikodara with a dozen\r\nshafts. Himself holding the reins of his steeds, he once more poured over\r\nBhima a shower of straight arrows. Then Duhshasana sped a shaft bright as\r\nthe rays of the sun, decked with gold, diamonds, and other precious gems,\r\ncapable of piercing the body of his assailant, and irresistible as the\r\nstroke of Indra's thunder. His body pierced therewith, Vrikodara fell,\r\nwith languid limbs and like one deprived of life and with outstretched\r\narms, upon his own excellent car. Recovering his senses, however, he\r\nbegan to roar like a lion.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Fighting fiercely, prince Duhshasana achieved the most\r\ndifficult feats in that encounter. With a single shaft he cut off Bhima's\r\nbow, and then with six shafts he pierced his foe's driver. Having\r\nachieved those feats, the prince, endued with great activity, pierced\r\nBhima himself with nine shafts. Indeed the high-souled warrior, without\r\nlosing a moment, then pierced Bhimasena with many shafts of great energy.\r\nFilled with rage at this, Bhimasena, endued with great activity, sped at\r\nthy son a fierce dart. Beholding that terrible dart impetuously coursing\r\ntowards him like a blazing brand, thy high-souled son cut it off with ten\r\nshafts shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. Seeing that\r\ndifficult feat achieved by him, all the warriors, filled with joy,\r\napplauded him highly. Thy son then once more pierced Bhima deeply with\r\nanother shaft. Blazing with wrath at sight of Duhshasana, Bhima then\r\naddressed him, saying, \"Pierced I have been, O hero, quickly and deeply,\r\nby thee. Bear now, however, once more, the stroke of my mace.\" Having\r\nsaid this, the enraged Bhima took up that terrible mace of his for\r\nDuhshasana's slaughter. Once more addressing him, he said, \"O thou of\r\nwicked soul, I shall today drink thy blood on the field of battle.\" Thus\r\naddressed, thy son sped at Bhima with great force a fierce dart\r\nresembling Death itself. Bhima also, his form filled with wrath, whirled\r\nhis terrible mace and hurled it at his antagonist. That mace,\r\nprecipitately breaking Duhshasana's dart, struck thy son on his head.\r\nIndeed, perspiring like an elephant with juicy secretions trickling down\r\nhis body, Bhima, in that dreadful battle, hurled his mace at the prince.\r\nWith that weapon, Bhimasena forcibly threw Duhshasana down from his car\r\nat a distance measured by the length of ten bows. Struck with the\r\nimpetuous mace, Duhshasana, thrown down on the ground, began to tremble.\r\nAll his steeds also, O king, were slain, and his car too was reduced to\r\natoms by that falling weapon. As regards Duhshasana himself, his armour\r\nand ornaments and attire and garlands were all displaced, and he began to\r\nwrithe, afflicted with agony. Endued with great activity, Bhimasena then\r\nrecollected, in the midst of that terrible battle and standing as he did\r\namid many foremost warriors of the Kuru army, all the acts of hostility\r\n(done towards the Pandavas) by thy sons. The mighty-armed Bhima of\r\ninconceivable feats, O king, beholding Duhshasana (in that plight), and\r\nrecollecting the seizure of Draupadi's tresses and her disrobing while\r\nshe was ill,--indeed, the innocent Bhima, reflecting also upon the\r\ndiverse other wrongs inflicted on that princess while her husbands sat\r\nwith faces turned away from the scene, blazed up in wrath like fire fed\r\nwith libations of clarified butter. Addressing Karna and Suyodhana and\r\nKripa and Drona's son and Kritavarma, he said, \"Today I shall slay the\r\nwretched Duhshasana. Let all the warriors protect him (if they can).\"\r\nHaving said this, Bhima of exceeding strength and great activity suddenly\r\nrushed, from desire of slaying Duhshasana. Like a lion of fierce\r\nimpetuosity rushing towards a mighty elephant, Vrikodara, that foremost\r\nof heroes, rushed towards Duhshasana in that battle and attacked him in\r\nthe very sight of Suyodhana and Karna. Jumping down from his car, he\r\nalighted on the ground, and fixed his eyes steadfastly on his fallen foe.\r\nDrawing then his whetted sword of keen edge, and trembling with rage, he\r\nplaced his foot upon the throat of Duhshasana, and ripping open the\r\nbreast of his enemy stretched on the ground, quaffed his warm life-blood.\r\nThen throwing him down and cutting off, O king, with that sword the head\r\nof thy son, Bhima of great intelligence, desirous of accomplishing his\r\nvow, again quaffed his enemy's blood little by little, as if for enjoying\r\nits taste. Then looking at him with wrathful eyes, he said these words,\r\n\"I regard the taste of this blood of my enemy to be superior to that of\r\nmy mother's milk, or honey, or clarified butter, or good wine that is\r\nprepared from honey, or excellent water, or milk, or curds, or skimmed\r\nmilk, or all other kinds of drinks there are on earth that are sweet as\r\nambrosia or nectar.\" Once more, Bhima of fierce deeds, his heart filled\r\nwith wrath, beholding Duhshasana dead, laughed softly and said, \"What\r\nmore can I do to thee? Death has rescued thee from my hands.\" They, O\r\nking, that saw Bhimasena, while he filled with joy at having quaffed the\r\nblood of his foe, was uttering those words and stalking on the field of\r\nbattle, fell down in fear. They that did not fall down at the sight, saw\r\ntheir weapons drop from their hands. Many, from fear, cried out feebly\r\nand looked at Bhima with half-shut eyes. Indeed, all those that stood\r\naround Bhima and beheld him drink the blood of Duhshasana, fled away,\r\noverwhelmed with fear, and saying unto one another, \"This one is no human\r\nbeing!\" When Bhima had assumed that form, people, beholding him quaff his\r\nenemy's blood, fled away with Citrasena, saying unto one another, 'This\r\nBhima must be a rakshasa!\" Then the (Pancala) prince Yudhamanyu, at the\r\nhead of his troops, fearlessly pursued the retreating Citrasena and\r\npierced him with seven keen shafts, quickly sped one after another. At\r\nthis, like a trampled snake of great energy repeatedly darting out its\r\ntongue and desirous of vomiting its poison, Citrasena turned back and\r\npierced the Pancala prince with three shafts and his driver with six. The\r\nbrave Yudhamanyu then struck off his enemy's head with a shaft equipped\r\nwith goodly wings and an exceedingly keen point and sped with great care\r\nfrom his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. Upon the fall of his brother\r\nCitrasena, Karna, filled with wrath and displaying his prowess, put the\r\nPandava host to flight, at which Nakula rushed against that warrior of\r\nimmeasurable energy. Bhima, having slain there (at the very sight of\r\nKarna) the vindictive Duhshasana, took up a little quantity of his blood,\r\nand, endued with stentorian lungs, he said these words in the hearing of\r\nall those foremost of heroes of the world, \"O wretch amongst men, here I\r\ndrink thy life-blood from thy throat. Filled with joy, abuse us once\r\nmore, saying 'beast, beast' (as thou didst before).\" And he continued,\r\n\"They that danced at us then, saying, 'beast, beast,' even we will dance\r\nat them now, repeating their own words. Our sleep at the palace at\r\nPramanakoti, the administration of deadly poison to our food, the bites\r\nof black cobras, the setting fire to the house of lac, the robbing of our\r\nkingdom by gambling, our exile in the woods, the cruel seizure of\r\nDraupadi's beautiful tresses, the strokes of shafts and weapons in\r\nbattle, our miseries at home, the other kinds of sufferings we endured at\r\nVirata's abode, all these woes borne by us through the counsels of\r\nShakuni and Duryodhana and Radha's son, proceeded from thee as their\r\ncause. Through the wickedness of Dhritarashtra and his son, we have\r\nendured all these woes. Happiness has never been ours.\" Having said these\r\nwords, O king, the victorious Vrikodara, once more spoke these words unto\r\nKeshava and Arjuna. Indeed, bathed in blood, with blood flowing from his\r\nwounds, with face exceedingly red, filled with great wrath, Bhimasena\r\nendued with great activity, said these words, \"Ye heroes, that which I\r\nhad vowed in respect of Duhshasana in battle, I have accomplished today.\r\nI will soon accomplish my other vow by slaying that second beast, viz.,\r\nDuryodhana, in this sacrifice of battle. Striking the head of that\r\nwicked-souled one with my foot in the presence of the Kauravas, I shall\r\nobtain peace.\" Having said these words, Bhima, filled with great joy,\r\ndrenched with blood, uttered loud shouts, even as the mighty and\r\nhigh-souled Indra of a 1,000 eyes had roared after slaying (the Asura)\r\nVritra.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the slaughter of Duhshasana, O king, ten of thy\r\nsons, heroes that never retreated from battle, all of whom were great\r\ncar-warriors, endued with mighty energy, and filled with the poison of\r\nwrath, shrouded Bhima with their shafts. Nishangin, and Kavachin, and\r\nPasin and Dundadhara and Dhanurgraha, and Alolupa, and Saha, and Shanda,\r\nand Vatavega and Suvarchasas, these ten, afflicted at the slaughter of\r\ntheir brother, united together and checked the mighty-armed Bhimasena\r\nwith their shafts. Resisted on all sides with their shafts by those great\r\ncar-warriors, Bhima, with eyes red as fire with fury, looked resplendent\r\nlike the Destroyer himself in rage. Partha, however, with ten\r\nbroad-headed shafts of great impetuosity, equipped with golden wings,\r\ndespatched to Yama's abode those ten Bharata princes decked with golden\r\nbracelets. Upon the fall of those ten heroes, thy army fled away in the\r\nvery sight of the Suta's son, overwhelmed with the fear of the Pandavas.\r\nThen, O king, great fear entered the heart of Karna at sight of Bhima's\r\nprowess which resembled that of the Destroyer himself unto living\r\ncreatures. Then Shalya, that ornament of assemblies, understanding the\r\nstate of Karna's mind from a survey of his features, addressed that\r\nchastiser of foes in words suited to the hour, \"Do not be grieved, O son\r\nof Radha! This deed does not become thee. Afflicted with the fear of\r\nBhimasena, these kings are all flying away. Exceedingly pained by the\r\ncalamity that has befallen his brother Duhshasana in consequence of his\r\nblood having been quaffed by the high-souled Bhima, Duryodhana is\r\nstupefied! Kripa and others, and those of the king's brothers that are\r\nstill alive, with afflicted hearts, their rage quelled by sorrow, are\r\ntending Duryodhana, sitting around him. Those heroes, the Pandavas of\r\nsure aim, headed by Dhananjaya, are advancing against thee for battle.\r\nFor these reasons, O tiger among men, mustering all thy prowess and\r\nkeeping the duties of a Kshatriya before thy eyes, proceed against\r\nDhananjaya. The entire burthen (of this battle) has been placed upon thee\r\nby the son of Dhritarashtra. O thou of mighty arms, bear that burthen to\r\nthe best of thy power and might. In victory there will be great fame. In\r\ndefeat, heaven is certain. There, O son of Radha, thy son, Vrishasena,\r\nfilled with wrath at sight of the stupefaction that has overwhelmed thee,\r\nis rushing towards the Pandavas.\" Hearing these words of Shalya of\r\nimmeasurable energy, Karna, reflecting, concluded unalterably that\r\nfighting had become unavoidable. Then Vrishasena, filled with wrath, and\r\nriding upon his own car, rushed towards that son of Pandu, viz.,\r\nVrikodara, who, armed with his mace, resembled the Destroyer himself with\r\nhis fatal rod and was employed in slaughtering thy troops. That foremost\r\nof heroes, Nakula, filled with wrath, rushed at that enemy of theirs,\r\nKarna's son, striking him with arrows, like the victorious Maghavat with\r\njoyous heart rushing against (the Asura) Jambha. Then the brave Nakula,\r\nwith a razor-headed shaft, cut off his enemy's standard decked with gems.\r\nWith a broad-headed arrow, he next cut off the bow also of Karna's son,\r\nwith a golden belt attached to it. Possessed of mighty weapons, Karna's\r\nson then, desirous of showing his regard for Duhshasana, quickly took up\r\nanother bow, and pierced Nakula, the son of Pandu with many mighty\r\ncelestial weapons. The high-souled Nakula, then, filled with rage,\r\npierced his antagonist with shafts that resembled large blazing brands.\r\nAt this Karna's son also, accomplished in weapons, showered celestial\r\nweapon upon Nakula. From rage engendered by the strokes of his enemy's\r\nweapon, as also from his own resplendence and the energy of his weapons,\r\nthe son of Karna blazed up like a fire with libations of clarified\r\nbutter. Indeed, O king, Karna's son then slew with his excellent weapons\r\nthe beautiful steeds of the delicate Nakula, that were of the Vanayu\r\nbreed, white in hue, and decked with trappings of gold. Alighting then\r\nfrom his steedless vehicle, and taking up a bright shield decked with\r\ngolden moons, and armed also with a sword that was blue as the sky,\r\nNakula, frequently jumping up, careered there like a bird. Performing\r\ndiverse beautiful evolutions in the air, the son of Pandu cut off many\r\nforemost of men and steeds and elephants. Cut off with that sword, they\r\nfell down on the earth like animals cut off in a horse-sacrifice by the\r\nperson appointed to that duty. 2,000 well-trained heroes, delighting in\r\nbattle, hailing from diverse realms, well-paid, of sure aim, and their\r\nlimbs smeared with excellent sandal-paste, were quickly cut off by the\r\nsingle-handed Nakula inspired with desire of victory. Then Karna's son,\r\nsuddenly advancing with great speed against the rushing Nakula in that\r\nbattle pierced him from every side with many keen arrows from desire of\r\nslaying him. Thus struck with shafts (by Vrishasena), Nakula struck his\r\nbrave antagonist in return. Pierced by the son of Pandu, Vrishasena\r\nbecame filled with wrath. Protected, however, in that dreadful battle, by\r\nhis brother Bhima, the high-souled Nakula achieved such terrible feats on\r\nthat occasion. Filled with rage, the son of Karna then pierced with\r\neighteen shafts the heroic Nakula who seemed to sport in that battle,\r\nwhile employed, unaided, in destroying the foremost of men and steeds and\r\nelephants. Deeply pierced by Vrishasena in that battle, O king, Pandu's\r\nson Nakula, that foremost of men, endued with great activity, became\r\nfilled with rage and rushed in that encounter against the son of Karna\r\nfrom desire of slaying him. Then Vrishasena poured showers of keen shafts\r\nupon Nakula of great energy as the latter precipitately advanced against\r\nhim in that battle like a hawk with outstretched wings from desire of\r\nmeat. Baffling, however, his antagonist's showers of shafts, Nakula\r\ncareered in diverse beautiful motions. Then Karna's son, O king, in that\r\ndreadful battle, cut off, with his mighty shafts, the shield, decked with\r\na 1,000 stars, of Nakula, while he was careering with great activity in\r\nthose beautiful motions. Without losing a moment, that resister of foes,\r\n(Vrishasena), with half a dozen sharp razor-headed shafts, then cut off\r\nthat naked sword of Nakula, polished and keen-edged, made of steel,\r\ncapable of bearing a great strain and of destroying the bodies of all\r\nfoes, and terrible and fierce as the poison of the snake, while he was\r\nwhirling it rapidly. After this, Vrishasena deeply pierced his antagonist\r\nin the centre of his chest with some well-tempered and keen shafts.\r\nHaving achieved those feats in battle that were applauded by all noble\r\npersons and that could not be achieved by other men, the high-souled\r\nNakula of great activity, afflicted with those shafts, proceeded to the\r\ncar, O king, of Bhimasena. The steedless son of Madri, thus afflicted by\r\nKarna's son, sprang upon Bhima's car like a lion springing upon a\r\nmountain summit, in the sight of Dhananjaya. The high-souled and heroic\r\nVrishasena then, filled with wrath, poured his arrowy showers upon those\r\ntwo mighty car-warriors for piercing those two sons of Pandu. After the\r\ndestruction of that car belonging to the son of Pandu (Nakula), and after\r\nhis sword also had been speedily cut off with (Vrishasena's) shafts; many\r\nother foremost of Kuru heroes, uniting together, approached the Pandava\r\nbrothers, and began to strike them with showers of shafts. Then those two\r\nsons of Pandu, Bhima and Arjuna, filled with wrath, and resembling two\r\nfires fed with libations of clarified butter, poured terrible showers of\r\narrows upon Vrishasena and the other assembled warriors around him. The\r\nson of the Wind-god then, addressing Phalguna, said, \"Behold, Nakula here\r\nis being afflicted. The son of Karna is resisting us. Proceed, therefore,\r\nagainst Karna's son.\" Hearing these words, the diadem-decked (Arjuna)\r\napproached the car of his brother Vrikodara. Beholding that hero arrived\r\nnear, Nakula addressed him, saying, \"Do thou speedily slay this one.\"\r\nThus addressed in that battle by his brother, Nakula, standing before\r\nhim, the diadem-decked Arjuna, that formidable hero, precipitately caused\r\nhis ape-bannered vehicle, guided by Keshava himself, to be driven towards\r\nVrishasena.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n85\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Learning that Nakula had been deprived of his car,\r\nafflicted with arrows and mangled with the weapons of Karna's son, and\r\nthat he had his shafts, bow, and sword cut off, these eleven formidable\r\nresisters of all foes, the five heroic sons of Drupada, the grandson of\r\nSini forming the sixth, and the five sons of Draupadi quickly proceeded\r\non their loud-sounding cars drawn by bounding steeds, with banners waving\r\nin the air, and guided by accomplished drivers. Those well-armed warriors\r\nbegan to destroy thy elephants and cars and men and steeds with shafts\r\nthat resembled formidable snakes. Then Hridika's son and Kripa and\r\nDrona's son and Duryodhana and Shakuni's son and Vrika and Kratha and\r\nDevavridha, those foremost of Kaurava car-warriors, speedily proceeded\r\nagainst them, armed with their bows and mounted upon their cars of rattle\r\ndeep as the roar of elephants or the clouds. These Kaurava warriors,\r\nassailing those foremost of men and first of car-warriors, those eleven\r\nheroes (of the Pandava army), O king, with the mightiest of shafts,\r\nchecked their progress. At this, the Kulindas, riding upon their\r\nelephants of impetuous speed that looked like mountain summits and that\r\nwere of the hue of newly-risen clouds, advanced against those Kaurava\r\nheroes. Well-equipped, and covered with gold, those infuriated elephants,\r\nborn in Himalayan regions and ridden by accomplished warriors longing for\r\nbattle, looked resplendent like clouds in the welkin, charged with\r\nlightning. The prince of the Kulindas then vigorously assailed Kripa and\r\nhis driver and steeds, with ten shafts made wholly of iron. Struck (in\r\nreturn) with the shafts of Sharadvata's son, the prince fell down with\r\nhis elephant on the ground. The younger brother of that prince then,\r\nassailing Kripa's car with a number of lances made wholly of iron and all\r\nbright as the rays of the sun, uttered loud roars. The ruler of the\r\nGandharvas, however, cut off the head of that warrior while still\r\nuttering those roars. Upon the fall of those Kulindas, those mighty\r\ncar-warriors of thy army, filled with joy, blew their sea-born conchs,\r\nand, armed with bows, rushed against their enemies. The battle then that\r\nonce more took place between the Kurus on the one side and the Pandavas\r\nand the Srinjayas on the other, with arrows and scimitars and darts and\r\nswords and maces and battle-axes, became fierce and awful and exceedingly\r\ndestructive of men and steeds and elephants. Car-warriors and steeds and\r\nelephants and foot-soldiers, striking one another, fell down on the\r\nground, making the field of battle look like the welkin when congregated\r\nmasses of clouds charged with lightning and producing incessant peals of\r\nthunder are assailed by fierce winds from all sides. Then the chief of\r\nthe Bhojas struck the huge elephants, the car-warriors, the innumerable\r\nfoot-soldiers, and the horse under Satanika. Struck with Kritavarma's\r\nshafts, these soon fell down on the ground. About this time, struck with\r\nAshvatthama's shafts, three huge elephants equipped with all kinds of\r\nweapons, ridden by accomplished warriors, and adorned with lofty\r\nstandards, fell down lifeless on the ground like gigantic cliffs riven by\r\nthunder. Then the third brother of the Kulinda chief assailed thy son\r\nDuryodhana with some excellent shafts in the centre of the chest. Thy\r\nson, however, pierced him as also his elephant with many whetted shafts.\r\nThat prince of elephants then, with the prince on his back, fell down,\r\nwith streams of blood issuing from every part of his body, like a\r\nmountain of red chalk in the season of rains, with red streams running\r\ndown its breast, tumbling down when riven by the thunder of Sachi's lord.\r\nThe Kulinda prince, however, having saved himself in time, rode another\r\nelephant. Urged by the prince, that animal assailed Kratha with his\r\ndriver and steeds and car. Pierced, however, with Kratha's shafts, that\r\nelephant, with its rider, fell down like a thunder-riven hill. The ruler\r\nof the Krathas, that invincible car-warrior, however, struck with shafts\r\nby the prince born on the mountains from the back of another elephant,\r\nfell down with his steeds, driver, bow, and standard, like a mighty tree\r\nuprooted by the tempest. Then Vrika deeply pierced with a dozen shafts\r\nthat prince having his abode on the Himavat as he stood on his elephant.\r\nThe huge beast quickly crushed with his four legs (the Kaurava warrior)\r\nVrika with his steeds and car. That prince of elephants then, with its\r\nrider, deeply pierced by the son of Vabhru, advanced impetuously against\r\nthe latter. Vabhru's son, however, that prince of the Magadhas, afflicted\r\nwith arrows by Sahadeva's son, fell down. The prince of the Kulindas\r\nthen, with that elephant of his which was capable of slaying the foremost\r\nof warriors with its tusks and body, rushed impetuously towards Shakuni\r\nfor slaying him. The mountaineer succeeded in afflicting Shakuni greatly.\r\nSoon, however, the chief of the Gandharas cut off his head. About this\r\ntime huge elephants and steeds and car-warriors and large bands of foot,\r\nstruck by Satanika, fell down on the earth, paralysed and crushed like\r\nsnakes beaten by the tempest caused by Garuda's wings. Then a Kulinda\r\nwarrior (on the Kaurava side), smiling the while, pierced Satanika, the\r\nson of Nakula, with many whetted arrows. Nakula's son, however, with a\r\nrazor-headed arrow, cut off from his antagonist's trunk his head\r\nresembling a lotus. Then Karna's son pierced Satanika with three arrows,\r\nmade wholly of iron and Arjuna also with as many. And he pierced Bhima\r\nwith three arrows and Nakula with seven and Janardana with a dozen.\r\nBeholding that feat of Vrishasena, that achiever of superhuman feats, the\r\nKauravas became filled with joy and applauded him greatly. They, however,\r\nthat were conversant with Dhananjaya's prowess, regarded Vrishasena as a\r\nlibation already poured on the fire. The diadem-decked Arjuna then, that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, seeing Madri's son Nakula, that foremost of\r\nmen, deprived of his steeds in the midst of all, and beholding Janardana\r\nmangled with arrows, rushed in that battle against Vrishasena who was\r\nthen staying in front of the Suta's son (Karna). Like Namuci rushing\r\nagainst Indra, Karna's son, that great car-warrior, also rushed, in that\r\nbattle, against that fierce and foremost of men, Arjuna, that warrior\r\npossessing thousands of arrows, as the latter advanced towards him.\r\nUnsupported by any one, the high-souled son of Karna, quickly piercing\r\nPartha with a shaft in that battle, uttered a loud shout, like Namuci in\r\ndays of old after having pierced Indra. Once more Vrishasena pierced\r\nPartha in the left arm-pit with many formidable shafts. Piercing Krishna\r\nnext with nine arrows, he struck Partha again with ten shafts. The\r\nwhite-steeded Arjuna, having before been pierced by Vrishasena with those\r\nformidable arrows, became slightly enraged and set his heart on the\r\nslaughter of Karna's son. The high-souled and diadem-decked Arjuna then,\r\nhis brow furrowed from wrath with three lines, quickly sped from the van\r\nof battle a number of shafts for the destruction of Vrishasena in that\r\nencounter. With eyes red in wrath, that hero capable of slaying Yama\r\nhimself if the latter fought with him, then laughed terribly and said\r\nunto Karna and all the other Kaurava heroes headed by Duryodhana and\r\nDrona's son, these words, \"Today, O Karna, in thy very sight in this\r\nbattle, I will despatch the fierce Vrishasena unto Yama's abode with my\r\nkeen arrows! People say that all of you, united together, slew my son,\r\nendued with great activity, in my absence, and while he was alone and\r\nunsupported on his car. I, however, will slay thy son in the very sight\r\nof you all. Let all the Kaurava car-warriors protect him. I will slay the\r\nfierce Vrishasena. After that, I will slay thee, O fool, even I, Arjuna,\r\nin the midst of battle! Today I will, in battle, slay thee that art the\r\nroot of this quarrel and that hast become so proud in consequence of\r\nDuryodhana's patronage. Putting forth my strength, I will certainly slay\r\nthee in this battle, and Bhimasena will slay this Duryodhana, this wretch\r\namong men, through whose evil policy this quarrel born of dice hath\r\narisen.\" Having said these words, Arjuna rubbed the string of his bow and\r\ntook aim at Vrishasena in that battle, and sped, O king, a number of\r\nshafts for the slaughter of Karna's son. The diadem-decked Arjuna then,\r\nfearlessly and with great force, pierced Vrishasena with ten shafts in\r\nall his vital limbs. With four fierce razor-headed arrows he cut off\r\nVrishasena's bow and two arms and head. Struck with Partha's shafts, the\r\nson of Karna, deprived of arms and head, fell down on the earth from his\r\ncar, like a gigantic shala adorned with flowers falling down from a\r\nmountain summit. Beholding his son, thus struck with arrows, fall down\r\nfrom his vehicle, the Suta's son Karna, endued with great activity and\r\nscorched with grief on account of the death of his son, quickly proceeded\r\non his car, inspired with wrath, against the car of the diadem-decked\r\nPartha.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, beholding his son slain in his sight by the white-steeded Arjuna\r\nin battle, the high-souled Karna, filled with great wrath, rushed against\r\nKrishna and Arjuna.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the gigantic and roaring Karna, incapable of\r\nbeing resisted by the very gods, advancing like the surging sea, that\r\nbull amongst men, viz., he of Dasharha's race, addressed Arjuna, saying,\r\n\"That car-warrior having white steeds and owning Shalya for his driver\r\ncometh hither with whom thou art to contend in battle. Therefore, O\r\nDhananjaya, summon all thy coolness. Behold then, O son of Pandu, the\r\nwell-equipped car of Karna. White steeds are yoked unto it and Radha's\r\nson himself is the warrior that stands upon it. Teeming with banners and\r\ndecked with rows of bells, it looks like a celestial car borne along the\r\nwelkin by steeds white in hue. Behold also the standard of the\r\nhigh-souled Karna, bearing the device of the elephant's rope, and looking\r\nlike the bow of Indra himself that divides the firmament by a clear line.\r\nBehold Karna as he advanceth from desire of doing what is agreeable to\r\nDhritarashtra's son, shooting showers of shafts like the clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain. There the royal chief of the Madras, stationed on the\r\nfore-part of the car, guideth the steeds of Radha's son of immeasurable\r\nenergy. Hear the peal of their drums and the fierce blare of their\r\nconchs. Hear, O son of Pandu, the diverse leonine roars coming from every\r\nside. Hear the terrible twang, silencing all other loud sounds, of the\r\nbow (Vijaya) stretched by Karna of immeasurable energy. There the mighty\r\ncar-warriors among the Pancalas, with their followers, are breaking like\r\na herd of deer in the great forest at the sight of an angry lion. It\r\nbehoveth thee, O son of Kunti, to slay the Suta's son with every care. No\r\nother person save thee can venture to bear the shafts of Karna. It is\r\nwell known to me that thou art competent to vanquish in battle the three\r\nworlds with all their mobile and immobile creatures including the very\r\ngods and the Gandharvas. What need be said about battling with that\r\npuissant one, when people are incapable of even gazing at him, viz., the\r\nfierce and terrible Isana, that great god, the three-eyed Sarva,\r\notherwise called Kapardin? Thou, however, hadst, by battle, gratified\r\nthat god of gods himself, that Siva who is the source of bliss unto all\r\ncreatures, that deity called Sthanu. The other deities also have all\r\ngiven thee boons. Through the grace, O Partha, of that god of gods, that\r\ndeity armed with a trident, slay Karna, O mighty-armed one, like Indra\r\nslaying the Asura Namuci. Let prosperity be ever with thee, O Partha, and\r\ndo thou obtain victory in battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Arjuna said, \"My victory, O Krishna, is, certain. There is no doubt in\r\nthis, since thou, O slayer of Madhu, that art the master of all the\r\nworlds, art pleased with me. Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesha, and my car,\r\nO great car-warrior! Today Phalguna will not return from battle without\r\nslaying Karna. Behold Karna slain today and cut in pieces with my shafts.\r\nOr, O Govinda, thou wilt today behold me slain with (Karna's) arrows.\r\nThat terrible battle, capable of stupefying the three words, is at hand.\r\nAs long as the earth will last, people will speak of it.\" Saying these\r\nwords unto Krishna who is never tired with exertion, Partha quickly\r\nproceeded on his car against Karna like an elephant against a rival\r\nelephant. Once more Partha of great energy said unto Krishna, that\r\nchastiser of foes, these words, \"Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesha, for time\r\npasseth.\" Thus addressed by the high-souled son of Pandu, Keshava wished\r\nhim victory and urged steeds as fleet as thought. Then that car of\r\nPandu's son, possessed of great speed, soon reached the front of Karna's\r\ncar.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n87\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Vrishasena slain, Karna, filled with grief and\r\nrage, shed tears from his eyes for the death of his son. Endued with\r\ngreat energy, with eyes red as copper from rage, Karna proceeded in the\r\nface of his foe, having summoned Dhananjaya to battle. Then those two\r\ncars, both possessed of solar effulgence and covered with tiger-skins,\r\nwhen they came together, looked like two suns close to each other. Both\r\nhaving white steeds and both crushers of foes, those two great bowmen,\r\nthose two warriors possessed of solar effulgence, looked resplendent like\r\nthe sun and the moon in the firmament. Beholding those two warriors that\r\nresembled Indra and Virochana's son (Vali) carefully preparing for battle\r\nfor the conquest of the three worlds, all creatures were filled with\r\nwonder. Seeing those two warriors rushing towards each other with the\r\nclatter of car-wheels the twang of bows, the sound of palms, the whizz of\r\narrows, and leonine shouts, and seeing also their standards, viz., that\r\nof Karna bearing the elephant's rope and that of Partha bearing the ape,\r\napproach each other, all the lords of the earth became filled with\r\nwonder. Seeing those two car-warriors engaged with each other, O Bharata,\r\nall the kings uttered leonine shouts and cheered them repeatedly with\r\napplause. Beholding that single combat between Partha and Karna,\r\nthousands of combatants there slapped their armpits and waved their\r\ngarments on the air. The Kauravas beat their musical instruments and blew\r\ntheir numerous conchs for gladdening Karna. Similarly, all the Pandavas,\r\nfor gladdening Dhananjaya, caused every point of the compass to resound\r\nwith the blasts of their trumpets and conchs. With those leonine shouts\r\nand slaps on armpits and other loud cries and roars of brave warriors,\r\ntremendous became the noise there on the occasion of that encounter\r\nbetween Karna and Arjuna. People beheld those two tigers among men, those\r\ntwo foremost of car-warriors, stationed on their cars, each armed with\r\nhis formidable bow, each equipped with arrows and darts, and each owning\r\na lofty standard. Both were clad in mail, both had scimitars tied to\r\ntheir belts, both had white steeds, and both were adorned with excellent\r\nconchs. One had Krishna for driver on his car, and the other had Shalya.\r\nBoth of them were great car-warriors and both looked alike. Both\r\npossessed of leonine necks and long arms, the eyes of both were red, and\r\nboth were adorned with garlands of gold. Both were armed with bows that\r\nseemed to flash like lightning, and both were adorned with wealth of\r\nweapons. Both had yak-tails for being fanned therewith, and both were\r\ndecked with white umbrellas held over them. Both had excellent quivers\r\nand both looked exceedingly handsome. The limbs of both were smeared with\r\nred sandal-paste and both looked like infuriated bulls. Both were\r\nbroad-necked like the lion, both were broad-chested, and both endued with\r\ngreat strength. Challenging each other, O king, each desired to slay the\r\nother. And they rushed against each other like two mighty bulls in a\r\ncow-pen. They were like a couple of infuriated elephants or of angry\r\nmountains or of infant snakes of virulent poison or of all-destroying\r\nYamas. Enraged with each other like Indra and Vritra, they looked like\r\nthe sun and the moon in splendour. Filled with wrath, they resembled two\r\nmighty planets risen for the destruction of the world at the end of the\r\nYuga. Both of them born of celestial fathers, and both resembling gods in\r\nbeauty, they were of godlike energy. Indeed, they looked like the sun and\r\nthe moon come of their own accord on the field of battle. Both of them\r\nendued with great might, both filled with pride in battle, they were\r\narmed with diverse weapons. Beholding those two tigers among men, those\r\ntwo heroes endued with the impetuosity of tigers, thy troops, O monarch,\r\nwere filled with great joy. Seeing those two tigers amongst men, viz.,\r\nKarna and Dhananjaya, engaged in battle, a doubt entered the hearts of\r\nall as to which of them would be victorious. Both armed with superior\r\nweapons, and both well-practised in battle, both made the welkin resound\r\nwith the slaps on their armpits. Both possessed of great celebrity in\r\nconsequence of prowess and might, they resembled the Asura Samvara and\r\nthe chief of the celestials in respect of their skill in battle. Both\r\nequal to Kartavirya or Dasaratha's son in battle, both resembled Vishnu\r\nhimself in energy or Bhava himself in fight. Both had white steeds, O\r\nking, and both were borne on foremost of cars. Both of them, again, had\r\nforemost of drivers in that great battle. Beholding, O monarch, those two\r\ngreat car-warriors looking resplendent on their cars, the bands of\r\nSiddhas and Charanas that came there became filled with wonder. The\r\nDhartarashtras then, O bull of Bharata's race, with their troops,\r\nencompassed the high-souled Karna, that ornament of battle, without\r\nlosing any time. Similarly the Pandavas headed by Dhrishtadyumna, filled\r\nwith joy, encompassed that high-souled Partha who was unrivalled in\r\nbattle. Karna became the stake, O monarch, of thy army in that battle,\r\nwhile Partha became the stake of the Pandavas. The soldiers of both sides\r\nwere as members of that assembly and became the spectators of that game.\r\nIndeed, as regards the parties engaged in that game of battle, either\r\nvictory or defeat was certain. Those two then, Karna and Arjuna, for\r\nvictory or the reverse, began the match between ourselves and the\r\nPandavas both standing on the field of battle. Skilled in fight, the two\r\nheroes, O monarch, in that encounter, became highly enraged with each\r\nother and wished to slay each other. Desiring to take each other's life,\r\nlike Indra and Vritra, O lord, they faced each other like two mighty\r\ncomets of terrible form. Then in the sky, differences and disputes,\r\naccompanied with revilings, arose among the creatures there, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, on the subject of Karna and Arjuna. All the inhabitants\r\nof the world, O sire, were heard to differ amongst themselves. The gods,\r\nthe Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Pishacas, the Snakes, the Rakshasas,\r\nadopted opposite sides in that encounter between Karna and Arjuna. The\r\nwelkin, O monarch, with all the stars, became anxious on Karna's account,\r\nwhile the wide earth became so on Partha's account, like the mother for\r\nher son. The rivers, the seas, the mountains, O best of men, the trees,\r\nthe deciduous plants and herbs, took the side of the diadem-decked\r\nArjuna. The Asuras, Yatudhanas, the Guhyakas, O scorcher of foes, and\r\nravens and other rangers of the sky, sided with Karna. All the gems and\r\nprecious jewels, the four Vedas with the histories as the fifth, the\r\nUpavedas, the Upanishads, with all their mysteries, and the compilations,\r\nand Vasuki, and Citrasena, and Takshaka, and Upatakshaka, and all the\r\nmountains, and all the offspring of Kadru with their children, all the\r\ngreat snakes endued with poison, and the Nagas, took the side of Arjuna.\r\nAiravata and his children, the offspring of Surabhi, the offspring of\r\nVaisali, and the Bhogins sided with Arjuna. The smaller snakes all sided\r\nwith Karna. Wolves and wild stags and all kinds of auspicious animals and\r\nbirds were, O king, for victory to Partha. The Vasus, the Maruts, the\r\nSadhyas, the Rudras, the Vishvedevas and the Ashvinis, and Agni and Indra\r\nand Soma and Pavana, and the ten points of the compass, became the\r\npartisans of Dhananjaya, while all the Adityas sided with Karna. The\r\nvaishyas, the shudras, the Sutas, and those castes that were of a mixed\r\norigin, all, O king, adopted the side of Radha's son. The celestials,\r\nhowever, with the pitris, and with all that were numbered with them as\r\nalso with their followers, and Yama and Vaishravana and Varuna were on\r\nthe side of Arjuna. The brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the sacrifices, and\r\nthose gifts called dakshinas, were for Arjuna. The pretas, and pishacas,\r\nmany carnivorous animals and birds, the rakshasas with all the monsters\r\nof the sea, the dogs, and the jackals were for Karna. The diverse tribes\r\nof celestial and regenerate and royal rishis were for the son of Pandu.\r\nThe gandharvas headed by Tumvuru, O king, were on the side of Arjuna.\r\nWith the offspring of Pradha and Mauni, the several classes of gandharvas\r\nand apsaras, and many wise sages, having for their vehicles wolves and\r\nstags and elephants and steeds and cars and foot, and clouds and the\r\nwind, came there for witnessing the encounter between Karna and Arjuna.\r\nThe gods, the danavas, the gandharvas, the nagas, the yakshas, the birds,\r\nthe great rishis versed in the Vedas, the pitris that subsist upon the\r\ngifts called svadha, and asceticism and the sciences, and the (celestial)\r\nherbs with diverse virtues, came, O monarch, and took up their stations\r\nin the welkin, making a great noise. Brahman, with the regenerate rishis\r\nand the Lords of creatures, and Bhava himself on his car, came to that\r\npart of the welkin. Beholding those two high-souled ones, Karna and\r\nDhananjaya, about to encounter each other, Shakra himself said, \"Let\r\nArjuna vanquish Karna.\" Surya, however, said, \"Let Karna vanquish Arjuna.\r\nIndeed, let my son Karna, slaying Arjuna, gain the victory in this\r\nbattle. Let my son, slaying Karna, win victory.\" Even thus did Surya and\r\nVasava, those two foremost of personages, who were there and had adopted\r\nopposite sides, dispute with each other. Beholding those two high-souled\r\nones, Karna and Dhananjaya, about to engage themselves in battle, the\r\ngods and the asuras adopted opposite sides. The three worlds with the\r\ncelestial rishis and all the gods and all other creatures, trembled at\r\nthe sight. The gods were on the side of Partha, while the asuras were on\r\nthat of Karna. Thus all creatures were interested in that encounter,\r\nsiding with this or that leader of car-warriors, the Kuru or the Pandava\r\nhero. Beholding the Self-born Lord of Creation (viz., Brahman), the gods\r\nurged him, saying, \"Let, O god, the success of these two lions among men\r\nbe equal. Let not the vast universe be destroyed in consequence of this\r\nencounter between Karna and Arjuna. O Selfborn one, say but the word, let\r\nthe success of these two be equal.\" Hearing these words, Maghavat, bowing\r\ndown unto the Grandsire, represented this unto that god of gods, that\r\nforemost one of all intelligent beings, saying, \"Formerly it was said by\r\nthy holy self that the two Krishnas are always sure to win victory. Let\r\nit be (now) as thou then saidest. Be gratified with me, O holy one!\" At\r\nthis, Brahman and Isana replied unto the chief of the celestials, saying,\r\n'The victory of the high-souled Vijaya is certain, of that Savyasaci who\r\ngratified the eater of sacrificial libations in the forest of Khandava\r\nand who, coming to heaven, rendered assistance to thee, O Sakra! Karna is\r\non the side of the Danavas. It is proper, therefore, that he should meet\r\nwith defeat. By this, without doubt, the purposes of the gods will be\r\nachieved. One's own business, O chief of the celestials, should always be\r\nimportant. The high-souled Phalguna, again, is devoted to truth and to\r\nmorality. He must always be victorious, without doubt. He by whom the\r\nhigh-souled and holy god having the bull on his standard was gratified,\r\nwhy should not he, O thou of a hundred eyes, be victorious,--he, that is,\r\nwho hath for the driver of his car that Lord of the universe, Vishnu\r\nhimself? Possessed of great energy of mind and great strength, Partha is\r\na hero, accomplished in arms and endued with ascetic merit. Possessed\r\nalso of great energy of body, he beareth the entire science of weapons.\r\nIndeed, Partha hath every accomplishment. He ought to be victorious,\r\nsince that would accomplish the purposes of the gods. In consequence of\r\nhis greatness, Partha transgresses destiny itself, whether favourable or\r\nunfavourable, and when he does so, a great destruction of creatures takes\r\nplace. When the two Krishnas are excited with wrath, they show regard for\r\nnothing. These two bulls among beings are the Creators of all real and\r\nunreal things. These two are Nara and Narayana, the two ancient and best\r\nof Rishis. There is none to rule over them. They are rulers over all,\r\nperfectly fearless, they are scorchers of all foes. In heaven or among\r\nhuman beings, there is none equal to either of them. The three worlds\r\nwith the celestial Rishis and the Charanas are behind these two. All the\r\ngods and all creatures walk behind them. The entire universe exists in\r\nconsequence of the power of these two. Let Karna, that bull among men,\r\nobtain these foremost of regions of bliss here. Let him obtain identity\r\nwith the Vasus or the Maruts. Let him, with Drona and Bhishma, be\r\nworshipped in heaven, for Vikartana's son is brave and is a hero. Let the\r\nvictory, however, belong to the two Krishnas.\" After those two foremost\r\nones among the gods (Brahman and Isana), said so, the deity of a 1,000\r\neyes, worshipping those words of Brahman and Isana and saluting all\r\ncreatures himself said, \"Ye have heard what has been said by the two gods\r\nfor the benefit of the universe. It will be even so and not otherwise.\r\nStay ye then, with cheerful hearts.\" Hearing these words of Indra, all\r\ncreatures, O sire, became filled with wonder and applauded, O king, that\r\ndeity. The celestials then showered diverse kinds of fragrant flowers and\r\nblew their trumpets. Indeed, the gods, the Danavas and the Gandharvas all\r\nwaited there for witnessing that matchless single combat between those\r\ntwo lions among men. The two cars, O king, upon which Karna and Arjuna\r\nwere stationed, had white steeds yoked unto them both. And both had\r\nexcellent standards, and both produced a loud rattle. Many foremost of\r\nheroes, approaching the brave Vasudeva and Arjuna as also Shalya and\r\nKarna, began each to blow his conch. The battle then commenced (between\r\nthe two warriors), overwhelming all timid persons with fear. Fiercely\r\nthey challenged each other like Sakra and Samvara. The standards of the\r\ntwo heroes, perfectly bright, looked exceedingly beautiful on their cars,\r\nlike the planets Rahu and Ketu risen in the firmament at the time of the\r\nuniversal dissolution. The elephant's rope on Karna's banner, looking\r\nlike a snake of virulent poison and made of jewels and gems and\r\nexceedingly strong and resembling the bow of Indra, looked resplendent\r\n(as it waved in the air). That foremost of apes, again, belonging to\r\nPartha, with jaws wide open and terrible, and difficult of being gazed\r\nat, like the sun himself, inspired fear by his formidable teeth. The\r\nimpetuous Ape on the standard of the wielder of Gandiva, becoming\r\ndesirous of battle, rushed from his station and fell upon Karna's\r\nstandard. Endued with great impetuosity, the Ape, darting forward, struck\r\nthe elephant's rope with his nails and teeth, like Garuda falling upon a\r\nsnake. Decked with rows of little bells, hard as iron, and resembling the\r\nfatal noose (in the hands of Yama or Varuna), the elephant's rope, filled\r\nwith wrath, closed with the Ape. Thus in that fierce single combat\r\nbetween those two heroes, which was the result of what had been settled\r\nat the time of the match at dice, their standards first battled with each\r\nother. Meanwhile the steeds of the one neighed at the steeds of the\r\nother. The lotus-eyed Keshava pierced Shalya with his keen glances. The\r\nlatter also cast similar glances at the former. Vasudeva, however,\r\nvanquished Shalya with those glances of his, while Dhananjaya, the son of\r\nKunti, vanquished Karna with his glances. Then the Suta's son, smilingly\r\naddressing Shalya, said, \"If Partha by any means slays me in battle\r\ntoday, tell me truly, O friend, what thou wilt do after that.\" Shalya\r\nanswered, saying, \"If thou art slain, I myself will slay both Krishna and\r\nDhananjaya.\" Once more the ruler of the Madras said, \"If, O Karna, the\r\nwhite steeded Arjuna slays thee in battle today, I myself, on a single\r\ncar, will slay both Madhava and Phalguna.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Arjuna also asked Govinda a similar question.\r\nKrishna, however, smiling, said unto Partha these words of grave import,\r\n\"The Sun himself may fall down from his place, the Earth herself may\r\nsplit into a 1,000 fragments; fire itself may become cold. Still Karna\r\nwill not be able to slay thee, O Dhananjaya! If, however, any such\r\noccurrence takes place, know then that the destruction of the universe\r\nwill be at hand. As regards myself, I will, using my bare arms, slay both\r\nKarna and Shalya in battle.\" Hearing these words of Krishna, the\r\nape-bannered Arjuna, smiling, replied unto Krishna who was never fatigued\r\nwith exertion, saying, \"Shalya and Karna, united together, are not a\r\nmatch for myself alone, O Janardana! Thou shalt today, O Krishna, behold\r\nKarna with his standard and banners with Shalya and his car and steeds,\r\nwith his umbrella and armour and darts and shafts and bow, cut in pieces\r\nwith my shafts in battle. Thou shalt today behold him with his car and\r\nsteeds and darts and armour and weapons, reduced to dust like a tree in\r\nthe forest crushed by a tusker. Today the widowhood of the wives of\r\nRadha's son is at hand. Verily, they must have in their (last night's)\r\ndreams seen signs of approaching evil, O Mahadeva! Verily, thou shalt\r\ntoday see the wives of Karna become widows. I cannot restrain my wrath at\r\nwhat was done before now by this fool of little foresight when he beheld\r\nKrishna dragged to the assembly and when laughing at us he abused us\r\nrepeatedly in vile words. Today, O Govinda, thou shalt behold Karna\r\ncrushed by me like a tree with its load of flowers crushed by an\r\ninfuriated elephant. Today, O slayer of Madhu, thou shalt, after Karna's\r\nfall, hear those sweet words, 'By good luck, O thou of Vrishni's race,\r\nvictory hath been thine!' Thou shalt today comfort the mother of\r\nAbhimanyu with a lighter heart for having paid thy debt to the foe. Today\r\nthou shalt, filled with joy, comfort thy paternal aunt Kunti. Today thou\r\nshalt, O Madhava, comfort Krishna of tearful face and king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just with words sweet as nectar.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n88\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile the welkin, filled with gods and Nagas and\r\nAsuras and Siddhas and Yakshas and with large bands of Gandharvas and\r\nRakshasas, and Asuras and regenerate Rishis and royal sages and birds of\r\nexcellent feathers, assumed a wonderful aspect. All human beings\r\nassembled there beheld those beings of wonderful aspect staying in the\r\nsky, and the sky itself resounded with the voice of musical instruments\r\nand song and adulatory hymns and laughter and dance, and diverse other\r\nkinds of charming sounds. Then both the Kaurava and the Pandava warriors,\r\nfilled with joy, and causing the earth and the ten points of the compass\r\nto resound with the voice of musical instruments, the blare of conchs,\r\nand leonine roars and the din of battle, began to slaughter their foes.\r\nTeeming with men and steeds and elephants and cars and weapons,\r\nunbearable to combatants in consequence of the falling of maces and\r\nswords and darts and rapiers, abounding in heroes, and crowded with\r\nlifeless bodies, the field of battle, crimsoned with gore, looked\r\nexceedingly resplendent. Indeed, the battle between the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas then resembled that in days of yore between the gods and the\r\nAsuras. After that fierce and awful battle had commenced between\r\nDhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, each of those two heroes, clad in\r\nexcellent mail, shrouded the ten points of the compass and the host\r\nopposed to him with keen and straight arrows. A darkness having been\r\ncaused there with the arrows shot on that occasion, neither thy warriors\r\nnor the enemy could any longer see anything. From fear all the warriors\r\nthere sought the protection of either Karna or Arjuna like rays of light\r\nspread out in the welkin converging towards either the sun or the moon.\r\nThe two heroes then, each baffling the other's weapons with his own, like\r\nthe east and the west winds encountering each other, looked exceedingly\r\nresplendent like the sun and the moon risen after dispelling the darkness\r\ncaused by the clouds and covering the welkin. Each having encouraged his\r\ntroops, saying, \"Do not fly away!\" the enemy and thy warriors stood their\r\nground, encircling those two mighty car-warriors like the gods and the\r\nasuras standing around Vasava and Samvara. The two armies then greeted\r\nthose two best of men with the sounds of drums and other instruments and\r\nwith leonine roars, at which those two bulls among men looked beautiful\r\nlike the sun and the moon greeted by roaring clouds gathered around. Each\r\narmed with a formidable bow drawn to a complete circle and looking like a\r\n(solar or lunar) corona, those two heroes of great splendour, shooting,\r\nin that battle thousands of arrows that constituted their rays, resembled\r\ntwo unbearable suns risen at the end of the yuga for burning the entire\r\nuniverse with its mobile and immobile creatures. Both invincible, both\r\ncapable of exterminating foes, each desirous of slaying the other; and\r\neach displaying his skill upon the other, those two warriors, Karna and\r\nthe son of Pandu, closed fearlessly with each other in that dreadful\r\nbattle, like Indra and the asura Jambha. Invoking the mightiest of\r\nweapons then, those two formidable bowmen began, with their terrible\r\nshafts, to slay innumerable men and steeds and elephants as also to\r\nstrike each other, O king! Afflicted once more by those two foremost of\r\nmen, the troops of both the Kurus and the Pandavas, consisting of\r\nelephants and foot-soldiers and horsemen and car-warriors, fled away on\r\nall sides like other animals in the forest when assailed by the lion.\r\nThen Duryodhana, and the chief of the Bhojas, and Subala's son, and\r\nKripa, and the son of Sharadvata's daughter, these five great\r\ncar-warriors, assailed Dhananjaya and Keshava with shafts capable of\r\nproducing great pain. Dhananjaya, however, with his shafts, cut off at\r\nthe same time the bows, the quivers, the steeds, the elephants, and the\r\ncars with their drivers, of those warriors, and mangling every one of\r\nthem with excellent shafts, pierced the Suta's son with a dozen arrows.\r\nThen a hundred cars, a hundred elephants, and a number of Saka and\r\nTukhara and Yavana horsemen, accompanied by some of the foremost\r\ncombatants among the Kambojas, quickly rushed against Arjuna from desire\r\nof slaying him. Speedily cutting off with the shafts and razor-headed\r\narrows in his hands the excellent weapons of his foes, as also their\r\nheads, and steeds, and elephants, and cars, Dhananjaya felled his\r\ncontending enemies on the field. Then in the welkin blasts of celestial\r\ntrumpets were blown by the excellent gods. These were mingled with the\r\npraises of Arjuna. Blown by gentle breezes, excellent floral showers,\r\nfragrant and auspicious, fell (upon Arjuna's head). Beholding that\r\nincident, which was witnessed by gods and men, all creatures, O king,\r\nwere filled with wonder.' Only thy son and the Suta's son who were both\r\nof the same opinion, felt neither pain nor wonder. Then Drona's son,\r\ncatching hold of Duryodhana's hand, and adopting a soothing tone,\r\naddressed thy son, saying, \"Be gratified, O Duryodhana! Make peace with\r\nthe Pandavas. There is no need for quarrel. Fie on war! The preceptor,\r\nconversant with the mightiest of weapons and like unto Brahma itself,\r\nhath been slain. Other bulls among men, headed by Bhishma, have also been\r\nslain. As regards myself, I am unslayable, as also my maternal uncle.\r\nRule the kingdom for ever, (sharing it) with the sons of Pandu. Dissuaded\r\nby me, Dhananjaya will abstain. Janardana also doth not desire\r\nhostilities. Yudhishthira is always engaged in the good of all creatures.\r\nVrikodara is obedient to him. So also are the twins. Peace being made\r\nbetween thee and the Parthas, all creatures will be benefited, through,\r\nas it would seem, thy desire. Let the kings that are still alive go back\r\nto their homes. Let the troops abstain from hostilities. If thou dost not\r\nlisten to my words, O king, struck by foes in battle, thou wilt have to\r\nburn with grief. Thou hast beheld, as well as the universe, what has been\r\nachieved by the single-handed Arjuna decked with diadem and garlands. The\r\nslayer of Vala himself could not achieve its like, nor the Destroyer, nor\r\nPrachetas, nor the illustrious king of the Yakshas. Dhananjaya, as\r\nregards his merits, is even much greater than that. He will never\r\ntransgress whatever I say unto him. He will always follow thee. Be thou\r\ngratified, O king, for the benefit of the universe. Thou always honourest\r\nme greatly. I, too, bear a great friendship for thee. It is for this that\r\nI say so unto thee. I shall dissuade Karna also, provided thou art\r\ninclined to peace. Discerning persons say that there are four kinds of\r\nfriends, viz., those that are naturally so, those that are made so by\r\nconciliation, those that become so through wealth, and lastly those\r\nbrought under subjection by the exercise of power. All these elements are\r\nowned by thee with regard to the sons of Pandu. The Pandavas, O hero, are\r\nnaturally thy friends. Obtain them again as friends for certain by\r\nconciliation. If upon thyself being gratified, they agree to become\r\nfriends, do thou, O king of kings, act in that way.\" These beneficial\r\nwords having been said unto him by his friends, Duryodhana reflected for\r\nsome time. Drawing deep breaths, he then, with a cheerless heart, said,\r\n\"It is as thou, O friend, hast said. Listen, however, to the words that I\r\nwould say unto thee. The wicked-hearted Vrikodara, having slain\r\nDuhshasana like a tiger, spoke words that still dwell in my heart. Thou\r\nalso heardest the same. How then can there be peace? Arjuna again will\r\nnot be able to bear Karna in battle, like a tempest whose force is\r\nweakened when encountering the mighty mountains of Meru. Nor will the\r\nsons of Pritha have the least confidence in me, thinking of the many acts\r\nof forceful hostility (done by me towards them). Nor, O preceptor's son\r\nof unfading glory, doth it behove thee to say unto Karna now 'Abstain\r\nfrom battle!' Phalguna is exceedingly tired today. Karna will soon slay\r\nhim\". Having with humility said these words repeatedly unto the\r\npreceptor's son, thy son commanded his own troops, saying, \"Armed with\r\narrows, rush against and slay these foes. Why stand ye inactive?\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n89\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Then when the blare of conchs and the peal of drums became\r\nvery loud, those two foremost of men, both owning white steeds, the\r\nsuta's son Vikartana and Arjuna, encountered each other in consequence, O\r\nking, of thy son's evil policy. Those two heroes endued with great\r\nimpetuosity, Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, closed with each other like\r\ntwo infuriated Himalayan elephants, both of full-grown tusks, fighting\r\nwith each other for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Like a mass\r\nof clouds encountering another mass, or a mountain encountering a\r\nmountain, those two warriors, both pouring showers of arrows, encountered\r\neach other, their bows loudly twanging the while, and the wheels of their\r\ncars producing a deafening clatter, and their bow-strings and palms\r\nemitting loud sounds. Like two mountains, both endued with tall cliffs\r\nand abounding in trees and creepers and herbs and both teeming with the\r\ndiverse other denizens that are natural to them, moving towards each\r\nother for an encounter, those two mighty warriors encountered each other,\r\neach striking the other with mighty weapons.\r\n\r\nThe combat between the two heroes became furious like that between the\r\nchief of the celestials and Virocana's son in days of yore. Incapable of\r\nbeing endured by others and marked by a river whose distasteful water\r\nconsisted of blood, the limbs of those two heroes, as also their drivers\r\nand animals, became exceedingly mangled. Like two large lakes, both\r\nteeming with lotuses of diverse kinds and fish and tortoises, and echoing\r\nwith the voices of diverse kinds of fowl, and softly stirred by the wind,\r\napproaching each other, those two cars graced with standards approached\r\neach other. Both endued with prowess equal to that of the great Indra,\r\nboth resembling the great Indra himself, those two mighty car-warriors\r\nstruck each other with shafts that resembled the great Indra's thunder,\r\nlike the great Indra himself and (the asura) Vritra.\r\n\r\nBoth the armies consisting of cars and elephants and steeds and\r\nfoot-soldiers, all equipped with beautiful armour and ornaments and robes\r\nand weapons, and those also that were in the welkin, were inspired with\r\nfear upon beholding that encounter of wonderful aspect between Arjuna and\r\nKarna. Others among the spectators, filled with joy and uttering leonine\r\nshouts, raised their arms, waving their fingers or the pieces of cloth\r\nthey held, when Arjuna rushed against the son of Adhiratha, from desire\r\nof slaughter, like one infuriated elephant rushing against another.\r\n\r\nThe Somakas then loudly shouted to Partha, saying, \"Be quick, O Arjuna,\r\ngo and pierce Karna. Cut off his head without delay, and (with it) the\r\ndesire of Dhritarashtra's son for kingdom.\" Similarly many warriors of\r\nours that were there, said unto Karna, \"Proceed, proceed, O Karna, and\r\nslay Arjuna with keen shafts. Let the sons of Pritha once more go to the\r\nwoods forever.\"\r\n\r\nThen Karna first pierced Partha in that encounter, with ten mighty\r\nshafts. Arjuna pierced him in return with ten keen-pointed shafts, shot\r\nwith great vigour, in the centre of the chest. Indeed, the suta's son and\r\nArjuna then mangled each other with many shafts equipped with goodly\r\nwings. Desirous of obtaining advantage of each other's lapses in that\r\ndreadful encounter, with cheerful hearts they rushed against each other\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\nRubbing his two arms and the string also of gandiva, that fierce bowman,\r\nArjuna, then sped showers of cloth-yard shafts, and nalikas and arrows\r\nequipped with heads like boar's ears and razors, and anjalikas, and\r\ncrescent-shaped arrows. Those arrows of Partha, O king, spread over the\r\nwelkin, penetrated into Karna's car like flights of birds, with heads\r\nbent down, penetrating in the evening into a tree for roosting there in\r\nthe night. All those arrows, however, O king, that Arjuna, that victor\r\nover all foes, with furrowed brow and angry glances, sped at Karna, all\r\nthose successive showers of shafts shot by the son of Pandu, were cut off\r\nby the suta's son with his own arrows.\r\n\r\nThe son of Indra then sped at Karna a fiery weapon capable of slaying all\r\nfoes. Covering the earth and the welkin and the ten points of the compass\r\nand the very course of the sun with its effulgence, it caused his own\r\nbody also to blaze up with light. The robes of all the warriors took\r\nfire, at which they fled away. Loud sounds also arose there, like what is\r\nheard when a forest of bamboos in a wilderness is on fire. Beholding that\r\nfiery weapon acting on all sides, the suta's son Karna of great valour\r\nshot in that encounter the varunastra for quenching it. That\r\nconflagration then, in consequence of Karna's weapon, became quenched.\r\n\r\nA large mass of clouds quickly caused all the points of the compass to be\r\nenveloped with darkness. Those clouds whose extremities presented the\r\naspect of mountains, surrounding every side, flooded the earth with\r\nwater. That fierce conflagration, though it was such, was still quenched\r\nby those clouds in a trice. The entire welkin and all the directions,\r\ncardinal and subsidiary, were shrouded by clouds. Thus shrouded by\r\nclouds, all the points of the compass became dark and nothing could be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThen Arjuna dispelled those clouds caused by Karna, by means of the\r\nvayavyastra. After this, Dhananjaya, incapable of being over-mastered by\r\nfoes inspired gandiva, its string, and his shafts, with mantras, and\r\ninvoked into existence another weapon that was the favourite of the chief\r\nof the celestials and that resembled the thunder in energy and prowess.\r\nThen razor-headed arrows, and anjalikas, and crescent-shaped shafts, and\r\nnalikas, and cloth-yard shafts and those equipped with heads like the\r\nboar's ear, all keen and sharp, issued from gandiva in thousands, endued\r\nwith the force and impetuosity of the thunder. Possessed of great might\r\nand great energy, those impetuous and keen shafts equipped with vulturine\r\nfeathers piercing all the limbs, the steeds, the bow, the yoke, the\r\nwheels, and the standard of Karna, quickly penetrated into them like\r\nsnakes frightened by Garuda penetrating into the earth. Pierced all over\r\nwith arrows and bathed in blood, (the high-souled) Karna then, with eyes\r\nrolling in wrath, bending his bow of enduring string and producing a\r\ntwang as loud as the roar of the sea, invoked into existence the Bhargava\r\nweapon. Cutting off Partha's showers of shafts proceeding from the mouth\r\nof that weapon of Indra (which Arjuna had shot), Karna, having thus\r\nbaffled his antagonist's weapon with his own, destroyed cars and\r\nelephants and foot-soldiers (of the Pandava army). Unable to endure the\r\nfeats of Arjuna in that fierce battle, the mighty car-warrior Karna did\r\nthis, through the energy of the Bhargava weapon. Filled with wrath and\r\npossessed of great activity, the Suta's son, that foremost of men,\r\nlaughing at the two Krishnas, pierced the foremost of Pancala warriors\r\nwith well shot arrows in that battle. Then the Pancalas and the Somakas,\r\nO king, thus afflicted by Karna with showers of shafts in that encounter,\r\nbecame filled with wrath and uniting together pierced the Suta's son with\r\nkeen arrows from every side. Quickly cutting off those arrows with his\r\nown, the Suta's son, vigorously agitating them in that battle, afflicted\r\nwith many shafts the cars, the elephants, and the steeds of the Pancalas.\r\nTheir bodies pierced with those shafts of Karna, they fell down, deprived\r\nof life, on the earth, making loud sounds, like mighty elephants slain by\r\nan angry lion of terrible strength. Having slain those foremost of\r\nwarriors, those heroes endued with great strength, those leaders of the\r\nPancala forces who had always challenged him (to battle), Karna, O king,\r\nas he shot his arrows, looked beautiful, like a mass of clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain. Then thy warriors, thinking that Karna had won the\r\nvictory, clapped loudly and uttered leonine roars. O chief of the Kurus,\r\nall of them then regarded the two Krishnas as brought by Karna under his\r\npower, seeing that valour, incapable of being borne by foes, of the\r\nmighty car-warrior Karna. Beholding that weapon of Dhananjaya frustrated\r\nby Karna in the midst of battle, the angry son of the Wind-god, with eyes\r\nblazing with wrath, began to squeeze his hands. Indeed, the wrathful\r\nBhima, his anger being provoked, drew deep breaths and addressing Arjuna\r\nof true aim, said, \"How, O Jishnu, could this wretch fallen off from\r\nvirtue, this Suta's son, putting forth his might in battle, slay so many\r\nforemost of Pancala warriors, in thy sight? Before now thou couldst not\r\nbe conquered by the very gods or the Kalakeyas. Thou receivedst the touch\r\nof the arms of Sthanu himself. How, then, O diadem-decked Arjuna, could\r\nthe Suta's son pierce thee first with ten long shafts such as are used by\r\ncar-warriors? That the Suta's son should today have succeeded in baffling\r\nthe arrows shot by thee seems to me to be very amazing. Recollect the\r\nwoes of Krishna, and those disagreeable, keen, and cutting words that\r\nthis wicked-souled and fearless son of a Suta used towards us, viz.,\r\n'Sesame seeds without kernel!' Recollecting all this, O Savyasaci,\r\nquickly slay the wretched Karna in battle today. Why, O diadem-decked\r\nArjuna, dost thou show such indifference (towards this act)? This is not\r\nthe time for showing thy indifference to Karna's slaughter. That patience\r\nwith which thou didst vanquish all creatures and feed Agni at Khandava,\r\nwith that patience, slay thou the Suta's son. I also will crush him with\r\nmy mace.\" Then Vasudeva, beholding Partha's shafts baffled by Karna, said\r\nunto the former, \"What is this, O diadem-decked Arjuna, that Karna should\r\nsucceed in crushing thy weapons today with this? Why dost, thou, O hero,\r\nlose thy wits? Markest thou not that the Kauravas, (standing behind\r\nKarna), are even now shouting in joy? Indeed, all of them know that thy\r\nweapons are being baffled by Karna with his. That patience with which,\r\nYuga after Yuga, thou hadst slain persons having the quality of darkness\r\nfor their weapons, as also terrible Kshatriyas, and Asuras born of pride,\r\nin many a battle--with that patience do thou slay Karna today. Putting\r\nforth thy might, strike off the head of that foe of thine with this\r\nSudarsana, of edge keen as a razor, that I give unto thee, like Sakra\r\nstriking off the head of his foe Namuci, with the thunderbolt. That\r\npatience with which thou didst gratified the illustrious deity Mahadeva\r\nin the guise of a hunter, summoning that patience once again, O hero,\r\nslay the Suta's son with all his followers. After that, bestow upon king\r\nYudhishthira the earth with her belt of seas, her towns and villages, and\r\nwealth, and from off whose surface all foes will have been removed. By\r\nthat act, O Partha, do thou also win unrivalled fame.\" Thus addressed (by\r\nKrishna), the high-souled Partha of exceeding might set his heart upon\r\nthe slaughter of the Suta's son. Indeed, urged by Bhima and Janardana,\r\nand recollecting (his woes), and taking an internal survey of himself,\r\nand calling to mind the object for which he had come to this world, he\r\naddressed Keshava, saying, \"I will now invoke into existence a mighty and\r\nfierce weapon for the good of the world and the destruction of the Suta's\r\nson. Let me have thy permission, as also Brahman's and Bhava's, and of\r\nall those that are conversant with Brahma.\" Having said these words unto\r\nthe holy Keshava, Savyasaci of immeasurable soul bowed unto Brahman and\r\ninvoked into existence that excellent irresistible weapon called\r\nbrahmastra which could be applied by the mind alone. Baffling that\r\nweapon, however, Karna looked beautiful as he continued, like a cloud\r\npouring torrents of rain, to shoot his shafts. Beholding that weapon of\r\nthe diadem-decked Arjuna baffled in the midst of battle by Karna, the\r\nwrathful and mighty Bhima, blazing up with rage, addressed Arjuna of sure\r\naim and said, \"People say that thou art a master of the high brahmastra,\r\nthat mighty means (for achieving the destruction of foes). Do thou then,\r\nO Savyasaci, use another weapon of the same kind.\" Thus addressed by his\r\nbrother, Savyasaci used a second weapon of the kind. With that, Partha of\r\nabundant energy shrouded all the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, with arrows sped from gandiva that resembled fierce snakes\r\nand were like the blazing rays of the sun. Created by that bull of\r\nBharata's race, those arrows of golden wings, in hundreds upon hundreds,\r\nendued with the effulgence of the yuga fire or the sun, in a moment\r\nshrouded the car of Karna. Thence also issued long darts and battle-axes\r\nand discs and cloth-yard shafts in hundreds, all of awful forms, at which\r\nhostile warriors all around began to be deprived of life. The head of\r\nsome hostile warrior, severed from his trunk, fell down on the field of\r\nbattle. Another, beholding his fallen comrade, fell down dead on the\r\nearth, through fear. The (right) arm of a third, large and massive as the\r\ntrunk of an elephant, cut off (by Partha), fell down with the sword in\r\ngrasp. The left arm of a fourth, cut off with a razor-headed arrow, fell\r\ndown with the shield in it. Even thus, Partha, decked with diadem and\r\ngarlands, wounded and slew all the foremost warriors of Duryodhana's army\r\nwith his terrible and death-dealing shafts. Vaikartana also, in the midst\r\nof that battle, shot thousands of arrows. These, with a loud whizz, fell\r\nupon the son of Pandu like torrents of rain poured from the clouds. Then\r\npiercing Bhimasena and Janardana and the diadem-decked Arjuna of\r\nsuperhuman feats, each with three arrows Karna of terrible might uttered\r\na loud awful roar. Struck with Karna's shafts, the diadem-decked Arjuna,\r\nbeholding Bhima and Janardana, became unable to endure (the feats of his\r\nantagonist). Once more, therefore, Partha shot eight and ten arrows.\r\nPiercing the beautiful standard of Karna with one of those arrows, he\r\npierced Shalya with four and Karna himself with three. With ten other\r\nwell-shot shafts he then struck the Kaurava warrior Sabhapati, clad in\r\ngolden mail. Thereupon that prince, deprived of head and arms and steeds\r\nand driver and bow and standard, fell down, wounded and dead, from his\r\nforemost of cars, like a Sala tree cut down with an axe. Once more\r\npiercing Karna with three, eight, twelve, four, and ten arrows, Partha\r\nslew 400 elephants equipped with many weapons, and 8000 car-warriors, and\r\n1,000 steeds with riders, and 8,000 brave foot-soldiers. And soon Partha\r\nmade Karna with his driver and car and steeds and standard invisible with\r\nstraightly coursing shafts. Then the Kauravas, thus slaughtered by\r\nDhananjaya, loudly addressed Adhitratha's son, saying, \"Shoot thy arrows\r\nand slay the son of Pandu. Already, he has begun to exterminate the Kurus\r\nwith his shafts!\" Thus urged, Karna, with his best endeavours,\r\nincessantly shot many arrows. Capable of cutting the very vitals, those\r\nblood-drinking shafts, well sped by Karna, slew large numbers of the\r\nPandavas and the Pancalas. Thus those two foremost of all bowmen, those\r\ntwo warriors of great strength that were capable of bearing all foes,\r\nthose two heroes acquainted with weapons, struck the warriors opposed to\r\nthem, as also each other, with mighty weapons. Then Yudhishthira, clad in\r\ngolden mail, his arrows having been extracted and himself made sound with\r\nmantras and drugs by foremost of surgeons well-disposed towards him,\r\nquickly came to that spot for witnessing (the encounter between Arjuna\r\nand Karna). Beholding king Yudhishthira the just arrived there like the\r\nresplendent full Moon freed from the jaws of Rahu and risen in the\r\nfirmament, all creatures became filled with delight. Beholding those two\r\nforemost of warriors, those two first of heroes and slayers of foes,\r\nviz., Karna and Partha, engaged in fight, the spectators, both celestial\r\nand terrestrial, restraining the animals they rode or that were yoked\r\nunto their vehicles, stood motionless. As the two heroes, O king, struck\r\neach other with many foremost of arrows, O king, the sounds caused by the\r\nbows, bow-strings, and palms, of both Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son,\r\nbecame tremendous and their well-sped arrows also caused a deafening\r\nwhizz. Then the bow-string of the son of Pandu, stretched with force,\r\nbroke with a loud noise. During the interval thus offered, the Suta's son\r\npierced Partha with a hundred small arrows, keen and steeped in oil,\r\nwinged with the feathers of birds, and resembling snakes freed from their\r\nsloughs. He then quickly pierced Vasudeva with sixty shafts, and then\r\nPhalguna again with eight. Surya's son then pierced Bhima with thousands\r\nupon thousands of mighty arrows. Having pierced Krishna and Partha's\r\nstandard, Karna felled many amongst the Somakas that followed Partha.\r\nThese, however, in return shrouded Karna with showers of straight shafts\r\nlike masses of clouds shrouding the sun in the welkin. Accomplished in\r\nthe use of weapons, the Suta's son, stupefying those advancing warriors\r\nwith his shafts and baffling all the weapons shot by them, destroyed\r\ntheir cars and steeds and elephants. And the Suta's son, O king, also\r\nafflicted with his arrows many foremost of warriors among them. Their\r\nbodies pierced with Karna's shafts, they fell down on the ground,\r\ndeprived of life and making a loud noise as they fell. Indeed, those\r\nmighty combatants, afflicted by Karna of terrible strength, perished like\r\na pack of dogs afflicted by an angry lion. And once more many foremost of\r\ncombatants among the Pancalas and many such (among the Kauravas) fell\r\ndown after this, slain by Karna and Dhananjaya. Deprived of life by the\r\nmighty Karna with well-aimed arrows shot with great force, many fell\r\ndown, purging the contents of their stomachs. Then thy troops, regarding\r\nthe victory to be already theirs, clapped furiously and uttered loud\r\nleonine roars. Indeed, in that dreadful encounter, all of them regarded\r\nthe two Krishnas to have been brought by Karna under his power. Then\r\nquickly bending his bow-string and baffling all those shafts of\r\nAdhiratha's son, Partha, filled with rage in consequence of his limbs\r\nhaving been mangled with Karna's arrows, assailed the Kauravas. Rubbing\r\nhis bow-string, he clapped his palms and suddenly caused a darkness there\r\nwith the showers of shafts he shot. The diadem-decked Arjuna pierced\r\nKarna and Shalya and all the Kurus with those arrows. The welkin having\r\nbeen darkened by means of that mighty weapon, the very birds were unable\r\nto range in their element, a delicious wind then blew, bearing fragrant\r\nodours. Laughing the while, Partha forcibly struck Shalya's armour with\r\nten arrows. Piercing Karna next with a dozen shafts, he struck him once\r\nmore with seven. Deeply struck with those winged arrows of fierce energy\r\nshot with great force from Partha's bow, Karna, with mangled limbs and\r\nbody bathed in blood, looked resplendent like Rudra at the universal\r\ndestruction, sporting in the midst of crematorium at noon or eve, his\r\nbody dyed with blood. The son of Adhiratha then pierced Dhananjaya who\r\nresembled the chief of the celestials himself (in energy and might) with\r\nthree arrows, and he caused five other blazing arrows resembling five\r\nsnakes to penetrate the body of Krishna. Shot with great force, those\r\narrows, decked with gold, pierced through the armour of that foremost of\r\nbeings and passing out of his body fell upon the earth. Endued with great\r\nenergy, they entered the earth with great force and having bathed (in the\r\nwaters of the Bhogavati in the nether region) coursed back towards Karna.\r\nThose shafts were five mighty snakes that had adopted the side of\r\nTakshaka's son (Aswasena whose mother Partha had slain at Khandava). With\r\nten broad-headed arrows shot with great force, Arjuna cut off each of\r\nthose five snakes into three fragments whereupon they fell down on the\r\nearth. Beholding Krishna's limbs thus mangled with those snakes\r\ntransformed into arrows sped from Karna's arms, Arjuna, decked with\r\ndiadem and garlands, blazed up with wrath like a fire engaged in burning\r\na heap of dry grass. He then pierced Karna in all his vital limbs with\r\nmany blazing and fatal shafts shot from the bow-string stretched to the\r\nvery ear. (Deeply pierced), Karna trembled in pain. With the greatest\r\ndifficulty he stood, summoning all his patience. Dhananjaya having been\r\nfilled with wrath, all the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, the very splendour of the Sun, and Karna's car, O king, all\r\nbecame invisible with the showers shot by him. The welkin seemed as if it\r\nwere shrouded by a thick forest. Then that slayer of foes, that bull of\r\nKuru's race, that foremost of heroes, viz., Savyasaci, O king, soon slew\r\nin that battle 2,000 foremost of Kuru warriors, with their cars and\r\nsteeds and drivers, forming the protectors of Karna's car-wheels and\r\nwings and his van-guard and rear-guard and who constituted the very pick\r\nof Duryodhana's car-force, and who, urged by Duryodhana, had been\r\nfighting with great energy. Then thy sons and the Kauravas that were\r\nstill alive fled away, deserting Karna, and abandoning their dying and\r\nwounded, and their wailing sons and sires. Beholding himself abandoned by\r\nthe terrified Kurus and seeing the space around him empty, Karna felt no\r\nagitation, O Bharata, but, on the other hand, rushed at Arjuna, with a\r\ncheerful heart.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Flying away in consequence of the falling of Arjuna's\r\narrows, the broken divisions of the Kauravas, staying at a distance,\r\ncontinued to gaze at Arjuna's weapon swelling with energy and careering\r\naround with the effulgence of lightning. Then Karna, with showers of\r\nterrible shafts, baffled that weapon of Arjuna while it was still\r\ncareering in the welkin and which Arjuna had shot with great vigour in\r\nthat fierce encounter for the destruction of his foe. Indeed, that weapon\r\n(of Partha) which, swelling with energy, had been consuming the Kurus,\r\nthe Suta's son now crushed with his shafts winged with gold. Bending then\r\nhis own loud-sounding bow of irrefragable string, Karna shot showers of\r\nshafts. The Suta's son destroyed that burning weapon of Arjuna with his\r\nown foe-killing weapon of great power which he had obtained from Rama,\r\nand which resembled (in efficacy) an Atharvan rite. And he pierced Partha\r\nalso with numerous keen shafts. The encounter then, O king, that took\r\nplace between Arjuna and the son of Adhiratha, became a very dreadful\r\none. They continued to strike each other with arrows like two fierce\r\nelephants striking each other with their tusks. All the points of the\r\ncompass then became shrouded with weapons and the very sun became\r\ninvisible. Indeed, Karna and Partha, with their arrowy downpours, made\r\nthe welkin one vast expanse of arrows without any space between. All the\r\nKauravas and the Somakas then beheld a wide-spread arrowy net. In that\r\ndense darkness caused by arrows, they were unable to see anything else.\r\nThose two foremost of men, both accomplished in weapons, as they\r\nincessantly aimed and shot innumerable arrows, O king, displayed diverse\r\nkinds of beautiful manoeuvres. While they were thus contending with each\r\nother in battle, sometimes the Suta's son prevailed over his rival and\r\nsometimes the diadem-decked Partha prevailed over his, in prowess and\r\nweapons and lightness of hands. Beholding that terrible and awful\r\npassage-at-arms between those two heroes each of whom was desirous of\r\navailing himself of the other's lapses, all the other warriors on the\r\nfield of battle became filled with wonder. The beings in the welkin, O\r\nking, applauded Karna and Arjuna. Indeed, many of them at a time, filled\r\nwith joy, cheerfully shouted, sometimes saying, \"Excellent, O Karna!\" and\r\nsometimes saying, \"Excellent, O Arjuna!\" During the progress of that\r\nfierce encounter, while the earth was being pressed deep with the weight\r\nof cars and the tread of steeds and elephants, the snake Aswasena, who\r\nwas hostile to Arjuna, was passing his time in the nether region. Freed\r\nfrom the conflagration at Khandava, O king, he had, from anger,\r\npenetrated through the earth (for going to the subterranean region). That\r\nbrave snake, recollecting the death of his mother and the enmity he on\r\nthat account harboured against Arjuna, now rose from the lower region.\r\nEndued with the power of ascending the skies, he soared up with great\r\nspeed upon beholding that fight between Karna and Arjuna. Thinking that\r\nthat was the time for gratifying his animosity towards, as he thought,\r\nthe wicked-souled Partha, he quickly entered into Karna's quiver, O king,\r\nin the form of an arrow. At that time a net of arrows was seen, shedding\r\nits bright arrows around. Karna and Partha made the welkin one dense mass\r\nof arrows by means of their arrowy downpours. Beholding that wide-spread\r\nexpanse of arrows, all the Kauravas and the Somakas became filled with\r\nfear. In that thick and awful darkness caused by arrows they were unable\r\nto see anything else. Then those two tigers among men, those two foremost\r\nof all bowmen in the world, those two heroes, fatigued with their\r\nexertions in battle, looked at each other. Both of them were then fanned\r\nwith excellent and waving fans made of young (palm) leaves and sprinkled\r\nwith fragrant sandal-water by many Apsaras staying in the welkin. And\r\nSakra and Surya, using their hands, gently brushed the faces of those two\r\nheroes. When at last Karna found that he could not prevail over Partha\r\nand was exceedingly scorched with the shafts of the former, that hero,\r\nhis limbs very much mangled, set his heart upon that shaft of his which\r\nlay singly within a quiver. The Suta's son then fixed on his bow-string\r\nthat foe-killing, exceedingly keen, snake-mouthed, blazing, and fierce\r\nshaft, which had been polished according to rule, and which he had long\r\nkept for the sake of Partha's destruction. Stretching his bow-string to\r\nhis ear, Karna fixed that shaft of fierce energy and blazing splendour,\r\nthat ever-worshipped weapon which lay within a golden quiver amid sandal\r\ndust, and aimed it at Partha. Indeed, he aimed that blazing arrow, born\r\nin Airavata's race, for cutting off Phalguna's head in battle. All the\r\npoints of the compass and the welkin became ablaze and terrible meteors,\r\nand thunderbolts fell. When that snake of the form of an arrow was fixed\r\non the bow-string, the Regents of the world, including Sakra, set up loud\r\nwails. The Suta's son did not know that the snake Aswasena had entered\r\nhis arrow by the aid of his Yoga powers. Beholding Vaikartana aim that\r\narrow, the high-souled ruler of the Madras, addressing Karna, said, \"This\r\narrow, O Karna, will not succeed in striking off Arjuna's head. Searching\r\ncarefully, fix another arrow that may succeed in striking off thy enemy's\r\nhead.\" Endued with great activity, the Suta's son, with eyes burning in\r\nwrath, then said unto the ruler of the Madras, \"O Shalya, Karna never\r\naimeth an arrow twice. Persons like us never become crooked warriors.\"\r\nHaving said these words, Karna, with great care, let off that shaft which\r\nhe had worshipped for many long years. Bent upon winning the victory, O\r\nking, he quickly said unto his rival, \"Thou art slain, O Phalguna!\" Sped\r\nfrom Karna's arms, that shaft of awful whizz, resembling fire or the sun\r\nin splendour, as it left the bow-string, blazed up in the welkin and\r\nseemed to divide it by a line such as is visible on the crown of a woman\r\ndividing her tresses. Beholding that shaft blazing in the welkin, the\r\nslayer of Kamsa, Madhava, with great speed and the greatest ease, pressed\r\ndown with his feet that excellent car, causing it to sink about a cubit\r\ndeep. At this, the steeds, white as the rays of the moon and decked in\r\ntrappings of gold, bending their knees, laid themselves down on the\r\nground. Indeed, seeing that snake (in the form of an arrow) aimed by\r\nKarna, Madhava, that foremost of all persons endued with might, put forth\r\nhis strength and thus pressed down with his feet that car into the earth,\r\nwhereat the steeds, (as already said) bending down their knees, laid\r\nthemselves down upon the earth when the car itself had sank into it. Then\r\nloud sounds arose in the welkin in applause of Vasudeva. Many celestial\r\nvoices were heard, and celestial flowers were showered upon Krishna, and\r\nleonine shouts also were uttered. When the car had thus been pressed down\r\ninto the earth through the exertions of the slayer of Madhu, the\r\nexcellent ornament of Arjuna's head, celebrated throughout the earth, the\r\nwelkin, heaven, and the waters, the Suta's son swept off from the crown\r\nof his rival, with that arrow, in consequence of the very nature of that\r\nsnaky weapon and the great care and wrath with which it had been shot.\r\nThat diadem, endued with the splendour of the sun or the moon or fire or\r\na planet, and adorned with gold and pearls and gems and diamonds, had\r\nwith great care been made by the puissant Self-born himself for\r\nPurandara. Costly as its appearance indicated, it was inspiring terror in\r\nthe hearts of foes, contributing to the happiness of him that wore it,\r\nand shedding a fragrance, that ornament had been given by the chief of\r\nthe celestials himself with a cheerful heart unto Partha while the latter\r\nhad proceeded to slaughter the foes of the gods. That diadem was\r\nincapable of being crushed by Rudra and the Lord of waters and Kuvera\r\nwith Pinaka and noose and thunderbolt and the very foremost of shafts. It\r\ncould not be endured by even the foremost ones among the gods. Vrisha,\r\nhowever, now broke it forcibly with his snake-inspired shaft. Endued with\r\ngreat activity, that wicked-natured snake of fierce form and false vows,\r\nfalling upon that diadem-decked with gold and gems, swept it away from\r\nArjuna's head. That snake, O king, forcibly tore it away from Partha's\r\nhead, quickly reducing into fragments that well-made ornament set over\r\nwith many a gem and blazing with beauty, like the thunderbolt riving a\r\nmountain summit decked with lofty and beautiful trees graced with\r\nflowers. Crushed by that excellent weapon, possessed of splendour, and\r\nblazing with the fire of (the snake's) poison, that beautiful and\r\nmuch-liked diadem of Partha fell down on the earth like the blazing disc\r\nof the Sun from the Asta hills. Indeed, that snake forcibly swept away\r\nfrom Arjuna's head that diadem adorned with many gems, like the thunder\r\nof Indra felling a beautiful mountain summit adorned with lofty trees\r\nbearing budding leaves and flowers. And the earth, welkin, heaven, and\r\nthe waters, when agitated by a tempest, roar aloud, O Bharata, even such\r\nwas the roar that arose in all the worlds at that time. Hearing that\r\ntremendous noise, people, notwithstanding their efforts to be calm,\r\nbecame extremely agitated and reeled as they stood. Reft of diadem, the\r\ndark complexioned and youthful Partha looked beautiful like a blue\r\nmountain of lofty summit. Binding then his locks with a white cloth,\r\nArjuna stood perfectly unmoved. With that white gear on his head, he\r\nlooked like the Udaya hill illumined with the rays of the sun. Thus that\r\nshe-snake (whom Arjuna had killed at Khandava) of excellent mouth,\r\nthrough her son in the form of an arrow, sped by Surya's son, beholding\r\nArjuna of exceeding energy and might standing with his head at a level\r\nwith the reins of the steeds, took away his diadem only, that well-made\r\nornament (formerly) owned by Aditi's son and endued with the effulgence\r\nof Surya himself. But Arjuna also (as will appear in the sequel) did not\r\nreturn from that battle without causing the snake to succumb to the power\r\nof Yama. Sped from Karna's arms, that costly shaft resembling fire or the\r\nsun in effulgence, viz., that mighty snake who from before had become the\r\ndeadly foe of Arjuna, thus crushing the latter's diadem, went away.\r\nHaving burnt the gold-decked diadem of Arjuna displayed on his head, he\r\ndesired to come to Arjuna once more with great speed. Asked, however, by\r\nKarna (who saw him but knew him not), he said these words, \"Thou hadst\r\nsped me, O Karna, without having seen me. It was for this that I could\r\nnot strike off Arjuna's head. Do thou quickly shoot me once again, after\r\nseeing me well. I shall then slay thy foe and mine too.\" Thus addressed\r\nin that battle by him, the Suta's son said, \"Who are you possessed of\r\nsuch fierce form?\" The snake answered, saying, \"Know me as one that has\r\nbeen wronged by Partha. My enmity towards him is due to his having slain\r\nmy mother. If the wielder of the thunderbolt himself were to protect\r\nPartha, the latter would still have to go to the domains of the king of\r\nthe pitris. Do not disregard me. Do my bidding. I will slay thy foe.\r\nShoot me without delay.\" Hearing those words, Karna said, \"Karna, O\r\nsnake, never desires to have victory in battle today by relying on\r\nanother's might. Even if I have to slay a hundred Arjunas, I will not, O\r\nsnake, still shoot the same shaft twice.\" Once more addressing him in the\r\nmidst of battle, that best of men, viz., Surya's son, Karna, said, \"Aided\r\nby the nature of my other snaky weapons, and by resolute effort and\r\nwrath, I shall slay Partha. Be thou happy and go elsewhere.\" Thus\r\naddressed, in battle, by Karna, that prince of snakes, unable from rage\r\nto bear those words, himself proceeded, O king, for the slaughter of\r\nPartha, having assumed the form of an arrow. Of fierce form, the desire\r\nhe ardently cherished was the destruction of his enemy. Then Krishna,\r\naddressing Partha in that encounter, said into him, \"Slay that great\r\nsnake inimical to thee.\" Thus addressed by the slayer of Madhu, the\r\nwielder of Gandiva, that bowman who was always fierce unto foes, enquired\r\nof him, saying, \"Who is that snake that advanceth of his own accord\r\nagainst me, as if, indeed he advanceth right against the mouth of\r\nGaruda?\" Krishna replied, \"Whilst thou, armed with bow, wert engaged at\r\nKhandava in gratifying the god Agni, this snake was then in the sky, his\r\nbody ensconced within his mother's. Thinking that it was only a single\r\nsnake that was so staying in the sky, thou killedest the mother.\r\nRemembering that act of hostility done by thee, he cometh towards thee\r\ntoday for thy destruction. O resister of foes, behold him coming like a\r\nblazing meteor, falling from the firmament!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Jishnu, turning his face in rage, cut off, with\r\nsix keen shafts, that snake in the welkin as the latter was coursing in a\r\nslanting direction. His body thus cut off, he fell down on the earth.\r\nAfter that snake had been cut off by Arjuna, the lord Keshava himself, O\r\nking, of massive arms, that foremost of beings, raised up with his arms\r\nthat car from the earth. At that time, Karna, glancing obliquely at\r\nDhananjaya, pierced that foremost of persons, viz., Krishna, with ten\r\nshafts whetted on stone and equipped with peacock feathers. Then\r\nDhananjaya, piercing Karna with a dozen well-shot and keen arrows\r\nequipped with heads like the boar's ear, sped a cloth-yard shaft endued\r\nwith the energy of a snake of virulent poison and shot from his\r\nbow-string stretched to his ear. That foremost of shafts, well shot by\r\nArjuna, penetrated through Karna's armour, and as if suspending his life\r\nbreaths, drank his blood and entered the earth, its wings also having\r\nbeen drenched with gore. Endued with great activity, Vrisha, enraged at\r\nthe stroke of the shaft, like a snake beaten with stick, shot many mighty\r\nshafts, like snakes of virulent poison vomiting venom. And he pierced\r\nJanardana with a dozen shafts and Arjuna with nine and ninety. And once\r\nmore piercing the son of Pandu with a terrible shaft, Karna laughed and\r\nuttered a loud roar. The son of Pandu, however, could not endure his\r\nenemy's joy. Acquainted with all the vital parts of the human body,\r\nPartha, possessed of prowess like that of Indra, pierced those vital\r\nlimbs with hundreds of arrows even as Indra had struck Vala with great\r\nenergy. Then Arjuna sped ninety arrows, each resembling the rod of Death\r\nat Karna. Deeply pierced with those shafts, Karna trembled like a\r\nmountain riven with thunder. The head-gear of Karna, adorned with costly\r\ngems and precious diamonds and pure gold, as also his earrings, cut off\r\nby Dhananjaya with his winged arrows, fell down on the earth. The costly\r\nand bright armour also of the Suta's son that had been forged with great\r\ncare by many foremost of artists working for a long time, the son of\r\nPandu cut off within a moment in many fragments. After thus divesting him\r\nof his armour, Partha then, in rage, pierced Karna with four whetted\r\nshafts of great energy. Struck forcibly by his foe, Karna suffered great\r\npain like a diseased person afflicted by bile, phlegm, wind, and fever.\r\nOnce more Arjuna, with great speed, mangled Karna, piercing his very\r\nvitals, with numerous excellent shafts, of great keenness, and sped from\r\nhis circling bow with much force and speed and care. Deeply struck by\r\nPartha with those diverse arrows of keen points and fierce energy, Karna\r\n(covered with blood) looked resplendent like a mountain of red chalk with\r\nstreams of red water running adown its breast. Once more Arjuna pierced\r\nKarna in the centre of the chest with many straight-coursing and strong\r\nshafts made entirely of iron and equipped with wings of gold and each\r\nresembling the fiery rod of the Destroyer, like the son of Agni piercing\r\nthe Krauncha mountains. Then the Suta's son, casting aside his bow that\r\nresembled the very bow of Sakra, as also his quiver, felt great pain, and\r\nstood inactive, stupefied, and reeling, his grasp loosened and himself in\r\ngreat anguish. The virtuous Arjuna, observant of the duty of manliness,\r\nwished not to slay his enemy while fallen into such distress. The younger\r\nbrother of Indra then, with great excitement, addressed him, saying,\r\n\"Why, O son of Pandu, dost thou become so forgetful? They that are truly\r\nwise never spare their foes, however weak, even for a moment. He that is\r\nlearned earneth both merit and fame by slaying foes fallen into distress.\r\nLose no time in precipitately crushing Karna who is always inimical to\r\nthee and who is the first of heroes. The Suta's son, when able, will once\r\nmore advance against thee as before. Slay him, therefore, like Indra\r\nslaying the Asura Namuci.\" Saying, \"So be it, O Krishna!\" and worshipping\r\nJanardana, Arjuna, that foremost of all persons in Kuru's race once more\r\nquickly pierced Karna with many excellent arrows like the ruler of\r\nheaven, piercing the Asura, Samvara. The diadem-decked Partha, O Bharata,\r\ncovered Karna and his car and steeds with many calf-toothed arrows, and\r\nputting forth all his vigour he shrouded all the points of the compass\r\nwith shafts equipped with wings of gold. Pierced with those arrows\r\nequipped with heads like the calf's tooth, Adhiratha's son of broad chest\r\nlooked resplendent like an Asoka or Palasa or Salmali decked with its\r\nflowery load or a mountain overgrown with a forest of sandal trees.\r\nIndeed, with those numerous arrows sticking to his body, Karna, O\r\nmonarch, in that battle, looked resplendent like the prince of mountains\r\nwith its top and glens overgrown with trees or decked with flowering\r\nKarnikaras. Karna also shooting repeated showers of arrows, looked, with\r\nthose arrows constituting his rays, like the sun coursing towards the\r\nAsta hills, with disc bright with crimson rays. Shafts, however, of keen\r\npoints, sped from Arjuna's arms, encountering in the welkin the blazing\r\narrows, resembling mighty snakes, sped from the arms of Adhiratha's son,\r\ndestroyed them all. Recovering his coolness, and shooting many shafts\r\nthat resembled angry snakes, Karna then pierced Partha with ten shafts\r\nand Krishna with half a dozen, each of which looked like an angry snake.\r\nThen Dhananjaya desired to shoot a mighty and terrible arrow, made wholly\r\nof iron, resembling the poison of snake or fire in energy, and whose\r\nwhizz resembling the peal of Indra's thunder, and which was inspired with\r\nthe force of a high (celestial) weapon. At that time, when the hour of\r\nKarna's death had come, Kala, approaching invisibly, and alluding to the\r\nBrahmana's curse, and desirous of informing Karna that his death was\r\nnear, told him, \"The Earth is devouring thy wheel!\" Indeed, O foremost of\r\nmen, when the hour of Karna's death came, the high brahmastra that the\r\nillustrious Bhargava had imparted unto him, escaped from his memory. And\r\nthe earth also began to devour the left wheel of his car. Then in\r\nconsequence of the curse of that foremost of Brahmanas, Karna's car began\r\nto reel, having sunk deep into the earth and having been transfixed at\r\nthat spot like a sacred tree with its load of flowers standing upon an\r\nelevated platform. When his car began to reel from the curse of the\r\nBrahmana, and when the high weapon he had obtained from Rama no longer\r\nshone in him through inward light, and when his terrible snake-mouthed\r\nshaft also had been cut off by Partha, Karna became filled with\r\nmelancholy. Unable to endure all those calamities, he waved his arms and\r\nbegan to rail at righteousness saying, \"They that are conversant with\r\nrighteousness always say that righteousness protects those that are\r\nrighteous. As regards ourselves, we always endeavour, to the best of our\r\nability and knowledge to practise righteousness. That righteousness,\r\nhowever, is destroying us now instead of protecting us that are devoted\r\nto it. I, therefore, think that righteousness does not always protect its\r\nworshippers.\" While saying these words, he became exceedingly agitated by\r\nthe strokes of Arjuna's arrows. His steeds and his driver also were\r\ndisplaced from their usual position. His very vitals having been struck,\r\nhe became indifferent as to what he did, and repeatedly railed at\r\nrighteousness in that battle. He then pierced Krishna in the arm with\r\nthree terrible arrows, and Partha, too, with seven. Then Arjuna sped\r\nseven and ten terrible arrows, perfectly straight and of fierce\r\nimpetuosity, resembling fire in splendour and like unto Indra's thunder\r\nin force. Endued with awful impetuosity, those arrows pierced Karna and\r\npassing out of his body fell upon the surface of the earth. Trembling at\r\nthe shock, Karna then displayed his activity to the utmost of his power.\r\nSteadying himself by a powerful effort he invoked the brahmastra.\r\nBeholding the brahmastra, Arjuna invoked the Aindra weapon with proper\r\nmantras. Inspiring gandiva, its string, and his shafts also, with\r\nmantras, that scorcher of foes poured showers like Purandara pouring rain\r\nin torrents. Those arrows endued with great energy and power, issuing out\r\nof Partha's car, were seen to be displayed in the vicinity of Karna's\r\nvehicle. The mighty car-warrior Karna baffled all those shafts displayed\r\nin his front. Seeing that weapon thus destroyed, the Vrishni hero,\r\naddressing Arjuna, said, \"Shoot high weapons, O Partha! The son of Radha\r\nbaffles thy shafts.\" With proper mantras, Arjuna then fixed the\r\nbrahmastra on his string, and shrouding all the points of the compass\r\nwith arrows, Partha struck Karna (with many) arrows. Then Karna, with a\r\nnumber of whetted shafts endued with great energy, cut off the string of\r\nArjuna's bow. Similarly he cut off the second string, and then the third,\r\nand then the fourth, and then the fifth. The sixth also was cut off by\r\nVrisha, and then the seventh, then the eighth, then the ninth, then the\r\ntenth, and then at last the eleventh. Capable of shooting hundreds upon\r\nhundreds of arrows, Karna knew not that Partha had a hundred strings to\r\nhis bow. Tying another string to his bow and shooting many arrows, the\r\nson of Pandu covered Karna with shafts that resembled snakes of blazing\r\nmouths. So quickly did Arjuna replace each broken string that Karna could\r\nnot mark when it was broken and when replaced. The feat seemed to him to\r\nbe exceedingly wonderful. The son of Radha baffled with his own weapons\r\nthose of Savyasaci. Displaying also his own prowess, he seemed to get the\r\nbetter of Dhananjaya at that time. Then Krishna, beholding Arjuna\r\nafflicted with the weapons of Karna, said these words unto Partha:\r\n\"Approaching Karna, strike him with superior weapons.\" Then Dhananjaya,\r\nfilled with rage, inspiring with mantras another celestial weapons that\r\nlooked like fire and that resembled the poison of the snake and that was\r\nas hard as the essence of adamant, and uniting the Raudra weapon with it,\r\nbecame desirous of shooting it at his foe. At that time, O king, the\r\nearth swallowed up one of wheels of Karna's car. Quickly alighting then\r\nfrom his vehicle, he seized his sunken wheel with his two arms and\r\nendeavoured to lift it up with a great effort. Drawn up with force by\r\nKarna, the earth, which had swallowed up his wheel, rose up to a height\r\nof four fingers' breadth, with her seven islands and her hills and waters\r\nand forests. Seeing his wheel swallowed, the son of Radha shed tears from\r\nwrath, and beholding Arjuna, filled with rage he said these words, \"O\r\nPartha, O Partha, wait for a moment, that is, till I lift this sunken\r\nwheel. Beholding, O Partha, the left wheel of my car swallowed through\r\naccident by the earth, abandon (instead of cherishing) this purpose (of\r\nstriking and slaying me) that is capable of being harboured by only a\r\ncoward. Brave warriors that are observant of the practices of the\r\nrighteous, never shoot their weapons at persons with dishevelled hair, or\r\nat those that have turned their faces from battle, or at a Brahmana, or\r\nat him who joins his palms, or at him who yields himself up or beggeth\r\nfor quarter or at one who has put up his weapon, or at one whose arrows\r\nare exhausted, or at one whose armour is displaced, or at one whose\r\nweapon has fallen off or been broken! Thou art the bravest of men in the\r\nworld. Thou art also of righteous behaviour, O son of Pandu! Thou art\r\nwell-acquainted with the rules of battle. For these reasons, excuse me\r\nfor a moment, that is, till I extricate my wheel, O Dhananjaya, from the\r\nearth. Thyself staying on thy car and myself standing weak and languid on\r\nthe earth, it behoveth thee not to slay me now. Neither Vasudeva, nor\r\nthou, O son of Pandu, inspirest me with the slightest fear. Thou art born\r\nin the Kshatriya order. Thou art the perpetuator of a high race.\r\nRecollecting the teachings of righteousness, excuse me for a moment, O\r\nson of Pandu!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n91\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Vasudeva, stationed on the car, addressed Karna,\r\nsaying, \"By good luck it is, O son of Radha, that thou rememberest\r\nvirtue! It is generally seen that they that are mean, when they sink into\r\ndistress, rail at Providence but never at their own misdeeds. Thyself and\r\nSuyodhana and Duhshasana and Shakuni, the son of Subala, had caused\r\nDraupadi, clad in a single piece of raiment, to be brought into the midst\r\nof the assembly. On that occasion, O Karna, this virtue of thine did not\r\nmanifest itself. When at the assembly Shakuni, an adept in dice,\r\nvanquished Kunti's son Yudhishthira who was unacquainted with it, whither\r\nhad this virtue of thine gone? When the Kuru king (Duryodhana), acting\r\nunder thy counsels, treated Bhimasena in that way with the aid of snakes\r\nand poisoned food, whither had this virtue of thine then gone? When the\r\nperiod of exile into the woods was over as also the thirteenth year, thou\r\ndidst not make over to the Pandavas their kingdom. Whither had this\r\nvirtue of thine then gone? Thou didst set fire to the house of lac at\r\nVaranavata for burning to death the sleeping Pandavas. Whither then, O\r\nson of Radha, had this virtue of thine gone? Thou laughedest at Krishna\r\nwhile she stood in the midst of the assembly, scantily dressed because in\r\nher season and obedient to Duhshasana's will, whither, then, O Karna, had\r\nthis virtue of thine gone? When from the apartment reserved for the\r\nfemales innocent Krishna was dragged, thou didst not interfere. Whither,\r\nO son of Radha, had this virtue of thine gone? Thyself addressing the\r\nprincess Draupadi, that lady whose tread is as dignified as that of the\r\nelephant, in these words, viz., 'The Pandavas, O Krishna, are lost. They\r\nhave sunk into eternal hell. Do thou choose another husband!' thou\r\nlookedest on the scene with delight. Whither then, O Karna, had this\r\nvirtue of thine gone? Covetous of kingdom and relying on the ruler of the\r\nGandharvas, thou summonedest the Pandavas (to a match of dice). Whither\r\nthen had this virtue of thine gone? When many mighty car-warriors,\r\nencompassing the boy Abhimanyu in battle, slew him, whither had this\r\nvirtue of thine then gone? If this virtue that thou now invokest was\r\nnowhere on those occasions, what is the use then of parching thy palate\r\nnow, by uttering that word? Thou art now for the practice of virtue, O\r\nSuta, but thou shalt not escape with life. Like Nala who was defeated by\r\nPushkara with the aid of dice but who regained his kingdom by prowess,\r\nthe Pandavas, who are free from cupidity, will recover their kingdom by\r\nthe prowess of their arms, aided with all their friends. Having slain in\r\nbattle their powerful foes, they, with the Somakas, will recover their\r\nkingdom. The Dhartarashtras will meet with destruction at the hands of\r\nthose lions among men (viz., the sons of Pandu), that are always\r\nprotected by virtue!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, O Bharata, by Vasudeva, Karna hung\r\ndown his head in shame and gave no answer. With lips quivering in rage,\r\nhe raised his bow, O Bharata, and, being endued with great energy and\r\nprowess, he continued to fight with Partha. Then Vasudeva, addressing\r\nPhalguna, that bull among men, said, \"O thou of great might, piercing\r\nKarna with a celestial weapon, throw him down.\" Thus addressed by the\r\nholy one, Arjuna became filled with rage. Indeed, remembering the\r\nincidents alluded to by Krishna, Dhananjaya blazed up with fury. Then, O\r\nking, blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate from all the pores of the\r\nangry Partha's body. The sight seemed to be exceedingly wonderful.\r\nBeholding it, Karna, invoking the brahmastra, showered his shafts upon\r\nDhananjaya, and once more made an effort to extricate his car. Partha\r\nalso, by the aid of the brahmastra, poured arrowy downpours upon Karna.\r\nBaffling with his own weapon the weapon of his foe, the son of Pandu\r\ncontinued to strike him. The son of Kunti then, aiming at Karna sped\r\nanother favourite weapon of his that was inspired with the energy of\r\nAgni. Sped by Arjuna, that weapon blazed up with its own energy. Karna,\r\nhowever, quenched that conflagration with the Varuna weapon. The Suta's\r\nson also, by the clouds he created, caused all the points of the compass\r\nto be shrouded with a darkness such as may be seen on a rainy day. The\r\nson of Pandu, endued with great energy, fearlessly dispelled those clouds\r\nby means of the Vayavya weapon in the very sight of Karna. The Suta's son\r\nthen, for slaying the son of Pandu, took up a terrible arrow blazing like\r\nfire. When that adored shaft was fixed on the bow-string, the earth, O\r\nking, trembled with her mountains and waters and forests. Violent winds\r\nbegan to blow, bearing hard pebbles. All the points of the compass became\r\nenveloped with dust. Wails of grief, O Bharata, arose among the gods in\r\nthe welkin. Beholding that shaft aimed by the Suta's son, O sire, the\r\nPandavas, with cheerless hearts, gave themselves up to great sorrow. That\r\nshaft of keen point and endued with the effulgence of Sakra's thunder,\r\nsped from Karna's arms, fell upon Dhananjaya's chest and penetrated it\r\nlike a mighty snake penetrating an ant-hill. That grinder of foes, viz.,\r\nthe high-souled Vibhatsu, thus deeply pierced in that encounter, began to\r\nreel. His grasp became loosened, at which his bow Gandiva dropped from\r\nhis hand. He trembled like the prince of mountains in an earthquake.\r\nAvailing himself of that opportunity, the mighty car-warrior Vrisha,\r\ndesirous of extricating his car-wheel that had been swallowed up by the\r\nearth, jumped down from his vehicle. Seizing the wheel with his two arms\r\nhe endeavoured to drag it up, but though possessed of great strength, he\r\nfailed in his efforts, as destiny would have it. Meanwhile the\r\ndiadem-decked and high-souled Arjuna, recovering his senses, took up a\r\nshaft, fatal as the rod of Death, and called anjalika. Then Vasudeva,\r\naddressing Partha, said, \"Cut off with thy arrow the head of this enemy\r\nof thine, viz., Vrisha, before he succeeds in getting upon his car.\"\r\nApplauding those words of the lord Vasudeva, and while the wheel of his\r\nenemy was still sunk, the mighty car-warrior Arjuna took up a\r\nrazor-headed arrow of blazing effulgence and struck the standard (of\r\nKarna) bearing the elephant's rope and bright as the spotless sun. That\r\nstandard bearing the device of the costly elephant's rope, was adorned\r\nwith gold and pearls and gems and diamonds, and forged with care by\r\nforemost of artists excelling in knowledge, and possessed of great\r\nbeauty, and variegated with pure gold. That standard always used to fill\r\nthy troops with high courage and the enemy with fear. Its form commanded\r\napplause. Celebrated over the whole world, it resembled the sun in\r\nsplendour. Indeed, its effulgence was like that of fire or the sun or the\r\nmoon. The diadem-decked Arjuna, with that razor-headed shaft, exceedingly\r\nsharp, equipped with wings of gold, possessed of the splendour of fire\r\nwhen fed with libations of clarified butter, and blazing with beauty, cut\r\noff that standard of Adhiratha's son, that great car-warrior. With that\r\nstandard, as it fell, the fame, pride, hope of victory, and everything\r\ndear, as also the hearts of the Kurus, fell, and loud wails of \"Oh!\" and\r\n\"Alas!\" arose (from the Kuru army). Beholding that standard cut off and\r\nthrown down by that hero of Kuru's race possessed of great lightness of\r\nhand, thy troops, O Bharata, were no longer hopeful of Karna's victory.\r\nHastening then for Karna's destruction, Partha took out from his quiver\r\nan excellent Anjalika weapon that resembled the thunder of Indra or the\r\nrod of fire and that was possessed of the effulgence of the\r\nthousand-rayed Sun. Capable of penetrating the very vitals, besmeared\r\nwith blood and flesh, resembling fire or the sun, made of costly\r\nmaterials, destructive of men, steeds, and elephants, of straight course\r\nand fierce impetuosity, it measured three cubits and six feet. Endued\r\nwith the force of the thousand-eyed Indra's thunder, irresistible as\r\nRakshasas in the night, resembling Pinaka or Narayana's discus, it was\r\nexceedingly terrible and destructive of all living creatures. Partha\r\ncheerfully took up that great weapon, in the shape of an arrow, which\r\ncould not be resisted by the very gods, that high-souled being which was\r\nalways adored by the son of Pandu, and which was capable of vanquishing\r\nthe very gods and the Asuras. Beholding that shaft grasped by Partha in\r\nthat battle, the entire universe shook with its mobile and immobile\r\ncreatures. Indeed, seeing that weapon raised (for being sped) in that\r\ndreadful battle, the Rishis loudly cried out, \"Peace be to the universe!\"\r\nThe wielder of Gandiva then fixed on his bow that unrivalled arrow,\r\nuniting it with a high and mighty weapon. Drawing his bow Gandiva, he\r\nquickly said, \"Let this shaft of mine be like a mighty weapon capable of\r\nquickly destroying the body and heart of my enemy, if I have ever\r\npractised ascetic austerities, gratified my superiors, and listened to\r\nthe counsels of well-wishers. Let this shaft, worshipped by me and\r\npossessed of great sharpness, slay my enemy Karna by that Truth.\" Having\r\nsaid these words Dhananjaya let off that terrible shaft for the\r\ndestruction of Karna, that arrow fierce and efficacious as a rite\r\nprescribed in the Atharvan of Angiras, blazing with effulgence, and\r\nincapable of being endured by Death himself in battle. And the\r\ndiadem-decked Partha, desirous of slaying Karna, with great cheerfulness,\r\nsaid, \"Let this shaft conduce to my victory. Shot by me, let this arrow\r\npossessed of the splendour of fire or the sun take Karna to the presence\r\nof Yama.\" Saying these words, Arjuna, decked with diadem and garlands,\r\ncherishing feelings of hostility towards Karna and desirous of slaying\r\nhim, cheerfully struck his foe with that foremost of shafts which was\r\npossessed of the splendour of the sun or the moon and capable of\r\nbestowing victory. Thus sped by that mighty warrior, that shaft endued\r\nwith the energy of the sun caused all the points of the compass to blaze\r\nup with light. With that weapon Arjuna struck off his enemy's head like\r\nIndra striking off the head of Vritra with his thunder. Indeed, O king,\r\nwith that excellent Anjalika weapon inspired with mantras into a mighty\r\nweapon, the son of Indra cut off the head of Vaikartana in the afternoon.\r\nThus cut off with that Anjalika, the trunk of Karna fell down on the\r\nearth. The head also of that commander of the (Kaurava) army, endued with\r\nsplendour equal to that of the risen sun and resembling the meridian sun\r\nof autumn, fell down on the earth like the sun of bloody disc dropped\r\ndown from the Asta hills. Indeed, that head abandoned with great\r\nunwillingness the body, exceedingly beautiful and always nursed in\r\nluxury, of Karna of noble deeds, like an owner abandoning with great\r\nunwillingness his commodious mansion filled with great wealth. Cut off\r\nwith Arjuna's arrow, and deprived of life, the tall trunk of Karna endued\r\nwith great splendour, with blood issuing from every wound, fell down like\r\nthe thunder-riven summit of a mountain of red chalk with crimson streams\r\nrunning down its sides after a shower. Then from that body of the fallen\r\nKarna a light passing through the welkin penetrated the sun. This\r\nwonderful sight, O king, was beheld by the human warriors after the fall\r\nof Karna. Then the Pandavas, beholding Karna slain by Phalguna, loudly\r\nblew their conchs. Similarly, Krishna and Dhananjaya also, filled with\r\ndelight, and losing no time, blew their conchs. The Somakas beholding\r\nKarna slain and lying on the field, were filled with joy and uttered loud\r\nshouts with the other troops (of the Pandava army). In great delight they\r\nblew their trumpets and waved their arms and garments. All the warriors,\r\nO king, approaching Partha, began to applaud him joyfully. Others,\r\npossessed of might, danced, embracing each other, and uttering loud\r\nshouts, said, \"By good luck, Karna hath been stretched on the earth and\r\nmangled with arrows.\" Indeed, the severed head of Karna looked beautiful\r\nlike a mountain summit loosened by a tempest, or a quenched fire after\r\nthe sacrifice is over, or the image of the sun after it has reached the\r\nAsta hills. The Karna-sun, with arrows for its rays, after having\r\nscorched the hostile army, was at last caused to be set by the mighty\r\nArjuna-time. As the Sun, while proceeding towards the Asta hills, retires\r\ntaking away with him all his rays, even so that shaft (of Arjuna) passed\r\nout, taking with it Karna's life breaths. The death hour of the Suta's\r\nson, O sire, was the afternoon of that day. Cut off with the Anjalika\r\nweapon in that battle, the head of Karna fell down along with his body.\r\nIndeed, that arrow of Arjuna, in the very sight of the Kaurava troops,\r\nquickly took away the head and the body of Karna. Beholding the heroic\r\nKarna thrown down stretched on the earth, pierced with arrows and bathed\r\nin blood, the king of the Madras, went away on that car deprived of its\r\nstandard. After the fall of Karna, the Kauravas, deeply pierced with\r\nshafts in that battle, and afflicted with fear, fled away from the field,\r\nfrequently casting their eyes on that lofty standard of Arjuna that\r\nblazed with splendour. The beautiful head, graced with a face that\r\nresembled a lotus of a 1,000 petals, of Karna whose feats were like those\r\nof the thousand-eyed Indra, fell down on the earth like the\r\nthousand-rayed sun as he looks at the close of day.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n92\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the troops crushed with arrows in that\r\nencounter between Karna and Arjuna, Shalya proceeded, filled with wrath,\r\non that car divested of equipment. Beholding his army deprived of the\r\nSuta's son and its cars and steeds and elephants destroyed, Duryodhana,\r\nwith eyes bathed in tears, repeatedly sighed the very picture of woe.\r\nDesirous of beholding the heroic Karna, pierced with arrows and bathed in\r\nblood, and stretched on the earth like the sun dropped from the skies at\r\nwill, the warriors came there and stood surrounding the fallen hero.\r\nAmongst those belonging to the enemy and thy army that thus stood there,\r\nsome showed signs of joy, some of fear, some of sorrow, some of wonder,\r\nand some gave themselves up to great grief, according to their respective\r\nnatures. Others amongst the Kauravas, hearing that Karna of mighty energy\r\nhad been slain by Dhananjaya, his armour, ornaments, robes, and weapons\r\nhaving all been displaced, fled in fear like a herd of kine afflicted\r\nwith exceeding fear at losing its bull. Bhima then, uttering loud roars\r\nand causing the welkin to tremble with those awful and tremendous shouts,\r\nbegan to slap his armpits, jump, and dance, frightening the\r\nDhartarashtras by those movements. The Somakas and the Srinjayas also\r\nloudly blew their conchs. All the Kshatriyas embraced one another in joy,\r\nupon beholding the Suta's son slain at that juncture. Having fought a\r\ndreadful battle, Karna was slain by Arjuna like an elephant by a lion.\r\nThat bull among men, Arjuna, thus accomplished his vow. Indeed even thus,\r\nPartha reached the end of his hostility (towards Karna). The ruler of the\r\nMadras, with stupefied heart, quickly proceeding, O king, to the side of\r\nDuryodhana, on that car divested of standard said in sorrow these words,\r\n\"The elephants, the steeds, and the foremost of car-warriors of thy army\r\nhave been slain. In consequence of those mighty warriors, and steeds, and\r\nelephants huge as hills, having been slain after coming into contact with\r\none another, thy host looks like the domains of Yama. Never before, O\r\nBharata, has a battle been fought like that between Karna and Arjuna\r\ntoday. Karna had powerfully assailed the two Krishnas today and all\r\nothers who are thy foes. Destiny, however, has certainly flowed,\r\ncontrolled by Partha. It is for this that Destiny is protecting the\r\nPandavas and weakening us. Many are the heroes who, resolved to\r\naccomplish thy objects have been forcibly slain by the enemy. Brave\r\nkings, who in energy, courage, and might, were equal to Kuvera or Yama or\r\nVasava or the Lord of the waters, who were possessed of every merit, who\r\nwere almost unslayable, and who were desirous of achieving thy object,\r\nhave in battle been slain by the Pandavas. Do not, O Bharata, grieve for\r\nthis. This is Destiny. Comfort thyself. Success cannot be always\r\nattained.\" Hearing these words of the ruler of the Madras and reflecting\r\non his own evil doings. Duryodhana, with a cheerless heart, became almost\r\ndeprived of his senses and sighed repeatedly the very picture of woe.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n93\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'What was the aspect of the Kuru and the Srinjaya\r\nhost on that awful day while it was crushed with arrows and scorched\r\n(with weapons) in that encounter between Karna and Arjuna and while it\r\nwas flying away from the field?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with attention how that awful and great\r\ncarnage of human beings and elephants and steeds occurred in battle.\r\nWhen, after Karna's fall Partha uttered leonine shouts, a great fright\r\nentered the hearts of thy sons. Upon the fall of Karna no warrior of thy\r\narmy set his heart on rallying the troops or putting forth his prowess.\r\nTheir refuge having been destroyed by Arjuna, they were then like\r\nraftless merchants, whose vessels have wrecked on the fathomless ocean,\r\ndesirous of crossing the uncrossable main. After the slaughter of the\r\nSuta's son, O king, the Kauravas, terrified and mangled with shafts,\r\nmasterless and desirous of protection, became like a herd of elephants\r\nafflicted by lions. Vanquished by Savyasaci on that afternoon, they fled\r\naway like bulls with broken horns or snakes with broken fangs. Their\r\nforemost of heroes slain, their troops thrown into confusion, themselves\r\nmangled with keen arrows, thy sons, after the fall of Karna, O king, fled\r\naway in fear. Divested of weapons and armour, no longer able to ascertain\r\nwhich point of the compass was which, and deprived of their senses, they\r\ncrushed one another in course of their flight and looked at one another,\r\nafflicted with fear. \"It is me that Vibhatsu is pursuing with speed!\" \"It\r\nis me that Vrikodara is pursuing with speed!\"--thought every one among\r\nthe Kauravas who became pale with fear and fell down as they fled. Some\r\non horses, some on cars, some on elephants, and some on foot, mighty\r\ncar-warriors, endued with great speed, fled away in fear. Cars were\r\nbroken by elephants, horsemen were crushed by great car-warriors, and\r\nbands of foot-soldiers were trodden down by bodies of horsemen, as these\r\nfled in fear. After the fall of the Suta's son, thy warriors became like\r\npeople without protectors in a forest teeming with beasts of prey and\r\nrobbers. They were then like elephants without riders and men without\r\narms. Afflicted with fear, they looked upon the world as if it were full\r\nof Partha. Beholding them fly away afflicted with the fear of Bhimasena,\r\nindeed, and seeing his troops thus leave the field in thousands,\r\nDuryodhana, uttering cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" addressed his driver,\r\nsaying, \"Partha will never be able to transgress me standing bow in hand.\r\nUrge my steeds slowly behind all the troops. Without doubt, if I fight\r\nstanding in the rear of the army, the son of Kunti will never be able to\r\ntransgress me even as the vast deep is unable to transgress its\r\ncontinents. Slaying Arjuna and Govinda and the proud Vrikodara and the\r\nrest of my foes, I will free myself from the debt I owe to Karna.\"\r\nHearing these words of the Kuru king that were so worthy of a hero and\r\nhonourable man, the charioteer slowly urged his steeds adorned with\r\ntrappings of gold. Then 25,000 warriors on foot, belonging to thy army,\r\nwithout cars and cavalry and elephants among them, prepared for battle.\r\nBhimasena, filled with wrath, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata,\r\nencompassed them with four kinds of forces and began to strike them with\r\ntheir shafts. In return, those warriors fought with Bhima and Prishata's\r\nson. Some amongst them challenged the two heroes by name. Then Bhimasena\r\nbecame filled with rage. Alighting from his car, mace in hand, he fought\r\nwith those warriors arrived for battle. Observant of the rules of fair\r\nfight, Vrikodara, the son of Kunti, came down from his car, and relying\r\nupon the might of his arms, began to fight on foot with those foes of his\r\nthat were on foot. Taking up his massive mace adorned with gold, he began\r\nto slaughter them all, like the Destroyer armed with his bludgeon. The\r\nKaurava warriors on foot, filled with rage and becoming reckless of their\r\nlives, rushed against Bhima in that battle like insects upon a blazing\r\nfire. Those infuriated combatants, difficult of being defeated in battle,\r\napproaching Bhimasena, perished in a trice like living creatures upon\r\nseeing the Destroyer. The mighty Bhima, armed with a mace, careered like\r\na hawk and destroyed all those 25,000 combatants. Having slain that\r\ndivision of heroic warriors, Bhima, of prowess incapable of being baffled\r\nand of great might, once more stood, with Dhrishtadyumna before him.\r\nPossessed of great energy, Dhananjaya proceeded against the (remnant of\r\nthe) car-force (of the Kauravas). The two sons of Madri, and Satyaki,\r\nfilled with joy, rushed with speed against Shakuni and slaughtered the\r\ntroops of Subala's son. Having slain with keen shafts his cavalry and\r\nelephants in that encounter, they rushed impetuously against Shakuni\r\nhimself, upon which a great battle took place. Meanwhile Dhananjaya, O\r\nlord, proceeding against thy car-force, twanged his bow Gandiva\r\ncelebrated over the three worlds. Beholding that car having white steeds\r\nyoked unto it and owning Krishna for its driver, and seeing that Arjuna\r\nwas the warrior standing on it, thy troops fled away in fear. 25,000\r\nsoldiers on foot, deprived of cars and mangled with shafts, had perished\r\n(at the hands of Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna). Having slain them, that tiger\r\namong men, that great car-warrior among the Pancalas, viz., the\r\nhigh-souled Dhrishtadyumna the son of the Pancala king, soon showed\r\nhimself, with Bhimasena before him. That slayer of foes and mighty bowman\r\nappeared exceedingly handsome. Beholding Dhrishtadyumna's car which had\r\nsteeds white as pigeons yoked unto it and whose lofty standard was made\r\nof the trunk of a Kovidara, the Kauravas fled away in great fear. The\r\ntwins (Nakula and Sahadeva) of great fame, and Satyaki, having pursued\r\nwith great speed the king of the Gandharvas who was possessed of\r\nlightness of hands in the use of weapons, re-appeared (amid the Pandava\r\nranks). Chekitana and Shikhandi and the (five) sons of Draupadi, O sire,\r\nhaving slaughtered thy vast army, blew their conchs. All those heroes,\r\nalthough they saw thy troops flying away with faces turned from the\r\nfield, still pursued them, like bulls pursuing angry bulls after\r\nvanquishing them. Pandu's son Savyasaci of great might, O king, beholding\r\na remnant of thy army still standing for battle, became filled with\r\nwrath. Possessed of great energy, Dhananjaya, rushed against that\r\ncar-force, drawing his bow Gandiva celebrated over the three worlds.\r\nSuddenly he shrouded them with showers of arrows. The dust that was\r\nraised darkened the scene and nothing could any longer be distinguished.\r\nWhen the earth was thus shrouded with dust and when darkness covered\r\neverything, thy troops, O king, fled on all sides from fear. When the\r\nKuru army was thus broken, the Kuru king, O monarch, viz., thy son,\r\nrushed against all his foes advancing against him. Then Duryodhana\r\nchallenged all the Pandavas to battle, O chief of Bharata's race, like\r\nthe Asura Vali in days of yore challenging the gods. At this, all the\r\nPandava heroes, uniting together, rushed against the advancing\r\nDuryodhana, shooting and hurling at him diverse weapons and upbraiding\r\nhim repeatedly. Duryodhana, however, filled with rage, fearlessly\r\nslaughtered those enemies of his in hundreds and thousands, with keen\r\nshafts. The prowess that we then beheld of thy son was exceedingly\r\nwonderful, for alone and unsupported, he fought with all the Pandavas\r\nunited together. Duryodhana then beheld his own troops who, mangled with\r\narrows, had set their hearts on flight, gone not far from the field.\r\nRallying them then, O monarch, thy son who was resolved to maintain his\r\nhonour, gladdening those warriors of his, said these words unto them: \"I\r\ndo not see that spot in the earth or on the mountains, whither if ye fly,\r\nthe Pandavas will not slay you! What use then in flying away? Small is\r\nthe force that the Pandavas now have. The two Krishnas also are\r\nexceedingly mangled. If all of us stay for battle, victory will certainly\r\nbe ours. If we fly in disunion, the sinful Pandavas, pursuing us, will\r\ncertainly slay all of us. For this, it is better that we should die in\r\nbattle. Death in battle is fraught with happiness. Fight, observant of\r\nthe Kshatriya's duty. He that is dead knows no misery. On the other hand,\r\nsuch a one enjoys eternal bliss hereafter. Listen, ye Kshatriyas, ay, all\r\nof you, that are assembled here! When the destroyer Yama spareth neither\r\nthe hero nor the coward, who is there so foolish of understanding,\r\nalthough observant of a Kshatriya's vow like us, that would not fight.\r\nWould ye place yourselves under the power of the angry foe Bhimasena? It\r\nbehoveth you not to abandon the duty observed by your sires and\r\ngrandsires. There is no greater sin for a Kshatriya than flight from\r\nbattle. There is no more blessed path for heaven, ye Kauravas, than the\r\nduty of battle. Slain in battle, ye warriors, enjoy heaven without\r\ndelay.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'While even these words were being uttered by thy\r\nson, the (Kaurava) warriors, exceedingly mangled, fled away on all sides,\r\nregardless of that speech.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'The ruler of the Madras then, beholding thy son employed\r\nin rallying the troops, with fear depicted on his countenance and with\r\nheart stupefied with grief, said these words unto Duryodhana.\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Behold this awful field of battle, O hero, covered with\r\nheaps of slain men and steeds and elephants. Some tracts are covered with\r\nfallen elephants huge as mountains, exceedingly mangled, their vital\r\nlimbs pierced with shafts, lying helplessly, deprived of life, their\r\narmour displaced and the weapons, the shields and the swords with which\r\nthey were equipped lying scattered about. These fallen animals resemble\r\nhuge mountains riven with thunder, with their rocks and lofty trees and\r\nherbs loosened from them and lying all around. The bells and iron hooks\r\nand lances and standards with which those huge creatures had been\r\nequipped are lying on the ground. Adorned with housings of gold, their\r\nbodies are now bathed in blood. Some tracts, again, are covered with\r\nfallen steeds, mangled with shafts, breathing hard in pain and vomitting\r\nblood. Some of them are sending forth soft wails of pain, some are biting\r\nthe earth with rolling eyes and some are uttering piteous neighs.\r\nPortions of the field are covered with horsemen and elephant-warriors\r\nfallen off from their animals, and with bands of car-warriors forcibly\r\nthrown down from their cars. Some of them are already dead and some are\r\nat the point of death. Covered also with the corpses of men and steeds\r\nand elephants as also with crushed cars and other huge elephants with\r\ntheir trunks and limbs cut off, the earth has become awful to look at\r\nlike the great Vaitarani (skirting the domains of Yama). Indeed, the\r\nearth looketh even such, being strewn with other elephants, stretched on\r\nthe ground with trembling bodies and broken tusks, vomiting blood,\r\nuttering soft cries in pain, deprived of the warriors on their backs,\r\ndivested of the armour that covered their limbs, and reft of the\r\nfoot-soldiers that protected their flank and rear, and with their quivers\r\nand banners and standards displaced, their bodies adorned with housings\r\nof gold struck deep with the weapons of the foe. The earth looked like\r\nthe cloud-covered welkin in consequence of being strewn with the fallen\r\nbodies of elephant-warriors and horse-men and carwarriors, all of great\r\nfame, and of foot-soldiers slain by foes fighting face to face, and\r\ndivested of armour and ornaments and attire and weapons. Covered with\r\nthousands of fallen combatants mangled with arrows, fully exposed to\r\nview, and deprived of consciousness, with some amongst them whose breaths\r\nwere returning slowly, the earth seemed as if covered with many\r\nextinguished fires. With those foremost of heroes among both the Kurus\r\nand the Srinjayas, pierced with arrows and deprived of life by Partha and\r\nKarna, the earth seemed as if strewn with blazing planets fallen from the\r\nfirmament, or like the nocturnal firmament itself bespangled with blazing\r\nplanets of serene light. The shafts sped from the arms of Karna and\r\nArjuna, piercing through the bodies of elephants and steeds and men and\r\nquickly stilling their lives, entered the earth like mighty snakes\r\nentering their holes with heads bent downwards. The earth has become\r\nimpassable with heaps of slain men and steeds and elephants, and with\r\ncars broken with the shafts of Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son and with\r\nthe numberless shafts themselves shot by them. Strewn with well-equipped\r\ncars crushed by means of mighty shafts along with the warriors and the\r\nweapons and the standards upon them, cars, that is, with their traces\r\nbroken, their joints separated, their axles and yokes and Trivenus\r\nreduced to fragments, their wheels loosened, their Upaskaras destroyed,\r\ntheir Anukarsanas cut in pieces, the fastenings of their quivers cut off,\r\nand their niches (for the accommodation of drivers) broken, strewn with\r\nthose vehicles adorned with gems and gold, the earth looks like the\r\nfirmament overspread with autumnal clouds. In consequence of\r\nwell-equipped royal cars deprived of riders and dragged by fleet steeds,\r\nas also of men and elephants and cars and horses that fled very quickly,\r\nthe army has been broken in diverse ways. Spiked maces with golden bells,\r\nbattle-axes, sharp lances, heavy clubs, mallets, bright unsheathed\r\nswords, and maces covered with cloth of gold, have fallen on the field.\r\nBows decked with ornaments of gold, and shafts equipped with beautiful\r\nwings of pure gold, and bright unsheathed rapiers of excellent temper,\r\nand lances, and scimitars bright as gold, and umbrellas, and fans, and\r\nconchs, and arms decked with excellent flowers and gold, and caparisons\r\nof elephants, and standards, and car fences and diadems, and necklaces,\r\nand brilliant crowns, and yak-tails lying about, O king, and garlands\r\nluminous with corals and pearls, and chaplets for the head, and bracelets\r\nfor both the wrist and the upper arms, and collars for the neck with\r\nstrings of gold, and diverse kinds of costly diamonds and gems and\r\npearls, and bodies brought up in a great luxury, and heads beautiful as\r\nthe moon, are lying scattered about. Abandoning their bodies and\r\nenjoyments and robes and diverse kinds of agreeable pleasures, and\r\nacquiring great merit for the devotion they showed to the virtuous of\r\ntheir order, they have speedily gone in a blaze of flame to regions of\r\nbliss. Turn back, O Duryodhana! Let the troops retire! O king, O giver of\r\nhonours, proceed towards thy camp! There, the Sun is hanging low in the\r\nwelkin, O lord! Remember, O ruler of men, that thou art the cause of all\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Having said these words unto Duryodhana, Shalya, with heart filled with\r\ngrief, stopped. Duryodhana, however, at that time, deeply afflicted and\r\ndeprived of his senses, and with eyes bathed in tears, wept for the\r\nSuta's son, saying, \"Karna! Oh Karna!\" Then all the kings headed by\r\nDrona's son, repeatedly comforting Duryodhana, proceeded towards the\r\ncamp, frequently looking back at the lofty standard of Arjuna that seemed\r\nto be ablaze with his fame. At that terrible hour when everything around\r\nlooked so resplendent, the Kauravas, all of whom had resolved to repair\r\nto the other world, their features incapable of recognition owing to the\r\nblood that covered them, beholding the earth, that was drenched with the\r\nblood flowing from the bodies of men and steeds and elephants, looking\r\nlike a courtesan attired in crimson robes and floral garlands and\r\nornaments of gold, were unable, O king, to stand there! Filled with grief\r\nat the slaughter of Karna, they indulged in loud lamentations, saying,\r\n\"Alas, Karna! Alas Karna!\" Beholding the Sun assume a crimson hue, all of\r\nthem speedily proceeded towards their camp. As regards Karna, though\r\nslain and pierced with gold-winged shafts whetted on stone and equipped\r\nwith feathers and dyed in blood and sped from gandiva, yet that hero,\r\nlying on the ground, looked resplendent like the Sun himself of bright\r\nrays. It seemed that illustrious Surya, ever kind to his worshippers,\r\nhaving touched with his rays the gore-drenched body of Karna, proceeded,\r\nwith aspect crimson in grief, to the other ocean from desire of a bath.\r\nThinking so, the throngs of celestials and rishis (that had come there\r\nfor witnessing the battle) left the scene for proceeding to their\r\nrespective abodes. The large crowd of other beings also, entertaining the\r\nsame thought, went away, repairing as they chose to heaven or the earth.\r\nThe foremost of Kuru heroes also, having beheld that wonderful battle\r\nbetween Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, which had inspired all living\r\ncreatures with dread, proceeded (to their nightly quarters), filled with\r\nwonder and applauding (the encounter). Though his armour had been cut off\r\nwith arrows, and though he had been slain in course of that dreadful\r\nfight, still that beauty of features which the son of Radha possessed did\r\nnot abandon him when dead. Indeed, everyone beheld the body of the hero\r\nto resemble heated gold. It seemed to be endued with life and possessed\r\nof the effulgence of fire or the sun. All the warriors, O king, were\r\ninspired with fright at sight of the Suta's son lying dead on the field,\r\nlike other animals at sight of the lion. Indeed, though dead, that tiger\r\namong men seemed ready to utter his commands. Nothing, in that\r\nillustrious dead, seemed changed. Clad in beautiful attire, and possessed\r\nof a neck that was very beautiful, the Suta's son owned a face which\r\nresembled the full moon in splendour. Adorned with diverse ornaments and\r\ndecked with Angadas made of bright gold, Vaikartana, though slain, lay\r\nstretched like a gigantic tree adorned with branches and twigs. Indeed,\r\nthat tiger among men lay like a heap of pure gold, or like a blazing fire\r\nextinguished with the water of Partha's shafts. Even as a blazing\r\nconflagration is extinguished when it comes in contact with water, the\r\nKarna-conflagration was extinguished by the Partha-cloud in the battle.\r\nHaving shot showers of arrows and scorched the ten points of the compass,\r\nthat tiger among men, viz., Karna, along with his sons, was quieted by\r\nPartha's energy. He left the world, taking away with him that blazing\r\nglory of his own which he had earned on earth by fair fight. Having\r\nscorched the Pandavas and the Pancalas with the energy of his weapons,\r\nhaving poured showers of arrows and burnt the hostile divisions, having,\r\nindeed, heated the universe like the thousand-rayed Surya of great\r\nbeauty, Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, left the world, with his sons\r\nand followers. Thus fell that hero who was a Kalpa tree unto those swarms\r\nof birds represented by suitors. Solicited by suitors he always said, \"I\r\ngive\" but never the words \"I have not!\" The righteous always regarded him\r\nas a righteous person. Even such was Vrisha who fell in single combat.\r\nAll the wealth of that high-souled person had been dedicated to the\r\nBrahmanas. There was nothing, not even his life, that he could not give\r\naway unto the Brahmanas. He was ever the favourite of ladies, exceedingly\r\nliberal, and a mighty car-warrior. Burnt by the weapons of Partha, he\r\nattained to the highest end. He, relying upon whom thy son had provoked\r\nhostilities, thus went to heaven, taking away with him the hope of\r\nvictory, the happiness, and the armour of the Kauravas. When Karna fell,\r\nthe rivers stood still. The Sun set with a pale hue. The planet Mercury,\r\nthe son of Soma, assuming the hue of fire or the Sun, appeared to course\r\nthrough the firmament in a slanting direction. The firmament seemed to be\r\nrent in twain; the earth uttered loud roars; violent and awful winds\r\nbegan to blow. All the points of the horizon, covered with smoke, seemed\r\nto be ablaze. The great oceans were agitated and uttered awful sounds.\r\nThe mountains with their forests began to tremble, and all creatures, O\r\nsire, felt pain. The planet Jupiter, afflicting the constellation Rohini\r\nassumed the hue of the moon or the sun. Upon the fall of Karna, the\r\nsubsidiary points also of the compass became ablaze. The sky became\r\nenveloped in darkness. The earth trembled. Meteors of blazing splendour\r\nfell. Rakshasas and other wanderers of the night became filled with joy.\r\nWhen Arjuna, with that razor-faced shaft, struck off Karna's head adorned\r\nwith a face beautiful as the moon, then, O king, loud cries of \"Oh!\" and\r\n\"Alas!\" were heard of creatures in heaven, in the welkin, and on the\r\nearth. Having in battle slain his foe Karna who was worshipped by the\r\ngods, the gandharvas, and human beings, Pritha's son Arjuna looked\r\nresplendent in his energy like the deity of a 1,000 eyes after the\r\nslaughter of Vritra. Then riding on that car of theirs whose rattle\r\nresembled the roar of the clouds and whose splendour was like that of the\r\nmeridian sun of the autumnal sky, which was adorned with banners and\r\nequipped with a standard incessantly producing an awful noise, whose\r\neffulgence resembled that of the snow or the Moon or the conch or the\r\ncrystal, and whose steeds were like those of Indra himself, those two\r\nforemost of men, viz., the son of Pandu and the crusher of Keshi, whose\r\nenergy resembled that of the great Indra, and who were adorned with gold\r\nand pearls and gems and diamonds and corals, and who were like fire or\r\nthe sun in splendour, fearlessly careered over the field of battle with\r\ngreat speed, like Vishnu and Vasava mounted on the same chariot. Forcibly\r\ndivesting the enemy of his splendour by means of the twang of gandiva and\r\nthe slaps of their palms, and slaying the Kurus with showers of shafts,\r\nthe Ape-bannered Arjuna, the Garuda-bannered Krishna, both of whom were\r\npossessed of immeasurable prowess, those two foremost of men, filled with\r\njoy, took up with their hands their loud-sounding conchs adorned with\r\ngold and white as snow, and placing them against their lips, blew\r\nsimultaneously with those beautiful mouths of theirs, piercing the hearts\r\nof their foes with the sound. The blare of pancajanya and that of\r\ndevadatta filled the earth, the sky, and heaven.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the heroic Madhava's conch as also at that of Arjuna's,\r\nall the Kauravas, O best of kings, became filled with fright. Those\r\nforemost of men, causing the forests, the mountains, the rivers and the\r\npoints of the compass to resound with the blare of their conchs, and\r\nfilling the army of thy son with fright, gladdened Yudhishthira\r\ntherewith. As soon as the Kauravas heard the blare of those conchs that\r\nwere thus being blown, all of them left the field with great speed,\r\ndeserting the ruler of the Madras and the chief of the Bharatas, O\r\nBharata, viz., Duryodhana. Then diverse creatures, uniting together,\r\ncongratulated Dhananjaya, that hero shining resplendent on the field of\r\nbattle, as also Janardana, those two foremost of men who then looked like\r\na couple of risen suns. Pierced with Karna's arrows, those two chastisers\r\nof foes, Acyuta and Arjuna, looked resplendent like the bright and\r\nmany-rayed moon and the sun risen after dispelling a gloom. Casting off\r\nthose arrows, those two mighty warriors, both endued with unrivalled\r\nprowess, surrounded by well-wishers and friends, happily entered their\r\nown encampment, like the lords Vasava and Vishnu duly invoked by\r\nsacrificial priests. Upon the slaughter of Karna in that dreadful battle,\r\nthe gods, gandharvas, human beings, caranas, great rishis, yakshas, and\r\ngreat nagas, worshipped Krishna and Arjuna with great respect and wished\r\nthem victory (in all things). Having received all their friends then,\r\neach according to his age, and applauded by those friends in return for\r\ntheir incomparable feats, the two heroes rejoiced with their friends,\r\nlike the chief of the celestials and Vishnu after the overthrow of Vali.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n95\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of Karna otherwise called Vaikartana, the\r\nKauravas, afflicted with fear, fled away on all sides, casting their eyes\r\non empty space. Indeed, hearing that the heroic Karna had been slain by\r\nthe foe, all thy troops, stupefied with fear, broke and fled in all\r\ndirections. Then, O king, the leaders, filled with anxiety, desirous of\r\nwithdrawing their troops, O Bharata, whose flight had been endeavoured to\r\nbe checked by thy son. Understanding their wishes, thy son, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, acting according to the advice of Shalya, withdrew the\r\narmy. Then Kritavarma, O Bharata, surrounded by thy unslaughtered remnant\r\nof thy Narayana troops of thy army, quickly proceeded towards the\r\nencampment. Surrounded by a 1,000 gandharvas, Shakuni, beholding the son\r\nof Adhiratha slain, proceeded quickly towards the encampment.\r\nSharadvata's son, Kripa, O king, surrounded by the large elephant force\r\nthat resembled a mass of clouds, proceeded quickly towards the\r\nencampment. The heroic Ashvatthama, repeatedly drawing deep breaths at\r\nthe sight of the victory of the Pandavas, proceeded quickly towards the\r\nencampment. Surrounded by the unslaughtered remnant of the samsaptakas\r\nwhich was still a large force, Susharma also, O king, proceeded, casting\r\nhis eyes on those terrified soldiers. King Duryodhana, deeply afflicted\r\nand deprived of everything, proceeded, his heart filled with grief, and a\r\nprey to many cheerless thoughts. Shalya, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nproceeded towards the camp, on that car deprived of standard, casting his\r\neyes on all sides. The other mighty car-warriors of the Bharata army,\r\nstill numerous, fled quickly, afflicted with fear, filled with shame, and\r\nalmost deprived of their senses. Indeed seeing Karna overthrown, all the\r\nKauravas fled away quickly, afflicted and anxious with fear, trembling,\r\nand with voices choked with tears. The mighty car-warriors of thy army\r\nfled away in fear, O chief of Kuru's race, some applauding Arjuna, some\r\napplauding Karna. Amongst those thousands of warriors of thy army in that\r\ngreat battle, there was not a single person who had still any wish for\r\nfight. Upon the fall of Karna, O monarch, the Kauravas became hopeless of\r\nlife, kingdom, wives, and wealth. Guiding them with care, O lord, thy\r\nson, filled with grief and sorrow, set his heart upon resting them for\r\nthe night. Those great car-warriors also, O monarch, accepting his orders\r\nwith bent heads, retired from the field with cheerless hearts and pale\r\nfaces.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After Karna had thus been slain and the Kaurava troops\r\nhad fled away, he of Dasharha's race, embracing Partha from joy, said\r\nunto him these words: \"Vritra was slain by thee. Men will talk (in the\r\nsame breath) of the slaughter of Vritra and Karna in awful battle. Vritra\r\nwas slain in battle by the deity of great energy with his thunder. Karna\r\nhath been slain by thee with bow and sharp arrows. Go, O son of Kunti,\r\nand represent, O Bharata, unto king Yudhishthira the just, this prowess\r\nof thine that is capable of procuring thee great fame and that hath\r\nbecome well-known in the world. Having represented unto king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, this slaughter of Karna in battle for compassing which thou\r\nhadst been endeavouring for a long course of years, thou wilt be freed\r\nfrom the debt thou owest to the king. During the progress of the battle\r\nbetween thyself and Karna, the son of Dharma once came for beholding the\r\nfield. Having, however, been deeply and exceedingly pierced (with\r\narrows), he could not stay in battle. The king, that bull among men, then\r\nwent back to his tent.\" Partha answered Keshava, that bull of Yadu's\r\nrace, saying, \"So be it!' The latter then cheerfully caused the car of\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors to turn back. Having said these words unto\r\nArjuna, Krishna addressed the soldiers, saying, \"Blessed be ye, stand all\r\nof you carefully, facing the foe!\" Unto Dhrishtadyumna and Yudhamanyu and\r\nthe twin sons of Madri and Vrikodara and Yuyudhana, Govinda said, \"Ye\r\nkings, until we come back having informed the king of Karna's slaughter\r\nby Arjuna, stand ye here with care.\" Having received the permission of\r\nthese heroes, he then set out for the quarters of the king. With Partha\r\nin his company, Govinda beheld Yudhishthira, that tiger among kings,\r\nlying on an excellent bed of gold. Both of them then, with great joy,\r\ntouched the feet of the king. Beholding their joy and the extraordinary\r\nwounds on their bodies, Yudhishthira regarded the son of Radha to be dead\r\nand rose quickly from his bed. That chastiser of foes, the mighty-armed\r\nmonarch, having risen from his bed, repeatedly embraced Vasudeva and\r\nArjuna with affection. That descendant of Kuru's race then asked Vasudeva\r\n(the particulars of Karna's death). Then the sweet-speeched Vasudeva that\r\ndescendant of the Yadu race, spoke to him of Karna's death exactly as it\r\nhad happened. Smiling then, Krishna, otherwise called Acyuta, joined his\r\npalms and addressed king Yudhishthira whose foes had been killed saying,\r\n\"By good luck, the wielder of Gandiva, and Vrikodara, the son of Pandu,\r\nand thyself, and the two sons of Madri, are all safe, having been freed\r\nfrom this battle that has been so destructive of heroes and that made the\r\nvery hair of the body to stand on end. Do thou those acts, O son of\r\nPandu, which should next be done. The Suta's son Karna, possessed of\r\ngreat might and otherwise called Vaikartana, hath been slain. By good\r\nluck, victory hath become thine, O king of kings. By good luck, thou\r\ngrowest, O son of Pandu! The Earth drinketh today the blood of that\r\nSuta's son, that wretch among men, who had laughed at the dice-won\r\nKrishna. That foe of thine, O bull of Kuru's race, lieth today on the\r\nbare ground, pierced all over with arrows. Behold that tiger among men,\r\npierced and mangled with shafts. O thou of mighty arms, rule now, with\r\ncare, this earth that is divested of all thy foes, and enjoy with us, all\r\nkinds of enjoyable articles!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having heard these words of the high-souled Keshava,\r\nYudhishthira, with great joy, worshipped in return that hero of\r\nDasharha's race. \"Good luck, Good luck!\" were the words, O monarch, that\r\nhe said. And he added, \"It is not wonderful, O mighty-armed one, in thee,\r\nO son of Devaki, that Partha, having obtained thee for his charioteer,\r\nshould achieve feats that are even super-human.\" Then that chief of\r\nKuru's race, that righteous son of Pritha, taking hold of Keshava's right\r\narm adorned with Angadas, and addressing both Keshava and Arjuna, said,\r\n\"Narada told me that ye two are the gods Nara and Narayana, those ancient\r\nand best of Rishis, that are ever employed in the preservation of\r\nrighteousness. Gifted with great intelligence, the master Krishna\r\nDvaipayana, the highly blessed Vyasa, also hath repeatedly told me this\r\ncelestial history. Through thy influence, O Krishna, this Dhananjaya the\r\nson of Pandu, facing his foes, hath vanquished them, without ever turning\r\nback from any of them. Victory, and not defeat, we are certain to have,\r\nsince thou hast accepted the drivership of Partha in battle.\" Having said\r\nthese words, king Yudhishthira the just, that tiger among men, mounting\r\nhis car, adorned with gold and having steeds of ivory white and black\r\ntails and fleet as thought harnessed unto it, and surrounded by many\r\nPandava troops, set out, conversing pleasantly with Krishna and Arjuna\r\nalong the way, for beholding the field of battle on which thousands of\r\nincidents had taken place. Conversing with those two heroes, viz.,\r\nMadhava and Phalguna, the king beheld Karna, that bull among men, lying\r\non the field of battle. Indeed, king Yudhishthira beheld Karna pierced\r\nall over with arrows like a Kadamva flower with straight filaments all\r\naround its body. Yudhishthira beheld Karna illuminated by thousands of\r\ngolden lamps filled with perfumed oil. Having beheld Karna with his son\r\nslain and mangled with shafts sped from Gandiva, king Yudhishthira\r\nrepeatedly looked at him before he could believe his eyes. He then\r\napplauded those tigers among men, Madhava and Phalguna, saying, \"O\r\nGovinda, today I have become king of the earth, with my brothers, in\r\nconsequence of thyself of great wisdom having become my protector and\r\nlord. Hearing of the slaughter of that tiger among men, the proud son of\r\nRadha, the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra will be filled with\r\ndespair, as regards both life and kingdom. Through thy grace, O bull\r\namong men, we have acquired our objects. By good luck, victory hath been\r\nthine, O Govinda! By good luck, the enemy hath been slain. By good luck,\r\nthe wielder of Gandiva, the son of Pandu, hath been crowned with victory.\r\nThirteen years we have passed in wakefulness and great sorrow. O thou of\r\nmighty arms, through thy grace, we will sleep happily this night.\" In\r\nthis way, O ruler of men, king Yudhishthira the just, praised Janardana\r\ngreatly as also Arjuna, O monarch!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding Karna with his son slain with Partha's\r\nshafts, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, Yudhishthira, regarded himself\r\nas reborn. The kings (in the Pandava army), great car-warriors--all\r\nfilled with joy, approached Kunti's son Yudhishthira and gladdened him\r\ngreatly. Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Vrikodara the son of Pandu, and\r\nSatyaki, O king, that foremost of car-warriors among the Vrishnis, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and others among the Pandus, the Pancalas,\r\nand the Srinjayas, worshipped the son of Kunti at the slaughter of the\r\nSuta's son. Extolling king Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, those\r\ndelighters in battle, those effectual smiters, those heroes possessed of\r\nsureness of aim and longing for victory, also praised those scorchers of\r\nfoes, viz., the two Krishnas, with speeches fraught with panegyrics. Then\r\nthose great car-warriors, filled with delight, proceeded towards their\r\nown camp. Thus occurred that great carnage, making the hair stand on end,\r\nin consequence, O king, of thy evil policy! Why dost thou grieve for it\r\nnow?'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing those evil tidings, the Kuru king\r\nDhritarashtra suddenly fell down on the ground from his excellent seat.\r\nSimilarly, the royal lady Gandhari of great foresight fell down. She\r\nindulged in diverse lamentations, for the slaughter of Karna in battle.\r\nThen Vidura and Sanjaya both raised the fallen monarch and began to\r\nconsole him. Similarly the Kuru ladies raised Gandhari. Thinking destiny\r\nand necessity to be all powerful, that royal ascetic, under that great\r\ngrief, seemed to lose his senses. His heart filled with anxiety and\r\nsorrow, the king, however, did not again swoon away. Comforted by them,\r\nhe remained silent, indulging in melancholy musing. He that reads of this\r\ngreat battle, which is like unto a sacrifice, between the high-souled\r\nDhananjaya and Adhiratha's son, so also he that hears the account of this\r\nbattle read, both obtain, O Bharata, the fruit of a great sacrifice duly\r\nperformed. The learned say that the holy and the eternal Vishnu is\r\nSacrifice, and each of those other gods, viz., Agni, Wind, Soma, and\r\nSurya, is so. Therefore, he that will, without malice, hear or recite\r\nthis Parvan, will be happy and capable of attaining to every region of\r\nbliss. Filled with devotion, men always read this sacred and first of\r\nSamhitas. They that do, rejoice, obtaining wealth, and grain, and fame. A\r\nman must, therefore, ever hear it without malice. He that does so will\r\nobtain all kinds of happiness. With that foremost of persons, Vishnu, and\r\nthe illustrious Self-born, and Bhava also, become pleased. A Brahmana, by\r\nreading it, would obtain the fruit of having studied the Vedas; a\r\nKshatriya obtains strength and victory in battle; Vaishyas would obtain\r\nimmense wealth, and Shudras would obtain health and freedom from disease.\r\nThen again the illustrious Vishnu is eternal. And since it is that god\r\nwho hath been glorified in this Parvan, it is for this that the man\r\nreading or hearing it becometh happy and acquireth all the objects of his\r\nheart. These words of the great Rishi (Vyasa) can never the untrue! The\r\nmerit that may be attained by listening to the recitation of the Karna\r\nParvan is equal to his who giveth away unceasingly for a whole year good\r\ncows with calves.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of Karna Parv\r\n"
