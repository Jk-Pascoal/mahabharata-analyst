Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as\r\nalso to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \"Jaya\" be uttered.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"When the thirty-sixth year (after the battle) was\r\nreached, the delighter of the Kurus, Yudhishthira, beheld many unusual\r\nportents. Winds, dry and strong, and showering gravels, blew from every\r\nside. Birds began to wheel, making circles from right to left. The great\r\nrivers ran in opposite directions. The horizon on every side seemed to be\r\nalways covered with fog. Meteors, showering (blazing) coals, fell on the\r\nEarth from the sky. The Suns disc, O king, seemed to be always covered\r\nwith dust. At its rise, the great luminary of day was shorn of splendour\r\nand seemed to be crossed by headless trunks (of human beings). Fierce\r\ncircles of light were seen every day around both the Sun and the Moon.\r\nThese circles showed three hues. Their edges seemed to be black and rough\r\nand ashy-red in colour. These and many other omens, foreshadowing fear\r\nand danger, were seen, O king, and filled the hearts of men with anxiety.\r\nA little while after, the Kuru king Yudhishthira heard of the wholesale\r\ncarnage of the Vrishnis in consequence of the iron bolt. The son of\r\nPandu, hearing that only Vasudeva and Rama had escaped with life,\r\nsummoned his brothers and took counsel with them as to what they should\r\ndo. Meeting with one another, they became greatly distressed upon hearing\r\nthat the Vrishnis had met with destruction through the Brahmanas rod of\r\nchastisement. The death of Vasudeva, like the drying up of the ocean,\r\nthose heroes could not believe. In fact the destruction of the wielder of\r\nSaranga was incredible to them. Informed of the incident about the iron\r\nbolt, the Pandavas became filled with grief and sorrow. In fact, they sat\r\ndown, utterly cheerless and penetrated with blank despair.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said: \"Indeed, O holy one, how was it that the Andhakas along\r\nwith Vrishnis, and those great car-warriors, the Bhojas, met with\r\ndestruction in the very sight of Vasudeva?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"When the thirty-sixth year was reached (after\r\nthe great battle) a great calamity overtook the Vrishnis. Impelled by\r\nTime, they all met with destruction in consequence of the iron bolt.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said: \"Cursed by whom did those heroes, the Vrishnis, the\r\nAndhakas, and the Bhojas, met with destruction? O foremost regenerate\r\npersons, do thou tell me this in detail.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"One day, the Vrishni heroes numbering Sarana\r\namongst them, saw Vishvamitra and Kanwa and Narada arrived at Dwaraka.\r\nAfflicted by the rod of chastisement wielded by the deities, those\r\nheroes, causing Samva to be disguised like a woman, approached those\r\nascetics and said, This one is the wife of Vabhru of immeasurable energy\r\nwho is desirous of having a son. Ye Rishis, do you know for certain what\r\nthis one will bring forth?\r\n\r\n\"Hear now, O king, what those ascetics, attempted to be thus deceived,\r\nsaid: This heir of Vasudeva, by name Samva, will bring forth a fierce\r\niron bolt for the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. Ye wicked\r\nand cruel ones, intoxicated with pride, through that iron bolt ye will\r\nbecome the exterminators of your race with the exception of Rama and\r\nJanarddana. The blessed hero armed with the plough will enter the ocean,\r\ncasting off his body, while a hunter of the name of Jara will pierce the\r\nhigh-souled Krishna while lying on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Endeavoured to be deceived by those wicked ones, those ascetics, with\r\neyes red in wrath, looked at each other and uttered those words. Having\r\nsaid so they then proceeded to see Keshava. The slayer of Madhu, informed\r\nof what had taken place, summoned all the Vrishnis and told them of it.\r\nPossessed of great intelligence and fully acquainted with what the end of\r\nhis race would be, he simply said that that which was destined would\r\nsurely happen. Hrishikesa having said so, entered his mansion. The Lord\r\nof the universe did not wish to ordain otherwise. When the next day came,\r\nSamva actually brought forth an iron bolt through which all the\r\nindividuals in the race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas became consumed\r\ninto ashes. Indeed, for the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas,\r\nSamva brought forth, through that curse, a fierce iron bolt that looked\r\nlike a gigantic messenger of death. The fact was duly reported to the\r\nking. In great distress of mind, the king (Ugrasena) caused that iron\r\nbolt to be reduced into fine powder. Men were employed, O king, to cast\r\nthat powder into the sea. At the command of Ahuka, of Janarddana, of\r\nRama, and of the high-souled Vabhru, it was, again, proclaimed throughout\r\nthe city that from that day, among all the Vrishnis and the Andhakas no\r\none should manufacture wines and intoxicating spirits of any kind, and\r\nthat whoever would secretly manufacture wines and spirits should be\r\nimpaled alive with all his kinsmen. Through fear of the king, and knowing\r\nthat it was the command of Rama also of unimpeachable deeds, all the\r\ncitizens bound themselves by a rule and abstained from manufacturing\r\nwines and spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus\r\nendeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time\r\n(death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of\r\nterrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny\r\ncomplexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their\r\nhouses. The mighty bowmen among the Vrishnis shot hundreds and thousands\r\nof shafts at him, but none of these succeeded in piercing him, for he was\r\nnone else than the Destroyer of all creatures. Day by day strong winds\r\nblew, and many were the evil omens that arose, awful and foreboding the\r\ndestruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. The streets swarmed with\r\nrats and mice. Earthen pots showed cracks or broke from no apparent\r\ncause. At night, the rats and mice ate away the hair and nails of\r\nslumbering men. Sarikas chirped, sitting within the houses of the\r\nVrishnis. The noise made by those birds ceased not for even a short while\r\nby day or by night. The Sarashas were heard to imitate the hooting of the\r\nowl, and goats imitated the cries, O Bharata, of jackals. Many birds\r\nappeared, impelled by Death, that were pale of complexion but that had\r\nlegs red of hue. Pigeons were seen to always disport in the houses of the\r\nVrishnis. Asses were born of kine, and elephants of mules. Cats were born\r\nof bitches, and mouse of the mongoose. The Vrishnis, committing sinful\r\nacts, were not seen to feel any shame. They showed disregard for\r\nBrahmanas and the Pitris and the deities, They insulted and humiliated\r\ntheir preceptors and seniors. Only Rama and Janardana acted differently.\r\nWives deceived their husbands, and husbands deceived their wives. Fires,\r\nwhen ignited, cast their flames towards the left. Sometimes they threw\r\nout flames whose splendour was blue and red. The Sun, whether when rising\r\nor setting over the city, seemed to be surrounded by headless trunks of\r\nhuman form. In cook rooms, upon food that was clean and well-boiled, were\r\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\r\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\r\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\r\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\r\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\r\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\r\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\r\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\r\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\r\ndirection. \"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\r\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\r\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\r\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\r\nmade the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day had happened at the time\r\nof the great battle of the Bharatas. It has once more appeared, it seems,\r\nfor our destruction. \"The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, thinking upon the\r\nomens that Time showed, understood that the thirty-sixth year had come,\r\nand that what Gandhari, burning with grief on account of the death of her\r\nsons, and deprived of all her kinsmen, had said was about to transpire.\r\nThe present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at\r\nsuch awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.\r\nVasudeva, having said so, endeavoured to bring about those occurrences\r\nwhich would make Gandharis words true. That chastiser of foes commanded\r\nthe Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers\r\nforthwith proclaimed at the command of Keshava that the Vrishnis should\r\nmake a journey to the sea-coast for bathing in the sacred waters of the\r\nocean.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"At that time the Vrishni ladies dreamed every night\r\nthat a woman of black complexion and white teeth, entering their abodes,\r\nlaughed aloud and ran through Dvaraka, snatching from them the auspicious\r\nthreads in their wrists. The men dreamt that terrible vultures, entering\r\ntheir houses and fire-chambers, gorged themselves on their bodies. Their\r\nornaments and umbrellas and standards and armour were seen to be taken\r\naway by terrible Rakshasas. In the very sight of the Vrishnis, the discus\r\nof Krishna, given by Agni, made of iron and having its nave composed of\r\nhardest adamant, ascended into the firmament. In the very sight of\r\nDaruka, the excellent car of Vasudeva, of solar effulgence, and properly\r\nequipped, was taken away by the horses yoked unto it. Those foremost of\r\nsteeds, numbering four, (Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Valahaka), and\r\nendued with the speed of thought, fled away, dragging the car after them\r\nalong the surface of the ocean. The two great standards of Krishnas car\r\nand Valadevas car, that with the device of Garuda and that bearing the\r\ndevice of the palmyra, which were reverently worshipped by those two\r\nheroes, were taken away by Apsaras who, day and night, called upon the\r\nVrishnis and the Andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred\r\nwater. When these omens were seen and heard, those foremost of men, the\r\nmighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, became desirous of\r\nsetting out, with their whole families, on a pilgrimage to some sacred\r\nwater. They prepared diverse kinds of viands and edibles and diverse\r\nkinds of wines and meat. The troops of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas,\r\nblazing with beauty and endued with fierce energy, then set out from the\r\ncity on cars and steeds and elephants. The Yadavas, then, with their\r\nwives, proceeded to Prabhasa and took up their residence there, each in\r\nthe (temporary) habitation that was assigned to him, and all having an\r\nabundance of provisions consisting of edibles and drink.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing that they had taken up their abode on the sea-coast, Uddhava,\r\nthe wisest of men, who was, besides, well-versed in Yoga, proceeded there\r\nand took his leave (for departing). Krishna, with joined hands, saluted\r\nUddhava, and seeing him bent on departing (from the world) and knowing\r\nthat the destructions of the Vrishnis was at hand, did not feel any\r\ndisposition to prevent him. The mighty car-warriors among the Vrishnis\r\nand the Andhakas, whose hour had come, then saw Uddhava proceed on his\r\ngreat journey, filling the whole welkin with his splendour. The Vrishnis,\r\nmixing with wine the food that had been cooked for high-souled Brahmanas,\r\ngave it away unto monkeys and apes. Those heroes of fierce energy then\r\nbegan their high revels, of which drinking formed the chief feature, at\r\nPrabhasa. The entire field echoed with the blare of hundreds of trumpets\r\nand abounded with actors and dancers plying their vocations. In the very\r\nsight of Krishna, Rama began to drink, with Kritavarma, Yuyudhana and\r\nGada; and Vabhru also did the same. Then Yuyudhana, inebriated with wine,\r\nderisively laughing at and insulting Kritavarma in the midst of that\r\nassembly, said, What Kshatriya is there who, armed with weapons, will\r\nslay men locked in the embraces of sleep and, therefore, already dead?\r\nHence, O son of Hridika, the Yadavas will never tolerate what thou hast\r\ndone. When Yuyudhana had said these words, Pradyumna, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, applauded them, expressing his disregard for the son of\r\nHridika.\r\n\r\n\"Highly incensed at this, Kritavarma, emphasising his disregard for\r\nSatyaki, by pointing to him with his left hand, said these words:\r\nProfessing thyself to be a hero, how couldst thou so cruelly slay the\r\narmless Bhurishrava who, on the field of battle, ( gave up all hostile\r\nintentions and) sat in praya?\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of his, Keshava, that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\ngiving way to wrath, cast an angry glance at Kritavarma. Then Satyaki\r\ninformed the slayer of Madhu as to how Kritavarma had behaved towards\r\nSatrajit for taking away from him the celebrated gem Syamantaka. Hearing\r\nthe narrative, Satyabhama, giving way to wrath and tears, approached\r\nKeshava and sitting on his lap enhanced his anger (for Kritavarma). Then\r\nrising up in a rage, Satyaki said, I swear to thee by Truth that I shall\r\nsoon cause this one to follow in the wake of the five sons of Draupadi,\r\nand of Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandithey that were slain by this sinful\r\nwretch, while they were asleep, with the assistance of Dronas son. O thou\r\nof slender waist, Kritavarmas period of life and fame have come to their\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"Having said these words, Satyaki rushed at Kritavarma and severed his\r\nhead with a sword in the very sight of Keshava. Yuyudhana, having\r\nachieved this feat, began to strike down others there present. Hrishikesa\r\nran to prevent him from doing further mischief. At that time, however, O\r\nmonarch, the Bhojas and Andhakas, impelled by the perverseness of the\r\nhour that had come upon them, all became as one man and surrounded the\r\nson of Sini. Janardana of mighty energy, knowing the character of the\r\nhour, stood unmoved without giving way to anger at the sight of those\r\nheroes rushing in wrath at Satyaki from every side. Urged by fate and\r\ninebriated with drink, they began to strike Yuyudhana with the pots from\r\nwhich they had been eating. When the son of Sini was being thus\r\nassaulted, Rukminis son became highly enraged. He rushed forward for\r\nrescuing Satyaki who was engaged with the Bhojas and the Andhakas. Endued\r\nwith might of arms and wealth of energy, those two heroes exerted\r\nthemselves with great courage. But as the odds were overwhelming, both of\r\nthem were slain in the very sight of Krishna. The delighter of the Yadus,\r\nbeholding his own son, and the son of Sini too, slain, took up, in wrath,\r\na handful of the Eraka grass that grew there. That handful of grass\r\nbecame a terrible bolt of iron endued with the energy of the thunderbolt.\r\nWith it Krishna slew all those that came before him. Then the Andhakas\r\nand the Bhojas, the Saineyas and the Vrishnis, urged by Time, struck one\r\nanother in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\r\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\r\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\r\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\r\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\r\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\r\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\r\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\r\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\r\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\r\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\r\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\r\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\r\nthe slayer of Madhu stood, raising a bolt of iron formed of a blade of\r\ngrass. Beholding that Samva was slain, as also Charudeshna and Pradyumna\r\nand Aniruddha, Madhava became filled with rage. Beholding Gada lying dead\r\non the ground, his wrath became enhanced. The wielder of Sarnga and the\r\ndiscus and the mace then exterminated the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.\r\nHear, O king, what that conquerer of hostile towns, Vabhru of mighty\r\nenergy and Daruka then said to Krishna, O holy one, a very large number\r\nof men has been slain by thee. Turn now to where Rama has gone. We wish\r\nto go there where he has proceeded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"Then Daruka and Keshava and Vabhru left that spot,\r\nfollowing in the wake of Rama (for discovering his retreat). They beheld\r\nthat hero of infinite energy sitting thoughtfully, reclining his back\r\nagainst a tree, in a solitary spot of earth. Finding Rama of great soul,\r\nKrishna commanded Daruka, saying, Going to the Kurus, inform Partha of\r\nthis great slaughter of the Yadus. Let Arjuna come here quickly, hearing\r\nof the destruction of the Yadavas through the Brahmanas curse.\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed, Daruka, deprived of his senses by grief, proceeded on a\r\ncar to the (capital of the) Kurus. After Daruka had gone away, Keshava,\r\nseeing Vabhru waiting on him, told him these words: Do thou go quickly\r\nfor protecting the ladies. Let not robbers do them any injury, tempted by\r\nthe wealth (that is with them). Thus commanded by Keshava, Vabhru, still\r\nhelpless with wine but cheerless at the slaughter of his kinsmen,\r\ndeparted. He had rested for a while by the side of Keshava, but as soon\r\nas he had proceeded to a distance, the iron-bolt, attaching itself to a\r\nmallet in the hands of a hunter, suddenly sprang of itself upon that\r\nsolitary survivor of the Yadava race and slew him, who also had been\r\nincluded in the curse of the Brahmanas. Beholding Vabhru slain, Keshava\r\nof great energy addressed his elder brother and said, Do thou, O Rama\r\nwait for me here till I place the ladies under the care of kinsmen.\r\n\r\n\"Entering the city of Dwaravati, Janardana said these words unto his\r\nfather, Do thou protect all the ladies of our house, till Dhananjaya\r\ncomes. At the skirts of the forest Rama is waiting for me. I shall meet\r\nhim today. This great carnage of the Yadus has been beheld by me even as\r\nI beheld before the carnage of those Kshatriyas who were the foremost\r\nones of Kurus race. It is impossible for me to see this city of the\r\nYadavas without the Yadus beside me. Know that proceeding to the woods I\r\nshall practise penances with Rama in my company. Having said these words,\r\nKrishna touched the feet of his father with his head, and quickly left\r\nhis presence. Then a loud wail of sorrow arose from the ladies and\r\nchildren of his house. Hearing that loud sound of wailing uttered by the\r\nweeping ladies, Keshava retraced his foot-steps and said unto them,\r\nArjuna will come here. That foremost of man will relieve you of your\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n\"Proceeding then to the forest, Keshava beheld Rama sitting in a solitary\r\nspot thereof. He also saw that Rama had set himself to Yoga and that from\r\nout his mouth was issuing a mighty snake. The colour of that snake was\r\nwhite. Leaving the human body (in which he had dwelt so long), that\r\nhigh-souled naga of a 1,000 heads and having a form as large as that of a\r\nmountain, endued besides with red eyes, proceeded along that way which\r\nled to the ocean. Ocean himself, and many celestial snakes, and many\r\nsacred Rivers were there, for receiving him with honour. There were\r\nKarkotaka and Vasuki and Takshaka and Prithusravas and Varuna and\r\nKunjara, and Misri and Sankha and Kumuda and Pundarika, and the\r\nhigh-souled Dhritarashtra, and Hrada and Kratha and Sitikantha of fierce\r\nenergy, and Chakramanda and Atishanda, and that foremost of Nagas called\r\nDurmukha, and Amvarisha, and king Varuna himself, O monarch. Advancing\r\nforward and offering him the Arghya and water to wash his feet, and with\r\ndiverse other rites, they all worshipped the mighty Naga and saluted him\r\nby making the usual enquiries.\r\n\r\n\"After his brother had thus departed from the (human) world, Vasudeva of\r\ncelestial vision, who was fully acquainted with the end of all things,\r\nwandered for some time in that lonely forest thoughtfully. Endued with\r\ngreat energy he then sat down on the bare earth. He had thought before\r\nthis of everything that had been fore-shadowed by the words uttered by\r\nGandhari in former days. He also recollected the words that Durvasas had\r\nspoken at the time his body was smeared by that Rishi with the remnant of\r\nthe Payasa he had eaten (while a guest at Krishnas house). The\r\nhigh-souled one, thinking of the destruction of the Vrishnis and the\r\nAndhakas, as also of the previous slaughter of the Kurus, concluded that\r\nthe hour (for his own departure from the world) had come. He then\r\nrestrained his senses (in Yoga). Conversant with the truth of every\r\ntopic, Vasudeva, though he was the Supreme Deity, wished to die, for\r\ndispelling all doubts and establishing a certainty of results (in the\r\nmatter of human existence), simply for upholding the three worlds and for\r\nmaking the words of Atris son true. Having restrained all his senses,\r\nspeech, and mind, Krishna laid himself down in high Yoga.\r\n\r\n\"A fierce hunter of the name of Jara then came there, desirous of deer.\r\nThe hunter, mistaking Keshava, who was stretched on the earth in high\r\nYoga, for a deer, pierced him at the heel with a shaft and quickly came\r\nto that spot for capturing his prey. Coming up, Jara beheld a man dressed\r\nin yellow robes, rapt in Yoga and endued with many arms. Regarding\r\nhimself an offender, and filled with fear, he touched the feet of\r\nKeshava. The high-souled one comforted him and then ascended upwards,\r\nfilling the entire welkin with splendour. When he reached Heaven, Vasava\r\nand the twin Ashvinis and Rudra and the Adityas and the Vasus and the\r\nViswedevas, and Munis and Siddhas and many foremost ones among the\r\nGandharvas, with the Apsaras, advanced to receive him. Then, O king, the\r\nillustrious Narayana of fierce energy, the Creator and Destroyer of all,\r\nthat preceptor of Yoga, filling Heaven with his splendour, reached his\r\nown inconceivable region. Krishna then met the deities and (celestial)\r\nRishis and Charanas, O king, and the foremost ones among the Gandharvas\r\nand many beautiful Apsaras and Siddhas and Saddhyas. All of them, bending\r\nin humility, worshipped him. The deities all saluted him, O monarch, and\r\nmany foremost of Munis and Rishis worshipped him who was the Lord of all.\r\nThe Gandharvas waited on him, hymning his praises, and Indra also\r\njoyfully praised him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"Meanwhile Daruka, going to the Kurus and seeing\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, the son of Pritha, informed them of how the\r\nVrishnis had slain one another with iron bolts. Hearing that the Vrishnis\r\nalong with the Bhojas and Andhakas and Kukuras had all been slain, the\r\nPandavas, burning with grief, became highly agitated. Then Arjuna, the\r\ndear friend of Keshava, bidding them farewell, set out for seeing his\r\nmaternal uncle. He said that destruction would soon overtake everything.\r\nProceeding to the city of the Vrishnis with Daruka in his company, O\r\npuissant king, that hero beheld that the city of Dwaraka looked like a\r\nwoman bereft of her husband. Those ladies who had, before this, the very\r\nLord of the universe for their protector, were now lordless. Seeing that\r\nPartha had come for protecting them, they all set up a loud wail. 16,000\r\nladies had been wedded to Vasudeva. Indeed, as soon as they saw Arjuna\r\narrive, they uttered a loud cry of sorrow. As soon as the Kuru prince met\r\nthose beauteous ones deprived of the protection of Krishna and of their\r\nsons as well, he was unable to look at them, his vision being obstructed\r\nby tears. The Dwaraka river had the Vrishnis and the Andhakas for its\r\nwater, steeds for its fishes, cars for its rafts, the sound of musical\r\ninstruments and the rattle of cars for its waves, houses and mansions and\r\npublic squares for its lakes. Gems and precious stones were its abundant\r\nmoss. The walls of adamant were the garlands of flowers that floated on\r\nit. The streets and roads were the strong currents running in eddies\r\nalong its surface. The great open squares were the still large lakes in\r\nits course. Rama and Krishna were its two mighty alligators. That\r\nagreeable river now seemed to Arjuna to be the fierce Vaitarani bound up\r\nwith Times net. Indeed, the son of Vasava, endued with great\r\nintelligence, beheld the city to look even thus, reft as it was of the\r\nVrishni heroes. Shorn of beauty, and perfectly cheerless, it presented\r\nthe aspect of a lotus flower in the season of winter. Beholding the sight\r\nthat Dwaraka presented, and seeing the numerous wives of Krishna, Arjuna\r\nwailed aloud with eyes bathed in tears and fell down on the earth. Then\r\nSatya, the daughter of Satrajit, and Rukmini too, O king, fell down\r\nbeside Dhananjaya and uttered loud wails of grief. Raising him then they\r\ncaused him to be seated on a golden seat. The ladies sat around that\r\nhigh-souled one, giving expression to their feelings. Praising Govinda\r\nand talking with the ladies, the son of Pandu comforted them and then\r\nproceeded to see his maternal uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"The Kuru prince beheld the heroic and high-souled\r\nAnakadundubhi lying on the ground and burning with grief on account of\r\nhis sons. The broad-chested and mighty-armed son of Pritha, more\r\nafflicted than his uncle, with eyes bathed in tears, touched his uncles\r\nfeet, O Bharata. The mighty-armed Anakadundubhi wished to smell the head\r\nof his sisters son but failed to do it, O slayer of foes. The old man of\r\nmighty arms, deeply afflicted, embraced Partha with his arms and wept\r\naloud, remembering his sons, brothers, grandsons, daughters sons, and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, Without beholding those heroes, O Arjuna, who had\r\nsubjugated all the kings of the Earth and the Daityas a hundred times, I\r\nam still alive! Methinks, I have no death! Through the fault of those two\r\nheroes who were thy dear disciples and who were much regarded by thee,\r\nalso, O Partha, the Vrishnis have been destroyed. Those two who were\r\nregarded as Atirathas amongst the foremost of the Vrishnis, and referring\r\nto whom in course of conversation thou wert wont to indulge in pride, and\r\nwho, O chief of Kurus race, were ever dear to Krishna himselfalas, those\r\ntwo, O Dhananjaya, have been the chief causes of the destruction of the\r\nVrishnis! I do not censure the son of Sini or the son of Hridika, O\r\nArjuna. I do not censure Akrura or the son of Rukmini. No doubt, the\r\ncurse (of the Rishis) is the sole cause. How is it that that lord of the\r\nuniverse, the slayer of Madhu, who had put forth his prowess for\r\nachieving the destruction of Kesin and Kansa, and Chaidya swelling with\r\npride, and Ekalavya, the son of the ruler of the Nishadas, and the\r\nKalingas and the Magadhas, and the Gandharas and the king of Kasi, and\r\nmany rulers assembled together in the midst of the desert, many heroes\r\nbelonging to the East and the South, and many kings of the mountainous\r\nregionsalas, how could he remain indifferent to such a calamity as the\r\ncurse denounced by the Rishis? Thyself, Narada, and the Munis, knew him\r\nto be the eternal and sinless Govinda, the Deity of unfading glory. Alas,\r\nbeing puissant Vishnu himself, he witnessed, without interfering, the\r\ndestruction of his kinsmen! My son must have himself allowed all this to\r\nhappen. He was the Lord of the universe. He did not, however, wish to\r\nfalsify the words of Gandhari and the Rishis, O scorcher of foes. In thy\r\nvery sight, O hero, thy grandson, who had been slain by Ashvatthama, was\r\nrevived through his energy. That friend, however, of yours did not wish\r\nto protect his kinsmen. Beholding his sons and grandsons and brothers and\r\nfriends lying dead, he said unto me these words, O chief of Bharatas\r\nrace, \"The destruction of this our race has at last come. Vibhatsu will\r\ncome to this city, Dwaravati. Tell him what has occurred, this great\r\ncarnage of the Vrishnis. I have no doubt that as soon as he will hear of\r\nthe destruction of the Yadus, that hero of mighty energy will come here\r\nwithout any loss of time. Know, O father, that I am Arjuna and Arjuna is\r\nmyself. That should be done by thee which he would say. The son of Pandu\r\nwill do what is best for the women and the children. Even he will perform\r\nthy funeral rites. This city of Dwaravati, after Arjunas departure, will,\r\nwith its walls and edifices, be swallowed up by the ocean without any\r\ndelay. As regards myself, retiring to some sacred place, I shall bide my\r\nhour, with the intelligent Rama in my company, observing strict vows all\r\nthe while.\" Having said these words unto me, Hrishikesa of inconceivable\r\nprowess, leaving me with the children, has gone away to some spot which I\r\ndo not know. Thinking of those two high-souled brothers of thine, as also\r\nof the terrible carnage of my kinsmen, I have abstained from all food,\r\nand am emaciated with grief. I shall neither eat, nor live. By good luck\r\nthou meetest me, O son of Pandu. Do thou accomplish all, O Partha, that\r\nKrishna has said. This kingdom, with all these women, and all the wealth\r\nhere, is thine now, O son of Pritha. As regards myself, O slayer of foes,\r\nI shall cast off my life-breaths dear though they be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"That scorcher of foes, Vibhatsu, thus addressed by\r\nhis maternal uncle, replied, with great cheerlessness of heart, unto\r\nVasudeva who was equally cheerless, saying, O uncle, I am unable to look\r\nat this Earth when she is reft of that hero of Vrishnis race and those my\r\nother kinsmen. The king and Bhimasena and Sahadeva and Nakula and\r\nYajnaseni, numbering the sixth, are of the same mind with myself in this\r\nmatter. The time has come for the departure of the king also. Know this,\r\nthat the hour of our departure too is at hand. Thou art the foremost of\r\nthose that are well conversant with the course of time. I shall, however,\r\nO chastiser of foes, first remove to Indraprastha the women of the\r\nVrishni race as also the children and the aged. Having said so unto his\r\nuncle, Arjuna next addressed Daruka, saying, I wish to see without any\r\ndelay the chief officers of the Vrishni heroes. Having uttered these\r\nwords, the heroic Arjuna, grieving for those great car-warriors (who had\r\nbeen slain), entered the great hall of the Yadavas (where they used to\r\nhold their court), called Sudharma. When he had taken his seat there, all\r\nthe citizens, including the Brahmanas, and all the ministers of state\r\ncame and stood surrounding him. Then Partha, more grieved than they,\r\naddressed those grieving and cheerless citizens and officers who were\r\nmore dead than alive, and said these words that were well suited to the\r\noccasion: I shall take away with me the remnants of the Vrishnis and the\r\nAndhakas. The sea will soon engulf this city. Equip all your cars and\r\nplace on them all your wealth. This Vajra (the grandson of Krishna) will\r\nbe your king at Shakraprastha. On the seventh day from this, at sunrise,\r\nwe shall set out. Make your preparations without delay.\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed by Prithas son of pure deeds, all of them hastened their\r\npreparations with eagerness for achieving their safety. Arjuna passed\r\nthat night in the mansion of Keshava. He was suddenly overwhelmed with\r\ngreat grief and stupefaction. When morning dawned, Vasudeva of great\r\nenergy and prowess attained, through the aid of Yoga, to the highest\r\ngoal. A loud and heart-rending sound of wailing was heard in Vasudevas\r\nmansion, uttered by the weeping ladies. They were seen with dishevelled\r\nhair and divested of ornaments and floral wreaths. Beating their breasts\r\nwith their hands, they indulged in heart-rending lamentations. Those\r\nforemost of women, Devaki and Bhadra and Rohini and Madira threw\r\nthemselves on the bodies of their lord. Then Partha caused the body of\r\nhis uncle to be carried out on a costly vehicle borne on the shoulders of\r\nmen. It was followed by all the citizens of Dwaraka and the people of the\r\nprovinces, all of whom, deeply afflicted by grief, had been well-affected\r\ntowards the deceased hero. Before that vehicle were borne the umbrella\r\nwhich had been held over his head at the conclusion of the\r\nhorse-sacrifice he had achieved while living, and also the blazing fires\r\nhe had daily worshipped, with the priests that had used to attend to\r\nthem. The body of the hero was followed by his wives decked in ornaments\r\nand surrounded by thousands of women and thousands of their\r\ndaughters-in-law. The last rites were then performed at that spot which\r\nhad been agreeable to him while he was alive. The four wives of that\r\nheroic son of Sura ascended the funeral pyre and were consumed with the\r\nbody of their lord. All of them attained to those regions of felicity\r\nwhich were his. The son of Pandu burnt the body of his uncle together\r\nwith those four wives of his, using diverse kinds of scents and perfumed\r\nwood. As the funeral pyre blazed up, a loud sound was heard of the\r\nburning wood and other combustible materials, along with the clear chant\r\nof Samans and the wailing of the citizens and others who witnessed the\r\nrite. After it was all over, the boys of the Vrishni and Andhaka races,\r\nheaded by Vajra, as also the ladies, offered oblations of water to the\r\nhigh-souled hero.\r\n\r\n\"Phalguna, who was careful in observing every duty, having caused this\r\nduty to be performed, proceeded, O chief of Bharatas race, next to the\r\nplace where the Vrishnis were slaughtered. The Kuru prince, beholding\r\nthem lying slaughtered all around, became exceedingly cheerless. He,\r\nhowever, did what was required to be done in view of that which had\r\nhappened. The last rites were performed, according to the order of\r\nseniority, unto the bodies of those heroes slain by the iron bolts born,\r\nby virtue of the curse denounced by the Brahmanas, of the blades of Eraka\r\ngrass. Searching out the bodies then of Rama and Vasudeva, Arjuna caused\r\nthem to be burnt by persons skilled in that act. The son of Pandu, having\r\nnext performed duly those sraddha rites that are done to the dead,\r\nquickly set out on the seventh day, mounting on his car. The widows of\r\nthe Vrishni heroes, wailing aloud, followed the high-souled son of Pandu.\r\nDhananjaya, on cars drawn by bullocks and mules and camels. All were in\r\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\r\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\r\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\r\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\r\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\r\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\r\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\r\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\r\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\r\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\r\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\r\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\r\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,\r\nescorted this vast procession of Vrishnis, which still abounded with\r\nwealth, and which looked like a veritable ocean.\r\n\r\n\"After all the people had set out, the ocean, that home of sharks and\r\nalligators, flooded Dvaraka, which still teemed with wealth of every\r\nkind, with its waters. Whatever portion of the ground was passed over,\r\nocean immediately flooded over with his waters. Beholding this wonderful\r\nsight, the inhabitants of Dvaraka walked faster and faster, saying,\r\nWonderful is the course of fate! Dhananjaya, after abandoning Dvaraka,\r\nproceeded by slow marches, causing the Vrishni women to rest in pleasant\r\nforests and mountains and by the sides of delightful streams. Arrived at\r\nthe country of the five waters, the puissant Dhananjaya planted a rich\r\nencampment in the midst of a land that abounded with corn and kine and\r\nother animals. Beholding those lordless widows escorted by Prithas son\r\nalone O Bharata, the robbers felt a great temptation (for plunder). Then\r\nthose sinful wretches, with hearts overwhelmed by cupidity, those Abhiras\r\nof ill omen, assembled together and held a consultation. They said, Here\r\nthere is only one bowman, Arjuna. The cavalcade consists of children and\r\nthe old. He escorts them, transgressing us. The warriors (of the\r\nVrishnis) are without energy. Then those robbers, numbering by thousands,\r\nand armed with clubs, rushed towards the procession of the Vrishnis,\r\ndesirous of plunder. Urged by the perverse course of time they fell upon\r\nthat vast concourse, frightening it with loud leonine shouts and desirous\r\nof slaughter. The son of Kunti, suddenly ceasing to advance along the\r\npath, turned, with his followers, towards the place where the robbers had\r\nattacked the procession. Smiling the while, that mighty-armed warrior\r\naddressed the assailants, saying, You sinful wretches, forbear, if ye\r\nlove your lives. Ye will rue this when I pierce your bodies with my\r\nshafts and take your lives. Though thus addressed by that hero, they\r\ndisregarded his words, and though repeatedly dissuaded, they fell upon\r\nArjuna. Then Arjuna endeavoured to string his large, indestructible,\r\ncelestial bow with some effort. He succeeded with great difficulty in\r\nstringing it, when the battle had become furious. He then began to think\r\nof his celestial weapons but they would not come to his mind. Beholding\r\nthat furious battle, the loss of the might of his arm, and the\r\nnon-appearance of his celestial weapons, Arjuna became greatly ashamed.\r\nThe Vrishni warriors including the foot-soldiers, the elephant-warriors,\r\nand the car-men, failed to rescue those Vrishni women that were being\r\nsnatched away by the robbers. The concourse was very large. The robbers\r\nassailed it at different points. Arjuna tried his best to protect it, but\r\ncould not succeed. In the very sightof all the warriors, many foremost of\r\nladies were dragged away, while others went away with the robbers of\r\ntheir own accord. The puissant Arjuna, supported by the servants of the\r\nVrishnis, struck the robbers with shafts sped from Gandiva. Soon,\r\nhowever. O king, his shafts were exhausted. In former days his shafts had\r\nbeen inexhaustible. Now, however, they proved otherwise. Finding his\r\nshafts exhausted, he became deeply afflicted with grief. The son of Indra\r\nthen began to strike the robbers with the horns of his bow. Those\r\nMlecchas, however, O Janamejaya, in the very sight of Partha, retreated,\r\ntaking away with them many foremost ladies of the Vrishnis and Andhakas.\r\nThe puissant Dhananjaya regarded it all as the work of destiny. Filled\r\nwith sorrow he breathed heavy sighs at the thought of the non-appearance\r\nof his (celestial) weapons, the loss of the might of his arms, the\r\nrefusal of his bow to obey him, and the exhaustion of his shafts.\r\nRegarding it all as the work of destiny, he became exceedingly cheerless.\r\nHe then ceased, O king, to make further efforts, saying, he had not the\r\npower which he had before. The high-souled one, taking with him the\r\nremnant of the Vrishni women, and the wealth that was still with them,\r\nreached Kurukshetra. Thus bringing with him the remnant of the Vrishnis.\r\nhe established them at different places. He established the son of\r\nKritavarma at the city called Marttikavat, with the remnant of the women\r\nof the Bhoja king. Escorting the remainder, with children and old men and\r\nwomen, the son of Pandu established them, who were reft of heroes, in the\r\ncity of Indraprastha. The dear son of Yuyudhana, with a company of old\r\nmen and children and women, the righteous-souled Arjuna established on\r\nthe banks of the Sarasvati. The rule of Indraprastha was given to Vajra.\r\nThe widows of Akrura then desired to retire into the woods. Vajra asked\r\nthem repeatedly to desist, but they did not listen to him. Rukmini, the\r\nprincess of Gandhara, Saivya, Haimavati, and queen Jamvabati ascended the\r\nfuneral pyre. Satyabhama and other dear wives of Krishna entered the\r\nwoods, O king, resolved to set themselves to the practice of penances.\r\nThey began to live on fruits and roots and pass their time in the\r\ncontemplation of Hari. Going beyond the Himavat, they took up their abode\r\nin a place called Kalpa. Those men who had followed Arjuna from\r\nDwaravati, were distributed into groups, and bestowed upon Vajra. Having\r\ndone all these acts suited to the occasion, Arjuna, with eyes bathed in\r\ntears, then entered the retreat of Vyasa. There he beheld the Island-born\r\nRishi seated at his ease.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"As Arjuna entered the asylum of the truthful Rishi,\r\nhe beheld the son of Satyavati seated in a secluded spot.\r\n\r\n\"Approaching that Rishi of high vows and endued with a knowledge of all\r\nduties, he said, I am Arjuna, and then awaited his pleasure. Satyavatis\r\nson, endued with high penances, answered, saying Welcome! Of tranquil\r\nsoul, the great Muni further said, Take thy seat. Seeing that the son of\r\nPritha was exceedingly cheerless and breathing heavy sighs repeatedly and\r\nfilled with despair, Vyasa addressed him, saying, \"Hast thou been\r\nsprinkled with water from anybodys nails or hair, or the end of anybodys\r\ncloth, or from the mouth of a jar? Hast thou had sexual congress with any\r\nwoman before the cessation of her functional flow? Hast thou slain a\r\nBrahmana? Hast thou been vanquished in battle? Thou lookest like one\r\nshorn of prosperity. I do not know that thou hast been defeated by\r\nanyone. Why then, O chief of Bharatas race, this exceedingly dejected\r\naspect? It behoveth thee, O son of Pritha, to tell me all, if, indeed,\r\nthere be no harm in telling it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, He whose complexion was like that of a (newly-risen) cloud,\r\nhe whose eyes were like a pair of large lotus petals, Krishna, has, with\r\nRama, cast off his body and ascended to Heaven. At Prabhasa, through iron\r\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\r\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\r\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\r\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\r\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\r\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\r\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\r\nblades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\r\nmighty-armed warriors have thus been laid low. Encountering one another,\r\nthey have met with destruction. Thinking repeatedly of this carnage of\r\nthe Yadava warriors of immeasurable energy and of the illustrious\r\nKrishna, I fail to derive peace of mind. The death of the wielder of\r\nSarnga is as incredible as the drying up of the ocean, the displacement\r\nof a mountain, the falling down of the vault of heaven, or the cooling\r\nproperty of fire. Deprived of the company of the Vrishni heroes, I desire\r\nnot to live in this world. Another incident has happened that is more\r\npainful than this, O thou that art possessed of wealth of penances.\r\nRepeatedly thinking of it, my heart is breaking. In my very sight, O\r\nBrahmana, thousands of Vrishni ladies were carried away by the Abhiras of\r\nthe country of the five waters, who assailed us. Taking up my bow I found\r\nmyself unequal to even string it. The might that had existed in my arms\r\nseemed to have disappeared on that occasion. O great ascetic, my weapons\r\nof diverse kinds failed to make their appearance. Soon, again, my shafts\r\nbecame exhausted. That person of immeasurable soul, of four arms,\r\nwielding the conch, the discus, and the mace, clad in yellow robes, dark\r\nof complexion, and possessing eyes resembling lotus-petals, is no longer\r\nseen by me. Alas, reft of Govinda, what have I to live for, dragging my\r\nlife in sorrow? He who used to stalk in advance of my car, that divine\r\nform endued with great splendour and unfading puissance, consuming as he\r\nproceeded all hostile warriors, can no longer be seen by me. No longer\r\nbeholding him who by his energy first burnt all hostile troops whom I\r\nafterwards despatched with shafts sped from Gandiva, I am filled with\r\ngrief and my head swims, O best of men. Penetrated with cheerlessness and\r\ndespair, I fail to obtain peace of mind. I dare not live, reft of the\r\nheroic Janardana. As soon as I heard that Vishnu had left the Earth, my\r\neyes became dim and all things disappeared from my vision. O best of men,\r\nit behoveth thee to tell me what is good for me now, for I am now a\r\nwanderer with an empty heart, despoiled of my kinsmen and of my\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, The mighty car-warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races\r\nhave all been consumed by the Brahmanas curse. O chief of Kurus race, it\r\nbehoveth thee not to grieve for their destruction. That which has\r\nhappened had been ordained. It was the destiny of those high-souled\r\nwarriors. Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully\r\ncompetent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the\r\nuniverse with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be\r\nsaid of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? He who used to proceed\r\nin front of thy car, armed with discus and mace, through affection for\r\nthee, was the four-armed Vasudeva, that ancient rishi. That high-souled\r\none of expansive eyes, Krishna, having lightened the burthen of the Earth\r\nand cast off his (human) body, has attained to his own high seat. By thee\r\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\r\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\r\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\r\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\r\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\r\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\r\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\r\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\r\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\r\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\r\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\r\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\r\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\r\nweapons, having achieved success, have gone away to the place they came\r\nfrom. They will, again, come into thy hands when the Time for their\r\ncoming approaches. The time has come, O Bharata, for you all to attain to\r\nthe highest goal. Even this is what I regard to be highly beneficial for\r\nyou all, O chief of Bharatas race.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"Having heard these words of Vyasa of\r\nimmeasurable energy, the son of Pritha, receiving his permission,\r\nreturned to the city named after the elephant. Entering it, the hero\r\napproached Yudhishthira and informed him of all that had taken place with\r\nreference to the Vrishnis.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of Mausala-parv\r\n"
