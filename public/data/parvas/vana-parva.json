      "content": "(Aranyaka Parva)\r\n\r\nOm! Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male beings,\r\nand the goddess Saraswati also, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Janamejaya said, 'O thou foremost of regenerate ones, deceitfully\r\ndefeated at dice by the sons of Dhritarashtra and their counsellors,\r\nincensed by those wicked ones that thus brought about a fierce animosity,\r\nand addressed in language that was so cruel, what did the Kuru princes,\r\nmy ancestors--the sons of Pritha--(then) do? How also did the sons of\r\nPritha, equal unto Sakra in prowess, deprived of affluence and suddenly\r\nover whelmed with misery, pass their days in the forest? Who followed the\r\nsteps of those princes plunged in excess of affliction? And how did those\r\nhigh souled ones bear themselves and derive their sustenance, and where\r\ndid they put up? And, O illustrious ascetic and foremost of Brahmanas,\r\nhow did those twelve years (of exile) of those warriors who were slayers\r\nof foes, pass away in the forest? And undeserving of pain, how did that\r\nprincess, the best of her sex, devoted to her husbands, eminently\r\nvirtuous, and always speaking the truth, endure that painful exile in the\r\nforest? O thou of ascetic wealth tell me all this in detail, for, O\r\nBrahmana, I desire to hear thee narrate the history of those heroes\r\npossessed of abundant prowess and lustre. Truly my curiosity is great.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus defeated at dice and incensed by the wicked\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra and their counsellors, the sons of Pritha set out\r\nfrom Hastinapura. And issuing through Vardhamana gate of the city, the\r\nPandavas bearing their weapons and accompanied by Draupadi set out in a\r\nnorthernly direction. Indrasena and others, with servants numbering\r\naltogether fourteen, with their wives, followed them on swift cars. And\r\nthe citizens learning of their departure became overwhelmed with sorrow,\r\nand began to censure Bhishma and Vidura and Drona and Gautama. And having\r\nmet together they thus addressed one another fearlessly.\r\n\r\n'Alas, our families, we ourselves, and our homes are all gone, when the\r\nwicked Duryodhana, backed by the son of Suvala, by Karna and Dussasana,\r\naspireth to this kingdom. And, Oh, our families, our (ancestral) usages,\r\nour virtue and prosperity, are all doomed where this sinful wretch\r\nsupported by wretches as sinful aspireth to the kingdom! And, Oh, how can\r\nhappiness be there where these are not! Duryodhana beareth malice towards\r\nall superiors, hath taken leave of good conduct, and quarreleth with\r\nthose that are near to him in blood. Covetous and vain and mean, he is\r\ncruel by nature. The whole earth is doomed when Duryodhana becometh its\r\nruler. Thither, therefore, let us proceed whither the merciful and\r\nhigh-minded sons of Pandu with passions under control and victorious over\r\nfoes, and possessed of modesty and renown, and devoted to pious\r\npractices, repair!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'And saying this, the citizens went after the\r\nPandavas, and having met them, they all, with joined hands, thus\r\naddressed the sons of Kunti and Madri.\r\n\r\n'Blest be ye! Where will ye go, leaving us in grief? We will follow you\r\nwhithersoever ye will go! Surely have we been distressed upon learning\r\nthat ye have been deceitfully vanquished by relentless enemies! It\r\nbehoveth you not to forsake us that are your loving subjects and devoted\r\nfriends always seeking your welfare and employed in doing what is\r\nagreeable to you! We desire not to be overwhelmed in certain destruction\r\nliving in the dominions of the Kuru king. Ye bulls among men, listen as\r\nwe indicate the merits and demerits springing respectively from\r\nassociation with what is good and bad! As cloth, water, the ground, and\r\nsesame seeds are perfumed by association with flowers, even so are\r\nqualities ever the product of association. Verily association with fools\r\nproduceth an illusion that entangleth the mind, as daily communion with\r\nthe good and the wise leadeth to the practice of virtue. Therefore, they\r\nthat desire emancipation should associate with those that are wise and\r\nold and honest and pure in conduct and possessed of ascetic merit. They\r\nshould be waited upon whose triple possessions, viz., knowledge (of the\r\nVedas), origin and acts, are all pure, and association with them is even\r\nsuperior to (the study of the) scriptures. Devoid of the religious acts\r\nas we are, we shall yet reap religious merit by association with the\r\nrighteous, as we should come by sin by waiting upon the sinful. The very\r\nsight and touch of the dishonest, and converse and association with them;\r\ncause diminution of virtue, and men (that are doomed to these), never\r\nattain purity of mind. Association with the base impaireth the\r\nunderstanding, as, indeed, with the indifferent maketh it indifferent,\r\nwhile communion with the good ever exalteth it. All those attributes\r\nwhich are spoken of in the world as the sources of religious merit, of\r\nworldly prosperity and sensual pleasures, which are regarded by the\r\npeople, extolled in the Vedas, and approved by the well-behaved, exist in\r\nyou, separately and jointly! Therefore, desirous of our own welfare, we\r\nwish to live amongst you who possess those attributes!\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Blessed are we since the people with the Brahmanas\r\nat their head, moved by affection and compassion credit us with merits we\r\nhave not. I, however, with my brothers, would ask all of you to do one\r\nthing. Ye should not, through affection and pity for us, act otherwise!\r\nOur grandfather Bhishma, the king (Dhritarashtra), Vidura, my mother and\r\nmost of my well-wishers, are all in the city of Hastinapura. Therefore,\r\nif ye are minded to seek our welfare, cherish ye them with care, uniting\r\ntogether as they are overwhelmed with sorrow and afflictions. Grieved at\r\nour departure, ye have come far! Go ye back, and let your hearts be\r\ndirected with tenderness towards the relatives I entrust to you as\r\npledges! This, of all others, is the one act upon which my heart is set,\r\nand by doing this ye would give me great satisfaction and pay me your\r\nbest regards!\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus exhorted by Yudhishthira the just, the\r\npeople in a body set up a loud wail exclaiming,--Alas, O king! And\r\nafflicted and overwhelmed with sorrow on remembering the virtues of\r\nPritha's son, they unwillingly retraced their steps asking leave of the\r\nPandavas.\r\n\r\n'The citizens having ceased to follow, the Pandavas ascended their cars,\r\nand setting out reached (the site of) the mighty banian tree called\r\nPramana on the banks of the Ganges. And reaching the site of the banian\r\ntree about the close of the day, the heroic sons of Pandu purified\r\nthemselves by touching the sacred water, and passed the night there. And\r\nafflicted with woe they spent that night taking water alone as their sole\r\nsustenance. Certain Brahmanas belonging to both classes, viz., those that\r\nmaintained the sacrificial fire and those that maintained it not, who\r\nhad, with their disciples and relatives, out of affection followed the\r\nPandavas thither also passed the night with them. And surrounded by those\r\nutterers of Brahma, the king shone resplendent in their midst. And that\r\nevening, at once beautiful and terrible, those Brahmanas having lighted\r\ntheir (sacred) fires, began to chant the Vedas and hold mutual converse.\r\nAnd those foremost of Brahmanas, with swan-sweet voices spent the night,\r\ncomforting that best of Kurus--the king.\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'When that night passed away and day broke in, those\r\nBrahmamas who supported themselves by mendicancy, stood before the\r\nPandavas of exalted deeds, who were about to enter the forest. Then king\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, addressed them, saying, \"Robbed of our\r\nprosperity and kingdom, robbed of everything, we are about to enter the\r\ndeep woods in sorrow, depending for our food on fruits and roots, and the\r\nproduce of the chase. The forest too is full of dangers, and abounds with\r\nreptiles and beasts of prey. It appeareth to me that ye will certainly\r\nhave to suffer much privation and misery there. The sufferings of the\r\nBrahmanas might overpower even the gods. That they would overwhelm me is\r\ntoo certain. Therefore, O Brahmana, go ye back whithersoever ye list!'\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmanas replied, 'O king, our path is even that on which ye are\r\nfor setting out! It behoveth thee not, therefore, to forsake us who are\r\nthy devoted admirers practising the true religion! The very gods have\r\ncompassion upon their worshippers,--specially upon Brahmanas of regulated\r\nlives!'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'We regenerate ones, I too am devoted to the\r\nBrahmanas! But this destitution that hath overtaken me overwhelmed me\r\nwith confusion! These my brothers that are to procure fruits and roots\r\nand the deer (of the forest) are stupefied with grief arising from their\r\nafflictions and on account of the distress of Draupadi and the loss of\r\nour kingdom! Alas, as they are distressed, I cannot employ them in\r\npainful tasks!'\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmanas said, 'Let no anxiety, O king, in respect of our\r\nmaintenance, find a place in thy heart! Ourselves providing our own food,\r\nwe shall follow thee, and by meditation and saying our prayers we shall\r\ncompass thy welfare while by pleasant converse we shall entertain thee\r\nand be cheered ourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, it must be as ye say, for I am ever\r\npleased with the company of the regenerate ones! But my fallen condition\r\nmaketh me behold in myself an object of reproach! How shall I behold you\r\nall, that do not deserve to bear trouble, out of love for me painfully\r\nsubsisting upon food procured by your own toil? Oh, fie upon the wicked\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued. 'Saying this, the weeping king sat himself down\r\nupon the ground. Then a learned Brahmana, Saunaka by name versed in\r\nself-knowledge and skilled in the Sankhya system of yoga, addressed the\r\nking, saying, 'Causes of grief by thousands, and causes of fear by\r\nhundreds, day after day, overwhelm the ignorant but not the wise. Surely,\r\nsensible men like thee never suffer themselves to be deluded by acts that\r\nare opposed to true knowledge, fraught with every kind of evil, and\r\ndestructive of salvation. O king, in thee dwelleth that understanding\r\nfurnished with the eight attributes which is said to be capable of\r\nproviding against all evils and which resulteth from a study of the Sruti\r\n(Vedas) and scriptures! And men like unto thee are never stupefied, on\r\nthe accession of poverty or an affliction overtaking their friends,\r\nthrough bodily or mental uneasiness! Listen, I shall tell the slokas\r\nwhich were chanted of old by the illustrious Janaka touching the subject\r\nof controlling the self! This world is afflicted with both bodily and\r\nmental suffering. Listen now to the means of allaying it as I indicate\r\nthem both briefly and in detail. Disease, contact with painful things,\r\ntoil and want of objects desired.--these are the four causes that induce\r\nbodily suffering. And as regards disease, it may be allayed by the\r\napplication of medicine, while mental ailments are cured by seeking to\r\nforget them yoga-meditation. For this reason, sensible physicians first\r\nseek to allay the mental sufferings of their patients by agreeable\r\nconverse and the offer of desirable objects And as a hot iron bar thrust\r\ninto a jar maketh the water therein hot, even so doth mental grief bring\r\non bodily agony. And as water quencheth fire, so doth true knowledge\r\nallay mental disquietude. And the mind attaining ease, the body findeth\r\nease also. It seemeth that affection is the root of all mental sorrow. It\r\nis affection that maketh every creature miserable and bringeth on every\r\nkind of woe. Verily affection is the root of all misery and of all fear,\r\nof joy and grief of every kind of pain. From affection spring all\r\npurposes, and it is from affection that spring the love of worldly goods!\r\nBoth of these (latter) are sources of evil, though the first (our\r\npurposes) is worse than the second. And as (a small portion of) fire\r\nthrust into the hollow of a tree consumeth the tree itself to its roots,\r\neven so affection, ever so little, destroyeth both virtue and profit. He\r\ncannot be regarded to have renounced the world who hath merely withdrawn\r\nfrom worldly possessions. He, however, who though in actual contact with\r\nthe world regardeth its faults, may be said to have truly renounced the\r\nworld. Freed from every evil passion, soul dependent on nothing with such\r\na one hath truly renounced the world. Therefore, should no one seek to\r\nplace his affections on either friends or the wealth he hath earned. And\r\nso should affection for one's own person be extinguished by knowledge.\r\nLike the lotus-leaf that is never drenched by water, the souls of men\r\ncapable of distinguishing between the ephemeral and the everlasting, of\r\nmen devoted to the pursuit of the eternal, conversant with the scriptures\r\nand purified by knowledge, can never be moved by affection. The man that\r\nis influenced by affection is tortured by desire; and from the desire\r\nthat springeth up in his heart his thirst for worldly possessions\r\nincreaseth. Verily, this thirst is sinful and is regarded as the source\r\nof all anxieties. It is this terrible thirst, fraught with sin that\r\nleaneth unto unrighteous acts. Those find happiness that can renounce\r\nthis thirst, which can never be renounced by the wicked, which decayeth\r\nnot with the decay of the body, and which is truly a fatal disease! It\r\nhath neither beginning nor end. Dwelling within the heart, it destroyeth\r\ncreatures, like a fire of incorporeal origin. And as a faggot of wood is\r\nconsumed by the fire that is fed by itself, even so doth a person of\r\nimpure soul find destruction from the covetousness born of his heart. And\r\nas creatures endued with life have ever a dread of death, so men of\r\nwealth are in constant apprehension of the king and the thief, of water\r\nand fire and even of their relatives. And as a morsel of meat, if in air,\r\nmay be devoured by birds; if on ground by beasts of prey; and if in water\r\nby the fishes; even so is the man of wealth exposed to dangers wherever\r\nhe may be. To many the wealth they own is their bane, and he that\r\nbeholding happiness in wealth becometh wedded to it, knoweth not true\r\nhappiness. And hence accession of wealth is viewed as that which\r\nincreaseth covetousness and folly. Wealth alone is the root of\r\nniggardliness and boastfulness, pride and fear and anxiety! These are the\r\nmiseries of men that the wise see in riches! Men undergo infinite\r\nmiseries in the acquisition and retention of wealth. Its expenditure also\r\nis fraught with grief. Nay, sometimes, life itself is lost for the sake\r\nof wealth! The abandonment of wealth produces misery, and even they that\r\nare cherished by one's wealth become enemies for the sake of that wealth!\r\nWhen, therefore, the possession of wealth is fraught with such misery,\r\none should not mind its loss. It is the ignorant alone who are\r\ndiscontented. The wise, however, are always content. The thirst of wealth\r\ncan never be assuaged. Contentment is the highest happiness; therefore,\r\nit is, that the wise regard contentment as the highest object of pursuit.\r\nThe wise knowing the instability of youth and beauty, of life and\r\ntreasure-hoards, of prosperity and the company of the loved ones, never\r\ncovet them. Therefore, one should refrain from the acquisition of wealth,\r\nbearing the pain incident to it. None that is rich free from trouble, and\r\nit is for this that the virtuous applaud them that are free from the\r\ndesire of wealth. And as regards those that pursue wealth for purposes of\r\nvirtue, it is better for them to refrain altogether from such pursuit,\r\nfor, surely, it is better not to touch mire at all than to wash it off\r\nafter having been besmeared with it. And, O Yudhishthira, it behoveth\r\nthee not to covet anything! And if thou wouldst have virtue, emancipate\r\nthyself from desire of worldly possessions!'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O Brahmana, this my desire of wealth is not for\r\nenjoying it when obtained. It is only for the support of the Brahmanas\r\nthat I desire it and not because I am actuated by avarice! For what\r\npurpose, O Brahmana, doth one like us lead a domestic life, if he cannot\r\ncherish and support those that follow him? All creatures are seen to\r\ndivide the food (they procure) amongst those that depend on them.[1] So\r\nshould a person leading a domestic life give a share of his food to Yatis\r\nand Brahmacharins that have renounced cooking for themselves. The houses\r\nof the good men can never be in want of grass (for seat), space (for\r\nrest), water (to wash and assuage thirst), and fourthly, sweet words. To\r\nthe weary a bed,--to one fatigued with standing, a seat,--to the thirsty,\r\nwater,--and to the hungry, food should ever be given. To a guest are due\r\npleasant looks and a cheerful heart and sweet words. The host, rising up,\r\nshould advance towards the guest, offer him a seat, and duly worship him.\r\nEven this is eternal morality. They that perform not the Agnihotra[2] not\r\nwait upon bulls, nor cherish their kinsmen and guests and friends and\r\nsons and wives and servants, are consumed with sin for such neglect. None\r\nshould cook his food for himself alone and none should slay an animal\r\nwithout dedicating it to the gods, the pitris, and guests. Nor should one\r\neat of that food which hath not been duly dedicated to the gods and\r\npitris. By scattering food on the earth, morning and evening, for (the\r\nbehoof of) dogs and Chandalas and birds, should a person perform the\r\nViswedeva sacrifice.[3] He that eateth the Vighasa, is regarded as eating\r\nambrosia. What remaineth in a sacrifice after dedication to the gods and\r\nthe pitris is regarded as ambrosia; and what remaineth after feeding the\r\nguest is called Vighasa and is equivalent to ambrosia itself. Feeding a\r\nguest is equivalent to a sacrifice, and the pleasant looks the host\r\ncasteth upon the guest, the attention he devoteth to him, the sweet words\r\nin which he addresseth him, the respect he payeth by following him, and\r\nthe food and drink with which he treateth him, are the five Dakshinas[4]\r\nin that sacrifice. He who giveth without stint food to a fatigued\r\nwayfarer never seen before, obtaineth merit that is great, and he who\r\nleading a domestic life, followeth such practices, acquireth religious\r\nmerit that is said to be very great. O Brahmana, what is thy opinion on\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saunaka said, 'Alas, this world is full of contradictions! That which\r\nshameth the good, gratifieth the wicked! Alas, moved by ignorance and\r\npassion and slaves of their own senses, even fools perform many acts of\r\n(apparent merit) to gratify in after-life their appetites! With eyes open\r\nare these men led astray by their seducing senses, even as a charioteer,\r\nwho hath lost his senses, by restive and wicked steeds! When any of the\r\nsix senses findeth its particular object, the desire springeth up in the\r\nheart to enjoy that particular object. And thus when one's heart\r\nproceedeth to enjoy the objects of any particular sense a wish is\r\nentertained which in its turn giveth birth to a resolve. And finally,\r\nlike unto an insect falling into a flame from love of light, the man\r\nfalleth into the fire of temptation, pierced by the shafts of the object\r\nof enjoyment discharged by the desire constituting the seed of the\r\nresolve! And thenceforth blinded by sensual pleasure which he seeketh\r\nwithout stint, and steeped in dark ignorance and folly which he mistaketh\r\nfor a state of happiness, he knoweth not himself! And like unto a wheel\r\nthat is incessantly rolling, every creature, from ignorance and deed and\r\ndesire, falleth into various states in this world, wandering from one\r\nbirth to another, and rangeth the entire circle of existences from a\r\nBrahma to the point of a blade of grass, now in water, now on land, and\r\nnow against in the air!\r\n\r\n'This then is the career of those that are without knowledge. Listen now\r\nto the course of the wise they that are intent on profitable virtue, and\r\nare desirous of emancipation! The Vedas enjoin act but renounce (interest\r\nin) action. Therefore, shouldst thou act, renouncing Abhimana,[5]\r\nperformance of sacrifices, study (of the Vedas), gifts, penance, truth\r\n(in both speech and act), forgiveness, subduing the senses, and\r\nrenunciation of desire,--these have been declared to be the eight\r\n(cardinal) duties constituting the true path. Of these, the four first\r\npave the way to the world of the pitris. And these should be practised\r\nwithout Abhimana. The four last are always observed by the pious, to\r\nattain the heaven of the gods. And the pure in spirit should ever follow\r\nthese eight paths. Those who wish to subdue the world for purpose of\r\nsalvation, should ever act fully renouncing motives, effectually subduing\r\ntheir senses, rigidly observing particular vows, devotedly serving their\r\npreceptors, austerely regulating their fare, diligently studying the\r\nVedas, renouncing action as mean and restraining their hearts. By\r\nrenouncing desire and aversion the gods have attained prosperity. It is\r\nby virtue of their wealth of yoga[6] that the Rudras, and the Sadhyas,\r\nand the Adityas and the Vasus, and the twin Aswins, rule the creatures.\r\nTherefore, O son of Kunti, like unto them, do thou, O Bharata, entirely\r\nrefraining from action with motive, strive to attain success in yoga and\r\nby ascetic austerities. Thou hast already achieved such success so far as\r\nthy debts to thy ancestors, both male and female concerned, and that\r\nsuccess also which is derived from action (sacrifices). Do thou, for\r\nserving the regenerate ones endeavour to attain success in penances.\r\nThose that are crowned with ascetic success, can, by virtue of that\r\nsuccess, do whatever they list; do thou, therefore, practising asceticism\r\nrealise all thy wishes.\""

Afflicted with many calamities I am unable to support them. I\r\ncannot abandon them, nor have I the power to offer them sustenance: Tell\r\nme, O holy one, what should be done by me in such a pass.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'After reflecting for a moment seeking to find out\r\nthe (proper) course by his yoga powers, Dhaumya, that foremost of all\r\nvirtuous men, addressed Yudhishthira, in these words, 'In days of old,\r\nall living beings that had been created were sorely afflicted with\r\nhunger. And like a father (unto all of them), Savita (the sun) took\r\ncompassion upon them. And going first into the northern declension, the\r\nsun drew up water by his rays, and coming back to the southern\r\ndeclension, stayed over the earth, with his heat centered in himself. And\r\nwhile the sun so stayed over the earth, the lord of the vegetable world\r\n(the moon), converting the effects of the solar heat (vapours) into\r\nclouds and pouring them down in the shape of water, caused plants to\r\nspring up. Thus it is the sun himself, who, drenched by the lunar\r\ninfluence, is transformed, upon the sprouting of seeds, into holy\r\nvegetable furnished with the six tastes. And it is these which constitute\r\nthe food of all creatures upon the earth. Thus the food that supporteth\r\nthe lives of creatures is instinct with solar energy, and the sun is,\r\ntherefore, the father of all creatures. Do thou, hence, O Yudhishthira,\r\ntake refuge even in him. All illustrious monarchs of pure descent and\r\ndeeds are known to have delivered their people by practising high\r\nasceticism. The great Karttavirya, and Vainya and Nahusha, had all, by\r\nvirtue of ascetic meditation preceded by vows, delivered their people\r\nfrom heavy afflictions.

And touching the water of the Ganges the virtuous Yudhishthira\r\nwith senses under complete control and depending upon air alone for his\r\nsustenance, stood there with rapt soul engaged in pranayama.[7] And\r\nhaving purified himself and restrained his speech, he began to sing the\r\nhymn of praise (to the sun).'\r\n\r\n'Yudhishthira said, \"Thou art, O sun, the eye of the universe. Thou art\r\nthe soul of all corporeal existences. Thou art the origin of all things.\r\nThou art the embodiment of the acts of all religious men. Thou art the\r\nrefuge of those versed in the Sankhya philosophy (the mysteries of the\r\nsoul), and thou art the support of the Yogins. Thou art a door unfastened\r\nwith bolts. Thou art the refuge of those wishing for emancipation. Thou\r\nsustainest and discoverest the world, and sanctifiest and supportest it\r\nfrom pure compassion. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas appearing before\r\nthee, adore thee in due time, reciting the hymns from the respective\r\nbranches (of the Vedas) they refer. Thou art the adored of the Rishis.\r\nThe Siddhas, and the Charanas and the Gandharvas and the Yakshas, and the\r\nGuhyakas, and the Nagas, desirous of obtaining boons follow thy car\r\ncoursing through the skies. The thirty-three gods[8] with Upendra\r\n(Vishnu) and Mahendra, and the order of Vaimanikas[9] have attained\r\nsuccess by worshipping thee. By offering thee garlands of the celestial\r\nMandaras[10] the best of the Vidyadharas have obtained all their desires.\r\nThe Guhyas and the seven orders of the Pitris--both divine and\r\nhuman--have attained superiority by adoring thee alone. The Vasus, the\r\nManilas, and the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Marichipas, the Valikhilyas,\r\nand the Siddhas, have attained pre-eminence by bowing down unto thee.\r\nThere is nothing that I know in the entire seven worlds, including that\r\nof Brahma which is beyond thee. There are other beings both great and\r\nendued with energy; but none of them hath thy lustre and energy. All\r\nlight is in thee, indeed, thou art the lord of all light. In thee are the\r\n(five) elements and all intelligence, and knowledge and asceticism and\r\nthe ascetic properties.[11] The discus by which the wielder of the\r\nSaranga[12] humbleth the pride of Asuras and which is furnished with a\r\nbeautiful nave, was forged by Viswakarman with thy energy. In summer thou\r\ndrawest, by thy rays, moisture from all corporeal existences and plants\r\nand liquid substances, and pourest it down in the rainy season. Thy rays\r\nwarm and scorch, and becoming as clouds roar and flash with lightning and\r\npour down showers when the season cometh. Neither fire nor shelter, nor\r\nwoolen cloths give greater comfort to one suffering from chilling blasts\r\nthan thy rays. Thou illuminest by thy rays the whole Earth with her\r\nthirteen islands. Thou alone are engaged in the welfare of the three\r\nworlds. If thou dost not rise, the universe becometh blind and the\r\nlearned cannot employ themselves in the attainment of virtue, wealth and\r\nprofit. It is through thy grace that the (three) orders of Brahmanas,\r\nKshatriyas and Vaisyas are able to perform their various duties and\r\nsacrifices.[13] Those versed in chronology say that thou art the\r\nbeginning and thou the end of a day of Brahma, which consisteth of a full\r\nthousand Yugas. Thou art the lord of Manus and of the sons of the Manus,\r\nof the universe and of man, of the Manwantaras, and their lords. When the\r\ntime of universal dissolution cometh, the fire Samvartaka born of thy\r\nwrath consumeth the three worlds and existeth alone And clouds of various\r\nhues begotten of thy rays, accompanied by the elephant Airavata and the\r\nthunderbolt, bring about the appointed deluges. And dividing thyself into\r\ntwelve parts and becoming as many suns, thou drinkest up the ocean once\r\nmore with thy rays. Thou art called Indra, thou art Vishnu, thou art\r\nBrahma, thou art Prajapati. Thou art fire and thou art the subtle mind.\r\nAnd thou art lord and the eternal Brahma. Thou art Hansa, thou art\r\nSavitri, thou art Bhanu, Ansumalin, and Vrishakapi. Thou art Vivaswan,\r\nMihira, Pusha, Mitra, and Dharma. Thou art thousand-rayed, thou art\r\nAditya, and Tapana, and the lord of rays. Thou art Martanda, and Arka,\r\nand Ravi, and Surya and Saranya and maker of day, and Divakara and\r\nSuptasaspti, and Dhumakeshin and Virochana. Thou art spoken of as swift\r\nof speed and the destroyer of darkness, and the possessor of yellow\r\nsteeds. He that reverentially adoreth thee on the sixth or the seventh\r\nlunar day with humility and tranquillity of mind, obtaineth the grace of\r\nLakshmi. They that with undivided attention adore and worship thee, are\r\ndelivered from all dangers, agonies, and afflictions. And they that hold\r\nthat thou art everywhere (being the soul of all things) living long,\r\nfreed from sin and enjoying an immunity from all diseases. O lord of all\r\nfood, it behoveth thee to grant food in abundance unto me who am desirous\r\nof food even for entertaining all my guests with reverence. I bow also to\r\nall those followers of thine that have taken refuge at thy feet--Mathara\r\nand Aruna and Danda and others, including Asani and Kshuva and the\r\nothers. And I bow also to the celestial mothers of all creatures, viz.,\r\nKshuva and Maitri and the others of the class. O, let them deliver me\r\ntheir supplient.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus, O great king, was the sun that purifier of the\r\nworld, adored (by Yudhishthira). And pleased with the hymn, the maker of\r\nday, self-luminous, and blazing like fire showed himself to the son of\r\nPandu. And Vivaswan said, 'Thou shall obtain all that thou desirest. I\r\nshall provide thee with food for five and seven years together. And, O\r\nking, accept this copper-vessel which I give unto thee. And, O thou of\r\nexcellent vows, as long as Panchali will hold this vessel, without\r\npartaking of its contents fruits and roots and meat and vegetables cooked\r\nin thy kitchen, these four kinds of food shall from this day be\r\ninexhaustible. And, on the fourteenth year from this, thou shall regain\r\nthy kingdom.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the god vanished away. He\r\nthat, with the desire of obtaining a boon, reciteth this hymn\r\nconcentrating his mind with ascetic abstraction, obtaineth it from the\r\nsun, however difficult of acquisition it may be that he asketh for. And\r\nthe person, male or female, that reciteth or heareth this hymn day after\r\nday, if he or she desireth for a son, obtaineth one, and if riches,\r\nobtaineth them, and if learning acquireth that too. And the person male\r\nor female, that reciteth this hymn every day in the two twilights, if\r\novertaken by danger, is delivered from it, and if bound, is freed from\r\nthe bonds. Brahma himself had communicated this hymn to the illustrious\r\nSakra, and from Sakra was it obtained by Narada and from Narada, by\r\nDhaumya. And Yudhishthira, obtaining it from Dhaumya, attained all his\r\nwishes. And it is by virtue of this hymn that one may always obtain\r\nvictory in war, and acquire immense wealth also. And it leadeth the\r\nreciter from all sins, to the solar region.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having obtained the boon, the virtuous son of\r\nKunti, rising from the water, took hold of Dhaumya's feet and then\r\nembraced his brother's. And, O exalted one, wending then with Draupadi to\r\nthe kitchen, and adored by her duly, the son of Pandu set himself to cook\r\n(their day's) food. And the clean food, however little, that was dressed,\r\nfurnished with the four tastes, increased and became inexhaustible. And\r\nwith it Yudhishthira began to feed the regenerate ones. And after the\r\nBrahmanas had been fed, and his younger brothers also, Yudhishthira\r\nhimself ate of the food that remained, and which is called Vighasa. And\r\nafter Yudhishthira had eaten, the daughter of Prishata took what\r\nremained. And after she had taken her meal, the day's food became\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n'And having thus obtained the boon from the maker of day, the son of\r\nPandu, himself as resplendent as that celestial, began to entertain the\r\nBrahmanas agreeably to their wishes. And obedient to their priest, the\r\nsons of Pritha, on auspicious lunar days and constellations and\r\nconjunctions, performed sacrifices according to the ordinance, the\r\nscriptures, and the Mantras. After the sacrifices, the sons of Pandu,\r\nblessed by the auspicious rites performed by Dhaumya and accompanied by\r\nhim, and surrounded also by the Brahmanas set out for the woods of\r\nKamyaka.'\""

And seated at his ease the king addressed these\r\nwords to the virtuous Vidura of profound intelligence, 'Thy understanding\r\nis as clear as that of Bhargava.[15] Thou knowest also all the subtleties\r\nor morality, and thou lookest on all the Kauravas with an equal eye. O,\r\ntell me what is proper for me and them. O Vidura, things having thus\r\ntaken their course, what should we do now? How may I secure the goodwill\r\nof the citizens so that they may not destroy us to the roots? O, tell us\r\nall, since thou art conversant with every excellent expedient.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'The three-fold purposes, O king (viz., profit, pleasure,\r\nand salvation), have their foundations in virtue, and the sages say that\r\na kingdom also standeth on virtue as its basis. Therefore, O monarch,\r\naccording to the best of thy power, cherish thou virtuously thy own sons\r\nand those of Pandu. That virtue had been beguiled by wicked souls with\r\nSuvala's son at their head, when thy sons invited the righteous\r\nYudhishthira and defeated him in the match at dice. O king, of this deed\r\nof utter iniquity I behold this expiation whereby, O chief of the Kurus,\r\nthy son, freed from sin, may win back his position among good men. Let\r\nthe sons of Pandu, obtain that which was given unto them by thee. For,\r\nverily, even this is the highest morality that a king should remain\r\ncontent with his own, and never covet another's possessions. Thy good\r\nname then would not suffer nor would family dissensions ensue, nor\r\nunrighteousness be thine. This then is thy prime duty now,--to gratify\r\nthe Pandavas and disgrace Sakuni. If thou wishest to restore to thy sons\r\nthe good fortune they have lost, then, O king, do thou speedily adopt\r\nthis line of conduct. If thou dost not act so, the Kurus will surely meet\r\nwith destruction, for neither Bhimasena nor Arjuna, if angry, will leave\r\nany of their foes unslain. What is there in the world which is\r\nunattainable to those who cannot among their warriors Savyasachin skilled\r\nin arms; who have the Gandiva, the most powerful of all weapons in the\r\nworld, for their bow; and who have amongst them the mighty Bhima also as\r\na warrior? Formerly, as soon as thy son was born, I told thee,--Forsake\r\nthou this inauspicious child of thine. Herein lieth the good of thy\r\nrace.--But thou didst not then act accordingly. Nor also, O king, have I\r\npointed out to thee the way of thy welfare. If thou doest as I have\r\ncounselled, thou shalt not have to repent afterwards. If thy son consent\r\nto reign in peace jointly with the sons of Pandu, passing thy days in joy\r\nthou shalt not have to repent. Should it be otherwise, abandon thou thy\r\nchild for thy own happiness. Putting Duryodhana aside, do thou install\r\nthe son of Pandu in the sovereignty, and let, O king, Ajatasatru, free\r\nfrom passion, rule the earth virtuously. All the kings of the earth,\r\nthen, like Vaisyas, will, without delay, pay homage unto us. And, O king,\r\nlet Duryodhana and Sakuni and Karna with alacrity wait upon the Pandavas.\r\nAnd let Dussasana, in open court, ask forgiveness of Bhimasena and of the\r\ndaughter of Drupada also.

By doing this, O monarch, thou wouldst do what was\r\nproper.'\r\n\r\n'Dhritarashtra said, 'These words, O Vidura, then thou hast spoken in\r\nthis assembly, with reference to the Pandavas and myself, are for their\r\ngood but not for ours. My mind doth not approve them. How hast thou\r\nsettled all this in thy mind now? When thou hast spoken all this on\r\nbehalf of the Pandavas, I perceive that thou art not friendly to me. How\r\ncan I abandon my son for the sake of the sons of Pandu? Doubtless they\r\nare my sons, but Duryodhana is sprung from my body. Who then, speaking\r\nwith impartiality, will ever counsel me to renounce my own body for the\r\nsake of others? O Vidura, all that thou sayest is crooked, although I\r\nhold thee in high esteem. Stay or go as thou likest. However much may she\r\nbe humoured, an unchaste will forsaketh her husband.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, O king, saying this Dhritarashtra rose suddenly and\r\nwent into the inner apartments.

Indeed, as a young damsel doth not like a husband of three score,\r\neven so Dhritarashtra did not like my words. Surely, destruction will\r\novertake the Kuru race, surely Dhritarashtra will never acquire good\r\nfortune.

Or let this wicked son of thine, O monarch, along and\r\nunaccompanied, himself go to the forest and live with the sons of Pandu.\r\nFor then, if the Pandavas, from association, feel an attachment for\r\nDuryodhana, then, O king of men, good fortune may be thine. (This,\r\nhowever, may not be)! For it hath been heard that one's congenital nature\r\nleaveth him not till death. But what do Bhishma and Drona and Vidura\r\nthink? What also dost thou think?

Neither Bhishma, nor Drona, nor Vidura, nor Gandhari liked this\r\ngame at dice. No doubt, it was begot of folly. And, O thou who delightest\r\nin the observance of vows, O illustrious one, knowing everything yet\r\ninfluenced by paternal affection, I am unable to cast off my senseless\r\nson, Duryodhana!'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'O king, O son of Vichitravirya, what thou sayest is true!\r\nWe know it well that a son is the best of all things and that there is\r\nnothing that is so good as a son. Instructed by the tears of Suravi,\r\nIndra came to know that the son surpasseth in worth other valuable\r\npossessions. O monarch, I will, in this connection, relate to thee that\r\nexcellent and best of stories, the conversation between Indra and Suravi.\r\nIn days of yore, Suravi, the mother of cows was once weeping in the\r\ncelestial regions. O child, Indra took compassion upon her, and asked\r\nher, saying, 'O auspicious one! why dost thou weep? Is everything well\r\nwith the celestials? Hath any misfortune, ever so little, befallen the\r\nworld of men or serpents?' Suravi replied, 'No evil hath befallen thee\r\nthat I perceive. But I am aggrieved on account of my son, and it is\r\ntherefore, O Kausika, that I weep! See, O chief of the celestials, yonder\r\ncruel husbandman is belabouring my weak son with the wooden stick, and\r\noppressing him with the (weight of the) plough, in consequence of which\r\nmy child agitated with agony is falling upon the ground and is at the\r\npoint of death. At sight of this, O lord of the celestials, I am filled\r\nwith compassion, and my mind is agitated! The one that is the stronger of\r\nthe pair is bearing his burthen of greater weight (with ease), but, O\r\nVasava, the other is lean, and weak and is a mass of veins and arteries!\r\nHe beareth his burthen with difficulty! And it is for him that I grieve.\r\nSee, O Vasava, sore inflicted with the whip, and harassed exceedingly, he\r\nis unable to bear his burthen. And it is for him that, moved by grief, I\r\nweep in heaviness of heart and these tears of compassion trickle down my\r\neyes!'\r\n\r\n\"Sakra said, 'O fair one, when thousands of thy son are (daily)\r\noppressed, why dost thou grieve for one under infliction?' Suravi\r\nreplied. 'Although I have a thousand offspring, yet my affections flow\r\nequally towards all! But, O Sakra, I feel greater compassion for one that\r\nis weak and innocent!'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa continued, 'Then Indra having heard these words of Suravi, was\r\nmuch surprised, and O thou of the Kuru race, he became convinced that a\r\nson is dearer than one's life! And the illustrious chastiser of Paka\r\nthereupon suddenly poured there a thick shower and caused obstruction to\r\nthe husbandman's work. And as Suravi said, thy affections, O king,\r\nequally flow towards all thy sons. Let them be greater towards those that\r\nare weak! And as my son Pandu is to me, so art thou, O son, and so also\r\nVidura of profound wisdom! It is out of affection that I tell you all\r\nthis! O Bharata, thou art possessed of a hundred and one sons, but Pandu\r\nhath only five. And they are in a bad plight and passing their days in\r\nsorrow. How may they save their lives, how may they thrive such thoughts\r\nregarding the distressed sons of Pritha continually agitate my soul! O\r\nking of the earth, if thou desirest all the Kauravas to live, let thy son\r\nDuryodhana make peace with the Pandavas!'\""

And, O exalted one, many Munis had come\r\nthere to behold the high-souled Yudhishthira, dwelling in an ascetic\r\nasylum, clad in deer-skin and wearing matted locks. It was there, O king\r\nof kings, that I heard of the grave error committed by thy sons and the\r\ncalamity and terrible danger arisen from dice that had overtaken them.\r\nTherefore, it is that I have come to thee, for the good of the Kauravas,\r\nsince, O exalted one, my affection is great for thee and I am delighted\r\nwith thee!

Why dost thou overlook then this great\r\nevil that is about to overtake all? And, O descendant of the Kurus, for\r\nthose wrongs that have been perpetrated in thy court, which are even like\r\nthe acts of wretched outcasts, thou art not well-thought amongst the\r\nascetics!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then turning to the wrathful prince Duryodhana,\r\nthe illustrious Rishi Maitreya addressed him in these soft words, 'O\r\nmighty-armed Duryodhana, O best of all eloquent men, O illustrious one,\r\ngive heed unto the words I utter for my good! O king, seek not to quarrel\r\nwith the Pandavas! And, O bull among men, compass thou thy own good as\r\nalso of the Pandavas, of the Kurus and of the world!

When those\r\nhigh-souled ones went from hence that Rakshasa of fierce soul obstructed\r\ntheir nocturnal path even like an immoveable hill. And even as a tiger\r\nslayeth a little deer, Bhima, that foremost of all endued with strength,\r\nand ever delighted in fight, slew that monster. Consider also, O king,\r\nhow while out on his campaign of conquest, Bhima slew in battle that\r\nmighty warrior, Jarasandha, possessing the strength of ten thousand\r\nelephants. Related to Vasudeva and having the sons of king Drupada as\r\ntheir brothers-in-law, who that is subject to decrepitude and death would\r\nundertake to cope with them in battle? O bull of the Bharata race, let\r\nthere be peace between thee and Pandavas! Follow thou my counsels and\r\nsurrender not thyself to anger!\r\n\r\n'O king, thus admonished by Maitreya, Duryodhana began to slap his thigh\r\nresembling the trunk of the elephant, and smilingly began to scratch the\r\nground with his foot. And the wicked wretch spake not a word, but hung\r\ndown his head. And, O monarch, beholding Duryodhana thus offer him a\r\nslight by scratching the earth silently, Maitreya became angry. And, as\r\nif commissioned by fate, Maitreya, the best of Munis, overwhelmed by\r\nwrath, set his mind upon cursing Duryodhana!

Do thou tell me how the encounter took place between the\r\nRakshasa and Bhimasena!'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'Listen to the story of that feat of Bhimasena of super\r\nhuman achievements! I have often heard of it in course of my conversation\r\nwith the Pandavas (while I was with them)\r\n\r\n'O foremost of kings, defeated at dice the Pandavas departed from hence\r\nand travelling for three days and nights they at length reached those\r\nwoods that go by the name of Kamyaka. O king, just after the dreadful\r\nhour of midnight when all nature is asleep, when man-eating Rakshasas of\r\nterrible deeds begin to wander, the ascetics and the cowherds and other\r\nrangers of the forest used to shun the woods of Kamyaka and fly to a\r\ndistance from fear of cannibals. And, O Bharata, as the Pandavas were at\r\nthis hour entering those woods a fearful Rakshasa of flaming eyes\r\nappeared before them with a lighted brand, obstructing their path. And\r\nwith outstretched arms and terrible face, he stood obstructing the way on\r\nwhich those perpetuators of the Kuru race were proceeding. With eight\r\nteeth standing out, with eyes of coppery hue, and with the hair of his\r\nhead blazing and standing erect, the fiend looked like a mass of clouds\r\nreflecting the rays of the sun or mingled with lightning flashes and\r\ngraced with flocks of cranes underneath on their wings. And uttering\r\nfrightful yells and roaring like a mass of clouds charged with rain, the\r\nfiend began to spread the illusion proper to his species. Hearing that\r\nterrible roar, birds along with other creatures that live on land or in\r\nwater, began to drop down in all directions, uttering cries of fear. And\r\nin consequence of the deer and the leopards and the buffaloes and the\r\nbears flying about in all directions, it seemed as if the forest itself\r\nwas in motion. And swayed by the wind raised by the sighs of the\r\nRakshasa, creepers growing at a great distance seemed to embrace the\r\ntrees with their arms of coppery leaves. And at that moment, a violent\r\nwind began to blow, and the sky became darkened with the dust that\r\ncovered it. And as grief is the greatest enemy of the object of the five\r\nsenses, even so appeared before the Pandavas that unknown foe of theirs.\r\nAnd beholding the Pandavas from a distance clad in black deer-skins, the\r\nRakshasa obstructed their passage through the forest even like the\r\nMainaka mountain. And at the sight of him never seen before the\r\nlotus-eyed Krishna, agitated with fear, closed her eyes. And she whose\r\nbraids had been dishevelled by the hand of Dussasana, stationed in the\r\nmidst of the five Pandavas, looked like a stream chafing amid five hills.\r\nAnd seeing her overwhelmed with fear the five Pandavas supported her as\r\nthe five senses influenced by desire adhere to the pleasures relating to\r\ntheir objects. And Dhaumya of great (ascetic) energy, in the presence of\r\nthe sons of Pandu, destroyed the fearful illusion that had been spread by\r\nthe Rakshasa, by applying various mantras, calculated to destroy the\r\nRakshasa. And beholding his illusion dispelled, the mighty Rakshasa of\r\ncrooked ways, capable of assuming any form at will, expanded his eyes in\r\nwrath and seemed like death himself. Then king Yudhishthira, endued with\r\ngreat wisdom, addressed him saying, 'Who art thou, and whose (son)? Tell\r\nus what we should do for thee.' The Rakshasa thus addressed, answered\r\nYudhishthira the just, saying, 'I am the brother of Vaka, the celebrated\r\nKirmira. I live at ease in these deserted woods of Kamyaka, daily\r\nprocuring my food by vanquishing men in fight. Who are ye that have come\r\nnear me in the shape of my food? Defeating ye all in fight, I will eat ye\r\nwith pleasure.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'O Bharata, hearing these words of the wretch,\r\nYudhishthira announced his own name and lineage, saying, 'I am king\r\nYudhishthira the just, the son of Pandu, of whom thou mayst have heard.\r\nDeprived of my kingdom, I have with my brothers Bhimasena and Arjuna and\r\nthe others, in course of my wanderings, come into this terrible forest\r\nwhich is thy dominion, desirous of passing my period of exile here!'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued, 'Kirmira said unto Yudhishthira, 'By good luck it is\r\nthat fate hath accomplished today my long-accomplished desire! With\r\nweapons upraised have I been continually ranging the entire earth with\r\nthe object of slaying Bhima. But Bhima I had found not. By good luck it\r\nis that slayer of my brother, whom I had been seeking so long, hath come\r\nbefore me! It was he who in the disguise of a Brahmana slew my dear\r\nbrother Vaka in the Vetrakiya forest by virtue of his science. He hath\r\ntruly no strength of arms! It is also this one of wicked soul who\r\nformerly slew my dear friend Hidimva, living in this forest and ravished\r\nhis sister! And that fool hath now come into this deep forest of mine,\r\nwhen the night is half spent, even at the time when we wander about!\r\nToday I will wreak my long-cherished vengeance upon him, and I will today\r\ngratify (the manes of) Vaka with his blood in plenty! By slaying this\r\nenemy of the Rakshasas, I shall today be freed from the debt I owe to my\r\nfriend and my brother, and thereby attain supreme happiness! If Bhimasena\r\nwas let free formerly by Vaka, today, I will devour him in thy sight, O\r\nYudhishthira! And even as Agastya ate up and digested the mighty Asura\r\n(Vatapi) I will eat up and digest this Bhima!'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued, 'Thus addressed by the Rakshasa, the virtuous\r\nYudhishthira, steadfast in his pledges, said, 'It can never be so,--and\r\nin anger rebuked the Rakshasa.' The mighty-armed Bhima then tore up in\r\nhaste a tree of the length of ten Vyasas and stripped it of its leaves.\r\nAnd in the space of a moment the ever-victorious Arjuna stringed his bow\r\nGandiva possessing the force of the thunderbolt. And, O Bharata, making\r\nJishnu desist, Bhima approached that Rakshasa still roaring like the\r\nclouds and said unto him, 'Stay! Stay!' And thus addressing the cannibal,\r\nand tightening the cloth around his waist, and rubbing his palms, and\r\nbiting his nether lip with his teeth, and armed with the tree, the\r\npowerful Bhima rushed towards the foe. And like unto Maghavat hurling his\r\nthunderbolt, Bhima made that tree, resembling the mace of Yama himself\r\ndescend with force on the head of the cannibal. The Rakshasa, however,\r\nwas seen to remain unmoved at that blow, and wavered not in the conflict.\r\nOn the other hand, he hurled his lighted brand, flaming like lightning,\r\nat Bhima. But that foremost of warriors turned it off with his left foot\r\nin such a way that it went back towards the Rakshasa. Then the fierce\r\nKirmira on his part, all on a sudden uprooting a tree darted to the\r\nencounter like unto the mace bearing Yama himself. And that fight, so\r\ndestructive of the trees, looked like the encounter in days of yore\r\nbetween the brothers Vali and Sugriva for the possession of the same\r\nwoman. And the trees struck at the heads of the combatants, were broken\r\ninto shivers, like lotus-stalks thrown on the temples of infuriate\r\nelephants. And in that great forest, innumerable trees, crushed like unto\r\nreeds, lay scattered as rags. That encounter with trees between that\r\nforemost of Rakshasas and that best of men, O thou bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, lasted but for a moment. Then taking up a crag, the angry Rakshasa\r\nhurled it at Bhima standing before him, but the latter wavered not. Then\r\nlike unto Rahu going to devour the sun dispersing his rays with extended\r\narms, the Rakshasa with out-stretched arms darted towards Bhima, who had\r\nremained firm under the blow inflicted with the crag. And tugging at and\r\ngrappling with each other in diverse ways they appeared like two\r\ninfuriate bulls struggling with each other. Or like unto two mighty\r\ntigers armed with teeth and claws, the encounter between them waxed\r\nfierce and hard. And remembering their (late) disgrace at the hands of\r\nDuryodhana, and proud of the strength of his arms, and conscious also of\r\nKrishna looking at him, Vrikodara began to swell in vigour. And fried\r\nwith anger, Bhima seized the Rakshasa with his arms, as one elephant in\r\nrut seizeth another. And the powerful Rakshasa also in his turn seized\r\nhis adversary, but Bhimasena that foremost of all men endued with\r\nstrength, threw the cannibal down with violence. The sounds that in\r\nconsequence of those mighty combatants pressing each other's hands, were\r\nfrightful and resembled the sounds of splintering bamboos. And hurling\r\nthe Rakshasa down, seized him by the waist, and began to whirl him about,\r\neven as fierce hurricane shaketh a tree. And thus seized by the mighty\r\nBhima, the fatigued Rakshasa, became faint, and trembling all over, he\r\nstill pressed the (Pandava) with all his strength. And finding him\r\nfatigued, Vrikodara, twined his own arms round the foe, even as one\r\nbindeth a beast with cord. And the monster thereupon began to roar\r\nfrightfully, as a trumpet out of order. And the mighty Vrikodara for a\r\nlong while whirled the Rakshasa till the latter appeared to be\r\ninsensible, and began to move convulsively. And finding the Rakshasa\r\nexhausted, the son of Pandu without loss of time took him up in his arms,\r\nand slew him like a beast. And placing his knee on the waist of that\r\nwretch of Rakshasa, Vrikodara began to press the neck of the foe with his\r\nhands. Then Bhima, dragging along the earth the bruised body of the\r\nRakshasa with the eye-lids about to close, said, 'O sinful wretch, thou\r\nwilt no more have to wipe away the tears of Hidimva or Vaka, for thou too\r\nart about to go to the mansions of Yama!' And saying this, that foremost\r\nof men, his heart filled with wrath, beholding the Rakshasa destitute of\r\nclothing and ornaments, and insensible, and undergoing convulsions, let\r\nhim dead. And after that Rakshasa of hue like the clouds had been slain,\r\nthe son of that best of kings (Pandu) praised Bhima for his many\r\nqualities, and placing Krishna in their front, set out for the Dwaita\r\nwoods.\"\r\n\r\nVidura said, 'It was thus, O lord of men, that Kirmira was slain in\r\ncombat by Bhima, in obedience, O Kaurava, to the commands of Yudhishthira\r\nthe just! And having rid the forest of its pest, the victorious\r\nYudhishthira the just, began to live in that dwelling of theirs, with\r\nDraupadi. And those bulls of the Bharata race comforting Draupadi began\r\nto cheerfully extol Bhima with glad hearts. And after the Rakshasa had\r\nbeen slain, borne down by the might of Bhima's arms, those heroes entered\r\ninto the peaceful forest freed from its annoyance. Passing through the\r\ngreat forest I saw lying the body of the wicked and fearless Rakshasa\r\nslain by Bhima's might. And, O Bharata, there I heard of this achievement\r\nof Bhima from those Brahmanas who have assembled round the Pandavas.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'Hearing the account of the slaughter in combat\r\nof Kirmira, that foremost of Rakshasas, the king sighed in sorrow and\r\nbecame absorbed in thought.'\""

And, O Janardana, thou hast also appropriate unto thyself\r\nthe sacred city of Dwarka, abounding in wealth and agreeable unto the\r\nRishi themselves, and thou wilt submerge it at the end within the ocean!\r\nO slayer of Madhu, how can crookedness be in thee, devoid as thou art, O\r\nthou of the Dasarha race, of anger and envy and untruth and cruelty? O\r\nthou who knowest no deterioration, all the Rishis, coming unto thee\r\nseated in thy glory on the sacrificial ground, seek protection of thee!\r\nAnd, O slayer of Madhu, thou stayest at the end of the Yuga, contracting\r\nall things and withdrawing this universe into thy own self, thou\r\nrepressor of all foes! O thou of the Vrishni race, at the beginning of\r\nthe Yuga, there sprang from thy lotus-like navel, Brahma himself, and\r\nlord of all mobile and immobile things, and whose is this entire\r\nuniverse! When the dreadful Danavas Madhu and Kaitava were bent on\r\nslaying Brahma, beholding their impious endeavour thou wert angry, and\r\nfrom thy forehead, O Hari, sprang Sambhu, the holder of the trident. Thus\r\nthese two foremost of the deities have sprung from thy body in order to\r\ndo thy work! Even Narada it was who hath told me this! O Narayana, thou\r\ndidst, in the forest of Chaitraratha, celebrate with plentiful gifts a\r\ngrand sacrifice consisting of a multitude of rites! O God, O thou of eyes\r\nlike lotus leaves, the deeds thou hast performed while still a boy,\r\nhaving recourse to thy might and aided by Baladeva, have never been done\r\nby others, nor are they capable of being achieved by others in the\r\nfuture! Thou didst even dwell in Kailasa, accompanied by Brahmanas!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having addressed Krishna thus, the illustrious\r\nPandava, who was the soul of Krishna, became dumb, when Janardana (in\r\nreply addressed that son of Pritha) saying, 'Thou art mine and I am\r\nthine, while all that is mine is thine also! He that hateth thee hateth\r\nme as well, and he that followeth thee followeth me! O thou irrepressible\r\none, thou art Nara and I am Narayana or Hari! We are the Rishis Nara and\r\nNarayana born in the world of men for a special purpose. O Partha, thou\r\nart from me and I am from thee! O bull of the Bharata race, no one can\r\nunderstand the difference that is between us!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the illustrious Kesava had said so in the\r\nmidst of that assembly of brave kings, all excited with anger, Panchali\r\nsurrounded by Dhrishtadyumna and her other heroic brothers, approached\r\nhim of eyes like lotus leaves seated with his cousins, and, desirous of\r\nprotection, addressed in angry accents that refuge of all, saying, 'Asita\r\nand Devala have said that in the matter of the creation of all things,\r\nthou hast been indicated (by the sages) as the only Prajapati and the\r\nCreator of all the worlds! And, O irrepressible one, Jamadagnya sayeth\r\nthat thou art Vishnu, and, O slayer of Madhu, that thou art (embodiment\r\nof) Sacrifice, Sacrificer and he for whom the sacrifice is performed!\r\nAnd, O best of male beings, the Rishis indicate thee as Forgiveness and\r\nTruth! Kasyapa hath said that thou art Sacrifice sprung from Truth! O\r\nexalted one, Narada calleth thee the god of the Sadhyas, and of the\r\nSivas, as alone the Creator and the Lord of all things. And, O tiger\r\namong men, thou repeatedly sportest with the gods including, Brahma and\r\nSankara and Sakra even as children sporting with their toys! And, O\r\nexalted one, the firmament is covered by thy head, and the earth by thy\r\nfeet; these worlds are as thy womb and thou art the Eternal one! With\r\nRishis sanctified by Vedic lore and asceticism, and whose souls have been\r\npurified by penance, and who are contented with soul-vision, thou art the\r\nbest of all objects! And, O chief of all male beings; thou art the refuge\r\nof all royal sages devoted to virtuous acts, never turning their backs on\r\nthe field of the battle, and possessed of every accomplishment! Thou art\r\nthe Lord of all, thou art Omnipresent, thou art the Soul of all things,\r\nand thou art the active power pervading everything! The rulers of the\r\nseveral worlds, those worlds themselves, the stellar conjunctions, the\r\nten points of the horizon, the firmament, the moon, and the sun, are all\r\nestablished in thee! And, O mighty-armed one, the morality of (earthly)\r\ncreatures, the immortality of the universe, are established in thee! Thou\r\nart the Supreme lord of all creatures, celestial or human! Therefore it\r\nis, O slayer of Madhu, that impelled by the affection thou bearest me\r\nthat I will relate to thee my griefs! O Krishna, how could one like me,\r\nthe wife of Pritha's sons, the sister of Dhrishtadyumna, and the friend\r\nof thee, be dragged to the assembly! Alas, during my season, stained with\r\nblood, with but a single cloth on, trembling all over, and weeping, I was\r\ndragged to the court of the Kurus! Beholding me, stained with blood in\r\nthe presence of those kings in the assembly, the wicked sons of\r\nDhritarashtra laughed at me! O slayer of Madhu, while the sons of Pandu\r\nand the Panchalas and the Vrishnis lived, they dared express the desire\r\nof using me as their slave! O Krishna, I am according to the ordinance,\r\nthe daughter in-law of both Dhritarashtra and Bhishma! Yet, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, they wished to make of me a slave by force! I blame the Pandavas\r\nwho are mighty and foremost in battle, for they saw (without stirring)\r\ntheir own wedded wife known over all the world, treated with such\r\ncruelty! Oh, fie on the might of Bhimasena, fie on the Gandiva of Arjuna,\r\nfor they, O Janardana, both suffered me to be thus disgraced by little\r\nmen! This eternal course of morality is ever followed by the\r\nvirtuous--viz., that the husband, however weak, protecteth his wedded\r\nwife! By protecting the wife one protecteth his offspring and by\r\nprotecting the offspring one protecteth his own self! One's own self is\r\nbegotten on one's wife, and therefore it is that the wife is called Jaya.\r\nA wife also should protect her lord, remembering that he is to take his\r\nbirth in her womb! The Pandavas never forsake the person that soliciteth\r\ntheir protection, and yet they abandoned me who solicited it! By my five\r\nhusbands five sons of exceeding energy have been born of me: Prativindhya\r\nby Yudhishthira, Sutasoma by Vrikodara, Srutakirti by Arjuna, Satanika by\r\nNakula and Srutakarman by the youngest, all of them of energy that cannot\r\nbe baffled. For their sake, O Janardana, it was necessary to protect me!\r\nEven as (thy son) Pradyumna, they are, O Krishna, mighty warriors all!\r\nThey are foremost of bowmen, and invincible in battle by any foe! Why do\r\nthey bear the wrongs inflicted (on me) by the sons of Dhritarashtra of\r\nsuch contemptible strength? Deprived of their kingdom by deception, the\r\nPandavas were made bondsmen and I myself was dragged to the assembly\r\nwhile in my season, and having only a single cloth on! Fie on that\r\nGandiva which none else can string save Arjuna and Bhima and thyself, O\r\nslayer of Madhu! Fie on the strength of Bhima, and fie on the prowess of\r\nArjuna, since, O Krishna, Duryodhana (after what he had done) hath drawn\r\nbreath even for a moment! He it is, O slayer of Madhu, who formerly drove\r\nthe guileless Pandavas with their mother from the kingdom, while they\r\nwere children still engaged in study and the observance of their vows. It\r\nis that sinful wretch, who, horrible to relate, mixed in Bhima's food\r\nfresh and virulent poison in full dose. But, O Janardana, Bhima digested\r\nthat poison with the food, without sustaining any injury, for, O best of\r\nmen and mighty-armed one, Bhima's days had not been ended! O Krishna, it\r\nis Duryodhana who at the house standing by the banyan called Pramana\r\nbound Bhima sleeping unsuspectingly, and casting him into the Ganges\r\nreturned to the city. But the powerful Bhimasena the son of Kunti,\r\npossessed of mighty arms, on waking from sleep, tore his bonds and rose\r\nfrom the water. It is Duryodhana, who caused venomous black-cobras to\r\nbite all over the body of Bhimasena, but that slayer of foes died not.\r\nAwaking, the son of Kunti smashed all the serpents and with his left hand\r\nkilled (the agent, viz.) the favourite charioteer of Duryodhana. Again,\r\nwhile the children were asleep at Varanavata with their mother, it is he\r\nwho set fire to the house intending to burn them to death. Who is there\r\ncapable of doing such an act? It was then that the illustrious Kunti,\r\novertaken by this calamity, and surrounded by the flames, began to cry\r\nout in terror, speaking to the children, 'Alas, I am undone! How shall we\r\nescape from this fire today! Alas, I shall meet with destruction with my\r\nlittle children!' Then Bhima, possessed of mighty arms, and prowess like\r\nunto the force of the wind, comforted his illustrious mother as also his\r\nbrothers, saying, 'Like that king of birds, Garuda, the son of Vinata, I\r\nwill spring up into the air. We have no fear from this fire'. And then\r\ntaking his mother on his left flank, and the king in his right, and the\r\ntwins on each shoulder, and Vivatsu on his back, the mighty Vrikodara,\r\nthus taking all of them, at one leap cleared the fire and delivered his\r\nmother and brother from the conflagration. Setting out that night with\r\ntheir renowned mother, they came near the forest of Hidimva. And while\r\nfatigued and distressed, they were sleeping fast with her, a Rakshasa\r\nwoman called Hidimva approached them. Beholding the Pandavas with their\r\nmother asleep on the ground, influenced by desire she sought to have\r\nBhimasena for her lord. The weak one then took up Bhima's feet on her lap\r\nto press them with her soft hands. The mighty Bhima of immeasurable\r\nenergy, of prowess that could not be baffled, then woke from sleep, and\r\nasked her, saying, 'O thou of faultless features, what dost thou wish\r\nhere?' Thus asked by him, the Rakshasa lady of faultless features,\r\ncapable, besides, of assuming any form at will, replied unto the\r\nhigh-souled Bhima, saying, 'Do ye speedily fly from this place! My\r\nbrother gifted with strength will come to slay ye! Therefore speed and\r\ntarry not!' But Bhima haughtily said, 'I do not fear him! If he cometh\r\nhere, I will slay him!' Hearing their converse, that vilest of cannibals\r\ncame to the spot. Of frightful form and dreadful to behold, uttering loud\r\ncries as he came, the Rakshasa said, 'O Hidimva, with whom dost thou\r\nconverse? Bring him unto me, I will eat him up. It behoveth thee to tarry\r\nnot.' But moved by compassion, the Rakshasa lady of faultless features\r\nand pure heart said nothing out of pity. Then the man-eating monster,\r\nuttering dreadful cries, rushed at Bhima with great force. And\r\napproaching him furiously, the mighty cannibal, possessed with rage,\r\ncaught hold of Bhima's hand with his own and clenching fast his other\r\nhand and making it hard as the thunder-bolt of Indra, suddenly struck\r\nBhima a blow that descended with the force of lightning. His hand having\r\nbeen seized by the Rakshasa, Vrikodara, without being able to brook it,\r\nflew into a rage. Then a dreadful combat took place between Bhimasena and\r\nHidimva, both skilled in all weapons and which was like unto the\r\nencounter of Vasava with Vritra. And, O sinless one, after sporting with\r\nthe Rakshasa for a long while the powerful Bhima of mighty energy slew\r\nthe cannibal when the latter had become weak with exertion. Then having\r\nslain Hidimva, and taking (his sister) Hidimva at their head, of whom was\r\n(subsequently) born Ghatotkacha, Bhima and his brothers went away. Then\r\nall those repressors of their foes, accompanied by their mother and\r\nsurrounded by many Brahmanas proceeded towards Ekachakra. In the matter\r\nof this their journey, Vyasa ever engaged in their welfare had become\r\ntheir counsellor. Then arriving at Ekachakra, the Pandavas of rigid vows\r\nthere also slew a mighty cannibal, Vaka by name, terrible as Hidimva\r\nhimself. And having slain that fierce cannibal, Bhima that foremost of\r\nsmiters, went with all his brothers to the capital of Drupada. And, O\r\nKrishna, as thou hadst acquired Rukmini, the daughter of Bhishmaka, even\r\nso Savyasachin, while residing there, obtained me! O slayer of Madhu,\r\nArjuna won me in the Swayamvara, having performed a feat difficult of\r\nachievement by others and having fought also with the assembled kings!\r\n\r\n'Thus, O Krishna, afflicted with numerous griefs, and in great distress,\r\nam I living, with Dhaumya at our head, but deprived of the company of the\r\nadorable Kunti! Why do these that are gifted with strength and possessed\r\nof the prowess of the lion, sit indifferently, beholding me thus\r\nafflicted by enemies so despicable? Suffering such wrongs at the hands of\r\nwicked and evil-doing foes of small strength, am I to burn in grief so\r\nlong? Born I was in a great race, coming into the world in an\r\nextraordinary way! I am also the beloved wife of the Pandavas, and the\r\ndaughter-in-law of the illustrious Pandu! The foremost of women and\r\ndevoted to my husbands, even I, O Krishna, was seized by hair, O slayer\r\nof Madhu, in the sight of the Pandavas, each of whom is like an Indra\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\n'Saying this the mild-speeched Krishna hid her face with her soft hands\r\nlike the buds of lotus, and began to weep. And the tears of Panchali\r\nbegot of grief washed her deep, plump and graceful breasts crowned with\r\nauspicious marks. And wiping her eyes and sighing frequently she said\r\nthese words angrily and in a choked voice, 'Husbands, or sons, or\r\nfriends, or brothers, or father, have I none! Nor have I thee, O thou\r\nslayer of Madhu, for ye all, beholding me treated so cruelly by inferior\r\nfoes, sit still unmoved! My grief at Karna's ridicule is incapable of\r\nbeing assuaged! On these grounds I deserve to be ever protected by thee,\r\nO Kesava, viz., our relationship, thy respect (for me), our friendship,\r\nand thy lordship (over me)\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'In that assembly of heroes Vasudeva then spake\r\nunto the weeping Draupadi as follows, 'O fair lady, the wives of those\r\nwith whom thou art angry, shall weep even like thee, beholding their\r\nhusbands dead on the ground, weltering in blood and their bodies covered\r\nwith the arrows of Vivatsu! Weep not, lady, for I will exert to the\r\nutmost of my powers for the sons of Pandu! I promise thou shalt (once\r\nmore) be the queen of kings! The heavens might fall, or the Himavat might\r\nsplit, the earth might be rent, or the waters of the ocean might dry up,\r\nbut my words shall never be futile!' Hearing those words of Achyuta in\r\nreply, Draupadi looked obliquely at her third husband (Arjuna). And, O\r\nmighty king, Arjuna said unto Draupadi, 'O thou of beautiful coppery\r\neyes, grieve not! O illustrious one, it shall be even as the slayer of\r\nMadhu hath said! It can never be otherwise, O beautiful one!'\r\n\r\n\"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'I will slay Drona, Sikhandin will slay the\r\ngrandfather. And Bhimasena will slay Duryodhana, and Dhananjaya will slay\r\nKarna. And, O sister, assisted by Rama and Krishna, we are invincible in\r\nbattle by even the slayer himself of Vritra--what are the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'After these words had been spoken, all the\r\nheroes there turned their faces towards Vasudeva, who then in their midst\r\nbegan to speak as follows.'\""

And, O foremost of kings, Kshemavriddhi on his part, discharged\r\nat Samva mightier volley of shafts, aided by his powers of illusion! And\r\ndispersing by counter illusion that discharge inspired by illusion, Samva\r\nshowered on his (adversary's) car a thousand arrows! Then pierced by the\r\nshafts on Samva and overwhelmed there with Kshemavriddhi, the commander\r\nof the hostile host, left the field by the help of his fleet-steed! And\r\nwhen the wicked general of Salwa had left the field, a mighty Daitya\r\ncalled Vegavat rushed at my son! And, O best of monarchs, thus attacked,\r\nthe heroic Samva, the perpetuator of the Vrishni race, bore that onset of\r\nVegavat, keeping his ground. And, O son of Kunti, the heroic Samva, of\r\nprowess incapable of being baffled, whirling a quickly-going mace, hurled\r\nit speedily at Vegavat! And, O king, struck with that mace, Vegavat fell\r\ndown on the ground, like a weather-beaten and faded lord of the forest of\r\ndecayed roots! And on that heroic Asura of mighty energy, being slain\r\nwith the mace, my son entered within that mighty host and began to fight\r\nwith all. And, O great king, a well-known Danava named Vivindhya, a\r\nmighty warrior wielding a large and powerful bow, encountered\r\nCharudeshna! And, O monarch, the encounter between Charudeshna and\r\nVivindhya was as fierce as that in days of yore between Vritra and\r\nVasava! And enraged with each other the combatants pierced each other\r\nwith their arrows, uttering loud roars like unto two powerful lions! Then\r\nthe son of Rukmini fixed on his bow-string a mighty weapon possessing the\r\nsplendour of fire or the sun, and capable of destroying all foes, having\r\nfirst vivified it with incantations! Then, O monarch, that mighty warrior\r\nmy son, fired with wrath, challenged Vivindhya and discharged the weapon\r\nat him. And the Danava struck with that weapon, fell down on the ground a\r\nlifeless corpse! And beholding Vivindhya slain, and the whole host waver,\r\nSalwa advanced again on his beautiful car capable of going everywhere.\r\nAnd, O king of mighty arms, beholding Salwa on that beautiful car of his,\r\nthe combatants of Dwaraka wavered with fear! But, O thou of the Kuru\r\nrace, Pradyumna sailed out, and, O great king, bidding the Anarttas be of\r\ngood cheer, said, 'Waver ye not, and staying behold me fight I Even I\r\nshall, by force, repell that car with Salwa on it! Ye Yadavas, this day,\r\nI shall, with my weapons like unto serpents discharged from my bow with\r\nmy hand, destroy this host of the lord of Saubha! Be of good cheer, ye\r\nall! Fear not! The lord of Saubha will be slain today! Attached by me,\r\nthe wretch will meet with destruction together with his car!' O son of\r\nPandu, upon Pradyumna speaking thus with cheerful heart, the Yadava host,\r\nO hero, remained on the field, and began to fight cheerfully!'\""

And\r\nthe car he rode was drawn by excellent steeds in mail. And over it stood\r\na standard bearing the figure of a Makara with gaping mouth and fierce as\r\nYama. And with his steeds, more flying than running on the ground, he\r\nrushed against the foe And the hero equipped with quiver and sword, with\r\nfingers cased in leather, twanged his bow possessed of the splendour of\r\nthe lightning, with great strength, and transferring it from hand to\r\nhand, as if in contempt of the enemy, spread confusion among the Danavas\r\nand other warriors of the city of Saubha. And as hot in contempt of the,\r\nfoe, and continuously slew the Danavas in battle, no one could mark the\r\nslightest interval between his successive shafts. And the colour of his\r\nface changed not, and his limbs trembled not. And people only heard his\r\nloud leonine roars indicative of wonderful valour. And the aquatic\r\nmonster with mouth wide open, that devourer of all fishes, placed on\r\ngolden flag-staff of that best of cars, struck terror into the hearts of\r\nSalwa's warriors. And, O king, Pradyumna, the mower of foes rushed with\r\nspeed against Salwa himself so desirous of an encounter! And, O\r\nperpetuator of the Kuru race, braved by the heroic Pradyumna in that\r\nmighty battle, the angry Salwa could ill bear the challenge! And that\r\nconqueror of hostile cities, Salwa, maddened by anger, descended from his\r\nbeautiful car of unchecked speed, resolved to encounter Pradyumna. And\r\nthe people beheld the fight between Salwa and the foremost of Vrishni\r\nheroes, which was even like unto the encounter between Vasava with Vali.\r\nAnd, O hero, mounting on his beautiful car decked with gold and furnished\r\nwith flags and flag-staffs and quivers, the illustrious and mighty Salwa\r\nbegan to discharge his arrows at Pradyumna! Pradyumna also by the energy\r\nof his arms, overwhelmed Salwa in the combat by a thick shower of arrows.\r\nThe king of Saubha, however, thus attacked in battle by Pradyumna,\r\nendured him not, but discharged at my son arrows that were like blazing\r\nfire. But the mighty Pradyumna parried off that arrowy shower. Beholding\r\nthis, Salwa rained on my son other weapons of blazing splendour. Then, O\r\nforemost of monarchs, pierced by the shafts of Salwa, the son of Rukmini\r\ndischarged without loss of time an arrow that was capable of entering the\r\nvitals of a foe in fight. And that winged shaft shot by my son, piercing\r\nSalwa's mail, entered his heart--whereupon he fell down, in a swoon. And\r\nbeholding the heroic king Salwa fallen down deprived of sense, the\r\nforemost of the Danavas fled away rending the ground beneath their feet.\r\nAnd, O lord of the earth, the army of Salwa sent up exclamations of Oh!\r\nand Alas! seeing their king, the lord of Saubha, drop down bereft of\r\nsense! And O son of the Kuru race, regaining his senses, the mighty Salwa\r\nrose and all of a sudden discharged his arrows on Pradyumna. Then the\r\nheroic and mighty armed Pradyumna, sorely pierced by his adversary about\r\nhis throat, was enfeebled on his car. And, O mighty king, wounding the\r\nson of Rukmini, Salwa sent up a shout like unto the roar of a lion, and\r\nfilling the entire earth with it! And, O Bharata, when my son became\r\nsenseless, Salwa, without losing a moment, again discharged at him other\r\nshafts difficult to bear. And pierced with numberless arrows and deprived\r\nof his senses, Pradyumna, O chief of the Kuru race, became motionless on\r\nthe field of battle!'\""

And the combatants of the Vrishni\r\nand Andhaka races burst into exclamations of Oh! and Alas! while great\r\njoy was felt by the enemy and beholding him thus deprived of sense, his\r\ntrained charioteer, the son of Daruka, soon carried him off the field by\r\nthe help of his steeds. The car had not gone far when that best of\r\nwarriors regained his senses, and taking up his bow addressed his\r\ncharioteer, saying, 'O son of the Suta tribe, what hast thou done? Why\r\ndost thou go leaving the field of battle? This is not the custom of the\r\nVrishni heroes in battle! O son of a Suta, hast thou been bewildered at\r\nthe sight of a Salwa in that fierce encounter? Or hast thou been\r\ndisheartened, beholding the fight? O! tell me truly thy mind!'

On the other hand, O son of Kesava, the\r\ntask, I ween, of vanquishing Salwa is difficult for thee! Therefore, O\r\nhero, I am slowly retiring from the field.

What will\r\nthe irrepressible Madhava, the elder brother of Gada, say to me when he\r\nheareth that I have left the field of battle in bewilderment or that I\r\nhave been struck on the back--a run-away from the combat!

But, O thou blest with length of days,\r\nthose that guide the car are taught that the warrior on the car is, by\r\nall means, to be protected by his charioteer! Thou wert also much\r\nafflicted! Thou wert much wounded by the arrows shot by Salwa. Thou wert\r\nalso deprived of thy senses, O hero! Therefore is it that I retired from\r\nthe field.' But, O chief of the Satwatas, now that thou hast regained thy\r\nsenses without much ado, do thou, O son of Kesava, witness my skill in\r\nguiding the horses! I have been begotten by Daruka, and I have been duly\r\ntrained! I will now penetrate into the celebrated array of Salwa without\r\nfear!\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva continued, 'Saying this, O hero, the charioteer, pulling the\r\nreins, began to lead the horses with speed towards the field of battle.\r\nAnd, O king, struck with the whip and pulled by the reins those excellent\r\nsteeds seemed to be flying in the air, performing various beautiful\r\nmotion, now circular, now similar, now dissimilar, now to the right, now\r\nto the left. And, O king, those steeds understanding as it were the\r\nintention of Daruka's son endued with such lightness of hand, burned with\r\nenergy, and seemed to go without touching the ground with their feet!\r\nThat bull among men wheeled round Salwa's host so easily that they who\r\nwitnessed it wondered exceedingly. And the lord of Saubha, unable to bear\r\nthat manoeuvre of Pradyumna, instantly sent three shafts at the\r\ncharioteer of his antagonist! The charioteer, however, without taking any\r\nnote of the force of those arrows, continued to go along the right. Then\r\nthe lord of Saubha, O hero, again discharged at my son by Rukmini, a\r\nshower of various kinds of weapons! But that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\nthe son of Rukmini, showing with a smile his lightness of hand, cut all\r\nthose weapons off as they reached him. Finding his arrows cut by\r\nPradyumna, the lord of Saubha, having recourse to the dreadful illusion\r\nnatural to Asuras began to pour a thick shower of arrows. But cutting\r\ninto pieces those powerful Daitya weapons shot at him in mid-career by\r\nmeans of his Brahma weapon, Pradyumna discharged winged shafts of other\r\nkings. And these delighting in blood, warding off the shafts of Daitya,\r\npierced his head, bosom and face. And at those wounds Salwa fell down\r\nsenseless. And on the mean-minded Salwa falling down, afflicted with\r\nPradyumna's arrows, the son of Rukmini aimed another arrow at him,\r\ncapable of destroying every foe. And beholding that arrow worshipped by\r\nall the Dasarhas, and flaming like fire and fatal as a venomous snake,\r\nfixed on the bow-string, the firmament was filled with exclamations of\r\nOh! and Alas! Then all the celestials with Indra and the lord of\r\ntreasures (Kubera) at their head sent Narada and the god of wind endued\r\nwith the speed of the mind. And these two approaching the son of Rukmini\r\ndelivered unto him the message of the celestial, saying, O hero, king\r\nSalwa is nor to be slain by thee! Do thou draw back the arrow. He is\r\nunslayable by thee in fight! There breatheth not a person who cannot be\r\nkilled by that arrow! O thou of mighty arms, the Creator hath ordained\r\nhis death at the hands of Krishna, the son of Devaki! Let this be not\r\nfalsified!--Thereupon with a glad heart, Pradyumna withdrew that best of\r\narrows from his excellent bow and deposited it back in his quiver. And\r\nthen, O foremost of kings, the mighty Salwa, afflicted with the arrows of\r\nPradyumna, rose disheartened, and speedily went away. Then O king, the\r\nwicked Salwa, thus afflicted by the Vrishnis, mounted on his car of\r\nprecious metals, and leaving Dwaraka scudded through the skies!'\""

On my\r\narrival I found Dwaraka shorn of its splendour, and, O great monarch,\r\nthere were not sounds of Vedic recitation or sacrificial offering, And\r\nthe excellent damsels were all destitute of ornaments, and the gardens\r\nwere devoid of beauty. And alarmed by the aspect, I asked the son of\r\nHridika saying, 'Why is it that the men and women of the city of the\r\nVrishnis are so woe-begone, O tiger among men?' O thou best of kings thus\r\nasked the son of Hridika (Kritavarman) relate to me in detail the\r\ninvasion of the city by Salwa, and his subsequent departure from it. And,\r\nO thou foremost of Bharatas, hearing all, even then I made up my mind to\r\nslay Salwa. And encouraging the citizens, O best of Bharatas, I\r\ncheerfully addressed king Ahuka, and Anakdundhuvi, and the chief heroes\r\nof the Vrishni race, saying, 'Do ye, O bulls among the Yadavas, stay in\r\nthe city, taking every care, and know that I go to slay Salwa! I return\r\nnot to the city of Dwaravati without slaying him. I will again come to ye\r\nhaving compassed the destruction of Salwa together with his car of\r\nprecious metals. Do ye strike up the sharp and middle and flat notes of\r\nthe Dundhuvi so dreadful to foes!' And O thou bull of the Bharata race,\r\nthus adequately encouraged by me, those heroes cheerfully said unto me,\r\n'Go and slay the enemies!' And thus receiving the benedictions of those\r\nwarriors with glad hearts, and causing the Brahmanas to utter auspicious\r\nwords and bowing down to the best of the regenerate ones, and to Siva\r\nalso, I set out on my car unto which were yoked the horses Saivya, and\r\nSugriva, filling all sides with the clatter (of my wheels) and blowing\r\nthat best of conchs, the Panchajanya! And, O king, O tiger among men,\r\naccompanied by my redoubted and victorious army consisting of the four\r\nkinds of the forces so persevering in battle, I set out. And leaving many\r\ncountries, and mountains, crowned with trees, and pieces of water, and\r\nstreams, I at last arrived at the country of Matrikavarta. It is there, O\r\nthou tiger among men, that I heard that Salwa was coursing on his car of\r\nprecious metals near the ocean, and I followed in his pursuit. And, O\r\nthou slayer of thy foes, having reached the main, Salwa on his car of\r\ncostly metals was in the midst of the deep heaving with billows! And on\r\nseeing me from a distance, O Yudhishthira, that one of wicked soul\r\nhimself challenged me repeatedly to the fight. And many arrows capable of\r\npiercing to the quick, discharged from my bow reached not his car. And at\r\nthis I was wroth! And, O king, that essentially sinful wretch of a\r\nDaitya's son of irrepressible energy, on his part began to shoot thousand\r\nupon thousands of arrows in torrents! And, O Bharata, he rained shafts\r\nupon my soldiers and upon my charioteer and upon my steeds! But without\r\nthinking of the shafts, we continued the conflict. Then the warriors\r\nfollowing Salwa poured on me straight arrows by thousands. And the Asuras\r\ncovered my horses and my car and Daruka with arrows capable of piercing\r\nthe very vitals. And, O hero, I could not at that time see either my\r\nhorses, or my car, or my charioteer Daruka! And I with my army was\r\ncovered with weapons. And, O son of Kunti, superhumanly skilled in\r\nweapons, I also let fly from my bow arrows by tens of thousands,\r\ninspiring them with mantras! But as that car of costly metals was in the\r\nsky, full two miles off, it could not, O Bharata, be seen by my troops.\r\nThey could therefore only remaining on the field of battle look on like\r\nspectators in a place of amusement, cheering me on by shouts loud as the\r\nroar of the lion, and also by the sound of their clapping. And the tinted\r\narrows shot by the fore-part of hand penetrated into the bodies of the\r\nDanavas like biting insects. And then arose cries in the car of precious\r\nmetals from those that were dying of wounds by those sharp arrows and\r\nfalling into the waters of the mighty ocean. And the Danavas deprived of\r\ntheir arms, necks, and wearing the form of Kavandhas,--fell, sending up\r\ntremendous roars. And as they fell they were devoured by animals living\r\nin the waters of the ocean. And then I powerfully blew the Panchajanya\r\nobtained from the waters and graceful as the lotus-stalk and white as\r\nmilk or the Kunda flower or the moon or silver. And seeing his soldiers\r\nfall, Salwa the possessor of the car of precious metals, began to fight\r\nwith the help of illusion. And then he began to ceaselessly hurl at me\r\nmaces, and ploughshares, and winged darts and lances, and javelins, and\r\nbattle-axes, and swords and arrows blazing like javelins and\r\nthunderbolts, and nooses, and broad swords, and bullets from barrels, and\r\nshafts, and axes, and rockets. And permitting them to come towards me, I\r\nsoon destroyed them all by counter-illusion. And on this illusion being\r\nrendered ineffectual, he began the contest with mountain peaks. And, O\r\nBharata, then there was darkness and light alternately, and the day was\r\nnow fair, and now gloomy, and now hot, and now cold. And there was a\r\nperfect shower of coals, and ashes, and weapons. And creating such\r\nillusion the enemy fought with me. And ascertaining it I destroyed his\r\nillusion by counter-illusion. And in the due time I showered arrows all\r\nround. And then, O mighty king, the dome of heaven blazed as with a\r\nhundred suns, and, O son of Kunti with one hundred moons, and thousands\r\nand ten thousands of stars! And then none could ascertain whether it was\r\nday or night, or distinguish the points of the horizon. And, becoming\r\nbewildered, I fixed on my bowstring the weapon called Pragnastra. And, O\r\nson of Kunti, the weapon went like unto flakes of pure cotton blown away\r\nby the winds! And a great fight took place, calculated to make the down\r\non one's body stand on end. And O best of monarchs, having regained,\r\nlight, I again fought with the enemy!'\""

He seemed to be one of Ahuka's\r\nfollowers. And sadly and in a voice choked in sorrow, know, O\r\nYudhishthira, he said words'--O warrior, Ahuka, the lord of Dwaraka, hath\r\nsaid these words unto thee! O Kesava, hear what thy father's friend\r\nsayeth: O son of the Vrishni race, O thou irrepressible one, in thy\r\nabsence today Salwa, coming to Dwaraka, hath by main force killed\r\nVasudeva! Therefore, no need of battle any more. Cease, O Janardana! Do\r\nthou defend Dwaraka! This is thy principal duty!--Hearing these words of\r\nhis, my heart became heavy, and I could not ascertain what I should do\r\nand what I should not. And, O hero, hearing of that great misfortune, I\r\nmentally censured Satyaki, and Baladeva, and also that mighty pradyumna.\r\nHaving reposed on them the duty of protecting Dwaraka and Vasudeva, I had\r\ngone, O son of the Kuru race, to effect the destruction of Salwa's city.\r\nAnd in a sorrowful heart, I asked myself,--Doth that destroyer of foes,\r\nthe mighty-armed Baladeva, live, and Satyaki, and the son of Rukmini and\r\nCharudeshna possessed of prowess, and Shamva and others? For, O thou\r\ntiger among men, these living, even the bearer himself of the thunderbolt\r\ncould by no means destroy Suta's son (Vasudeva)! And thought, I, It is\r\nplain that Vasudeva is dead and equally plain that the others with\r\nBaladeva at their head have been deprived of life--This was my certain\r\nconclusion. And, O mighty king, thinking of the destruction of those all,\r\nI was overwhelmed with grief! And it was in this state of mind that I\r\nencountered Salwa afresh. And now I saw, O great monarch, Vasudeva\r\nhimself falling from the car of precious metals! And, O warrior I swooned\r\naway, and, O king of men, my sire seemed like unto Yayati after the loss\r\nof his merit, falling towards the earth from heaven! And like unto a\r\nluminary whose merit hath been lost saw my father falling, his head-gear\r\nfoul and flowing loosely, and his hair and dress disordered. And then the\r\nbow Sharanga dropped from my hand, and, O son of Kunti I swooned away! I\r\nsat down on the side of the car. And, O thou descendant of the Bharata\r\nrace, seeing me deprived of consciousness on the car, and as if dead, my\r\nentire host exclaimed Oh! and Alas! And my prone father with\r\nout-stretched arms and lower limbs, appeared like a dropping bird. And\r\nhim thus falling, O thou of mighty arms, O hero, the hostile warriors\r\nbearing in their hands lances and axes struck grievously! And (beholding\r\nthis) my heart trembled! and soon regaining my consciousness, O warrior,\r\nI could not see in that mighty contest either the car of costly metals,\r\nor the enemy Salwa, or my old father! Then I concluded in my mind that it\r\nwas certainly illusion. And recovering my senses, I again began to\r\ndischarge arrows by hundreds.\""

And I\r\nbegan to discharge from the Sharanga many well-looking arrows of the\r\nforms of snakes, capable of going at a great height and possessing\r\nintense energy. And, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, I could not then see\r\nthe car of costly metals, for it had vanished, through illusion! I was\r\nthen filled with wonder! That host of Danvas then, O Bharata, of\r\nfrightful visages and hair, set up a loud howl while I was waiting for\r\nit. In that fierce battle. I then, with the object of destroying them,\r\nfixed on my bow-string the weapon capable of piercing the foes if but his\r\nsound was inaudible. Upon this, their shouts ceased. But those Danavas\r\nthat had sent up that shout were all slain by those shafts of mine\r\nblazing as the Sun himself, and capable of striking at the perception of\r\nsound alone. And after the shout had ceased at one place, O mighty king,\r\nanother yell proceeded from another quarter. Thitherto also I sent my\r\nshafts. In this way, O Bharata, the Asuras began to send up yells in all\r\nthe ten quarters above and across. These were all slain by me, viz.,\r\nthose that were in the skies and that were invisible, with arrows of\r\ndiverse forms, and celestial weapons inspired with mantras. Then, O hero,\r\nthat car of precious metals capable of going anywhere at will,\r\nbewildering my eyes, reappeared at Pragjyotisha! And then the destroying\r\nDanavas of fierce forms suddenly drowned me with a mighty shower of\r\nrocks. And, O thou foremost of monarchs, torrents of rocks falling upon\r\nme covered me up, and I began to grow like an ant-hill (with its summits\r\nand peaks)! And covered along with my horses and charioteer and\r\nflagstaffs, with crags on all sides, I disappeared from sight altogether.\r\nThen those foremost of heroes of the Vrishni race who were of my army\r\nwere, struck with panic, and all on a sudden began to fly in all\r\ndirections. And beholding me in that plight, O king, the heaven, the\r\nfirmament, and the earth were filled with exclamation of Oh! and Alas!\r\nAnd then, O monarch, my friends filled with sorrow and grief began to\r\nweep and wail with heavy hearts! And delight filled the hearts of the\r\nenemies. And O thou who never waverest, I heard of this after I had\r\ndefeated the foe! And then wielding the thunderbolt, that favourite\r\n(weapon) of Indra, capable of riving stones, I destroyed that entire mass\r\nof crags! But my steeds, afflicted with the weight of the stones and\r\nalmost on the point of death began to tremble. And beholding me, all my\r\nfriends rejoiced again even as men rejoice on seeing the sun rise in the\r\nsky, dispersing the clouds. And seeing my horses almost in their last\r\ngasp for breath, afflicted with that load of stones, my charioteer said\r\nunto me in words suitable to the occasion, 'O thou of the Vrishni race,\r\nbehold Salwa the owner of the car of precious metals sitting (yonder). Do\r\nnot disregard him! Do thou exert thyself! Do thou abandon thy mildness\r\nand consideration for Salwa. Slay Salwa, O thou of mighty arms! O Kesava,\r\ndo not let him live! O hero, O thou destroyer of those that are not thy\r\nfriends (enemies), an enemy should be slain with every exertion! Even a\r\nweak enemy who is under the feet of a man endued with strength, should\r\nnot be disregarded by the latter: that (shall I say) of one that dareth\r\nus to the fight? Therefore, O thou tiger among men, putting forth every\r\nexertion, slay him, O lord, O thou foremost of the Vrishni race! Do thou\r\nnot delay again! This one is not capable of being vanquished by milder\r\nmeasures. And he cannot in my opinion be thy friend who is fighting thee\r\nand who devastated Dwaraka!' O Kaunteya, hearing such words of my\r\ncharioteer, and knowing that what he said was true, I directed my\r\nattention to the fight (afresh), with the view of slaying Salwa and\r\ndestroying the car of costly metals! And, O hero, saying unto Daruka,\r\n'Stay a moment' I fixed on my bow-string my favourite weapon of fire,\r\nblazing and of celestial origin, of irresistible force, and incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, bursting with energy, capable of penetrating into\r\neverything, and of great splendour! And saying, 'Destroy the car of\r\nprecious metals together with all those enemies that are in it.' I\r\nlaunched with the might of my arms and in wrath with mantras, the great\r\npowerful discus Sudarsana which reduceth to ashes in battle Yakshas and\r\nRakshasas and Danavas and kings born in impure tribes, sharp-edged like\r\nthe razor, and without stain, like unto Yama the destroyer, and\r\nincomparable, and which killeth enemies. And rising into the sky, it\r\nseemed like a second sun of exceeding effulgence at the end of the Yuga.\r\nAnd approaching the town of Saubha whose splendour had disappeared, the\r\ndiscus went right through it, even as a saw divideth a tall tree. And cut\r\nin twain by the energy of the Sudarsana it fell like the city of Tripura\r\nshaken by the shafts of Maheswara. And after the town of Saubha had\r\nfallen, the discus came back into my hands, And taking it up I once more\r\nhurled it with force saying, 'Go thou unto Salwa.' The discus then cleft\r\nSalwa in twain who in that fierce conflict was at the point of hurling a\r\nheavy mace. And with its energy it set the foe ablaze. And after that\r\nbrave warrior was slain, the disheartened Danava women fled in all\r\ndirections, exclaiming Oh! and Alas! And taking my chariot in front of\r\nthe town of Saubha I cheerfully blew my conch and gladdened the hearts of\r\nmy friends. And beholding their town, high as the peak of the Meru, with\r\nits palaces and gate-ways utterly destroyed, and all ablaze, the Danavas\r\nfled in fear. And having thus destroyed the town of Saubha and slain\r\nSalwa, I returned to the Anarttas and delighted my friends. And, O king,\r\nit is for this reason that I could not come to the city named after the\r\nelephant (Hastinapura), O destroyer of hostile heroes! O warrior, if I\r\nhad come, Suyodhana would not have been alive or the match at dice would\r\nnot have taken place. What can I do now? It is difficult to confine the\r\nwaters after the dam is broken!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having addressed the Kaurava thus, that foremost\r\nof male persons, of mighty arms, the slayer of Madhu, possessed of every\r\ngrace, saluting the Pandavas, prepared for departure. And the\r\nmighty-armed hero reverentially saluted Yudhishthira the just, and the\r\nking in return and Bhima also smelt the crown of his head. And he was\r\nembraced by Arjuna, and the twins saluted him with reverence. And he was\r\nduly honoured by Dhaumya, and worshipped with tears by Draupadi. And\r\ncausing Subhadra and Abhimanyu to ascend his golden car, Krishna, mounted\r\nit himself, worshipped by the Pandavas. And consoling Yudhishthira,\r\nKrishna set out for Dwaraka on his car resplendent as the sun and unto\r\nwhich were yoked the horses Saivya and Sugriva. And after he of the\r\nDasharha race had departed, Dhristadyumna, the son of Prishata, also set\r\nout for his own city, taking with him the sons of Draupadi. And the king\r\nof Chedi, Dhrishtaketu also, taking his sister with him set out for his\r\nbeautiful city of Suktimati, after bidding farewell to the Pandavas. And,\r\nO Bharata, the Kaikeyas also, with the permission of Kunti's son\r\npossessed of immeasurable energy, having reverentially saluted all the\r\nPandavas, went away. But Brahmanas and the Vaisyas and the dwellers of\r\nYudhishthira's kingdom though repeatedly requested to go, did not leave\r\nthe Pandavas. O foremost of king, O bull of the Bharata race, the\r\nmultitude that surrounded those high-souled ones in the forest of Kamyaka\r\nlooked extraordinary. And Yudhishthira, honouring those high-minded\r\nBrahmanas, in due time ordered his men, saying 'Make ready the car.'\""

And at time of going they distributed Nishkas of gold and clothes\r\nand kine unto Brahmanas versed in Siksha and Akshara and mantras. And\r\ntwenty attendants followed them equipped with bows, and bowstrings, and\r\nblazing weapons, and shafts and arrows and engines of destruction. And\r\ntaking the princess's clothes and the ornaments, and the nurses and the\r\nmaid-servants, Indrasena speedily followed the princes on a car. And then\r\napproaching the best of Kurus, the high-minded citizens walked round him.\r\nAnd the principal Brahmanas of Kurujangala cheerfully saluted him. And\r\ntogether with his brothers, Yudhishthira the just, on his part saluted\r\nthem cheerfully. And the illustrious king stopped there a little,\r\nbeholding the concourse of the inhabitants of Kurujangala. And the\r\nillustrious bull among the Kurus felt for them as a father feeleth for\r\nhis sons, and they too felt for the Kuru chief even as sons feel for\r\ntheir father! And that mighty concourse, approaching the Kuru hero, stood\r\naround him. And, O king, affected, with bashfulness, and with tears in\r\ntheir eyes, they all exclaimed, 'Alas, O lord! O Dharma!'

And Vibhatsu knowing the ways\r\nof virtue, pleasure, and profit said unto them in a loud voice, 'Living\r\nin the forest, the king intendeth to take away the good name of his\r\nenemies! O we with the regenerate ones at your head, versed in virtue and\r\nprofit, do you approaching the ascetics separately and inclining them to\r\ngrace, represent unto them what may be for our supreme good!' Upon\r\nhearing these words of Arjuna, the Brahmanas and the other orders, O\r\nking, saluting him cheerfully walked round the foremost of virtuous men!\r\nAnd bidding farewell unto the son of Pritha, and Vrikodara, and\r\nDhananjaya and Yajnaseni, and the twins, and commanded by Yudhishthira,\r\nthey returned to their respective abodes in the kingdom with heavy\r\nhearts.\""

Search ye, therefore, in this mighty forest for some spot\r\nabounding in birds and deer and flowers and fruits, beautiful to behold,\r\nand auspicious, and inhabited by virtuous persons and where we may dwell\r\npleasantly for all these years!' Thus addressed by Yudhishthira,\r\nDhananjaya replied unto the son of Dharma, after reverencing the\r\nillustrious king as if he were his spiritual preceptor. And Arjuna said,\r\n'Thou hast respectfully waited upon all the great and old Rishis. There\r\nis nothing unknown to thee in the world of men. And O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, thou hast always waited with reverence upon Brahmanas including\r\nDwaipayana and others, and Narada of great ascetic merit, who with senses\r\nunder control, ever goeth to the gates of all the world from the world of\r\nthe gods unto that of Brahma, including that of the Gandharvas and\r\nApsaras! And thou knowest, without doubt, the opinions of the Brahmanas,\r\nand, O king, their prowess also! And O monarch, thou knowest what is\r\ncalculated to do us good!

And\r\nthe king was also surrounded by hundreds of Mahatmas crowned with ascetic\r\nsuccess and of rigid vows. And those bulls of the Bharata race, the sons\r\nof Pandu setting out with those numerous Brahmanas, entered the sacred\r\nand delightful woods of Dwaita. And the king saw that mighty forest\r\ncovered on the close of summer with Salas, and palms, and mangoes, and\r\nMadhukas, and Nipas and Kadamvas and Sarjjas and Arjunas, and Karnikars,\r\nmany of them covered with flowers. And flocks of peacocks and Datyuhas\r\nand Chakoras and Varhins and Kokilas, seated on the tops of the tallest\r\ntrees of that forest were pouring forth their mellifluous notes. And the\r\nking also saw in that forest mighty herds of gigantic elephants huge as\r\nthe hills, with temporal juice trickling down in the season of rut,\r\naccompanied by herds of she-elephants. And approaching the beautiful\r\nBhogavati (Saraswati), the king saw many ascetics crowned with success in\r\nthe habitations in that forest, and virtuous men of sanctified souls clad\r\nin barks of trees and bearing matted locks on their heads. And descending\r\nfrom their cars, the king that foremost of virtuous men with his brothers\r\nand followers entered that forest like Indra of immeasurable energy\r\nentering heaven. And crowds of Charanas and Siddhas, desirous of\r\nbeholding the monarch devoted to truth, came towards him.

And saluting all the Siddhas, and saluted by them\r\nin return as a king or a god should be, that foremost of virtuous men\r\nentered the forest with joined hands accompanied by all those foremost of\r\nregenerate ones. And the illustrious and virtuous king, saluted in return\r\nby those virtuous ascetics that had approached him, sat down in their\r\nmidst at the foot of a mighty tree decked with flowers, like his father\r\n(Pandu) in days before. And those chiefs of the Bharata race viz., Bhima\r\nand Dhananjaya and the twins and Krishna and their followers, all\r\nfatigued, leaving their vehicles, sat themselves down around that best of\r\nkings.

And the illustrious\r\nking, that bull of the Kuru race, set himself to please all the Yatis and\r\nMunis and the principal Brahmanas in that forest, by offerings of\r\nexcellent fruits and roots. And their priest, Dhaumya endued with great\r\nenergy, like unto a father to those princes, began to perform the\r\nsacrificial rites of Ishti and Paitreya for the Pandavas residing in that\r\ngreat forest. And there came, as a guest, unto the abode of the\r\naccomplished Pandavas living in the wood after loss of their kingdom, the\r\nold Rishi Markandeya, possessed of intense and abundant energy.

Yet that sinless one\r\nhad to dwell in the forest at the command of his father, accepting it as\r\nhis duty. The illustrious Rama was equal unto Sakra in prowess, and\r\ninvincible in battle. And yet he had to range the forest renouncing all\r\npleasures! Therefore should no one act unrighteously, saying,--I am\r\nmighty!

Therefore, should no one act unrighteously,\r\nsaying,--I am mighty! And, O exalted of men, the virtuous and truthful\r\nking of Kasi and Karusha was called a mad dog for having renounced his\r\nterritories and riches! Therefore, should no one act unrighteously,\r\nsaying,--I am mighty! O best of men, O son of Pritha, the seven righteous\r\nRishis, for having observed the ordinance prescribed by the Creator\r\nhimself in the Vedas, blaze in the firmament.

And the sounds of the\r\nYajus, the Riks, the Samas, and other words uttered by the Brahmanas,\r\nwere exceedingly delightful to hear. And the Vedic recitations of the\r\nBrahmanas mingling with the twang of bows of the sons of Pritha, produced\r\na union of the Brahmana and Kshatriya customs that was highly beautiful.\r\nAnd one evening the Rishi Vaka of the Dalvya family addressed\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti seated in the midst of the Rishis, saying,\r\n'Behold, O chief of the Kurus, O son of Pritha, the homa time is come of\r\nthese Brahmanas devoted to ascetic austerities, the time when the\r\n(sacred) fires have all been lit up! These all, of rigid vows, protected\r\nby thee, are performing the rites of religion in this sacred region!

Indeed, a king slayeth his enemies having obtained a Brahmana\r\nconversant, with religion and worldly affairs and freed from passion and\r\nfolly. King Vali cherishing his subjects practised those duties that lead\r\nto salvation, and knew not of any other means in this world than\r\nBrahmanas.

This earth with\r\nher wealth never adoreth long as her lord a Kshatriya living without a\r\nBrahmana! The earth, however, girt by the sea, boweth unto him who is\r\nruled by a Brahmana and taught his duties by him! Like an elephant in\r\nbattle without his driver, a Kshatriya destitute of Brahmanas decreaseth\r\nin strength! The Brahmana's sight is without compare, and the Kshatriya's\r\nmight also is unparalleled. When these combine, the whole earth itself\r\ncheerfully yieldeth to such a combination. As fire becoming mightier with\r\nthe wind consumeth straw and wood, so kings with Brahmanas consume all\r\nfoes! An intelligent Kshatriya, in order to gain what he hath not, and\r\nincrease what he hath, should take counsel of Brahmanas! Therefore, O son\r\nof Kunti, for obtaining what thou hast not and increasing what thou hast,\r\nand spending what thou hast on proper objects and persons, keep thou with\r\nthee a Brahmana of reputation, of a knowledge of the Vedas, of wisdom and\r\nexperience!

He Is even (to foes), like unto Yama himself at the end of\r\nthe Yuga! It was by the prowess of his weapons that all the kings of the\r\nearth were made to wait upon the Brahmanas at thy sacrifice? Beholding\r\nthat Arjuna that tiger among men worshipped by both the celestials and\r\nthe Danavas so anxious, why, O king, dost thou not feel indignant? I\r\ngrieve, O Bharata, that thy wrath doth not blaze up at sight of that son\r\nof Pritha in exile, that prince who deserveth not such distress and who\r\nhath been brought up in every luxury! Why doth not thy wrath blaze up at\r\nsight of that Arjuna in exile, who, on a single car, hath vanquished\r\ncelestials and men and serpents? Why, O king, doth not thy wrath blaze up\r\nat sight of that Arjuna in exile who, honoured with offerings of cars and\r\nvehicles of various forms and horses and elephants, forcibly took from\r\nthe kings of the earth their treasures, who is the chastiser of all foes,\r\nand who at one impetus can throw full five hundred arrows? Why, O king,\r\ndoth not thy wrath blaze up at sight of Nakula, in exile, who so fair and\r\nable-bodied and young, is the foremost of all swordsmen? Why, O king,\r\ndost thou pardon the foe. O Yudhishthira, at sight of Madri's son, the\r\nhandsome and brave Sahadeva in exile? Why doth not thy anger blaze up, O\r\nking, it sight of both Nakula and Sahadeva overwhelmed with grief, though\r\nso undeserving of distress? Why also, O king, dost thou pardon the foe at\r\nsight of myself in exile who, born in the race of Drupada and, therefore,\r\nthe sister of Dhrishtadyumna, am the daughter-in-law of the illustrious\r\nPandu and the devoted wife of heroes? Truly, O thou best of the Bharatas,\r\nthou hast no anger, else why is it that thy mind is not moved at sight of\r\nthy brothers and myself (in such distress)? It is said that there is no\r\nKshatriya in the world who is bereft of anger. I now behold in thee,\r\nhowever, a refutation of the proverb! That Kshatriya, O son of Pritha,\r\nwho discovereth not his energy when the opportunity cometh, is ever\r\ndisregarded by all creatures! Therefore, O king, thou shouldst not extend\r\nthy forgiveness to the foe. Indeed, with thy energy, without doubt, thou,\r\nmayst slay them all! So also, O king, that Kshatriya who is not appeased\r\nwhen the time for forgiveness cometh, becometh unpopular with every\r\ncreature and meeteth with destruction both in this and the other world!'\""

      "content": "\"Draupadi continued, 'On this subject, the ancient story of the\r\nconversation between Prahlada and Vali, the son of Virochana, is quoted\r\nas an example. One day Vali asked his grand-father Prahlada, the chief of\r\nthe Asuras and the Danavas, possessed of great wisdom and well-versed in\r\nthe mysteries of the science of duty, saying, 'O sire, is forgiveness\r\nmeritorious or might and energy such? I am puzzled as regards this; O\r\nsire, enlighten me who ask thee this! O thou conversant with all duties,\r\ntell me truly which of these is meritorious? I will strictly obey\r\nwhatever thy command may be! Thus asked (by Vali), his wise grandfather,\r\nconversant with every conclusion, replied upon the whole subject unto his\r\ngrand-son who had sought at his hands the resolution of his doubts. And\r\nPrahlada said, 'Know, O child, these two truths with certainty, viz.,\r\nthat might is not always meritorious and forgiveness also is not always\r\nmeritorious! He that forgiveth always suffereth many evils. Servants and\r\nstrangers and enemies always disregard him. No creature ever bendeth down\r\nunto him. Therefore it is, O child, that the learned applaud not a\r\nconstant habit of forgiveness! The servants of an ever-forgiving person\r\nalways disregard him, and contract numerous faults. These mean-minded men\r\nalso seek to deprive him of his wealth. Vile souled servants also\r\nappropriate to themselves his vehicles and clothes and ornaments and\r\napparel and beds and seats and food and drink and other articles of use.\r\nThey do not also at the command of their master, give unto others the\r\nthings they are directed to give Nor do they even worship their master\r\nwith that respect which is their master's due. Disregard in this world is\r\nworse than death. O child, sons and servants and attendants and even\r\nstrangers speak harsh words unto the man who always forgiveth. Persons,\r\ndisregarding the man of an ever-forgiving temper, even desire his wife,\r\nand his wife also, becometh ready to act as she willeth. And servants\r\nalso that are ever fond of pleasure, if they do not receive even slight\r\npunishments from their master, contract all sorts of vices, and the\r\nwicked ever injure such a master. These and many other demerits attach to\r\nthose that are ever-forgiving!\r\n\r\n\"Listen now, O son of Virochana, to the demerits of those that are never\r\nforgiving! The man of wrath who, surrounded by darkness, always\r\ninflicteth, by help of his own energy, various kinds of punishment on\r\npersons whether they deserve them or not, is necessarily separated from\r\nhis friends in consequence of that energy of his. Such a man is hated by\r\nboth relatives and strangers. Such a man, because he insulteth others,\r\nsuffereth loss of wealth and reapeth disregard and sorrow and hatred and\r\nconfusion and enemies. The man of wrath, in consequence of his ire,\r\ninflicteth punishments on men and obtaineth (in return) harsh words. He\r\nis divested of his prosperity soon and even of life, not to say, of\r\nfriends and relatives. He that putteth forth his might both upon his\r\nbenefactor and his foe, is an object of alarm to the world, like a snake\r\nthat hath taken shelter in a house, to the inmates thereof. What\r\nprosperity can he have who is an object of alarm to the world? People\r\nalways do him an injury when they find a hole. Therefore, should men\r\nnever exhibit might in excess nor forgiveness on all occasions. One\r\nshould put forth his might and show his forgiveness on proper occasions.\r\nHe that becometh forgiving at the proper time and harsh and mighty also\r\nat the proper time, obtaineth happiness both in this world and the other.\r\n\r\n\"'I shall now indicate the occasions in detail of forgiveness, as laid\r\ndown by the learned, and which should ever be observed by all. Hearken\r\nunto me as I speak! He that hath done thee a service, even if he is\r\nguilty of a grave wrong unto thee, recollecting his former service,\r\nshouldst thou forgive that offender. Those also that have become\r\noffenders from ignorance and folly should be forgiven for learning and\r\nwisdom are not always easily attainable by man. They that having offended\r\nthee knowingly, plead ignorance should be punished, even if their\r\noffences be trivial. Such crooked men should never be pardoned. The first\r\noffence of every creature should be forgiven. The second offence,\r\nhowever, should be punished, even if it be trivial. If, however, a person\r\ncommiteth an offence unwillingly, it hath been said that examining his\r\nplea well by a judicious enquiry, he should be pardoned. Humility may\r\nvanquish might, humility may vanquish weakness. There is nothing that\r\nhumility may not accomplish. Therefore, humility is truly fiercer (than\r\nit seemeth)! One should act with reference to place and time, taking note\r\nof his own might or weakness. Nothing can succeed that hath been\r\nundertaken without reference to place and time. Therefore, do thou ever\r\nwait for place and time! Sometimes offenders should be forgiven from fear\r\nof the people. These have been declared to be times of forgiveness. And\r\nit hath been said that on occasions besides these, might should be put\r\nforth against transgressors.'\r\n\r\n\"Draupadi continued, 'I, therefore, regard, O king, that the time hath\r\ncome for thee to put forth thy might! Unto those Kurus the covetous sons\r\nof Dhritarashtra who injure us always, the present is not the time for\r\nforgiveness! It behoveth thee to put forth thy might. The humble and\r\nforgiving person is disregarded; while those that are fierce persecute\r\nothers. He, indeed, is a king who hath recourse to both, each according\r\nto its time!'\""

      "content": "Yudhishthira said, 'Anger is the slayer of men and is again their\r\nprosperor. Know this, O thou possessed of great wisdom, that anger is the\r\nroot of all prosperity and all adversity. O thou beautiful one, he that\r\nsuppresseth his anger earneth prosperity. That man, again, who always\r\ngiveth way to anger, reapeth adversity from his fierce anger. It is seen\r\nin this world that anger is the cause of destruction of every creature.\r\nHow then can one like me indulge his anger which is so destructive of the\r\nworld? The angry man commiteth sin. The angry man killeth even his\r\npreceptors. The angry man insulteth even his superiors in harsh words.\r\nThe man that is angry faileth to distinguish between what should be said\r\nand what should not. There is no act that an angry man may not do, no\r\nword that an angry man may not utter. From anger a man may slay one that\r\ndeserveth not to be slain, and may worship one that deserveth to be\r\nslain. The angry man may even send his own soul to the regions of Yama.\r\nBeholding all these faults, the wise control their anger, desirous of\r\nobtaining high prosperity both in this and the other world. It is for\r\nthis that they of tranquil souls have banished wrath. How can one like us\r\nindulge in it then? O daughter of Drupada, reflecting upon all this, my\r\nanger is not excited One that acteth not against a man whose wrath hath\r\nbeen up, rescueth himself as also others from great fear. In fact, he may\r\nbe regarded to be the physician of the two (viz., himself and angry man).\r\nIf a weak man, persecuted by others, foolishly becometh angry towards men\r\nthat are mightier than he, he then becometh himself the cause of his own\r\ndestruction. And in respect of one who thus deliberately throweth away\r\nhis life, there are no regions hereafter to gain. Therefore, O daughter\r\nof Drupada, it hath been said that a weak man should always suppress his\r\nwrath. And the wise man also who though presecuted, suffereth not his\r\nwrath to be roused, joyeth in the other world--having passed his\r\npersecutor over in indifference. It is for this reason hath it been said\r\nthat a wise man, whether strong or weak, should ever forgive his\r\npersecutor even when the latter is in the straits. It is for this, O\r\nKrishna, that the virtuous applaud them that have conquered their wrath.\r\nIndeed, it is the opinion of the virtuous that the honest and forgiving\r\nman is ever victorious. Truth is more beneficial than untruth; and\r\ngentleness than cruel behaviour. How can one like me, therefore, even for\r\nthe purpose of slaying Duryodhana, exhibit anger which hath so many\r\nfaults and which the virtuous banish from their souls? They that are\r\nregarded by the learned of foresight, as possessed of (true) force of\r\ncharacter, are certainly those who are wrathful in outward show only. Men\r\nof learning and of true insight call him to be possessed of force of\r\ncharacter who by his wisdom can suppress his risen wrath. O thou of fair\r\nhips, the angry man seeth not things in their true light. The man that is\r\nangry seeth not his way, nor respecteth persons. The angry man killeth\r\neven those that deserve not to be killed. The man of wrath slayeth even\r\nhis preceptors. Therefore, the man possessing force of character should\r\never banish wrath to a distance. The man that is overwhelmed with wrath\r\nacquireth not with ease generosity, dignity, courage, skill, and other\r\nattributes belonging to real force of character. A man by forsaking anger\r\ncan exhibit proper energy, whereas, O wise one, it is highly difficult\r\nfor the angry man to exhibit his energy at the proper time! The ignorant\r\nalways regard anger as equivalent to energy. Wrath, however hath been\r\ngiven to man for the destruction of the world. The man, therefore, who\r\nwisheth to behave properly, must ever forsake anger. Even one who hath\r\nabandoned the excellent virtues of his own order, it is certain,\r\nindulgeth in wrath (if behaveth properly). If fools, of mind without\r\nlight, transgress in every respect, how, O faultless one, can one like me\r\ntransgress (like them)? If amongst men there were not persons equal unto\r\nthe earth in forgiveness, there would be no peace among men but continued\r\nstrife caused by wrath. If the injured return their injuries, if one\r\nchastised by his superior were to chastise his superior in return, the\r\nconsequence would be the destruction of every creature, and sin also\r\nwould prevail in the world. If the man who hath ill speeches from\r\nanother, returneth those speeches afterwards; if the injured man\r\nreturneth his injuries: if the chastised person chastiseth in return; if\r\nfathers slay sons, and sons fathers and if husbands slay wives, and wives\r\nhusbands; then, O Krishna, how can birth take place in a world where\r\nanger prevaileth so! For, O thou of handsome face, know that the birth of\r\ncreatures is due to peace! If the kings also, O Draupadi, giveth way to\r\nwrath, his subjects soon meet with destruction. Wrath, therefore, hath\r\nfor its consequence the destruction and the distress of the people. And\r\nbecause it is seen that there are in the world men who are forgiving like\r\nthe Earth, it is therefore that creatures derive their life and\r\nprosperity. O beautiful one, one should forgive under every injury. It\r\nhath been said that the continuation of species is due to man being\r\nforgiving. He, indeed, is a wise and excellent person who hath conquered\r\nhis wrath and who showeth forgiveness even when insulted, oppressed, and\r\nangered by a strong person. The man of power who controleth his wrath,\r\nhath (for his enjoyment) numerous everlasting regions; while he that is\r\nangry, is called foolish, and meeteth with destruction both in this and\r\nthe other world. O Krishna, the illustrious and forgiving Kashyapa hath,\r\nin this respect, sung the following verses in honour of men that are ever\r\nforgiving, 'Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice, forgiveness\r\nis the Vedas, forgiveness is the Shruti. He that knoweth this is capable\r\nof forgiving everything. Forgiveness is Brahma; forgiveness is truth;\r\nforgiveness is stored ascetic merit; forgiveness protecteth the ascetic\r\nmerit of the future; forgiveness is asceticism; forgiveness is holiness;\r\nand by forgiveness is it that the universe is held together. Persons that\r\nare forgiving attain to the regions obtainable by those that have\r\npreformed meritorious sacrifices, or those that are well-conversant with\r\nthe Vedas, or those that have high ascetic merit. Those that perform\r\nVedic sacrifices as also those that perform the meritorious rites of\r\nreligion obtain other regions. Men of forgiveness, however, obtain those\r\nmuch-adored regions that are in the world of Brahma. Forgiveness is the\r\nmight of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of\r\nmind. How, O Krishna, can one like us abandon forgiveness, which is such,\r\nand in which are established Brahma, and truth, and wisdom and the\r\nworlds? The man of wisdom should ever forgive, for when he is capable of\r\nforgiving everything, he attaineth to Brahma. The world belongeth to\r\nthose that are forgiving; the other world is also theirs. The forgiving\r\nacquire honours here, and a state of blessedness hereafter. Those men\r\nthat ever conquer their wrath by forgiveness, obtain the higher regions.\r\nTherefore hath it been said that forgiveness is the highest virtue.'\r\nThose are the verses sung by Kashyapa in respect of those that are\r\neverforgiving. Having listened, O Draupadi, to these verses in respect of\r\nforgiveness, content thyself! Give not way to thy wrath! Our grandsire,\r\nthe son of Santanu, will worship peace; Krishna, the son of Devaki, will\r\nworship peace; the preceptor (Drona) and Vidura called Kshatri will both\r\nspeak of peace; Kripa and Sanjaya also will preach peace. And Somadatta\r\nand Yuyutshu and Drona's son and our grandsire Vyasa, every one of them\r\nspeaketh always of peace. Ever urged by these towards peace, the king\r\n(Dhritarashtra) will, I think, return us our kingdom. If however, he\r\nyieldeth to temptation, he will meet with destruction. O lady, a crisis\r\nhath come in the history of Bharatas for plunging them into calamity!\r\nThis hath been my certain conclusion from some time before! Suyodhana\r\ndeserveth not the kingdom. Therefore hath he been unable to acquire\r\nforgiveness. I, however, deserve the sovereignty and therefore is it that\r\nforgiveness hath taken possession of me. Forgiveness and gentleness are\r\nthe qualities of the self-possessed. They represent eternal virtue. I\r\nshall, therefore, truly adopt those qualities.\""

Regarding the burden (thou art to bear) thou thinkest\r\ndifferently from the ways of thy fathers and grand-fathers! Influenced by\r\nacts men are placed in different situations of life. Acts, therefore,\r\nproduce consequences that are inevitable; emancipation is desired from\r\nmere folly. It seemeth that man can never attain prosperity in this world\r\nby virtue, gentleness, forgiveness, straight-forwardness and fear of\r\ncensure! If this were not so, O Bharata, this insufferable calamity would\r\nnever have overtaken thee who art so undeserving of it, and these thy\r\nbrothers of great energy! Neither in those days of prosperity nor in\r\nthese days of thy adversity, thou, O Bharata, hath ever known anything so\r\ndear to thee as virtue, which thou hast even regarded as dearer to thee\r\nthan life? That thy kingdom is for virtue alone, that thy life also is\r\nfor virtue alone, is known to Brahmanas and thy superiors and even the\r\ncelestials! I think thou canst abandon Bhimasena and Arjuna and these\r\ntwin sons of Madri along with myself but thou canst not abandon virtue! I\r\nhave heard that the king protecteth virtue; and virtue, protected by him,\r\nprotecteth him (in return)! I see, however, that virtue protecteth thee\r\nnot! Like the shadow pursuing a man, thy heart, O tiger among men, with\r\nsingleness of purpose, ever seeketh virtue. Thou hast never disregarded\r\nthy equals, and inferiors and superiors. Obtaining even the entire world,\r\nthy pride never increased! O son of Pritha, thou ever worshippest\r\nBrahmanas, and gods, and the Pitris, with Swadhas, and other forms of\r\nworship! O son of Pritha, thou hast ever gratified the Brahmanas by\r\nfulfilling every wish of theirs! Yatis and Sannyasins and mendicants of\r\ndomestic lives have always been fed in thy house from off plates of gold\r\nwhere I have distributed (food) amongst them. Unto the Vanaprasthas thou\r\nalways givest gold and food. There is nothing in thy house thou mayest\r\nnot give unto the Brahmanas! In the Viswadeva sacrifice, that is, for thy\r\npeace, performed in thy house, the things consecrated are first offered\r\nunto guests and all creatures while thou livest thyself with what\r\nremaineth (after distribution)! Ishtis Pashubandhas, sacrifices for\r\nobtaining fruition of desire, the religions rites of (ordinary)\r\ndomesticity, Paka sacrifices, and sacrifices of other kinds, are ever\r\nperformed in thy house. Even in this great forest, so solitary and\r\nhaunted by robbers, living in exile, divested of thy kingdom, thy virtue\r\nhath sustained no diminution! The Aswamedha, the Rajasuya, the Pundarika,\r\nand Gosava, these grand sacrifices requiring large gifts have all been\r\nperformed by thee! O monarch, impelled by a perverse sense during that\r\ndire hour of a losing match at dice, thou didst yet stake and loss thy\r\nkingdom, thy wealth, thy weapons, thy brothers, and myself! Simple,\r\ngentle, liberal, modest, truthful, how, O king could thy mind be\r\nattracted to the vice of gambling? I am almost deprived of my sense, O\r\nking, and my heart is overwhelmed with grief, beholding this thy\r\ndistress, and this thy calamity! An old history is cited as an\r\nillustration for the truth that men are subjects to the will of God and\r\nnever to their own wishes! The Supreme Lord and Ordainer of all ordaineth\r\neverything in respect of the weal and woe, the happiness and misery, of\r\nall creatures, even prior to their births guided by the acts of each,\r\nwhich are even like a seed (destined to sprout forth into the tree of\r\nlife). O hero amongst men, as a wooden doll is made to move its limbs by\r\nthe wire-puller, so are creatures made to work by the Lord of all. O\r\nBharata, like space that covereth every object, God, pervading every\r\ncreature, ordaineth its weal or woe. Like a bird tied with a string,\r\nevery creature is dependent on God. Every one is subject to God and none\r\nelse. No one can be his own ordainer. Like a pearl on its string, or a\r\nbull held fast by the cord passing through its nose, or a tree fallen\r\nfrom the bank into the middle of the stream, every creature followeth the\r\ncommand of the Creator, because imbued with His Spirit and because\r\nestablished in Him. And man himself, dependent on the Universal Soul,\r\ncannot pass a moment independently. Enveloped in darkness, creatures are\r\nnot masters of their own weal or woe. They go to heaven or hell urged by\r\nGod Himself. Like light straws dependent on strong winds, all creatures,\r\nO Bharatas, are dependent on God! And God himself, pervading all\r\ncreatures and engaged in acts right and wrong, moveth in the universe,\r\nthough none can say This is God! This body with its physical attributes\r\nis only the means by which God--the Supreme Lord of all maketh (every\r\ncreature) to reap fruits that are good or bad. Behold the power of\r\nillusion that hath been spread by God, who confounding with his illusion,\r\nmaketh creatures slay their fellows! Truth-knowing Munis behold those\r\ndifferently. They appear to them in a different light, even like the rays\r\nof the Sun (which to ordinary eyes are only a pencil of light, while to\r\neyes more penetrating seem fraught with the germs of food and drink).\r\nOrdinary men behold the things of the earth otherwise. It is God who\r\nmaketh them all, adopting different processes in their creation and\r\ndestruction. And, O Yudhishthira, the Self-create Grandsire, Almighty\r\nGod, spreading illusion, slayeth his creatures by the instrumentality of\r\nhis creatures, as one may break a piece of inert and senseless wood with\r\nwood, or stone with stone, or iron with iron. And the Supreme Lord,\r\naccording to his pleasure, sporteth with His creatures, creating and\r\ndestroying them, like a child with his toy (of soft earth). O king, it\r\ndoth seem to me that God behaveth towards his creatures like a father or\r\nmother unto them. Like a vicious person, He seemeth to bear himself\r\ntowards them in anger! Beholding superior and well-behaved and modest\r\npersons persecuted, while the sinful are happy, I am sorely troubled.\r\nBeholding this thy distress and the prosperity of Suyodhana, I do not\r\nspeak highly of the Great Ordainer who suffereth such inequality! O sir,\r\nwhat fruits doth the Great Ordainer reap by granting prosperity to\r\nDhritarashtra's son who transgresseth the ordinances, who is crooked and\r\ncovetous, and who injureth virtue and religion! If the act done pursueth\r\nthe doer and none else, then certainly it is God himself who is stained\r\nwith the sin of every act. If however, the sin of an act done doth not\r\nattach to the doer, then (individual) might (and not God) is the true\r\ncause of acts, and I grieve for those that have no might!'\""

Thou\r\nspeakest, however, the language of atheism. O princess, I never act,\r\nsolicitous of the fruits of my actions. I give away, because it is my\r\nduty to give; I sacrifice because it is my duty to sacrifice! O Krishna,\r\nI accomplish to the best of my power whatever a person living in\r\ndomesticity should do, regardless of the fact whether those acts have\r\nfruits or not. O thou of fair hips, I act virtuously, not from the desire\r\nof reaping the fruits of virtue, but of not transgressing the ordinances\r\nof the Veda, and beholding also the conduct of the good and wise! My\r\nheart, O Krishna, is naturally attracted towards virtue. The man who\r\nwisheth to reap the fruits of virtue is a trader in virtue. His nature is\r\nmean and he should never be counted amongst the virtuous. Nor doth he\r\never obtain the fruits of his virtues! Nor doth he of sinful heart, who\r\nhaving accomplished a virtuous act doubteth in his mind, obtain the\r\nfruits of his act, in consequence of that scepticism of his! I speak unto\r\nthee, under the authority of the Vedas, which constitute the highest\r\nproof in such matters, that never shouldst thou doubt virtue! The man\r\nthat doubteth virtue is destined to take his birth in the brute species.\r\nThe man of weak understanding who doubteth religion, virtue or the words\r\nof the Rishis, is precluded from regions of immortality and bliss, like\r\nSudras from the Vedas! O intelligent one, if a child born of a good race\r\nstudieth the Vedas and beareth himself virtuously, royal sages of\r\nvirtuous behaviour regard him as an aged sage (not withstanding his\r\nyears)! The sinful wretch, however, who doubteth religion and\r\ntransgresseth the scriptures, is regarded as lower even than Sudras and\r\nrobbers! Thou hast seen with thy own eyes the great ascetic Markandeya of\r\nimmeasurable soul come to us! It is by virtue alone that he hath acquired\r\nimmortality in the flesh. Vyasa, and Vasistha and Maitreya, and Narada\r\nand Lomasa, and Suka, and other Rishis have all, by virtue alone, become\r\nof pure soul! Thou beholdest them with thy own eyes as furnished with\r\nprowess of celestial asceticism, competent to curse or bless (with\r\neffect), and superior to the very gods! O sinless one, these all, equal\r\nto the celestials themselves, behold with their eyes what Is written in\r\nthe Vedas, and describe virtue as the foremost duty! It behoveth thee\r\nnot, therefore, O amiable Queen, to either doubt or censure God or act,\r\nwith a foolish heart. The fool that doubteth religion and disregardeth\r\nvirtue, proud of the proof derived from his own reasoning, regardeth not\r\nother proofs and holdeth the Rishis, who are capable of knowing the\r\nfuture as present as mad men. The fool regardeth only the external world\r\ncapable of gratifying his senses, and is blind to everything else. He\r\nthat doubteth religion hath no expiation for his offence. That miserable\r\nwretch is full of anxiety and acquireth not regions of bliss hereafter. A\r\nrejector of proofs, a slanderer of the interpretation of the Vedic\r\nscriptures, a transgressor urged by lust and covetousness, that fool\r\ngoeth to hell. O amiable one, he on the other hand, who ever cherisheth\r\nreligion with faith, obtaineth eternal bliss in the other world. The fool\r\nwho cherisheth not religion, transgressing the proofs offered by the\r\nRishis, never obtaineth prosperity in any life, for such transgression of\r\nthe scriptures. It is certain, O handsome one, that with respect to him\r\nwho regardeth not the words of the Rishis or the conduct of the virtuous\r\nas proof, neither this nor the other world existeth. Doubt not, O\r\nKrishna, the ancient religion that is practised by the good and framed by\r\nRishis of universal knowledge and capable of seeing all things! O\r\ndaughter of Drupada, religion is the only raft for those desirous of\r\ngoing to heaven, like a ship to merchants desirous of crossing the ocean.\r\nO thou faultless one, if the virtues that are practised by the virtuous\r\nhad no fruits, this universe then would be enveloped in infamous\r\ndarkness. No one then would pursue salvation, no one would seek to\r\nacquire knowledge not even wealth, but men would live like beasts. If\r\nasceticism, the austerities of celibate life, sacrifices, study of the\r\nVedas, charity, honesty,--these all were fruitless, men would not have\r\npractised virtue generation after generation. If acts were all fruitless,\r\na dire confusion would ensue. For what then do Rishis and gods and\r\nGandharvas and Rakshasas who are all independent of human conditions,\r\ncherish virtue with such affection? Knowing it for certain that God is\r\nthe giver of fruits in respect of virtue, they practise virtue in this\r\nworld. This, O Krishna, is the eternal (source of) prosperity. When the\r\nfruits of both knowledge and asceticism are seen, virtue and vice cannot\r\nbe fruitless. Call to thy mind, O Krishna, the circumstances of thy own\r\nbirth as thou that heard of them, and recall also the manner in which\r\nDhrishtadyumna of great prowess was born! These, O thou of sweet smiles,\r\nare the best proofs (of the fruits of virtue)! They that have their minds\r\nunder control, reap the fruits of their acts and are content with little.\r\nIgnorant fools are not content with even that much they get (here),\r\nbecause they have no happiness born of virtue to acquire to in the world\r\nhereafter. The fruitlessness of virtuous acts ordained in the Vedas, as\r\nalso of all transgressions, the origin and destruction of acts are, O\r\nbeautiful one, mysterious even to the gods. These are not known to any\r\nbody and everybody. Ordinary men are ignorant in respect of these. The\r\ngods keep up the mystery, for the illusion covering the conduct of the\r\ngods is unintelligible. Those regenerate ones that have destroyed all\r\naspirations, that have built all their hopes on vows and asceticism, that\r\nhave burnt all their sins and have acquired minds where quest and peace\r\nand holiness dwell, understand all these. Therefore, though you mayst not\r\nsee the fruits of virtue, thou shouldst not yet doubt religion or gods.\r\nThou must perform sacrifices with a will, and practise charity without\r\ninsolence. Acts in this world have their fruits, and virtue also is\r\neternal. Brahma himself told this unto his (spiritual) sons, as testified\r\nto by Kashyapa. Let thy doubt, therefore, O Krishna, be dispelled like\r\nmist. Reflecting upon all this, let thy scepticism give way to faith.\r\nSlander not God, who is the lord of all creatures. Learn how to know him.\r\nBow down unto him. Let not thy mind be such. And, O Krishna, never\r\ndisregard that Supreme Being through whose grace mortal man, by piety,\r\nacquireth immortality!'\""

      "content": "\"Draupadi said, 'I do not ever disregard or slander religion, O son of\r\nPritha! Why should I disregard God, the lord of all creatures? Afflicted\r\nwith woe, know me, O Bharata, to be only raving I will once more indulge\r\nin lamentations; listen to me with attention O persecutor of all enemies,\r\nevery conscious creature should certainly act in this world. It is only\r\nthe immobile, and not other creatures, that may live without acting. The\r\ncalf, immediately after its birth, sucketh the mothers' teat. Persons\r\nfeel pain in consequence of incantations performed with their statues. It\r\nseemeth, therefore, O Yudhishthira, that creatures derive the character\r\nof their lives from their acts of former lives. Amongst mobile creatures\r\nman differeth in this respect that he aspireth, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, to affect his course of life in this and the other world by means\r\nof his acts. Impelled by the inspiration of a former life, all creatures\r\nvisibly (reap) in this world the fruits of their acts. Indeed, all\r\ncreatures live according to the inspiration of a former life, even the\r\nCreator and the Ordainer of the universe, like a crane that liveth on the\r\nwater (untaught by any one.) If a creature acteth not, its course of life\r\nis impossible. In the case of a creature, therefore, there must be action\r\nand not inaction. Thou also shouldest act, and not incur censure by\r\nabandoning action. Cover thyself up, as with an armour, with action.\r\nThere may or may not be even one in a thousand who truly knoweth the\r\nutility of acts or work. One must act for protecting as also increasing\r\nhis wealth; for if without seeking to earn, one continueth to only spend,\r\nhis wealth, even if it were a hoard huge as Himavat, would soon be\r\nexhausted. All the creatures in the world would have been exterminated,\r\nif there were no action. If also acts bore no fruits, creatures would\r\nnever have multiplied. It is even seen that creatures sometimes perform\r\nacts that have no fruits, for without acts the course of life itself\r\nwould be impossible. Those persons in the world who believe in destiny,\r\nand those again who believe in chance, are both the worst among men.\r\nThose only that believe in the efficacy of acts are laudable. He that\r\nlieth at ease, without activity, believing in destiny alone, is soon\r\ndestroyed like an unburnt earthen pot in water. So also he that believeth\r\nin chance, i.e., sitteth inactive though capable of activity liveth not\r\nlong, for his life is one of weakness and helplessness. If any person\r\naccidentally acquireth any wealth, it is said he deriveth it from chance,\r\nfor no one's effort hath brought about the result. And, O son of Pritha,\r\nwhatever of good fortune a person obtaineth in consequence of religious\r\nrites, that is called providential. The fruit, however that a person\r\nobtaineth by acting himself, and which is the direct result of those acts\r\nof his, is regarded as proof of personal ability. And, O best of men,\r\nknow that the wealth one obtaineth spontaneously and without cause is\r\nsaid to be a spontaneous acquisition. Whatever is thus obtained by\r\nchance, by providential dispensation, spontaneously, of as the result of\r\none's acts is, however, the consequence of the acts of a former life. And\r\nGod, the Ordainer of the universe, judging according to the acts of\r\nformer lives, distributeth among men their portions in this world.\r\nWhatever acts, good or bad, a person performeth, know that they are the\r\nresult of God's, arrangements agreeably to the acts of a former life.\r\nThis body is only the instruments in the hands of God, for doing the acts\r\nthat are done. Itself, inert, it doth as God urgeth it to do. O son of\r\nKunti, it is the Supreme Lord of all who maketh all creatures do what\r\nthey do. The creatures themselves are inert. O hero, man, having first\r\nsettled some purpose in his mind, accomplisheth it, himself working with\r\nthe aid of his intelligence. We, therefore, say that man is himself the\r\ncause (of what he doeth). O bull among men, it is impossible to number\r\nthe acts of men, for mansions and towns are the result of man's acts.\r\nIntelligent men know, by help of their intellect, that oil may be had\r\nfrom sesame, curds from milk, and that food may be cooked by means of\r\nigniting fuel. They know also the means for accomplishing all these. And\r\nknowing them, they afterwards set themselves, with proper appliances, to\r\naccomplish them. And creatures support their lives by the results\r\nachieved in these directions by their own acts. If a work is executed by\r\na skilled workman, it is executed well. From differences (in\r\ncharacteristics), another work may be said to be that of an unskilful\r\nhand. If a person were not, in the matter of his acts, himself the cause\r\nthereof, then sacrifices would not bear any fruits in his case nor would\r\nany body be a disciple or a master. It is because a person is himself the\r\ncause of his work that he is applauded when he achieved success. So the\r\ndoer is censured if he faileth. If a man were not himself the cause of\r\nhis acts, how would all this be justified? Some say that everything is\r\nthe result of Providential dispensation; others again, that this is not\r\nso, but that everything which is supposed to be the result of destiny or\r\nchance is the result of the good or the bad acts of former lives. It is\r\nseen, possessions are obtained from chance, as also from destiny\r\nSomething being from destiny and something from chance, something is\r\nobtained by exertion. In the acquisition of his objects, there is no\r\nfourth cause in the case of man. Thus say those that are acquainted with\r\ntruth and skilled in knowledge. If, however, God himself were not the\r\ngiver of good and bad fruits, then amongst creatures there would not be\r\nany that was miserable. If the effect of former acts be a myth, then all\r\npurposes for which man would work should be successful. They, therefore,\r\nthat regard the three alone (mentioned above) as the doors of all success\r\nand failure in the world, (without regarding the acts of former life),\r\nare dull and inert like the body itself. For all this, however, a person\r\nshould act. This is the conclusion of Manu himself. The person that doth\r\nnot act, certainly succumbeth, O Yudhishthira. The man of action in this\r\nworld generally meeteth with success. The idle, however, never achieveth\r\nsuccess. If success, becometh impossible, then should one seek to remove\r\nthe difficulties that bar his way to success. And, O king, if a person\r\nworketh (hard), his debt (to the gods) is cancelled (whether he achieveth\r\nsuccess or not). The person that is idle and lieth at his length, is\r\novercome by adversity; while he that is active and skillful is sure to\r\nreap success and enjoy prosperity. Intelligent persons engaged in acts\r\nwith confidence in themselves regard all who are diffident as doubting\r\nand unsuccessful. The confident and faithful, however, are regarded by\r\nthem as successful. And this moment misery hath overtaken us. If,\r\nhowever, thou betakest to action, that misery will certainly be removed.\r\nIf thou meetest failure, then that will furnish a proof unto thee and\r\nVrikodara and Vivatsu and the twins (that ye are unable to snatch the\r\nkingdom from the foe). The acts of others, it is seen, are crowned with\r\nsuccess. It is probable that ours also will be successful. How can one\r\nknow beforehand what the consequence will be? Having exerted thyself thou\r\nwilt know what the fruit of thy exertion will be. The tiller tilleth with\r\nthe plough the soil and soweth the seeds thereon. He then sitteth silent,\r\nfor the clouds (after that) are the cause that would help the seeds to\r\ngrow into plants. If however, the clouds favour him not, the tiller is\r\nabsolved from all blame. He sayeth unto himself, 'What others do, I have\r\ndone. If, notwithstanding this, I meet with failure, no blame can attach\r\nto me.' Thinking so, he containeth himself and never indulgeth in\r\nself-reproach. O Bharata, no one should despair saying, 'Oh, I am acting,\r\nyet success is not mine! For there are two other causes, besides\r\nexertion, towards success. Whether there be success or failure, there\r\nshould be no despair, for success in acts dependeth upon the union; of\r\nmany circumstances. If one important element is wanting, success doth not\r\nbecome commensurate, or doth not come at all. If however, no exertion is\r\nmade, there can be no success. Nor is there anything to applaud in the\r\nabsence of all exertion. The intelligent, aided by their intelligence,\r\nand according to their full might bring place, time, means, auspicious\r\nrites, for the acquisition of prosperity. With carefulness and vigilance\r\nshould one set himself to work, his chief guide being his prowess. In the\r\nunion of qualities necessary for success in work, prowess seemeth to be\r\nthe chief. When the man of intelligence seeth his enemy superior to him\r\nin many qualities, he should seek the accomplishment of his purposes by\r\nmeans, of the arts of conciliation and proper appliances. He should also\r\nwish evil unto his foe and his banishment. Without speaking of mortal\r\nman, if his foe were even the ocean or the hills, he should be guided by\r\nsuch motives. A person by his activity in searching for the holes of his\r\nenemies, dischargeth his debt to himself as also to his friends. No man\r\nshould ever disparage himself for the man that disparageth himself never\r\nearneth high prosperity. O Bharata, success in this world is attainable\r\non such conditions! In fact, success in the World is said to depend on\r\nacting according to time and circumstances. My father formerly kept a\r\nlearned Brahmana with him. O bull of the Bharata race, he said all this\r\nunto my father. Indeed, these instructions as to duty, uttered by\r\nVrihaspati himself, were first taught to my brothers. It was from them\r\nthat I heard these afterwards while in my father's house. And, O\r\nYudhishthira, while at intervals of business, I went out (of the inner\r\napartments) and sat on the lap of my father, that learned Brahmana used\r\nto recite unto me these truths, sweetly consoling me therewith!\""

      "content": "'Vaisampayana said, \"Hearing these words of Yajnaseni, Bhimasena, sighing\r\nin wrath, approached the king and addressed him, saying, 'Walk, O\r\nmonarch, in the customary path trodden by good men, (before thee) in\r\nrespect of kingdoms. What do we gain by living in the asylum of ascetics,\r\nthus deprived of virtue, pleasure, and profit? It is not by virtue, nor\r\nby honesty, nor by might, but by unfair dice, that our kingdom hath been\r\nsnatched by Duryodhana. Like a weak offal-eating jackal snatching the\r\nprey from mighty lions, he hath snatched away our kingdom. Why, O\r\nmonarch, in obedience to the trite merit of sticking to a promise, dost\r\nthou suffer such distress, abandoning that wealth which is the source of\r\nboth virtue and enjoyments? It was for thy carelessness, O king, that our\r\nkingdom protected by the wielder of the Gandiva and therefore, incapable\r\nof being wrested by Indra himself, was snatched from us in our very\r\nsight. It was for thee, O monarch, that, ourselves living, our prosperity\r\nwas snatched away from us like a fruit from one unable to use his arms,\r\nor like kine from one incapable of using his legs. Thou art faithful in\r\nthe acquisition of virtue. It was to please thee, O Bharata, that we have\r\nsuffered ourselves to be overwhelmed with such dire calamity. O bull of\r\nthe Bharata race, it was because we were subject to thy control that we\r\nare thus tearing the hearts of our friends and gratifying our foes. That\r\nwe did not, in obedience to thee, even then slay the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, is an act of folly on our part that grieveth me sorely.\r\nThis thy abode, O king, in the woods, like that of any wild animal, is\r\nwhat a man of weakness alone would submit to. Surely, no man of might\r\nwould ever lead such a life. This thy course of life is approved neither\r\nby Krishna, nor Vibhatsu, nor by Abhimanyu, nor by the Srinjayas, nor by\r\nmyself, nor by the sons of Madri. Afflicted with the vows, thy cry is\r\nReligion! Religion! Hast thou from despair been deprived of thy\r\nmanliness? Cowards alone, unable to win back their prosperity, cherish\r\ndespair, which is fruitless and destructive of one's purposes. Thou hast\r\nability and eyes. Thou seest that manliness dwelleth in us. It is because\r\nthou hast adopted a life of peace that thou feelest not this distress.\r\nThese Dhritarashtras regard us who are forgiving, as really incompetent.\r\nThis, O king, grieveth me more than death in battle. If we all die in\r\nfair fight without turning our backs on the foe, even that would be\r\nbetter than this exile, for then we should obtain regions of bliss in the\r\nother world. Or, if, O bull of the Bharata race, having slain them all,\r\nwe acquire the entire earth, that would be prosperity worth the trial. We\r\nwho ever adhere to the customs of our order, who ever desire grand\r\nachievements, who wish to avenge our wrongs, have this for our bounden\r\nduty. Our kingdom wrested from us, if we engage in battle, our deeds when\r\nknown to the world will procure for us fame and not slander. And that\r\nvirtue, O king, which tortureth one's own self and friends, is really no\r\nvirtue. It is rather vice, producing calamities. Virtue is sometimes also\r\nthe weakness of men. And though such a man might ever be engaged in the\r\npractice of virtue, yet both virtue and profit forsake him, like pleasure\r\nand pain forsaking a person that is dead. He that practiseth virtue for\r\nvirtue's sake always suffereth. He can scarcely be called a wise man, for\r\nhe knoweth not the purposes of virtue like a blind man incapable of\r\nperceiving the solar light. He that regardeth his wealth to exist for\r\nhimself alone, scarcely understandeth the purposes of wealth. He is\r\nreally like a servant that tendeth kine in a forest. He again that\r\npursueth wealth too much without pursuing virtue and enjoyments,\r\ndeserveth to be censured and slain by all men. He also that ever pursueth\r\nenjoyments without pursuing virtue and wealth, loseth his friends and\r\nvirtue and wealth also. Destitute of virtue and wealth such a man,\r\nindulging in pleasure at will, at the expiration of his period of\r\nindulgence, meeteth with certain death, like a fish when the water in\r\nwhich it liveth hath been dried up. It is for these reasons that they\r\nthat are wise are ever careful of both virtue and wealth, for a union of\r\nvirtue and wealth is the essential requisite of pleasure, as fuel is the\r\nessential requisite of fire. Pleasure hath always virtue for its root,\r\nand virtue also is united with pleasure. Know, O monarch, that both are\r\ndependent on each other like the ocean and the clouds, the ocean causing\r\nthe clouds and the clouds filling the ocean. The joy that one feeleth in\r\nconsequence of contact with objects of touch or of possession of wealth,\r\nis what is called pleasure. It existeth in the mind, having no corporeal\r\nexistence that one can see. He that wisheth (to obtain) wealth, seeketh\r\nfor a large share of virtue to crown his wish with success. He that\r\nwisheth for pleasure, seeketh wealth, (so that his wish may be realised).\r\nPleasure however, yieldeth nothing in its turn. One pleasure cannot lead\r\nto another, being its own fruit, as ashes may be had from wood, but\r\nnothing from those ashes in their turn. And, O king, as a fowler killeth\r\nthe birds we see, so doth sin slay the creatures of the world. He,\r\ntherefore, who misled by pleasure or covetousness, beholdeth not the\r\nnature of virtue, deserveth to be slain by all, and becometh wretched\r\nboth here and here-after. It is evident, O king, that thou knowest that\r\npleasure may be derived from the possession of various objects of\r\nenjoyment. Thou also well knowest their ordinary states, as well as the\r\ngreat changes they undergo. At their loss or disappearance occasioned by\r\ndecrepitude or death, ariseth what is called distress. That distress, O\r\nking, hath now overtaken us. The joy that ariseth from the five senses,\r\nthe intellect and the heart, being directed to the objects proper to\r\neach, is called pleasure. That pleasure, O king, is, as I think, one of\r\nthe best fruits of our actions.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, O monarch, one should regard virtue, wealth and pleasure one after\r\nanother. One should not devote one self to virtue alone, nor regard\r\nwealth as the highest object of one's wishes, nor pleasure, but should\r\never pursue all three. The scriptures ordain that one should seek virtue\r\nin the morning, wealth at noon, and pleasure in the evening. The\r\nscriptures also ordain that one should seek pleasure in the first portion\r\nof life, wealth in the second, and virtue in the last. And, O thou\r\nforemost of speakers, they that are wise and fully conversant with proper\r\ndivision of time, pursue all three, virtue, wealth, and pleasure,\r\ndividing their time duly. O son of the Kuru race, whether independence of\r\nthese (three), or their possession is the better for those that desire\r\nhappiness, should be settled by thee after careful thought. And thou\r\nshouldst then, O king, unhesitatingly act either for acquiring them, or\r\nabandoning them all. For he who liveth wavering between the two\r\ndoubtingly, leadeth a wretched life. It is well known that thy behaviour\r\nis ever regulated by virtue. Knowing this thy friends counsel thee to\r\nact. Gift, sacrifice, respect for the wise, study of the Vedas, and\r\nhonesty, these, O king, constitute the highest virtue and are efficacious\r\nboth here and hereafter. These virtues, however, cannot be attained by\r\none that hath no wealth, even if, O tiger among men, he may have infinite\r\nother accomplishments. The whole universe, O king, dependeth upon virtue.\r\nThere is nothing higher than virtue. And virtue, O king, is attainable by\r\none that hath plenty of wealth. Wealth cannot be earned by leading a\r\nmendicant life, nor by a life of feebleness. Wealth, however, can be\r\nearned by intelligence directed by virtue. In thy case, O king, begging,\r\nwhich is successful with Brahmanas, hath been forbidden. Therefore, O\r\nbull amongst men, strive for the acquisition of wealth by exerting thy\r\nmight and energy. Neither mendicancy, nor the life of a Sudra is what is\r\nproper for thee. Might and energy constitute the virtue of the Kshatriya\r\nin especial. Adopt thou, therefore, the virtue of thy order and slay the\r\nenemies. Destroy the might of Dhritarashtra's sons, O son of Pritha, with\r\nmy and Arjuna's aid. They that are learned and wise say that sovereignty\r\nis virtue. Acquire sovereignty, therefore, for it behoveth thee not to\r\nlive in a state of inferiority. Awake, O king, and understand the eternal\r\nvirtues (of the order). By birth thou belongest to an order whose deeds\r\nare cruel and are a source of pain to man. Cherish thy subjects and reap\r\nthe fruit thereof. That can never be a reproach. Even this, O king, is\r\nthe virtue ordained by God himself for the order to which thou belongest!\r\nIf thou tallest away therefrom, thou wilt make thyself ridiculous.\r\nDeviation from the virtues of one's own order is never applauded.\r\nTherefore, O thou of the Kuru race, making thy heart what it ought to be,\r\nagreeably to the order to which thou belongest, and casting away this\r\ncourse of feebleness, summon thy energy and bear thy weight like one that\r\nbeareth it manfully. No king, O monarch, could ever acquire the\r\nsovereignty of the earth or prosperity or affluence by means of virtue\r\nalone. Like a fowler earning his food in the shape of swarms of little\r\neasily-tempted game, by offering them some attractive food, doth one that\r\nis intelligent acquire a kingdom, by offering bribes unto low and\r\ncovetous enemies. Behold, O bull among kings, the Asuras, though elder\r\nbrothers in possession of power and affluence, were all vanquished by the\r\ngods through stratagem. Thus, O king, everything belongeth to those that\r\nare mighty. And, O mighty-armed one, slay thy foes, having recourse to\r\nstratagem. There is none equal unto Arjuna in wielding the bow in battle.\r\nNor is there anybody that may be equal unto me in wielding the mace.\r\nStrong men, O monarch, engage in battle depending on their might, and not\r\non the force of numbers nor on information of the enemy's plans procured\r\nthrough spies. Therefore, O son of Pandu exert thy might. Might is the\r\nroot of wealth. Whatever else is said to be its root is really not such.\r\nAs the shade of the tree in winter goeth for nothing, so without might\r\neverything else becometh fruitless. Wealth should be spent by one who\r\nwisheth to increase his wealth, after the manner, O son of Kunti, of\r\nscattering seeds on the ground. Let there be no doubt then in thy mind.\r\nWhere, however, wealth that is more or even equal is not to be gained,\r\nthere should be no expenditure of wealth. For investment of wealth are\r\nlike the ass, scratching, pleasurable at first but painful afterwards.\r\nThus, O king of men, the person who throweth away like seeds a little of\r\nhis virtue in order to gain a larger measure of virtue, is regarded as\r\nwise. Beyond doubt, it is as I say. They that are wise alienate the\r\nfriends of the foe that owneth such, and having weakened him by causing\r\nthose friends to abandon him thus, they then reduce him to subjection.\r\nEven they that are strong, engage in battle depending on their courage.\r\nOne cannot by even continued efforts (uninspired by courage) or by the\r\narts of conciliation, always conquer a kingdom. Sometimes, O king, men\r\nthat are weak, uniting in large numbers, slay even a powerful foe, like\r\nbees killing the despoiler of the honey by force of numbers alone. (As\r\nregards thyself), O king, like the sun that sustaineth as well as slayeth\r\ncreatures by his rays, adopt thou the ways of the sun. To protect one's\r\nkingdom and cherish the people duly, as done by our ancestors, O king,\r\nis, it hath been heard by us, a kind of asceticism mentioned even in the\r\nVedas. By ascetism, O king, a Kshatriya cannot acquire such regions of\r\nblessedness as he can by fair fight whether ending in victory or defeat.\r\nBeholding, O king, this thy distress, the world hath come to the\r\nconclusion that light may forsake the Sun and grace the Moon. And, O\r\nking, good men separately as well as assembling together, converse with\r\none another, applauding thee and blaming the other. There is this,\r\nmoreover, O monarch, viz., that both the Kurus and the Brahmanas,\r\nassembling together, gladly speak of thy firm adherence to truth, in that\r\nthou hast never, from ignorance, from meanness, from covetousness, or\r\nfrom fear, uttered an untruth. Whatever sin, O monarch, a king committeth\r\nin acquiring dominion, he consumeth it all afterwards by means of\r\nsacrifices distinguished by large gifts. Like the Moon emerging from the\r\nclouds, the king is purified from all sins by bestowing villages on\r\nBrahmanas and kine by thousands. Almost all the citizens as well as the\r\ninhabitants of the country, young or old, O son of the Kuru race, praise\r\nthee, O Yudhishthira! This also, O Bharata, the people are saying amongst\r\nthemselves, viz., that as milk in a bag of dog's hide, as the Vedas in a\r\nSudra, as truth in a robber, as strength in a woman, so is sovereignty in\r\nDuryodhana. Even women and children are repeating this, as if it were a\r\nlesson they seek to commit to memory. O represser of foes, thou hast\r\nfallen into this state along with ourselves. Alas, we also are lost with\r\nthee for this calamity of thine. Therefore, ascending in thy car\r\nfurnished with every implement, and making the superior Brahmanas utter\r\nbenedictions on thee, march thou with speed, even this very day, upon\r\nHastinapura, in order that thou mayst be able to give unto Brahmanas the\r\nspoils of victory. Surrounded by thy brothers, who are firm wielders of\r\nthe bow, and by heroes skilled in weapons and like unto snakes of\r\nvirulent poison, set thou out even like the slayer Vritra surounded by\r\nthe Marutas. And, O son of Kunti, as thou art powerful, grind thou with\r\nthy might thy weak enemies, like Indra grinding the Asuras; and snatch\r\nthou from Dhritarashtra's son the prosperity he enjoyeth. There is no\r\nmortal that can bear the touch of the shafts furnished with the feathers\r\nof the vulture and resembling snakes of virulent poison, that would be\r\nshot from the Gandiva. And, O Bharata, there is not a warrior, nor an\r\nelephant, nor a horse, that is able to bear the impetus of my mace when I\r\nam angry in battle. Why, O son of Kunti, should we not wrest our kingdom\r\nfrom the foe, fighting with the aid of the Srinjayas and Kaikeyas, and\r\nthe bull of the Vrishni race? Why, O king, should we not succeed in\r\nwresting the (sovereignty of the) earth that is now in the hands of the\r\nfoe, if, aided by a large force, we do but strive?\""

Anger, however, driveth off a person's patience. O child, the mind\r\ncannot be kept under control when it is influenced by hauteur, vanity, or\r\npride. I do not reproach thee, O Bhimasena, for the words thou usest. I\r\nonly regard that what hath befallen us was pre-ordained. When king\r\nDuryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, coveting our kingdom, plunged us\r\ninto misery and even slavery, then, O Bhima, it was Draupadi that rescued\r\nus. When summoned again to the assembly for playing once more, thou\r\nknowest as well as Arjuna what Dhritarashtra's son told me, in the\r\npresence of all the Bharatas, regarding the stake for which we were to\r\nplay. His words were, O prince Ajatsatru, (if vanquished), thou shalt\r\nhave with all thy brothers, to dwell, to the knowledge of all men, for\r\ntwelve years in the forest of thy choice, passing the thirteenth year in\r\nsecrecy. If during the latter period, the spies of the Bharatas, hearing\r\nof thee, succeed in discovering thee, thou shalt have again to live in\r\nthe forest for the same period, passing once more the last year in\r\nsecrecy. Reflecting upon this, pledge thyself to it. As regards myself, I\r\npromise truly in this assembly of the Kurus, that if thou canst pass this\r\ntime confounding my spies and undiscovered by them, then, O Bharata, this\r\nkingdom of the five rivers is once more thine. We also, O Bharata, if\r\nvanquished by thee, shall, all of us, abandoning all our wealth, pass the\r\nsame period, according to the same rules. Thus addressed by the prince, I\r\nreplied unto him in the midst of all the Kurus, 'So be it!' The wretched\r\ngame then commenced. We were vanquished and have been exiled. It is for\r\nthis that we are wandering miserably over different woody regions\r\nabounding with discomfort. Suyodhana, however, still dissatisfied, gave\r\nhimself up to anger, and urged the Kurus as also all those under his sway\r\nto express their joy at our calamity. Having entered into such an\r\nagreement in the presence of all good men, who dareth break it for the\r\nsake of a kingdom on earth? For a respectable person, I think, even death\r\nitself is lighter than the acquisition of sovereignty by an act of\r\ntransgression. At the time of the play, thou hadst desired to burn my\r\nhands. Thou wert prevented by Arjuna, and accordingly didst only squeeze\r\nthy own hands. If thou couldst do what thou hadst desired, could this\r\ncalamity befall us? Conscious of thy prowess, why didst thou not, O\r\nBhima, say so before we entered into such an agreement? Overwhelmed with\r\nthe consequence of our pledge, and the time itself having passed, what is\r\nthe use of thy addressing me these harsh words? O Bhima, this is my great\r\ngrief that we could not do anything even beholding Draupadi persecuted in\r\nthat way. My heart burneth as if I have drunk some poisonous liquid.\r\nHaving, however, given that pledge in the midst of the Kuru heroes, I am\r\nunable to violate it now. Wait, O Bhima, for the return of our better\r\ndays, like the scatterer of seeds waiting for the harvest. When one that\r\nhath been first injured, succeedeth in revenging himself upon his foe at\r\na time when the latter's enmity hath borne fruit and flowers, he is\r\nregarded to have accomplished a great thing by his prowess. Such a brave\r\nperson earneth undying fame. Such a man obtaineth great prosperity. His\r\nenemies bow down unto him, and his friends gather round him, like the\r\ncelestials clustering round Indra for protection. But know, O Bhima, my\r\npromise can never be untrue. I regard virtue as superior to life itself\r\nand a blessed state of celestial existence. Kingdom, sons, fame,\r\nwealth,--all these do not come up to even a sixteenth part of truth.'"

      "content": "Bhima said, 'O king, unsubstantial as thou art like froth, unstable like\r\na fruit (falling when ripe), dependent on time, and mortal, having\r\nentered into an agreement in respect of time, which is infinite and\r\nimmeasurable, quick like a shaft or flowing like a stream, and carrying\r\neverything before it like death itself, how canst regard it as available\r\nby thee? How can he, O son of Kunti, wait whose life is shortened every\r\nmoment, even like a quantity of collyrium that is lessened each time a\r\ngrain is taken up by the needle? He only whose life is unlimited or who\r\nknoweth with certitude what the period of his life is, and who knoweth\r\nthe future as if it were before his eyes, can indeed wait for the arrival\r\nof (an expected) time. If we wait, O king, for thirteen years, that\r\nperiod, shortening our lives, will bring us nearer to death. Death is\r\nsure to overtake every creature having a corporeal existence. Therefore,\r\nwe should strive for the possession of our kingdom before we die. He that\r\nfaileth to achieve fame, by failing to chastise his foes, is like an\r\nunclean thing. He is a useless burden on the earth like an incapacitated\r\nbull and perisheth ingloriously. The man who, destitute of strength, and\r\ncourage, chastiseth not his foes, liveth in vain, I regard such a one as\r\nlow-born. Thy hand can rain gold; thy fame spreadeth over the whole\r\nearth; slaying thy foes, therefore, in battle, enjoy thou the wealth\r\nacquired by the might of thy arms. O repressor of all foes, O king, if a\r\nman slaying his injurer, goeth the very day into hell, that hell becometh\r\nheaven to him. O king, the pain one feeleth in having to suppress one's\r\nwrath is more burning than fire itself. Even now I burn with it and\r\ncannot sleep in the day or the night. This son of Pritha, called\r\nVibhatsu, is foremost in drawing the bow-string. He certainly burneth\r\nwith grief, though he liveth here like a lion in his den. This one that\r\ndesireth to slay without aid all wielders of the bow on earth, represseth\r\nthe wrath that riseth in his breast, like a mighty elephant. Nakula,\r\nSahadeva, and old Kunti--that mother of heroes, are all dumb, desiring to\r\nplease thee. And all our friends along with the Srinjayas equally desire\r\nto please thee. I alone, and Prativindhya's mother speak unto thee\r\nburning with grief. Whatever I speak unto thee is agreeable to all of\r\nthem, for all of them plunged in distress, eagerly wish for battle. Then,\r\nO monarch, what more wretched a calamity can overtake us that our kingdom\r\nshould be wrested from us by weak and contemptible foes and enjoyed by\r\nthem? O king, from the weakness of thy disposition thou feelest shame in\r\nviolating thy pledge. But, O slayer of foes, no one applaudeth thee for\r\nthus suffering such pain in consequence of the kindliness of thy\r\ndisposition. Thy intellect, O king, seeth not the truth, like that of a\r\nfoolish and ignorant person of high birth who hath committed the words of\r\nthe Vedas to memory without understanding their sense. Thou art kind like\r\na Brahmana. How hast thou been born in the Kshatriya order? They that are\r\nborn in the Kshatriya order are generally of crooked hearts. Thou hast\r\nheard (recited) the duties of kings, as promulgated by Manu, fraught with\r\ncrookedness and unfairness and precepts opposed to tranquillity and\r\nvirtue. Why dost thou then, O king, forgive the wicked sons of\r\nDhritarashtra? Thou hast intelligence, prowess, learning and high birth.\r\nWhy dost thou then, O tiger among men, act in respect of thy duties, like\r\na huge snake that is destitute of motion? O son of Kunti, he that\r\ndesireth to conceal us, only wisheth to conceal the mountains of Himavat\r\nby means of a handful of grass. O son of Pritha, known as thou art over\r\nwhole earth, thou wilt not be able to live unknown, like the sun that can\r\nnever course through the sky unknown to men. Like a large tree in a\r\nwell-watered region with spreading branches and flowers and leaves, or\r\nlike Indra's elephant, how will Jishnu live unknown? How also will these\r\nchildren, the brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, equal unto a couple of young\r\nlions, both live in secret? How, O son of Pritha, will Krishna--the\r\ndaughter of Drupada--a princess and mother of heroes, of virtuous deeds\r\nand known over all the world, live unknown? Me also, everybody knoweth\r\nfrom my boyhood. I do not see how I can live unknown. As well mighty\r\nmountains of Meru be sought to be concealed. Then, again, many kings had\r\nbeen expelled by us from their kingdom. These kings and princes will all\r\nfollow the bad son of Dhritarashtra, for robbed and exiled by us, they\r\nhave not still become friendly. Desiring to do good unto Dhritarashtra,\r\nthey will certainly seek to injure us. They will certainly set against us\r\nnumerous spies in disguise. If these discover us and report their\r\ndiscovery, a great danger will overtake us. We have already lived in the\r\nwoods full thirteen months. Regard them, O king, for their length as\r\nthirteen years. The wise have said that a month is a substitute for a\r\nyear, like the pot-herb that is regarded as a substitute for the Soma.\r\nOr, (if thou breakest thy pledge), O king, thou mayst free thyself from\r\nthis sin by offering good savoury food to a quiet bull carrying sacred\r\nburdens. Therefore, O king resolve thou to slay thy enemies. There is no\r\nvirtue higher than fighting, for every Kshatriya!\""

And he thought within himself, 'I have heard\r\nrecited the duties of kings, also all truths about the duties of the\r\ndifferent orders. He is said to observe those duties truly who keepeth\r\nthem before his eyes, so as to regulate his conduct both in the present\r\nand the future. Knowing as I do the true course of virtue, which, however\r\nis so very difficult of being known, how can I forcibly grind virtue down\r\nlike grinding the mountains of Meru? Having reflected so for a moment,\r\nand settled what he should do, he replied unto Bhima as follows without\r\nallowing him another word:\r\n\r\n\"O thou of mighty arms, it is even so as thou hast said. But, O thou\r\nforemost of speakers, listen now to another word I say. Whatever sinful\r\ndeeds, O Bhima, one seeketh to achieve, depending on his courage alone,\r\nbecome always a source of pain. But, O thou of mighty arms, whatever is\r\nbegun with deliberation, with well-directed prowess, with all appliances,\r\nand much previous thought, is seen to succeed. The gods themselves favour\r\nsuch designs. Hear from me something about what, proud of thy might, O\r\nBhima, and led away by thy restlessness, thou thinkest should be\r\nimmediately begun. Bhurisravas, Sala, the mighty Jarasandha, Bhishma,\r\nDrona, Karna, the mighty son of Drona, Dhritarashtra's sons--Duryodhana\r\nand others--so difficult of being vanquished, are all accomplished in\r\narms and ever ready for battle with us. Those kings and chiefs of the\r\nearth also who have been injured by us, have all adopted the side of the\r\nKauravas, and are bound by ties of affection to them. O Bharata, they are\r\nengaged in seeking the good of Duryodhana and not of us. With full\r\ntreasures and aided by large forces, they will certainly strive their\r\nbest in battle. All the officers also of the Kuru army together with\r\ntheir sons and relatives, have been honoured by Duryodhana with wealth\r\nand luxuries. Those heroes are also much regarded by Duryodhana. This is\r\nmy certain conclusion that they will sacrifice their lives for Duryodhana\r\nin battle. Although the behaviour of Bhishma, Drona, and the illustrious\r\nKripa, is the same towards us as towards them, yet, O thou of mighty\r\narms, this is my certain conclusion that in order to pay off the royal\r\nfavours they enjoy, they will throw their very lives, than which there is\r\nnothing dearer, in battle. All of them are masters of celestial weapons,\r\nand devoted to the practice of virtue. I think they are incapable of\r\nbeing vanquished even by gods led by Vasava himself. There is again\r\namongst them that mighty warrior--Karna--impetuous, and ever wrathful,\r\nmaster of all weapons, and invincible, and encased in impenetrable mail.\r\nWithout first vanquishing in battle all those foremost of men, unaided as\r\nthou art, how canst thou slay Duryodhana? O Vrikodara, I cannot sleep\r\nthinking of the lightness of hand of that Suta's son, who, I regard, is\r\nthe foremost of all wielders of the bow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of Yudhishthira, the\r\nimpetuous Bhima became alarmed, and forbore from speaking anything. And\r\nwhile the sons of Pandu were thus conversing with each other, there came\r\nto that spot the great ascetic Vyasa, the son of Satyavati. And as he\r\ncame, the sons of Pandu worshipped him duly. Then that foremost of all\r\nspeakers, addressing Yudhishthira, said, O, Yudhishthira, O thou of\r\nmighty arms, knowing by spiritual insight what is passing in thy heart, I\r\nhave come to thee, O thou bull among men! The fear that is in thy heart,\r\narising from Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and Drona's son,\r\nand prince Duryodhana, and Dussasana, I will dispell, O slayer of all\r\nfoes, by means of an act enjoined by the ordinance. Hearing it from me,\r\naccomplish it thou with patience, and having accomplished it, O king,\r\nquell this fever of thine soon.'\"\r\n\r\nThat foremost of speakers then, the son of Parasara, taking Yudhishthira\r\nto a corner, began to address him in words of deep import, saying, 'O\r\nbest of the Bharatas, the time is come for thy prosperity, when, indeed\r\nDhananjaya--that son of Pritha--will slay all thy foes in battle. Uttered\r\nby me and like unto success personified, accept from me this knowledge\r\ncalled Pratismriti that I impart to thee, knowing thou art capable of\r\nreceiving it. Receiving it (from thee), Arjuna will be able to accomplish\r\nhis desire. And let Arjuna, O son of Pandu, go unto Mahendra and Rudra,\r\nand Varuna, and Kuvera, and Yama, for receiving weapon from them. He is\r\ncompetent to behold the gods for his asceticism and prowess. He is even a\r\nRishi of great energy, the friend of Narayana; ancient, eternal a god\r\nhimself, invincible, ever successful, and knowing no deterioration. Of\r\nmighty arms, he will achieve mighty deeds, having obtained weapons from\r\nIndra, and Rudra, and the Lokapalas, O son of Kunti, think also of going\r\nfrom this to some other forest that may, O king, be fit for thy abode. To\r\nreside in one place for any length of time is scarcely pleasant. In thy\r\ncase, it might also be productive of anxiety to the ascetics. And as thou\r\nmaintainest numerous Brahmanas versed in the Vedas and the several\r\nbranches thereof, continued residence here might exhaust the deer of this\r\nforest, and be destructive of the creepers and plants.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having addressed him thus, that illustrious and\r\nexalted ascetic Vyasa, of great wisdom, acquired with the mysteries of\r\nthe world, then imparted unto the willing Yudhishthira the just, who had\r\nmeanwhile purified himself, that foremost of sciences. And bidding\r\nfarewell unto the son of Kunti, Vyasa disappeared then and there. The\r\nvirtuous and intelligent Yudhishthira, however, having obtained that\r\nknowledge carefully retained it in his mind and always recited it on\r\nproper occasions. Glad of the advice given him by Vyasa, the son of Kunti\r\nthen, leaving the wood Dwaitavana went to the forest of Kamyaka on the\r\nbanks of the Saraswati. And, O king, numerous Brahmanas of ascetic merit\r\nand versed in the science of orthoepy and orthography, followed him like\r\nthe Rishis following the chief of the celestials. Arrived at Kamyaka,\r\nthose illustrious bulls amongst the Bharata took up their residence there\r\nalong with their friends and attendants. And possessed of energy, those\r\nheroes, O king, lived there for some time, devoted to the exercise of the\r\nbow and hearing all the while the chanting of the Vedas. And they went\r\nabout those woods every day in search of deer, armed with pure arrows.\r\nAnd they duly performed all the rites in honour of the Pitris, the\r\ncelestials and the Brahmanas.\""

Taking\r\nhold of Arjuna's hands, with a smiling face and in gentle accents, that\r\nchastiser of foes--the virtuous Yudhishthira--apparently after reflecting\r\nfor a moment, spake these words in private unto Dhananjaya, 'O Bharata,\r\nthe whole science of arms dwelleth in Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and\r\nKarna, and Drona's son. They fully know all sorts of Brahma and celestial\r\nand human and Vayavya weapons, together with the modes of using and\r\nwarding them off. All of them are conciliated and honoured and gratified\r\nby Dhritarashtra's son who behaveth unto them as one should behave unto\r\nhis preceptor. Towards all his warriors Dhritarashtra's son behaveth with\r\ngreat affection; and all the chiefs honoured and gratified by him, seek\r\nhis good in return. Thus honoured by him, they will not fail to put forth\r\ntheir might. The whole earth, besides, is now under Duryodhana's sway,\r\nwith all the villages and towns, O son of Pritha, and all the seas and\r\nwoods and mines! Thou alone art our sole refuge. On thee resteth a great\r\nburden. I shall, therefore, O chastiser of all foes, tell thee what thou\r\nart to do now. I have obtained a science from Krishna Dwaipayana. Used by\r\nthee, that science will expose the whole universe to thee. O child,\r\nattentively receive thou that science from me, and in due time (by its\r\naid) attain thou the grace of the celestials. And, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, devote thyself to fierce asceticism. Armed with the bow and sword,\r\nand cased in mail, betake thyself to austerities and good vows, and go\r\nthou northwards, O child, without giving way to anybody. O Dhananjaya,\r\nall celestial weapons are with Indra. The celestials, from fear of\r\nVritra, imparted at the time all their might to Sakra. Gathered together\r\nin one place, thou wilt obtain all weapons. Go thou unto Sakra, he will\r\ngive thee all his weapons. Taking the bow set thou out this very day in\r\norder to behold Purandara.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having said this, the exalted Yudhishthira the\r\njust, imparted that science unto Arjuna. And the elder brother having\r\ncommunicated with due rites the knowledge unto his heroic brother, with\r\nspeech and body and mind under perfect control, commanded him to depart.\r\nAnd at the command of Yudhishthira, the strong-armed Arjuna, taking up\r\nthe Gandiva as also his inexhaustible quivers, and accoutred in mail and\r\ngauntlets and finger-protectors made of the skin of the guana, and having\r\npoured oblations into the fire and made the Brahmanas to utter\r\nbenedictions after gifts, set out (from Kamyaka) with the objects of\r\nbeholding Indra. And armed with the bow, the hero, at the time of setting\r\nout heaved a sigh and cast a look upwards for achieving the death of\r\nDhritarashtra's sons. And beholding Kunti's son thus armed and about to\r\nset out, the Brahmanas and Siddhas and invisible spirits addressed him,\r\nsaying, 'O son of Kunti, obtain thou soon what thou wishest.' And the\r\nBrahmanas, also uttering benedictions said, 'Achieve thou the object thou\r\nhast in view. Let victory be truly thine.' And beholding the heroic\r\nArjuna, of thighs stout as the trunks of the Sala, about to set out\r\ntaking away with him the hearts of all, Krishna addressed him saying, 'O\r\nthou strong-armed one, let all that Kunti had desired at thy birth, and\r\nlet all that thou desirest, be accomplished, O Dhananjaya! Let no one\r\namongst us be ever again born in the order of Kshatriyas. I always bow\r\ndown unto the Brahmanas whose mode of living is mendicancy. This is my\r\ngreat grief that the wretch Duryodhana beholding me in the assembly of\r\nprinces mockingly called me a cow! Besides this he told me in the midst\r\nof that assembly many other hard things. But the grief I experience at\r\nparting with thee is far greater than any I felt at those insults.\r\nCertainly, in thy absence, thy brothers will while away their waking\r\nhours in repeatedly talking of thy heroic deeds! If, however, O son of\r\nPritha, thou stayest away for any length of time, we shall derive no\r\npleasure from our enjoyments or from wealth. Nay, life itself will be\r\ndistasteful to us. O son of Pritha, our weal, and woe, life and death,\r\nour kingdom and prosperity, are all dependent on thee. O Bharata, I bless\r\nthee, let success be thine. O sinless one, thy (present) task thou wilt\r\nbe able to achieve even against powerful enemies. O thou of great\r\nstrength, go thou to win success with speed. Let dangers be not thine. I\r\nbow to Dhatri and Vidhatri! I bless thee. Let prosperity be thine. And, O\r\nDhananjaya, let Hri, Sree, Kirti, Dhriti, Pushti, Uma, Lakshmi,\r\nSaraswati, all protect thee on thy way, for thou ever worshippest thy\r\nelder brother and ever obeyest his commands. And, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, I bow to the Vasus, the Rudras and Adityas, the Manilas, the\r\nViswadevas, and the Sadhyas, for procuring thy welfare. And, O Bharata,\r\nbe thou safe from all spirits of mischief belonging to the sky, the\r\nearth, and the heaven, and from such other spirits generally.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Krishna, the daughter of Yajnasena, having\r\nuttered these benedictions, ceased. The strong-armed son of Pandu then,\r\nhaving walked round his brothers and round Dhaumya also, and taking up\r\nhis handsome bow, set out. And all creatures began to leave the way that\r\nArjuna of great energy and prowess, urged by the desire of beholding\r\nIndra, took. And that slayer of foes passed over many mountains inhabited\r\nby ascetics, and then reached the sacred Himavat, the resort of the\r\ncelestials. And the high-souled one reached the sacred mountain in one\r\nday, for like the winds he was gifted with the speed of the mind, in\r\nconsequence of his ascetic austerities. And having crossed the Himavat,\r\nas also the Gandhamadana, he passed over many uneven and dangerous spots,\r\nwalking night and day without fatigue. And having reached Indrakila,\r\nDhananjaya stopped for a moment. And then he heard a voice in the skies,\r\nsaying, 'Stop!' And hearing that voice, the son of Pandu cast his glances\r\nall around. And Arjuna, capable of using his left hand with skill equal\r\nto that of his right hand, then beheld before him an ascetic under the\r\nshade of a tree, blazing with Brahma brilliancy, of a tawny colour, with\r\nmatted locks, and thin. And the mighty ascetic, beholding Arjuna stop at\r\nt at place, addressed him, saying, 'Who art thou, O child, arrived hither\r\nwith bow and arrows, and cased in mail and accoutred in scabbard and\r\ngauntlet, and (evidently) wedded to the customs of the Kshatriya? There\r\nis no need of weapons here. This is the abode of peaceful Brahmanas\r\ndevoted to ascetic austerities without anger or joy. There is no use for\r\nthe bow here, for there is no dispute in this place of any kind.\r\nTherefore throw away, O child, this bow of thine. Thou hast obtained a\r\npure state of life by coming here. O hero, there is no man who is like\r\nthee in energy and prowess.' That Brahmana thus addressed Arjuna, with a\r\nsmiling face, repeatedly. But he succeeded not in moving Arjuna, firmly\r\ndevoted to his purpose. The regenerate one, glad at heart, smilingly\r\naddressed Arjuna once more, saying, 'O slayer of foes, blest be thou! I\r\nam Sakra: ask thou the boon thou desirest.' Thus addressed, that\r\nperpetuator of the Kuru race, the heroic Dhananjaya bending his head and\r\njoining his hands, replied unto him of a thousand eyes, saying, 'Even\r\nthis is the object of my wishes; grant me this boon, O illustrious one. I\r\ndesire to learn from thee all the weapons.' The chief of the celestials\r\nthen, smiling, replied unto him cheerfully, saying, 'O Dhananjaya, when\r\nthou hast reached this region, what need is there of weapons? Thou hast\r\nalready obtained a pure state of life. Ask thou for the regions of bliss\r\nthat thou desirest.' Thus addressed, Dhananjaya replied unto him o a\r\nthousand eyes, saying, 'I desire not regions of bliss, nor objects of\r\nenjoyment, nor the state of a celestial; what is this talk about\r\nhappiness? O chief of the celestials, I do not desire the prosperity of\r\nall the gods. Having left my brothers behind me in the forest, and\r\nwithout avenging myself on the foe, shall I incur the opprobrium for all\r\nages of all the world.\" Thus addressed, the slayer of Vritra, worshipped\r\nof the worlds, consoling him with gentle words, spare unto the son of\r\nPandu, saying, 'When thou art able to behold the three-eyed\r\ntrident-bearing Siva, the lord of all creatures, it is then, O child,\r\nthat I will give thee all the celestial weapons. Therefore, strive thou\r\nto obtain the sight of the highest of the gods; for it is only after thou\r\nhast seen him. O son of Kunti, that thou will obtain all thy wishes.'\r\nHaving spoken thus unto Phalguna, Sakra disappeared then and there, and\r\nArjuna, devoting himself to asceticism, remained at that spot.\""

And the strong-armed Arjuna of great\r\nmight set out armed with his celestial bow and a sword with golden hilt,\r\nfor the success of the object he had in view, northwards, towards the\r\nsummit of the Himavat. And, O king, that first of all warriors in the\r\nthree worlds, the son of Indra, with a calm mind, and firmly adhering to\r\nhis purpose, then devoted himself, without the loss of any time, to\r\nascetic austerities. And he entered, all alone, that terrible forest\r\nabounding with thorny plants and trees and flowers and fruits of various\r\nkinds, and inhabited by winged creatures of various species, and swarming\r\nwith animals of diverse kinds, and resorted to by Siddhas and Charanas.\r\nAnd when the son of Kunti entered that forest destitute of human beings,\r\nsounds of conchs and drums began to be heard in the heavens. And a thick\r\nshower of flowers fell upon the earth, and the clouds spreading over the\r\nfirmament caused a thick shade. Passing over those difficult and woody\r\nregions at the foot of the great mountains, Arjuna soon reached the\r\nbreast of the Himavat; and staying there for sometime began to shine in\r\nhis brilliancy. And he beheld there numerous trees with expanding\r\nverdure, resounding with the melodious notes of winged warblers. And he\r\nsaw there rivers with currents of the lapis lazuli, broken by the fierce\r\neddies here and there, and echoing with the notes of swans and ducks and\r\ncranes. And the banks of those rivers resounded with the mellifluous\r\nstrains of the male Kokilas and the notes of peacocks and cranes. And the\r\nmighty warrior, beholding those rivers of sacred and pure and delicious\r\nwater and their charming banks, became highly delighted. And the\r\ndelighted Arjuna of fierce energy and high soul then devoted himself to\r\nrigid austerities in that delightful and woody region. Clad in rags made\r\nof grass and furnished with a black deerskin and a stick, he commenced to\r\neat withered leaves fallen upon the ground. And he passed the first\r\nmonth, by eating fruits at the interval of three nights; and the second\r\nby eating at the interval of the six nights; and the third by eating at\r\nthe interval of a fortnight. When the fourth month came, that best of the\r\nBharatas--the strong-armed son of Pandu--began to subsist on air alone.\r\nWith arms upraised and leaning upon nothing and standing on the tips of\r\nhis toes, he continued his austerities. And the illustrious hero's locks,\r\nin consequence of frequent bathing took the hue of lightning or the\r\nlotus. Then all the great Rishis went together unto the god of the Pinaka\r\nfor representing unto him about the fierce asceticism of Pritha's son.\r\nAnd bowing unto that god of gods, they informed him of Arjuna's\r\nausterities saying, 'This son of pritha possessed of great energy is\r\nengaged in the most difficult of ascetic austerities on the breast of the\r\nHimavat. Heated with his asceticism, the earth is smoking all round, O\r\ngod of gods. We do not know what his object is for which he is engaged in\r\nthese austerities. He, however, is causing us pain. It behoveth thee to\r\nprevent him!' Hearing these words of those munis with souls under perfect\r\ncontrol, the lord of all creatures--the husband of Uma said, 'It behoveth\r\nyou not to indulge in any grief on account of Phalguna! Return ye all\r\ncheerfully and with alacrity to the places whence ye have come. I know\r\nthe desire that is in Arjuna's heart. His wish is not for heaven, nor for\r\nprosperity, nor for long life. And I will accomplish, even, this day, all\r\nthat is desired by him.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"The truth-speaking Rishis, having heard these\r\nwords of Mahadeva, became delighted, and returned to their respective\r\nabodes.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said, \"After all those illustrious ascetics had gone away,\r\nthat wielder of the Pinaka and cleanser of all sins--the illustrious\r\nHara--assuming the form of a Kirata resplendent as a golden tree, and\r\nwith a huge and stalwart form like a second Meru, and taking up a hand\r\nsome bow and a number of arrows resembling snakes of virulent poison, and\r\nlooking like an embodiment of fire, came quickly down on the breast of\r\nHimavat. And the handsome god of gods was accompanied by Uma in the guise\r\nof a Kirata woman, and also by a swarm of merry spirits of various forms\r\nand attire, and by thousands of women in the form and attire of Kiratas.\r\nAnd, O king, that region suddenly blazed up in beauty, in consequence of\r\nthe arrival of the god of gods in such company. And soon enough a solemn\r\nstillness pervaded the place. The sounds of springs, and water-courses,\r\nand of birds suddenly ceased. And as the god of gods approached Pritha's\r\nson of blameless deeds, he beheld a wonderful sight, even that of a\r\nDanava named Muka, seeking, in the form of a boar, to slay Arjuna.\r\nPhalguna, at the sight of the enemy seeking to slay him, took up the\r\nGandiva and a number of arrows resembling snakes of virulent poison. And\r\nstringing his bow and filling the air with its twang, he addressed the\r\nboar and said, 'I have come here but done thee no injury. As thou seekest\r\nto slay me, I shall certainly send thee to the abode of Yama.' And\r\nbeholding that firm wielder of the bow--Phalguna--about to slay the boar,\r\nSankara in the guise of a Kirata suddenly bade him stop saying, 'The boar\r\nlike the mountain of Indrakila in hue hath been aimed at by me first';\r\nPhalguna, however, disregarding these words, struck the boar. The Kirata\r\nalso blazing splendour, let fly an arrow like flaming fire and resembling\r\nthe thunderbolt at the same object. And the arrows thus shot by both fell\r\nat the same instant of time upon the wide body of Muka, hard as adamant.\r\nAnd the two shafts fell upon the boar with a loud sound, even like that\r\nof Indra's thunderbolt and the thunder of the clouds falling together\r\nupon the breast of a mountain. And Muka, thus struck by two shafts which\r\nproduced numerous arrows resembling snakes of blazing mouths, yielded up\r\nhis life, assuming once more his terrible Rakshasa form. Jishnu--that\r\nslayer of foes--then beheld before him that person, of form blazing as\r\ngod, and attired in the dress of a Kirata and accompanied by many women.\r\nAnd beholding him, the son of Kunti with a joyous heart addressed him\r\nsmilingly and said, 'Who art thou that thus wanderest in these solitary\r\nwoods, surrounded by women? thou of the splendour of gold, art thou not\r\nafraid of this terrible forest? Why, again, didst thou shoot the boar\r\nthat was first aimed at by me? This Rakshasa that came hither, listlessly\r\nor with the object, of slaying me, had been first aimed at by me. Thou\r\nshalt not, therefore, escape from me with life. Thy behaviour towards me\r\nis not consistent with the customs of the chase. Therefore, O\r\nmountaineer, I will take thy life.' Thus addressed by the son of Pandu,\r\nthe Kirata, smiling replied unto his capable of wielding the bow with his\r\nleft hand, in soft words, saying, 'O hero, thou needst not be anxious on\r\nmy account. This forest land is proper abode for us who always dwell in\r\nthe woods. Respecting thyself, however, I may inquire, why thou hast\r\nselected thy abode here amid such difficulties. We, O ascetic, have our\r\nhabitation in these woods abounding in animals of all kinds. Why dost\r\nthou, so delicate and brought up in luxury and possessed of the splendour\r\nof fire, dwell alone in such a solitary region?' Arjuna said, 'Depending\r\non the Gandiva and arrows blazing like fire, I live in this great forest,\r\nlike a second Pavaki. Thou hast seen how this monster--this terrible\r\nRakshasa--that came hither in the form of an animal, hath been slain by\r\nme.' The Kirata replied, 'This Rakshasa, first struck with the shot from\r\nmy bow, was killed and sent to the regions of Yama by me. He was first\r\naimed at by me. And it is with my shot that he has been deprived of life.\r\nProud of thy strength, it behoveth thee not to impute thy own fault to\r\nothers. Thou art thyself in fault, O wretch, and, therefore, shalt not\r\nescape from me with life. Stay thou: I will shoot at thee shafts like\r\nthunderbolts. Strive thou also and shoot, to the best of thy power, thy\r\narrows at me.' Hearing these words of the Kirata, Arjuna became angry,\r\nand attacked him with arrows. The Kirata, however, with a glad heart\r\nreceived all those shafts upon himself, repeatedly saying, 'Wretch,\r\nwretch, shoot thou best arrows capable of piercing into the very vitals.'\r\nThus addressed, Arjuna, began to shower his arrows on him. Both of them\r\nthen became angry and, engaging in fierce conflict, began to shoot at\r\neach other showers of arrows, each resembling a snake of virulent poison.\r\nAnd Arjuna rained a perfect shower of arrows on the Kirata, Sankara,\r\nhowever, bore that downpour on him with a cheerful heart. But the wielder\r\nof the Pinaka, having borne that shower of arrows for a moment, stood\r\nunwounded, immovable like a hill. Dhananjaya, beholding his arrowy shower\r\nbecome futile, wondered exceedingly, repeatedly saying, 'Excellent!\r\nExcellent! Alas, this mountaineer of delicate limbs, dwelling on the\r\nheights of the Himavat, beareth, without wavering, the shafts shot from\r\nthe Gandiva! Who is he? Is he Rudra himself, or some other god, or a\r\nYaksha, or an Asura? The gods sometimes do descend on the heights of the\r\nHimavat. Except the god who wieldeth the Pinaka, there is none rise that\r\ncan bear the impetuosity of the thousands of arrows shot by me from the\r\nGandiva. Whether he is a god or a Yaksha, in fact, anybody except Rudra,\r\nI shall soon send him, with my shafts, to the regions of Yama.' Thus\r\nthinking, Arjuna, with a cheerful heart, began, O king, to shoot arrows\r\nby hundreds, resembling in splendour the rays of the sun. That downpour\r\nof shafts, however, the illustrious Creator of the worlds--the wielder of\r\nthe trident--bore with a glad heart, like a mountain bearing a shower of\r\nrocks. Soon, however, the arrows of Phalguna were exhausted. And noticing\r\nthis fact, Arjuna became greatly alarmed. And the son of Pandu then began\r\nto think of the illustrious god Agni who had before, during the burning\r\nof the Khandava, given him a couple of inexhaustible quivers. And he\r\nbegan to think, 'Alas, my arrows are all exhausted. What shall I shoot\r\nnow from my bow? Who is this person that swalloweth my arrows? Slaying\r\nhim with the end of my bow, as elephants are killed with lances, I shall\r\nsend him to the domains of the mace-bearing Yama.' The illustrious Arjuna\r\nthen, taking up his bow and dragging the Kirata with his bow-string,\r\nstruck him some fierce blows that descended like thunderbolts. When,\r\nhowever, that slayer of hostile heroes--the son of Kunti--commenced the\r\nconflict with the end of the bow, the mountaineer snatched from his hands\r\nthat celestial bow. And beholding his bow snatched from him, Arjuna took\r\nup his sword, and wishing to end the conflict, rushed at his foe. And\r\nthen the Kuru prince, with the whole might of his arms, struck that sharp\r\nweapon upon the head of the Kirata, a weapon that was incapable of being\r\nresisted even by solid rocks. But that first of swords, at touch of the\r\nKirata's crown, broke into pieces. Phalguna then commenced the conflict\r\nwith trees and stones. The illustrious god in the form of the huge-bodied\r\nKirata, however, bore that shower of trees and rocks with patience. The\r\nmighty son of Pritha then, his mouth smoking with wrath, struck the\r\ninvincible god in the form of a Kirata, with hi clenched fists, blows\r\nthat descended like thunderbolts. The god in the Kirata form returned\r\nPhalguna's blows with fierce blows resembling the thunderbolts of Indra.\r\nAnd in consequence of that conflict of blows between the son of Pandu and\r\nthe Kirata, there arose in that place loud and frightful sounds. That\r\nterrible conflict of blows, resembling the conflict of yore between\r\nVritra and Vasava, lasted but for a moment. The mighty Jishnu clasping\r\nthe Kirata began to press him with his breast, but the Kirata, possessed\r\nof great strength pressed the insensible son of Pandu with force. And in\r\nconsequence of the pressure of their arms and of their breasts, their\r\nbodies began to emit smoke like charcoal in fire. The great god then,\r\nsmiting the already smitten son of Pandu, and attacking him in anger with\r\nhis full might, deprived him of his senses. Then, O Bharata, Phalguna,\r\nthus pressed by the god of the gods, with limbs, besides, bruised and\r\nmangled, became incapable of motion and was almost reduced to a ball of\r\nflesh. And struck by the illustrious god, he became breathless and,\r\nfalling down on earth without power of moving, looked like one that was\r\ndead. Soon, however, he regained consciousness, and, rising from his\r\nprostrate position, with body covered with blood, became filled with\r\ngrief. Mentally prostrating himself before the gracious god of gods, and\r\nmaking a clay image of that deity, he worshipped it, with offerings of\r\nfloral garlands. Beholding, however, the garland that he had offered to\r\nthe clay image of Bhava, decking the crown of the Kirata, that best of\r\nPandu's sons became filled with joy and regained his ease. And he\r\nprostrated himself thereupon at the feet of Bhava, and the god also was\r\npleased with him. And Hara, beholding the wonder of Arjuna and seeing\r\nthat his body had been emaciated with ascetic austerities, spake unto him\r\nin a voice deep as the roaring of the clouds, saying, 'O Phalguna, I have\r\nbeen pleased with thee for thy act is without a parallel. There is no\r\nKshatriya who is equal to thee in courage, and patience. And, O sinless\r\none, thy strength and prowess are almost equal to mine. O mighty-armed\r\none, I have been pleased with thee. Behold me, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace! O large-eyed one! I will grant thee eyes (to see me in my true\r\nform). Thou wert a Rishi before. Thou wilt vanquish all thy foes, even\r\nthe dwellers of heaven; I will as I have been pleased with thee, grant\r\nthee an irresistible weapon. Soon shall thou be able to wield that weapon\r\nof mine.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Phalguna then beheld him--Mahadeva--that god of\r\nblazing splendour-that wielder of the Pinaka-that one who had his abode\r\non the mountains (of Kailasa)--accompanied by Uma. Bending down on his\r\nknee and bowing with his head, that conqueror of hostile cities-the son\r\nof Pritha-worshipped Hara and inclined him to grace. And Arjuna said, 'O\r\nKapardin, O chief of all gods, O destroyer of the eyes of Bhaga, O god of\r\ngods, O Mahadeva, O thou of blue throat, O thou of matted locks, I know\r\nthee as the Cause of all causes. O thou of three eyes, O lord of all!\r\nThou art the refuge of all the gods! This universe hath sprung from thee.\r\nThou art incapable of being vanquished by the three worlds of the\r\ncelestials, the Asuras, and men. Thou art Siva in the form of Vishnu, and\r\nVishnu in the form of Siva. Thou destroyedest of old the great sacrifice\r\nof Daksha. O Hari, O Rudra, I bow to thee. Thou hast an eye on thy\r\nforehead. O Sarva, O thou that rainest objects of desire, O bearer of the\r\ntrident, O wielder of the Pinaka, O Surya, O thou of pure body, O Creator\r\nof all, I bow to thee. O lord of all created things, I worship thee to\r\nobtain thy grace. Thou art the lord of the Ganas, the source of universal\r\nblessing, the Cause of the causes of the universe. Thou art beyond the\r\nforemost of male beings, thou art the highest, thou art the subtlest, O\r\nHara! O illustrious Sankara, it behoveth thee to pardon my fault. It was\r\neven to obtain a sight of thyself that I came to this great mountain,\r\nwhich is dear to thee and which is the excellent abode of ascetics. Thou\r\nart worshipped of all worlds. O lord, I worship thee to obtain thy grace.\r\nLet not this rashness of mine be regarded as a fault--this combat in\r\nwhich I was engaged with thee from ignorance. O Sankara, I seek thy\r\nprotection. Pardon me all I have done.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Endued with great might, the god whose sign was\r\nthe bull, taking into his the handsome hands of Arjuna, smilingly replied\r\nunto him, saying, 'I have pardoned thee. And the illustrious Hara,\r\ncheerfully clasping Arjuna with his arms, once more consoling Arjuna said\r\nas follows.\""

O thou of invincible prowess I take it up for giving it to\r\nthee. Endued with the dignity of the Meru, thou art competent to hold\r\nthis weapon.'\"\r\n\r\n\"After these words had been spoken, the Kuru prince Arjuna endued with\r\ngreat strength, duly received from Kuvera that celestial weapon. Then the\r\nchief of the celestials addressing Pritha's son of ceaseless deeds in\r\nsweet words, said, in a voice deep as that the clouds or the kettle-drum,\r\n'O thou mighty-armed son of Kunti, thou art an ancient god. Thou hast\r\nalready achieved the highest success, and acquired the statue of a god.\r\nBut, O represser of foes, thou hast yet to accomplish the purposes of the\r\ngods. Thou must ascend to heaven. Therefore prepare thou O hero of great\r\nsplendour! My own car with Matali as charioteer, will soon descend on the\r\nearth. Taking thee, O Kaurava, to heaven, I will grant thee there all my\r\ncelestial weapons.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Beholding those protectors of the worlds assembled together on the\r\nheights of Himavat, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, wondered much, Endued\r\nwith great energy, he then duly worshipped the assembled Lokapalas, with\r\nwords, water, and fruits. The celestials then returning that worship,\r\nwent away. And the gods capable of going everywhere at will, and endued\r\nwith the speed of the mind, returned to the places whence they had come.\"\r\n\r\n\"That bull among men--Arjuna--having obtained weapons thus, was filled\r\nwith pleasure. And he regarded himself as one whose desires had been\r\nfulfilled and who was crowned with success.\""

      "content": "(Indralokagamana Parva)\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"After the Lokapalas had gone away, Arjuna--that\r\nslayer of all foes--began to think, O monarch, of the car of Indra! And\r\nas Gudakesa gifted with great intelligence was thinking of it, the car\r\nendued with great effulgence and guided by Matali, came dividing the\r\nclouds and illuminating the firmament and filling the entire welkin with\r\nits rattle deep as the roar of mighty masses of clouds. Swords, and\r\nmissiles of terrible forms and maces of frightful description, and winged\r\ndarts of celestials splendour and lightnings of the brightest effulgence,\r\nand thunderbolts, and propellors furnished with wheels and worked with\r\natmosphere expansion and producing sounds loud as the roar of great\r\nmasses of clouds, were on that car. And there were also on that car\r\nfierce and huge-bodied Nagas with fiery mouths, and heaps of stones white\r\nas the fleecy clouds. And the car was drawn by ten thousands of horses of\r\ngolden hue, endued with the speed of the wind. And furnished with prowess\r\nof illusion, the car was drawn with such speed that the eye could hardly\r\nmark its progress. And Arjuna saw on that car the flag-staff called\r\nVaijayanta, of blazing effulgence, resembling in hue the emerald or the\r\ndark-blue lotus, and decked with golden ornaments and straight as the\r\nbamboo. And beholding a charioteer decked in gold seated on that car, the\r\nmighty-armed son of Pritha regarded it as belonging to the celestials.\r\nAnd while Arjuna was occupied with his thoughts regarding the car, the\r\ncharioteer Matali, bending himself after descending from the car,\r\naddressed him, saying, 'O lucky son of Sakra! Sakra himself wisheth to\r\nsee thee. Ascend thou without loss of time this car that hath been sent\r\nby Indra. The chief of the immortals, thy father--that god of a hundred\r\nsacrifices--hath commanded me, saying, 'Bring the son of Kunti hither.\r\nLet the gods behold him.' And Sankara himself, surrounded by the\r\ncelestials and Rishis and Gandharvas and Apsaras, waiteth to behold thee.\r\nAt the command of the chastiser of Paka, therefore, ascend thou with me\r\nfrom this to the region of the celestials. Thou wilt return after\r\nobtaining weapons.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna replied, 'O Matali, mount thou without loss of time this\r\nexcellent car, a car that cannot be attained even by hundreds of Rajasuya\r\nand horse sacrifices. Even kings of great prosperity who have performed\r\ngreat sacrifices distinguished by large gifts (to Brahmanas), even gods\r\nand Danavas are not competent to ride this car. He that hath not ascetic\r\nmerit is not competent to even see or touch this car, far less to ride on\r\nit. O blessed one, after thou hast ascended, it, and after the horses\r\nhave become still, I will ascend it, like a virtuous man stepping into\r\nthe high-road of honesty.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Matali, the charioteer of Sakra, hearing these\r\nwords of Arjuna, soon mounted the car and controlled the horses. Arjuna\r\nthen, with a cheerful heart, purified himself by a bath in the Ganges.\r\nAnd the son of Kunti then duly repeated (inaudibly) his customary\r\nprayers. He then, duly and according to the ordinance, gratified the\r\nPitris with oblations of water. And, lastly, he commenced to invoke the\r\nMandara--that king of mountains--saying, 'O mountain, thou art ever the\r\nrefuge of holy, heaven-seeking Munis of virtuous conduct and behaviour.\r\nIt is through thy grace, O mountain, that Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and\r\nVaisyas attain heaven, and their anxieties gone, sport with the\r\ncelestials. O king of mountains, O mountain, thou art the asylum of\r\nMunis, and thou holdest on thy breast numerous sacred shrines. Happily\r\nhave I dwelt on thy heights. I leave thee now, bidding thee farewell. Oft\r\nhave I seen thy tablelands and bowers, thy springs and brooks, and the\r\nsacred shrines on thy breast. I have also eaten the savoury fruits\r\ngrowing on thee, and have slated my thirst with draughts of perfumed\r\nwater oozing from the body. I have also drunk the water of thy springs,\r\nsweet as amrita itself. O mountain, as a child sleepeth happily on the\r\nlap of his father, so have I, O king of mountains, O excellent one,\r\nsported on thy breast, echoing with the notes of Apsaras and the chanting\r\nof the Vedas. O mountain, every day have I lived happily on thy\r\ntablelands.' Thus having bidden farewell to the mountain, that slayer of\r\nhostile heroes--Arjuna--blazing like the Sun himself, ascended the\r\ncelestial car. And the Kuru prince gifted with great intelligence, with a\r\nglad heart, coursed through the firmament on that celestial car effulgent\r\nas the sun and of extra-ordinary achievements. And after he had become\r\ninvisible to the mortals of the earth, he beheld thousands of cars of\r\nextra-ordinary beauty. And in that region there was no sun or moon or\r\nfire to give light, but it blazed in light of its own, generated by\r\nvirtue of ascetic merit. And those brilliant regions that are seen from\r\nthe earth in the form of stars, like lamps (in the sky)--so small in\r\nconsequence of their distance, though very large--were beheld by the son\r\nof Pandu, stationed in their respective places, full of beauty and\r\neffulgence and blazing with splendour all their own. And there he beheld\r\nroyal sages crowned with ascetic success, and heroes who had yielded up\r\ntheir lives in battle, and those that had acquired heaven by their\r\nascetic austerities, by hundreds upon hundreds. And there were also\r\nGandharvas, of bodies blazing like the sun, by thousands upon thousands,\r\nas also Guhyakas and Rishis and numerous tribes of Apsaras. And beholding\r\nthose self-effulgent regions, Phalguna became filled with wonder, and\r\nmade enquiries of Matali. And Matali also gladly replied unto him,\r\nsaying, 'These, O son of Pritha, are virtuous persons stationed in their\r\nrespective places. It is these whom thou hast seen, O exalted one, as\r\nstars, from the earth.' Then Arjuna saw standing at the gates (Indra's\r\nregion) the handsome and ever victorious elephant--Airavata--furnished\r\nwith four tusks, and resembling the mountain of Kailasa with its summits.\r\nAnd coursing along that path of the Siddhas, that foremost of the Kurus\r\nand the son of Pandu, sat in beauty like Mandhata--that best of kings.\r\nEndued with eyes like lotus leaves, he passed through the region set\r\napart for virtuous kings. And the celebrated Arjuna having thus passed\r\nthrough successive regions of heaven at last beheld Amaravati, the city\r\nof Indra.\""

And it was adorned with the\r\nflowers of every season, and with sacred trees of all kinds. And he\r\nbeheld also celestial gardens called Nandana--the favourite resort of\r\nApsaras. And fanned by the fragrant breezes charged with the farina of\r\nsweet-scented flowers, the trees with their lord of celestial blossoms\r\nseemed to welcome him amongst them. And the region was such that none\r\ncould behold it who had not gone through ascetic austerities, or who had\r\nnot poured libations on fire. It was a region for the virtuous alone, and\r\nnot for those who had turned their back on the field of battle. And none\r\nwere competent to see it who had not performed sacrifices or observed\r\nrigid vows, or who were without a knowledge of the Vedas, or who had not\r\nbathed in sacred waters, or who were not distinguished for sacrifices and\r\ngifts. And none were competent to see it who were disturbers of\r\nsacrifices, or who were low, or who drank intoxicating liquors, or who\r\nwere violators of their preceptors' bed, or who were eaters of\r\n(unsanctified) meat, or who were wicked. And having beheld those\r\ncelestial gardens resounding with celestial music, the strong-armed son\r\nof Pandu entered the favourite city of Indra. And he beheld there\r\ncelestial cars by thousands, capable of going everywhere at will,\r\nstationed in proper places. And he saw tens of thousands of such cars\r\nmoving in every direction. And fanned by pleasant breezes charged with\r\nthe perfumes of flowers, the son of Pandu was praised by Apsaras and\r\nGandharvas. And the celestials then, accompanied by the Gandharvas and\r\nSiddhas and great Rishis, cheerfully reverenced Pritha's son of white\r\ndeeds. Benedictions were poured upon him, accompanied by the sounds of\r\ncelestial music. The strong-armed son of Pritha then heard around him the\r\nmusic of conchs and drums. And praised all around, the son of Pritha then\r\nwent, at the command of Indra, to that large and extensive starry way\r\ncalled by the name of Suravithi. There he met with the Sadhyas, the\r\nViswas, the Marutas, the twin Aswins, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras,\r\nthe Brahmarshis of the great splendour, and numerous royal sages with\r\nDilipa at their head, and Tumvura and Narada, and that couple of\r\nGandharvas known by the names of Haha and Huhu. And the Kuru prince--that\r\nchastiser of foes--having met and duly saluted them, last of all beheld\r\nthe chief of the celestials--the god of a hundred sacrifices. Then the\r\nstrong-armed son of Pritha, alighting from the car approached the lord\r\nhimself of the gods--his father--that chastiser of Paka. And a beautiful\r\nwhite umbrella furnished with a golden staff was held over the chief of\r\nthe celestials. And he was fanned with a Chamara perfumed with celestial\r\nscents. And he was eulogised by many Gandharvas headed by Viswavasu and\r\nothers, by bards and singers, and by foremost Brahmanas chanting Rik and\r\nYajus hymns. And the mighty son of Kunti, approaching Indra, saluted him\r\nby bending his head to the ground. And Indra thereupon embraced him with\r\nhis round and plump arms. And taking his hand, Sakra made him sit by him\r\non a portion of his own seat, that sacred seat which was worshipped by\r\ngods and Rishis. And the lord of the celestials-that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes--smelt the head of Arjuna bending in humility, and even took him\r\nupon his lap. Seated on Sakra's seat at the command of that god of a\r\nthousand eyes, Pritha's son of immeasurable energy began to blaze in\r\nsplendour like a second Indra. And moved by affection, the slayer of\r\nVritra, consoling Arjuna, touched his beautiful face with his own\r\nperfumed hands. And the wielder of the thunderbolt, patting and rubbing\r\ngently again and again with his own hands which bore the marks of the\r\nthunderbolt the handsome and huge arms of Arjuna which resembled a couple\r\nof golden columns and which were hard in consequence of drawing the\r\nbowstring and son enhanced the beauty of the assembly, like the sun and\r\nmoon god of a thousand eyes--eyeing his son of curly locks smilingly and\r\nwith eyes expanded with delight, seemed scarcely to be gratified. The\r\nmore he gazed, the more he liked to gaze on. And seated on one seat, the\r\nfather and son enhanced the beauty of the assembly, like the sun and moon\r\nbeautifying the firmament together on the fourteenth day of the dark\r\nfortnight. And a band of Gandharvas headed by Tumvuru skilled in music\r\nsacred and profane, sang many verses in melodious notes. And Ghritachi\r\nand Menaka and Rambha and Purvachitti and Swayamprabha and Urvasi and\r\nMisrakesi and Dandagauri and Varuthini and Gopali and Sahajanya and\r\nKumbhayoni and Prajagara and Chitrasena and Chitralekha and Saha and\r\nMadhuraswana, these and others by thousands, possessed of eyes like lotus\r\nleaves, who were employed in enticing the hearts of persons practising\r\nrigid austerities, danced there. And possessing slim waists and fair\r\nlarge hips, they began to perform various evolutions, shaking their deep\r\nbosoms, and casting their glances around, and exhibiting other attractive\r\nattitude capable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the\r\nspectators.\""

And having performed her ablutions, she decked\r\nherself in charming ornaments and splendid garlands of celestial odour.\r\nAnd inflamed by the god of love, and her heart pierced through and\r\nthrough by the shafts shot by Manmatha keeping in view the beauty of\r\nArjuna, and her imagination wholly taken up by the thoughts of Arjuna,\r\nshe mentally sported with him on a wide and excellent bed laid over with\r\ncelestial sheets. And when the twilight had deepened and the moon was up,\r\nthat Apsara of high hips sent out for the mansions of Arjuna. And in that\r\nmood and with her crisp, soft and long braids decked with bunches of\r\nflowers, she looked extremely beautiful. With her beauty and grace, and\r\nthe charm of the motions of her eye-brows and of her soft accents, and\r\nher own moon like face, she seemed to tread, challenging the moon\r\nhimself. And as she proceeded, her deep, finely tapering bosoms, decked\r\nwith a chain of gold and adorned with celestial unguents and smeared with\r\nfragrant sandal paste, began to tremble. And in consequence of the weight\r\nof her bosoms, she was forced to slightly stoop forward at every step,\r\nbending her waist exceedingly beautiful with three folds. And her loins\r\nof faultless shape, the elegant abode of the god of love, furnished with\r\nfair and high and round hips and wide at their lower part as a hill, and\r\ndecked with chains of gold, and capable of shaking the saintship of\r\nanchorites, being decked with thin attire, appeared highly graceful. And\r\nher feet with fair suppressed ankles, and possessing flat soles and\r\nstraight toes of the colour of burnished copper and dorsum high and\r\ncurved like tortoise back and marked by the wearing of ornaments\r\nfurnished with rows of little bells, looked exceedingly handsome.

And the upper half of her body clad\r\nin an attire of fine texture and cloudy hues, she looked resplendent like\r\na digit of the moon in the firmament shrouded by fleecy clouds. And\r\nendued with the speed of the winds or the mind, she of luminous smiles\r\nsoon reached the mansion of Phalguna, the son of Pandu. And, O best of\r\nmen, Urvasi of beautiful eyes, having arrived at the gate of Arjuna's\r\nabode, sent word through the keeper in attendance.

But, O\r\nmonarch, upon beholding her at night in his mansion, Arjuna, with a\r\nfearstricken heart, stepped up to receive her with respect and as soon as\r\nhe saw her, the son of Pritha, from modesty, closed his eyes. And\r\nsaluting her, he offered the Apsara such worship as is offered unto a\r\nsuperior. And Arjuna said, 'O thou foremost of the Apsaras, I reverence\r\nthee by bending my head down. O lady, let me know thy commands. I wait\r\nupon thee as thy servant.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Phalguna, Urvasi became\r\ndeprived of her senses.

And she said, 'O best\r\nof men, I shall tell thee all that hath passed between me and Chitrasena,\r\nand why I have come hither. On account of thy coming here, O Arjuna,\r\nMahendra had convened a large and charming assembly, in which celestial\r\nfestivities were held.

And there came also numbers\r\nof great Rishis and royal sages and Siddhas and Charanas and Yakshas and\r\ngreat Nagas. And, O thou of expansive eyes, the members of the assembly\r\nresplendent as fire or the sun or the moon, having taken their seats\r\naccording to rank, honour, and prowess, O son of Sakra, the Gandharvas\r\nbegan to strike the Vinas and sing charming songs of celestial melody.\r\nAnd, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, the principal Apsaras also commenced\r\nto dance. Then, O son of Pritha, thou hadst looked on me only with a\r\nsteadfast gaze. When that assembly of the celestials broke, commanded by\r\nthy father, the gods went away to their respective places. And the\r\nprincipal Apsaras also went away to their abodes, and others also, O\r\nslayer of foes, commanded by thy father and obtaining his leave. It was\r\nthen that Chitrasena sent to me by Sakra, and arriving at my abode. O\r\nthou of eyes like lotus leaves, he addressed me, saying, 'O thou of the\r\nfairest complexion, I have been sent unto thee by the chief of the\r\ncelestials. Do thou something that would be agreeable to Mahendra and\r\nmyself and to thyself also. O thou of fair hips, seek thou to please\r\nArjuna, who is brave in battle even like Sakra himself, and who is always\r\npossessed of magnanimity.' Even these, O son of Pritha, were his words.\r\nThus, O sinless one, commanded by him and thy father also, I come to thee\r\nin order to wait upon thee, O slayer of foes. My heart hath been\r\nattracted by thy virtues, and am already under the influence of the god\r\nof love. And, O hero, even this is my wish, and I have cherished it for\r\never!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"While in heaven, hearing her speak in this\r\nstrain, Arjuna was overcome with bashfulness.

For, O thou of beautiful face, thou art\r\ncertainly equal in my estimation unto the wife of a superior.

That I had gazed particularly at thee, O blessed one, is true.\r\nThere was a reason for it. I shall truly tell it to thee, O thou of\r\nluminous smiles! In the assembly I gazed at thee with eyes expanded in\r\ndelight, thinking, 'Even this blooming lady is the mother of the Kaurava\r\nrace.' O blessed Apsara, it behoveth thee not to entertain other feelings\r\ntowards me, for thou art superior to my superiors, being the parent of my\r\nrace.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Arjuna, Urvasi answered, saying, 'O son of The\r\nchief of the celestials, we Apsaras are free and unconfined in our\r\nchoice. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to esteem me as thy superior.\r\nThe sons and grandsons of Puru's race, that have come hither in\r\nconsequence of ascetic merit do all sport with us, without incurring any\r\nsin. Relent, therefore, O hero, it behoveth thee not to send me away. I\r\nam burning with desire. I am devoted to thee.

O sinless one, as Kunti, or Madri,\r\nor Sachi, is to me, so art thou, the parent of my race, an object of\r\nreverence to me. Return, O thou of the fairest complexion: I bend my head\r\nunto thee, and prostrate myself at thy feet.

And having found him, he told him all\r\nthat had passed between him and Urvasi in the night. And he told\r\nChitrasena everything as it had happened, repeatedly referring to the\r\ncurse pronounced upon him. And Chitrasena also represented everything\r\nunto Sakra. And Harivahana, calling his son unto himself in private, and\r\nconsoling him in sweet words, smilingly said, 'O thou best of beings,\r\nhaving obtained thee, O child, Pritha hath to-day become a truly blessed\r\nmother. O mighty-armed one, thou hast now vanquished even Rishis by the\r\npatience and self-control. But, O giver of proper respect, the curse that\r\nUrvasi hath denounced on thee will be to thy benefit,\r\n\r\nO child, and stand thee in good stead. O sinless one, ye will have on\r\nearth to pass the thirteenth year (of your exile), unknown to all. It is\r\nthen that thou shalt suffer the curse of Urvasi. And having passed one\r\nyear as a dancer without manhood, thou shalt regain thy power on the\r\nexpiration of the term.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed by Sakra, that slayer of hostile heroes, Phalguna,\r\nexperienced great delight and ceased to think of the curse. And\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Pandu, sported in regions of heaven with the\r\nGandharva Chitrasena of great celebrity.\"\r\n\r\n\"The desires of the man that listeneth to this history of the son of\r\nPandu never run after lustful ends. The foremost of men, by listening to\r\nthis account of the awfully pure conduct of Phalguna, the son of the lord\r\nof the celestials, become void of pride and arrogance and wrath and other\r\nfaults, and ascending to heaven, sport there in bliss.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said, \"One day, the great Rishi Lomasa in course of his\r\nwanderings, went to the abode of Indra, desirous of beholding the lord of\r\nthe celestials. And the great Muni, having approached the chief of the\r\ngods, bowed to him respectfully. And he beheld the son of Pandu occupying\r\nhalf of the seat of Vasava. And worshipped by the great Rishis, that\r\nforemost of Brahmanas sat on an excellent seat at the desire of Sakra.\r\nAnd beholding Arjuna seated on Indra's seat, the Rishi began to think as\r\nto how Arjuna who was a Kshatriya had attained to the seat of Sakra\r\nhimself. What acts of merit had been performed by him and what regions,\r\nhad been conquered by him (by ascetic merit), that he had obtained a seat\r\nthat was worshipped by the gods themselves? And as the Rishi was employed\r\nwith these thoughts, Sakra, the slayer of Vritra, came to know of them.\r\nAnd having known them, the lord of Sachi addressed Lomasa with a smile\r\nand said, 'Listen, O Brahmarshi, about what is now passing in thy mind.\r\nThis one is no mortal though he hath taken his birth among men. O great\r\nRishi, the mighty-armed hero is even my son born of Kunti. He hath come\r\nhither, in order to acquire weapons for some purpose. Alas! dost thou not\r\nrecognise him as an ancient Rishi of the highest merit? Listen to me, O\r\nBrahamana, as I tell thee who is and why he hath come to me. Those\r\nancient and excellent Rishis who were known by the names of Nara and\r\nNarayana are, know, O Brahmana, none else than Hrishikesa and Dhananjaya.\r\nAnd those Rishis, celebrated throughout the three worlds, and known by\r\nthe names of Nara and Narayana have, for the accomplishment of a certain\r\npurpose, been born on earth--for the acquisition of virtue. That sacred\r\nasylum which even gods and illustrious Rishis are not competent to\r\nbehold, and which is known throughout the world by the name of Vadari,\r\nand situate by the source of the Ganga, which is worshipped by the\r\nSiddhas and the Charanas, was the abode, O Brahmana, of Vishnu and\r\nJishnu. Those Rishis of blazing splendour have, O Brahmarshi, at my\r\ndesire, been born on earth, and endued with mighty energy, will lighten\r\nthe burden thereof. Besides this, there are certain Asuras known as\r\nNivatakavachas, who, proud of the boon they have acquired, are employed\r\nin doing us injuries. Boastful of their strength, they are even now\r\nplanning the destruction of the gods, for, having received a boon, they\r\nno longer regard the gods. Those fierce and mighty Danavas live in the\r\nnether regions. Even all the celestials together are incapable of\r\nfighting with them. The blessed Vishnu--the slayer of Madhu--he, indeed\r\nwho is known on earth as Kapila, and whose glance alone, O exalted one,\r\ndestroyed the illustrious sons of Sagara, when they approached him with\r\nloud sounds in the bowels of the earth,--that illustrious and invincible\r\nHari is capable, O Brahmana of doing us a great service. Either he or\r\nPartha or both may do us that great service, without doubt. Verily as the\r\nillustrious Hari had slain the Nagas in the great lake, he, by sight\r\nalone, is capable of slaying those Asuras called the Nivatakavachas,\r\nalong with their followers. But the slayer of Madhu should not be urged\r\nwhen the task is insignificant. A mighty mass of energy that he is. It\r\nswelleth to increasing proportions, it may consume the whole universe.\r\nThis Arjuna also is competent to encounter them all, and the hero having\r\nslain them in battle, will go back to the world of men. Go thou at my\r\nrequest to earth. Thou wilt behold the brave Yudhishthira living in the\r\nwoods of Kamyaka. And for me tell thou the virtuous Yudhishthira of\r\nunbaffled prowess in battle, that he should not be anxious on account of\r\nPhalguna, for that hero will return to earth a thorough master of\r\nweapons, for without sanctified prowess of arms, and without skill in\r\nweapons, he would not be able to encounter Bhishma and Drona and others\r\nin battle. Thou wilt also represent unto Yudhishthira that the\r\nillustrious and mighty-armed Gudakesa, having obtained weapons, hath also\r\nmastered the science of celestial dancing and music both instrumental and\r\nvocal. And thou wilt also tell him, O king of men, O slayer of foes,\r\nthyself also, accompanied by all thy brothers, should see the various\r\nsacred shrines. For having bathed in different sacred waters, thou wilt\r\nbe cleansed from thy sins, and the fever of thy heart will abate. And\r\nthen thou wilt be able to enjoy thy kingdom, happy in the thought that\r\nthy sins have been washed off. And, O foremost of Brahmanas, endued with\r\nascetic power, it behoveth thee also to protect Yudhishthira during his\r\nwandering over the earth. Fierce Rakshasas ever live in mountain\r\nfastnesses and rugged steppes. Protect thou the king from those\r\ncannibals.'\r\n\r\n\"After Mahendra had spoken thus unto Lomasa, Vibhatsu also reverently\r\naddressed that Rishi, saying, 'Protect thou ever the son of Pandu. O best\r\nof men, let the king, O great Rishi, protected by thee, visit the various\r\nplaces of pilgrimage and give away unto Brahmanas in charity.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"The mighty ascetic Lomasa, having answered both\r\nsaying, 'So be it,' set out for the earth, desirous of arriving at\r\nKamvaka. And having arrived at those woods, he beheld the slayer of foes\r\nand son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira the just, surrounded by ascetics and\r\nhis younger brothers.\""

O charioteer, my wretched and sinful son is even\r\nnow engaged in a policy of the most vulgar kind. Of wicked soul, he will\r\ncertainly depopulate the earth. The illustrious person whose words even\r\nin jest are true, and who hath Dhananjaya to fight for him, is sure to\r\nwin the three worlds. Who that is even beyond the influence of Death and\r\nDecay will be able to stay before Arjuna, when he will scatter his barbed\r\nand sharp-pointed arrows whetted on stone? My wretched sons, who have to\r\nfight with the invincible Pandavas are indeed, all doomed. Reflecting day\r\nand night, I see not the warrior amongst us that is able to stay in\r\nbattle before the wielder of the Gandiva. If Drona, or Karna, or even\r\nBhishma advance against him in battle, a great calamity is likely to\r\nbefall the earth. But even in that case, I see not the way to our success\r\nKarna is kind and forgetful. The preceptor Drona is old, and the teacher\r\n(of Arjuna) Arjuna, however, is wrathful, and strong, and proud, and of\r\nfirm and steady prowess. As all these warriors are invincible, a terrible\r\nfight will take place between them. All of them are heroes skilled in\r\nweapons and of great reputation. They would not wish for the sovereignty\r\nof the world, if it was to be purchased by defeat. Indeed, peace will be\r\nrestored only on the death of these or of Phalguna. The slayer of Arjuna,\r\nhowever, existeth not, nor doth one that can vanquish him. Oh, how shall\r\nthat wrath of his which hath myself for its object be pacified. Equal\r\nunto the chief of the celestials, that hero gratified Agni at Khandava\r\nand vanquished all the monarchs of the earth on the occasion of the great\r\nRajasuya. O Sanjaya, the thunder-bolt falling on the mountain top,\r\nleaveth a portion unconsumed; but the shafts, O child, that are shot by\r\nKiriti leave not a rack behind. As the rays of the sun heat this mobile\r\nand immobile universe, so will the shafts shot by Arjuna's hands scorch\r\nmy sons. It seemeth to me that the Chamus of the Bharatas, terrified at\r\nthe clatter of Arjuna's chariot-wheels, are already broken through in all\r\ndirections. Vidhatri hath created Arjuna as an all-consuming Destroyer.\r\nHe stayeth in battle as a foe, vomitting and scattering swarms of arrows.\r\nWho is there that will defeat him?\""

I have heard, O\r\nking, how Arjuna hath gratified in battle by means of his bow the god of\r\ngods--Sthanu of eleven forms. The illustrious lord of all the\r\ngods--Kapardin himself--desirous of testing Phalguna, fought with him,\r\nhaving assumed the guise of a Kirata. And there it was that the Lokapala,\r\nin order to give away their weapons unto that bull of the Kuru race,\r\nshowed themselves unto him of undeteriorating prowess. What other man on\r\nearth, except Phalguna, would strive to have a sight of these gods in\r\ntheir own forms? And, O king, who is there that will weaken in battle\r\nArjuna, who could not be weakened by Maheswara himself possessed of eight\r\nforms? Thy sons, having dragged Draupadi, and thereby incensed the sons\r\nof Pandu, have brought this frightful and horrifying calamity upon\r\nthemselves. Beholding Duryodhana showing both his thighs unto Draupadi,\r\nBhima said with quivering lips, 'wretch! those thighs of thine will I\r\nsmash with my fierce descending mace, on the expiration of thirteen\r\nyears.' All the sons of Pandu are the foremost of smiters; all of them\r\nare of immeasurable energy; all of them are well-versed in every kind of\r\nweapons. For these, they are incapable of being vanquished even by the\r\ngods. Incensed at the insult offered to their wedded wife, Pritha's sons,\r\nurged by wrath, will, I ween, slay all thy sons in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O charioteer, what mischief hath been done by Karna\r\nuttering those cruel words, to the sons of Pandu! Was not the enmity\r\nsufficient that was provoked by bringing Krishna into the assembly? How\r\ncan my wicked sons live, whose eldest brother and preceptor walketh not\r\nin the path of righteousness? Seeing me void of eye-sight, and incapable\r\nof exerting myself actively, my wretched son, O charioteer, believeth me\r\nto be a fool, and listeneth not to my words. Those wretches also that are\r\nhis counsellors, viz., Karna and Suvala, and others, always pander to his\r\nvices, as he is incapable of understanding things rightly. The shafts\r\nthat Arjuna of immeasurable prowess may lightly shoot, are capable of\r\nconsuming all my sons, leave alone those shafts that he will shoot,\r\nimpelled by anger. The arrows urged by the might of Arjuna's arms and\r\nshot from his large bow, and inspired with mantras capable of converting\r\nthem into celestial weapons can chastise the celestials themselves. He\r\nwho hath for his counsellor and protector and friend that smiter of\r\nsinful men--the lord of the three worlds--Hari himself--encountereth\r\nnothing that he cannot conquer. This, O Sanjaya, is most marvellous in\r\nArjuna that, as we have heard, he hath been clasped by Mahadeva in his\r\narms.

It is then, O Sanjaya, that obedient as I have been to the voice of\r\nDuryodhana, I shall have to call back the rejected counsels of my\r\nfriends--counsels that I should have attended to in time.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"This hath been thy great fault, O king, viz., that though\r\ncapable, thou didst not, from affection prevent thy son from doing what\r\nhe hath done. The slayer of Madhu, that hero of unfading glory, hearing\r\nthat the Pandavas had been defeated at dice, soon went to the woods of\r\nKamyaka and consoled them there. And Draupadi's sons also headed by\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and Virata, and Dhrishtaketu, and those mighty warriors,\r\nthe Kekayas, all went there. All that was said by these warriors at the\r\nsight of Pandu's son defeated at dice, was learnt by me through our\r\nspies. I have also told thee all, O king. When the slayer of Madhu met\r\nthe Pandavas, they requested him to become the charioteer of Phalguna in\r\nbattle.

Even these, O\r\nking, were Krishna's words unto Yudhishthira, who, on the conclusion of\r\nKrishna's speech, addressed him in that meeting of heroes and in the\r\nhearing of all those brave warriors headed by Dhrishtadyumna, saying, 'O\r\nJanardana, I accept these words of thine as truth. O thou of mighty arms,\r\ndo thou, however, slay my enemies along with all their followers on the\r\nexpiry of thirteen years. O Kesava, promise this truly unto me. I\r\npromised in the presence of the king to live in the forest as I am now\r\nliving.' Consenting to these words of king Yudhishthira the just, his\r\ncounsellors headed by Dhrishtadyumna soon pacified the incensed Kesava\r\nwith sweet words and expressions suitable to the occasion.

We promise it, O thou of the fairest complexion.\r\nTherefore, grieve no more. O Krishna, those that mocked thee, beholding\r\nthee won at dice, shall reap the fruit of their act. Beasts of prey and\r\nbirds shall eat their flesh, and mock them thus. Jackals and vultures\r\nwill drink their blood. And, O Krishna, thou shalt behold the bodies of\r\nthose wretches that dragged thee by the hair prostrate on the earth,\r\ndragged and eaten by carnivorous animals. They also that gave thee pain\r\nand disregarded thee shall lie on the earth destitute of their heads, and\r\nthe earth herself shall drink their blood.' These and other speeches of\r\nvarious kinds were uttered there, O king, by those bulls of the Bharata\r\nrace. All of them are endued with energy and bravery, and marked with the\r\nmarks of battle. On the expiration of the thirteenth year, those mighty\r\nwarriors, chosen by Yudhishthira and headed by Vasudeva, will come (to\r\nthe field of battle).

Who is there that, desiring to live,\r\nwill encounter these in battle, resembling angry lions of erect manes?'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, \"What Vidura told me at the time of the game at\r\ndice, 'If thou seekest, O king, to vanquish the Pandavas (at dice), then\r\ncertainly a terrible blood-shed ending in the destruction of all the\r\nKurus will be the result,' I think it is about to be realised.

Endued with manliness, we are yet overwhelmed with calamities,\r\nin consequence of thy gambling vice, while the foolish null of\r\nDhritarashtra are growing stronger with the tributes (gathered from\r\ndependent kings). O mighty monarch, it behoveth thee to keep in view the\r\nduties of the Kshatriya. O great king, it is not the duty of a Khsatriya\r\nto live in the woods. The wise are of the opinion that to rule is the\r\nforemost duty of a Kshatriya. O king, thou art conversant with Kshatriya\r\nmorality. Do not, therefore, deviate from the path of duty. Turning away\r\nfrom the woods, let us, summoning Partha and Janardana, slay, O king, the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra, even before the twelve years are complete. O\r\nillustrious monarch O king of kings, even if these Dhartarashtras be\r\nsurrounded by soldiers in array of battle, I shall send them to the other\r\nworld by dint of might alone. I shall slay all the sons of Dhritarashtra\r\nalong with the Sauvalas, indeed, Duryodhana, Karna, and any one else that\r\nwill fight with me. And after I shall have slain all our foes, thou mayst\r\ncome back unto the woods. By acting thus, O king, no fault will be thine.\r\n(Or if any sin be thine), O represser of foes, O mighty monarch, washing\r\nit off, O sire, by various sacrifices, we may ascend to a superior\r\nheaven. Such a consummation may come to pass, if our king proveth not\r\nunwise or procrastinating. Thou art, however, virtuous. Verily the\r\ndeceitful should be destroyed by deceit. To slay the deceitful by deceit,\r\nis not regarded as sinful. O Bharata, it is, also said by those versed in\r\nmorality that one day and night is, O great prince, equal unto a full\r\nyear. The Veda text also, exalted one, is often heard, signifying that a\r\nyear is equivalent to a day when passed in the observance of certain\r\ndifficult vows. O thou of unfading glory, if the Vedas are an authority\r\nwith thee, regard thou the period of a day and something more as the\r\nequivalent of thirteen years. O represser of foes, this is the time to\r\nslay Duryodhana with his adherents. Else, O king, he will beforehand\r\nbring the whole earth obedient to his will. O foremost of monarchs, all\r\nthis is the result of thy addiction to gambling. We are on the verge of\r\ndestruction already, in consequence of thy promise of living one year\r\nundiscovered. I do not find the country where, if we live, the\r\nwicked-minded Suyodhana may not be able to trace us by his spies. And\r\nfinding us out, that wretch will again deceitfully send us into such\r\nexile in the woods. Or if that sinful one beholdeth us emerge, after the\r\nexpiry of the pledged period of non-discovery, he will again invite thee,\r\nO great king, to dice, and the play will once more begin. Summoned once\r\nmore, thou wilt again efface thyself at dice. Thou art not skilled at\r\ndice, and when summoned at play, thou wilt be deprived of thy senses.\r\nTherefore, O mighty monarch thou wilt have to lead a life in the woods\r\nagain. If, O mighty king, it behoveth thee not to make us wretched for\r\nlife, observe thou fully the ordinance of the Vedas, (which inculcateth\r\nthat) verily the deceitful ought to be slain by deceit. If I but have thy\r\ncommand I would go (to Hastinapura) and, even as fire falling upon a heap\r\nof grass consumeth it, would slay Duryodhana, putting forth my utmost\r\nmight. It behoveth thee, therefore, to grant me the permission.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Bhima, king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, smelt the crown of that son of Pandu, and pacifying him said, 'O\r\nmighty-armed one, without doubt, thou wilt, assisted by the wielder of\r\nthe Gandiva, slay Suyodhana at the expiry of the thirteenth year. But, O\r\nson of Pritha, as for thy assertion, 'O Lord, the time is complete', I\r\ncannot dare tell an untruth, for untruth is not in me. O son of Kunti,\r\nwithout the help of fraud, wilt thou kill the wicked and irrepressible\r\nDuryodhana, with his allies.'\r\n\r\n\"While Yudhishthira the just, was speaking unto Bhima thus, there came\r\nthe great and illustrious Rishi Vrihadaswa before them. And beholding\r\nthat virtuous ascetic before him, the righteous king worshipped him\r\naccording to the ordinance, with the offering of Madhuparka. And when the\r\nascetic was seated and refreshed, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira sat by\r\nhim, and looking up at the former, addressed him thus in exceedingly\r\npiteous accents:\r\n\r\n'O holy one, summoned by cunning gamblers skilled at dice, I have been\r\ndeprived of wealth and kingdom through gambling. I am not an adept at\r\ndice, and am unacquainted with deceit. Sinful men, by unfair means,\r\nvanquished me at play. They even brought into the public assembly my wife\r\ndearer unto me than life itself. And defeating me a second time, they\r\nhave sent me to distressful exile in this great forest, clad in deer\r\nskins. At present I am leading a distressful life in the woods in grief\r\nof heart. Those harsh and cruel speeches they addressed me on the\r\noccasion of that gambling match, and the words of my afflicted friends\r\nrelating to the match at dice and other subjects, are all stored up in my\r\nremembrance. Recollecting them I pass the whole night in (sleepless)\r\nanxiety. Deprived also (of the company) of the illustrious wielder of the\r\nGandiva, on whom depend the lives of us all, I am almost deprived of\r\nlife. Oh, when shall I see the sweet-speeched and large-hearted Vibhatsu\r\nso full of kindness and activity, return to us, having obtained all\r\nweapons? Is there a king on this earth who is more unfortunate than\r\nmyself? Hast thou ever seen or heard of any such before? To my thinking,\r\nthere is no man more wretched than I am.'\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa said, 'O great king, O son of Pandu, thou sayest, 'There is\r\nno person more miserable than I am' O sinless monarch, if thou wilt\r\nlisten, I will relate unto thee the history of a king more wretched than\r\nthyself?\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"And thereupon the king said unto the ascetic, 'O\r\nillustrious one, tell me, I desire to hear the history of the king who\r\nhad fallen into such a condition.'\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa said, 'O king, O thou that never fallest off, listen\r\nattentively with thy brothers, I will narrate the history of a prince\r\nmore miserable than thyself. There was a celebrated king among the\r\nNishadhas, named Virasena. He had a son named Nala, versed in (the\r\nknowledge of) virtue and wealth. It hath been heard by us that, that king\r\nwas deceitfully defeated by Pushkara, and afflicted with calamity, he\r\ndwelt in the woods with his spouse. And, O king, while he was living in\r\nthe forest, he had neither slaves nor cars, neither brother nor friends\r\nwith him. But thou art surrounded by thy heroic brothers like unto the\r\ncelestials, and also by foremost regenerate ones like unto Brahma\r\nhimself. Therefore, it behoveth thee not to grieve.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'I am anxious to hear in detail, O thou foremost of\r\neloquent men, the history of the illustrious Nala. It behoveth thee\r\ntherefore to relate it unto me.'"

And\r\nhe was strong, and handsome, and well-versed in (the knowledge of)\r\nhorses, and possessed of every desirable accomplishment. And he was at\r\nthe head of all the kings, even like the lord of the celestials. And\r\nexalted over all, he resembled the sun in glory. And he was the king of\r\nthe Nishadhas, intent on the welfare of the Brahmanas, versed in the\r\nVedas, and possessed of heroism. And he was truth-telling, fond of dice,\r\nand the master of a mighty army. And he was the beloved of men and women,\r\nand of great soul and subdued passions. And he was the protector (of\r\nall), and the foremost of bowmen, and like unto Manu himself. And like\r\nhim, there was among the Vidarbhas (a king named) Bhima, of terrible\r\nprowess, heroic and well-disposed towards his subjects and possessed of\r\nevery virtue. (But withal) he was childless. And with a fixed mind, he\r\ntried his utmost for obtaining issue. And. O Bharata there came unto him\r\n(once) a Brahmarshi named Damana. And, O king of kings, desirous of\r\nhaving offspring, Bhima, versed in morality, with his queen gratified\r\nthat illustrious Rishi by a respectful reception. And Damana,\r\nwell-pleased, granted unto the king and his consort a boon in the form of\r\na jewel of a daughter, and three sons possessed of lofty souls and great\r\nfame. (And they were called respectively) Damayanti, and Dama and Danta,\r\nand illustrious Damana. And the three sons were possessed of every\r\naccomplishment and terrible mien and fierce prowess. And the\r\nslender-waisted Damayanti, in beauty and brightness, in good name and\r\ngrace and luck, became celebrated all over the world. And on her\r\nattaining to age, hundreds of hand-maids, and female slaves, decked in\r\nornaments, waited upon her like Sachi herself. And Bhima's daughter of\r\nfaultless features, decked in every ornament, shone in the midst of her\r\nhand-maids, like the luminous lightning of the clouds. And the large-eyed\r\ndamsel was possessed of great beauty like that of Sree herself. And\r\nneither among celestials, nor among Yakshas, nor among men was anybody\r\npossessed of such beauty, seen or heard of before. And the beautiful\r\nmaiden filled with gladness the hearts of even the gods. And that tiger\r\namong men, Nala also had not his peer in the (three) worlds: for in\r\nbeauty he was like Kandarpa himself in his embodied form. And moved by\r\nadmiration, the heralds again and again celebrated the praises of Nala\r\nbefore Damayanti and those of Damayanti before the ruler of the\r\nNishadhas. And repeatedly hearing of each other's virtues they conceived\r\nan attachment towards each other not begot of sight, and that attachment,\r\nO son of Kunti began to grow in strength. And then Nala was unable to\r\ncontrol the love that was in his bosom. And he began to pass much of his\r\ntime in solitude in the gardens adjoining the inner apartment (of his\r\npalace). And there he saw a number of swans furnished with golden wings,\r\nwandering in those woods. And from among them he caught one with his\r\nhands. And thereupon the sky-ranging one said unto Nala. 'Deserve I not\r\nto be slain by thee. O king. I will do something that is agreeable to\r\nthee. O king of the Nishadhas. I will speak of thee before Damayanti in\r\nsuch a way that she will not ever desire to have any other person (for\r\nher lord).' Thus addressed, the king liberated that swan. And those swans\r\nthen rose on their wings and went to the country of the Vidarbhas. And on\r\narriving at the city of the Vidarbhas the birds alighted before\r\nDamayanti, who beheld them all. And Damayanti in the midst of her maids,\r\nbeholding those birds of extraordinary appearance was filled with\r\ndelight, and strove without loss of time to catch those coursers of the\r\nskies. And the swans at this, before that bevy of beauties, fled in all\r\ndirections. And those maidens there pursued the birds, each (running)\r\nafter one. And the swan after which Damayanti ran, having led her to a\r\nsecluded spot, addressed her in human speech, saying, O Damayanti, there\r\nis a king amongst the Nishadhas named Nala. He is equal unto the Aswins\r\nin beauty, not having his peer among men. Indeed, in comeliness, he is\r\nlike Kandarpa himself in his embodied form. O fair-complexioned one, O\r\nthou of slender waist, if thou becomest his wife, thy existence and this\r\nthy beauty may be of purpose. We have, indeed, beheld celestials and\r\nGandharvas, and Nagas, and Rakshasas, and men, but never saw we before\r\nany one like Nala. Thou also art a jewel among thy sex, as Nala is the\r\nprime among men. The union of the best with the best is happy.' Thus\r\naddressed by the swan. Damayanti, O monarch, replied unto him there,\r\nsaying, 'Do thou speak thus unto Nala also, 'Saying So be it, to the\r\ndaughter of Vidarbha, the oviparous one, O king, returned to the country\r\nof the Nishadhas, and related everything unto Nala.\""

And heaving\r\nfrequent sighs she was filled with anxiety, and became melancholy and\r\npale-faced and lean. And with her heart possessed by the god of love, she\r\nsoon lost colour, and with her upturned gaze and modes of abstraction,\r\nlooked like one demented. And she lost all inclination for beds and seats\r\nand object of enjoyment. And she ceased to lie down by day or night,\r\nalways weeping with exclamation of Oh! and Alas! And beholding her uneasy\r\nand fallen into that condition, her hand-maids represented, O king, the\r\nmatter of her illness unto the ruler of Vidarbha by indirect hints. And\r\nking Bhima, hearing of this from the handmaids of Damayanti, regarded the\r\naffair of his daughter to be serious. And he asked himself, 'Why is it\r\nthat my daughter seemeth to be so ill now?' And the king, reflecting by\r\nhimself that his daughter had attained to puberty, concluded that\r\nDamayanti's Swayamvara should take place. And the monarch, O exalted one,\r\n(invited) all the rulers of the earth, saying, Ye heroes, know that\r\nDamayanti's Swayamvara is at hand, And all the kings, hearing of\r\nDamayanti's Swayamvara, came unto Bhima, agreeable to his message,\r\nfilling the earth with the clatter of their cars, the roar of their\r\nelephants, and the neighing of their horses, and accompanied with their\r\nfine-looking battalions decked in ornaments and graceful garlands. And\r\nthe mighty-armed Bhima paid due reverence unto those illustrious\r\nmonarchs. And duly honoured by him they took up their quarters there.'\r\n\r\n\"And at the juncture, those foremost of celestial Rishis possessed of\r\ngreat splendour, of great wisdom and great vows--namely, Narada and\r\nParvata--having arrived in course of their wandering at the regions of\r\nIndra entered the mansion of the lord of the immortals, receiving proper\r\nworship. And Maghavat having worshipped them reverentially, inquired\r\nafter their undisturbed peace and welfare as regards all respects. And\r\nNarada said, 'O lord, O divine one, peace attendeth us in every respect.\r\nAnd, O Maghavat, peace attendeth also O exalted one, the kings of the\r\nwhole world.'\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued. 'Hearing the words of Narada the slaver of Vala\r\nand Vritra said, 'Those righteous rulers of the earth who fight\r\nrenouncing all desire of life, and who meet death when their time is come\r\nby means of weapons, without flying from the field,--theirs is this\r\nregion, everlasting unto them and granting all desires, even as it is to\r\nme. Where be those Kshatriya heroes? I do not see those kings approach\r\n(now) Where are my favourite guests?' Thus addressed by Sakra, Narada\r\nreplied, 'Listen, O Mahavat, why seest not thou the kings (now)? The\r\nruler of the Vidarbhas hath a daughter--the celebrated Damayanti. In\r\nbeauty she transcendeth all the women of the earth. Her Swayamvara, O\r\nSakra, will take place shortly. Thither are going all the kings and\r\nPrinces from all directions. And all the lords of the earth desire to\r\nhave that pearl of the earth,--desire to have her eagerly, O slaver of\r\nVala and Vritra.' And while they were talking thus, those foremost of the\r\nimmortals, the Lokapalas with Agni among them, appeared before the lord\r\nof the celestials. And all of them heard the words of Narada fraught with\r\ngrave import. And as soon as they heard them, they exclaimed in rapture,\r\nWe also will go there. And, O mighty monarch, accompanied by their\r\nattendants and mounted on their (respective) vehicles, they set out for\r\nthe country of Vidarbhas, whither (had gone) all the kings. And, O son of\r\nKunti, the high-souled king Nala also hearing of that concourse of kings,\r\nset out with a cheerful heart, full of Damayanti's love. And (it came to\r\npass) that the gods saw Nala on the way treading on the earth. And his\r\nform owing to its beauty was like that of the god of love himself. And\r\nbeholding him resplendent as the sun, the Lokapalas were filled with\r\nastonishment at his wealth of beauty, and abandoned their intention. And,\r\nO king, leaving their cars in the sky the dwellers of heaven alighted\r\nfrom the welkin and spake unto the ruler of the Nishadhas, saying, 'O\r\nforemost of monarchs ruling the Nishadhas, O Nala, thou art devoted to\r\ntruth.

And who also is he that desireth me to be\r\nhis messenger? And what, further, shall I have to do for you? O tell me\r\ntruly!'--When the king of the Nishadhas spoke thus, Maghavat replied,\r\nsaying, 'Know us as the immortals come hither for Damayanti's sake. I am\r\nIndra, this one is Agni, this the lord of waters, and this, O king, is\r\neven Yama the destroyer of the bodies of men.

Thus addressed by Sakra, Nala said with joined hands, 'I have come\r\nhere with the self same object. It behoveth thee not to send me (on this\r\nerrand). How can a person who is himself under the influence of love\r\nbring himself to speak thus unto a lady on behalf of others?

How can\r\nI hope to enter them?' Indra replied, 'Thou shalt be able to enter.' And,\r\nsaying, So be it.' Nala thereupon went to the palace of Damayanti. And\r\nhaving arrived there, he beheld the daughter of the king of Vidarbha\r\nsurrounded by her hand-maids, blazing in beauty and excelling in symmetry\r\nof form, of limbs exceedingly delicate, of slender waist and fair eyes.\r\nAnd she seemed to rebuke the light of the moon by her own splendour. And\r\nas he gazed on that lady of sweet smiles. Nala's love increased, but\r\ndesirous of keeping his truth, he suppressed his passion. And at the\r\nsight of Naishadha, overpowered by his effulgence, those first of women\r\nsprang up from their seats in amazement. And filled with wonder (at his\r\nsight), they praised Nala in gladness of heart. And without saying\r\nanything, they mentally paid him homage, 'Oh, what comeliness! Oh, what\r\ngentleness belongeth to this high-souled one! Who is he? Is he some god\r\nor Yaksha or Gandharva?' And those foremost of women, confounded by\r\nNala's splendour and bashfulness would not accost him at all in speech.\r\nAnd Damayanti although herself struck with amazement, smilingly addressed\r\nthe warlike Nala who also gently smiled at her, saying, 'What art thou, O\r\nthou of faultless features, that hast come here awakening my love? O\r\nsinless one, O hero of celestial form, I am anxious to know who thou art\r\nthat hast come hither. And why hast thou come hither? And how is it that\r\nthou hast not been discovered by any one, considering that my apartments\r\nare well-guarded and the king's mandates are stern.' Thus addressed by\r\nthe daughter of the king of the Vidarbhas, Nala replied, 'O beauteous\r\nlady, know that my name is Nala. I come here as the messenger of the\r\ngods. The celestials, Sakra, Agni, Varuna and Yama, desire to have thee.\r\nO beautiful lady, do thou choose one of them for thy lord.

And the monarchs entered the\r\namphitheatre decorated with golden pillars and a lofty portal arch, like\r\nmighty lions entering the mountain wilds. And those lords of earth decked\r\nwith fragrant garlands and polished ear-rings hung with jewels seated\r\nthemselves on their several seats. And that sacred assembly of Kings,\r\ngraced by those tigers among men, resembled the Bhogavati swarming with\r\nthe Nagas, or a mountain cavern with tigers. And their arms were robust,\r\nand resembling iron maces, and well-shaped, and graceful, and looking\r\nlike five-headed snakes. And graced with beautiful locks and fine noses\r\nand eyes and brows, the countenance of the kings shone like stars in the\r\nfirmament. And (when the time came), Damayanti of beauteous face,\r\nstealing the eyes and hearts of the princes by her dazzling light,\r\nentered the hall. And the glances of those illustrious kings were\r\nrivetted to those parts of her person where they had chanced to fall\r\nfirst, without moving at all. And when, O Bharata, the names of the\r\nmonarchs were proclaimed, the daughter of Bhima saw five persons all\r\nalike in appearance. And beholding them seated there, without difference\r\nof any kind in form, doubt filled her mind, and she could not ascertain\r\nwhich of them was king Nala. And at whomsoever (among them) she looked,\r\nshe regarded him to be the king of the Nishadhas. And filled with\r\nanxiety, the beauteous one thought within herself, 'Oh, how shall I\r\ndistinguish the celestials, and how discern the royal Nala?' And thinking\r\nthus, the daughter of Vidarbha became filled with grief. And, O Bharata,\r\nrecollecting the marks belonging to the celestials, of which she had\r\nheard, she thought, 'Those attributes of the celestials, of which I have\r\nheard from the aged, do not pertain to any of these deities present here\r\nupon the earth.' And revolving the matter long in her mind, and\r\nreflecting upon it repeatedly, she decided upon seeking the protection of\r\nthe gods themselves. And bowing down unto them with mind and speech, with\r\nfolded hands, she addressed them trembling, 'Since I heard the speech of\r\nthe swans, I chose the king of the Nishadhas as my lord. For the sake of\r\ntruth, O, let the gods reveal him to me. And as in thought or word I have\r\nnever swerved from him, O, let the gods, for the sake of that truth,\r\nreveal him to me. And as the gods themselves have destined the ruler of\r\nthe Nishadhas to be my lord, O, let them, for the sake of that truth,\r\nreveal him to me. And as it is for paying homage unto Nala that I have\r\nadopted this vow, for the sake of that truth, O, let the gods reveal him\r\nunto me, O, let the exalted guardians of the worlds assume their own\r\nproper forms, so that I may know the righteous king.' Hearing these\r\npiteous words of Damayanti, and ascertaining her fixed resolve, and\r\nfervent love for the king of Nishadhas, the purity of her heart and her\r\ninclination and regard and affection for Nala, the gods did as they had\r\nbeen adjured, and assumed their respective attributes as best they could.\r\nAnd thereupon she beheld the celestials unmoistened with perspiration,\r\nwith winkless eyes, and unfading garlands, unstained with dust, and\r\nstaying without touching the ground. And Naishadha stood revealed to his\r\nshadow, his fading garlands, himself stained with dust and sweat, resting\r\non the ground with winking eyes. And, O Bharata, discerning the gods and\r\nthe virtuous Nala the daughter of Bhima chose Naishadha according to her\r\ntruth. And the large-eyed damsel then bashfully caught the hem of his\r\ngarment and placed round his neck a floral wreath of exceeding grace. And\r\nwhen that fair-complexioned maiden had thus chosen Nala for her husband,\r\nthe kings suddenly broke out into exclamations of Oh! and Alas! And, O\r\nBharata, the gods and the great Rishis in wonder cried Excellent!\r\nExcellent!, applauding the king the while. And, O Kauravya, the royal son\r\nof Virasena, with heart filled with gladness, comforted the beauteous\r\nDamayanti, saying, 'Since thou, O blessed one, hast chosen a mortal in\r\nthe presence of the celestials, know me for a husband even obedient to\r\nthy command. And, O thou of sweet smiles, truly do I tell thee this that\r\nas long as life continueth in this body of mine, I will remain thine and\r\nthine alone. Damayanti also, with folded hands paid homage unto Nala in\r\nwords of like import. And the happy pair beholding Agni and the other\r\ngods mentally sought their protection. And after the daughter of Bhima\r\nhad chosen Naishadha as her husband, the Lokapalas of exceeding\r\neffulgence with pleased hearts, bestowed on Nala eight boons. And Sakra,\r\nthe lord of Sachi, bestowed on Nala the boon that he should be able to\r\nbehold his godship in sacrifices and that he should attain to blessed\r\nlegions thereafter, and Hutasana bestowed on him the boon of his own\r\npresence whenever Naishadha wished, and regions also bright as himself.\r\nAnd Yama granted him subtle taste in food as well as pre-eminence in\r\nvirtue. And the lord of waters granted Nala his own presence whenever he\r\ndesired, and also garlands of celestial fragrance. And thus each of them\r\nbestowed upon him a couple of boons. And having bestowed these the gods\r\nwent to heaven. And the kings also, having witnessed with wonder\r\nDamayanti's selection of Nala, returned delighted whence they had come.\r\nAnd on the departure of those mighty monarchs, the high-souled Bhima,\r\nwell pleased, celebrated the wedding of Nala and Damayanti. And having\r\nstayed there for a time according to his desire, Naishadha, the best of\r\nmen, returned to his own city with the permission of Bhima. And having\r\nattained that pearl of a woman, the virtuous king, O monarch, began to\r\npass his days in joy, like the slayer of Vala and Vritra in the company\r\nof Sachi. And resembling the sun in glory, the king, full of gladness,\r\nbegan to rule his subjects righteously, and give them great satisfaction.\r\nAnd like unto Yayati, the son of Nahusha, that intelligent monarch\r\ncelebrated the horse sacrifice and many other sacrifices with abundant\r\ngifts to Brahmanas. And like unto a very god, Nala sported with Damayanti\r\nin romantic woods and groves. And the high-minded king begat upon\r\nDamayanti a son named Indrasena, and a daughter named Indrasena. And\r\ncelebrating sacrifice, and sporting (with Damayanti) thus, the king ruled\r\nthe earth abounding in wealth.'\""

And thereupon Kali replied unto Sakra, 'Going to\r\nDamayanti's Swayamvara, will I obtain her (for my wife), as my heart is\r\nfixed upon that damsel.' Hearing this, Indra said with a smile, 'That\r\nSwayamvara is already ended. In our sight she hath chosen Nala for her\r\nhusband.' Thus answered by Sakra, Kali, that vilest of the celestials,\r\nfilled with wrath, addressing all those gods spake, 'Since in the\r\npresence of the celestials she hath chosen a mortal for her lord, it is\r\nmeet that she should undergo a heavy doom.' Upon hearing these words of\r\nKali, the celestials answered, 'It is with our sanction that Damayanti\r\nhath chosen Nala. What damsel is there that would not choose king Nala\r\nendued with every virtue? Well-versed in all duties, always conducting\r\nhimself with rectitude, he hath studied the four Vedas together with the\r\nPuranas that are regarded as the fifth. Leading a life of harmlessness\r\nunto all creatures, he is truth-telling and firm in his vows, and in his\r\nhouse the gods are ever gratified by sacrifices held according to the\r\nordinance. In that tiger among men--that king resembling a Lokapala, is\r\ntruth, and forbearance, and knowledge, and asceticism, and purity and\r\nself-control, and perfect tranquillity of soul. O Kali, the fool that\r\nwisheth to curse Nala bearing such a character, curseth himself, and\r\ndestroyeth himself by his own act. And, O Kali, he that seeketh to curse\r\nNala crowned with such virtues, sinketh into the wide bottomless pit of\r\nhell rife with torments.' Having said this to Kali and Dwapara, the gods\r\nwent to heaven. And when the gods had gone away, Kali said unto Dwapara,\r\n'I am ill able, O Dwapara, to suppress my anger.

And always watching for a\r\nhole, he continued to dwell in the country of the Nishadhas for a long\r\ntime. And it was in the twelfth year that Kali saw a hole. For one day\r\nafter answering the call of nature, Naishadha touching water said his\r\ntwilight prayers, without having previously washed his feet. And it was\r\nthrough this (omission) that Kali entered his person. And having\r\npossessed Nala, he appeared before Pushkara, and addressed him, saying,\r\n'Come and play at dice with Nala. Through my assistance thou wilt surely\r\nwin at the play. And defeating king Nala and acquiring his kingdom, do\r\nthou rule the Nishadhas.' Thus exhorted by Kali, Pushkara went to Nala.\r\nAnd Dwapara also approached Pushkara, becoming the principal die called\r\nVrisha. And appearing before the warlike Nala, that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes, Pushkara, repeatedly said, 'Let us play together with dice.' Thus\r\nchallenged in the presence of Damayanti, the lofty-minded king could not\r\nlong decline it. And he accordingly fixed the time for the play. And\r\npossessed by Kali, Nala began to lose, in the game, his stakes in gold,\r\nand silver, and cars with the teams thereof, and robes. And maddened at\r\ndice, no one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading that\r\nrepresser of foes from the play that went on. And thereupon, O Bharata,\r\nthe citizens in a body, with the chief councillors, came thither to\r\nbehold the distressed monarch and make him desist.

Do thou inform the king of\r\nthe Nishadhas that the citizens have come here, unable to bear the\r\ncalamity that hath befallen their king conversant with virtue and\r\nwealth.' Thereupon Bhima's daughter, overwhelmed with grief and almost\r\ndeprived of reason by it, spake unto Nala in choked accents, 'O king, the\r\ncitizens with the councillors of state, urged by loyalty, stay at the\r\ngate desirous of beholding thee. It behoveth thee to grant them an\r\ninterview.' But the king, possessed by Kali, uttered not a word in reply\r\nunto his queen of graceful glances, uttering thus her lamentations. And\r\nat this, those councillors of state as also the citizens, afflicted with\r\ngrief and shame, returned to their homes, saying, 'He liveth not.'

And she thought the affair to be a serious\r\none with the king. And apprehensive of the calamity that threatened Nala,\r\nyet seeking his welfare and at last understanding that her lord had lost\r\neverything, she said unto her nurse and maid-servant Vrihatsena of high\r\nfame, intent upon her good, dexterous in all duties, faithful and\r\nsweet-speeched, these words, 'O Vrihatsena, go thou and summon the\r\ncouncillors in the name of Nala, and tell them also what of wealth and\r\nother things hath been lost and what remaineth.' The councillors then,\r\nhearing of Nala's summons, said, 'This is fortunate for us' and\r\napproached the king. And when the subjects in a body had (thus) come a\r\nsecond time, the daughter of Bhima informed Nala of it. But the king\r\nregarded her not. Finding her husband disregarding her words, Damayanti,\r\nfilled with shame, returned to her apartments.

The matter at hand is very serious.' And Vrihatsena, hearing\r\nthose words of Damayanti caused Varshneya to be summoned by trusty\r\nservants. And the blameless daughter of Bhima, acquainted with conduct\r\nsuitable to time and place, addressing soft words said according to the\r\noccasion, 'Thou knowest how the king hath always behaved towards thee. He\r\nis now in difficulty, and it behoveth thee to assist him. The more the\r\nking loseth to Pushkara, the greater becometh his ardour for the play.\r\nAnd as the dice fall obedient to Pushkara, it is seen that they are\r\nadverse to Nala in the matter of the play. And absorbed in the play, he\r\nheedeth not the words of his friends and relatives, nor even those of\r\nmine. I do not think, however, that in this the high-souled Naishadha is\r\nto blame, in as much as the king regarded not my words, being absorbed in\r\nplay. O Charioteer, I seek thy protection. Do my behest. My mind\r\nmisgiveth me. The king may come to grief. Yoking Nala's favourite horses\r\nendued with the fleetness of the mind, do thou take these twins (my son\r\nand daughter) on the car and hie thou to Kundina. Leaving the children\r\nthere with my kindred as also the car and the horses, either stay thou\r\nthere, or go to any other place as it listeth thee.' Varshneya, the\r\ncharioteer of Nala, then reported in detail these words of Damayanti unto\r\nthe chief officers of the king. And having settled (the matter) in\r\nconsultation with them, and obtaining their assent, O mighty monarch, the\r\ncharioteer started for Vidarbha, taking the children on that car.

And\r\nunto Nala, O king, who had lost his kingdom, Pushkara laughingly said,\r\n'Let the play go on. But what stake hast thou now? Damayanti only\r\nremaineth; all else of thine hath been won by me. Well, if thou likest,\r\nthat Damayanti be our stake now.' Hearing these words of Pushkara the\r\nvirtuous king felt as if his heart would burst in rage, but he spake not\r\na word. And gazing at Pushkara in anguish, king Nala of great fame took\r\nall the ornaments off every part of his body. And attired in a single\r\npiece of cloth, his body uncovered, renouncing all his wealth, and\r\nenhancing the grief of friends, the king set out. And Damayanti, clad in\r\none piece of cloth, followed him behind as he was leaving the city. And\r\ncoming to the outskirts of the city, Nala stayed there for three nights\r\nwith his wife. But Pushkara, O king, proclaimed through the city that he\r\nthat should show any attention to Nala, would be doomed to death. And on\r\naccount of these words of Pushkara and knowing his malice towards Nala,\r\nthe citizens, O Yudhishthira, no longer showed him hospitable regards.\r\nAnd unregarded though deserving of hospitable regards, Nala passed three\r\nnights in the outskirts of the city, living on water alone. And afflicted\r\nwith hunger, the king went away in search of fruit and roots, Damayanti\r\nfollowing him behind. And in agony of famine, after many days, Nala saw\r\nsome birds with plumage of golden hue. And thereupon the mighty lord of\r\nthe Nishadhas thought within himself, 'These will be my banquet today and\r\nalso my wealth.' And then he covered them with the cloth he had on--when\r\nbearing up that garment of his, the birds rose up to the sky. And\r\nbeholding Nala nude and melancholy, and standing with face turned towards\r\nthe ground, those rangers of the sky addressed him, saying, 'O thou of\r\nsmall sense, we are even those dice. We had come hither wishing to take\r\naway thy cloth, for it pleased us not that thou shouldst depart even with\r\nthy cloth on.' And finding himself deprived of his attire, and knowing\r\nalso that the dice were departing (with it), the virtuous Nala, O king,\r\nthus spake unto Damayanti, 'O faultless one, they through whose anger I\r\nhave been despoiled of my kingdom, they through whose influence\r\ndistressed and afflicted with hunger, I am unable to procure sustenance,\r\nthey for whom the Nishadhas offered me not any hospitality, they, O timid\r\none, are carrying off my cloth, assuming the form of birds. Fallen into\r\nthis dire disaster, I am afflicted with grief and deprived of my senses,\r\nI am thy lord, do thou, therefore, listen to the words I speak for thy\r\ngood. These many roads lead to the southern country, passing by (the city\r\nof) Avanti and the Rikshavat mountains. This is that mighty mountain\r\ncalled Vindhya; yon, the river Payasvini running sea-wards, and yonder\r\nare the asylums of the ascetics, furnished with various fruit and roots.\r\nThis road leadeth to the country of the Vidarbhas--and that, to the\r\ncountry of the Kosalas. Beyond these roads to the south is the southern\r\ncountry.' Addressing Bhima's daughter, O Bharata, he distressed king Nala\r\nspake those words unto Damayanti over and over again. Thereupon afflicted\r\nwith grief, in a voice choked with tears, Damayanti spake unto Naishadha\r\nthese piteous words, 'O king, thinking of thy purpose, my heart\r\ntrembleth, and all my limbs become faint. How can I go, leaving thee in\r\nthe lone woods despoiled of thy kingdom and deprived of thy wealth,\r\nthyself without a garment on, and worn with hunger and toil? When in the\r\ndeep woods, fatigued and afflicted with hunger, thou thinkest of thy\r\nformer bliss, I will, O great monarch, soothe thy weariness. In every\r\nsorrow there is no physic equal unto the wife, say the physicians. It is\r\nthe truth, O Nala, that I speak unto thee.' Hearing those words of his\r\nqueen, Nala replied, 'O slender-waisted Damayanti, it is even as thou\r\nhast said. To a man in distress, there is no friend or medicine that is\r\nequal unto a wife. But I do not seek to renounce thee, wherefore, O timid\r\none, dost thou dread this? O faultless one, I can forsake myself but thee\r\nI cannot forsake.' Damayanti then said, 'If thou dost not, O mighty king,\r\nintend to forsake me, why then dost thou point out to me the way to the\r\ncountry of the Vidarbhas? I know, O king, that thou wouldst not desert\r\nme. But, O lord of the earth, considering that thy mind is distracted,\r\nthou mayst desert me. O best of men, thou repeatedly pointest out to me\r\nthe way and it is by this, O god-like one, that thou enhancest my grief.\r\nIf it is thy intention that I should go to my relatives, then if it\r\npleaseth thee, both of us will wend to the country of the Vidarbhas. O\r\ngiver of honours, there the king of the Vidarbhas will receive thee with\r\nrespect. And honoured by him, O king, thou shall live happily in our\r\nhome.'\""

How can I go there now in misery,\r\naugmenting thy grief?'\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Saying this again and again unto Damayanti, king\r\nNala, wrapped in half a garment, comforted his blessed wife. And both\r\nattired in one cloth and wearied with hunger and thirst, in course of\r\ntheir wanderings, at last they came to a sheltered shed for travellers.\r\nAnd arrived at this place, the king of the Nishadhas sat down on the bare\r\nearth with the princes of Vidarbha. And wearing the same piece of cloth\r\n(with Damayanti), and dirty, and haggard, and stained with dust, he fell\r\nasleep with Damayanti on the ground in weariness. And suddenly plunged in\r\ndistress, the innocent and delicate Damayanti with every mark of good\r\nfortune, fell into a profound slumber. And, O monarch, while she slept,\r\nNala, with heart and mind distraught, could not slumber calmly as before.\r\nAnd reflecting on the loss of his kingdom, the desertion of his friends,\r\nand his distress in the woods, he thought with himself, 'What availeth my\r\nacting thus? And what if I act not thus? Is death the better for me now?\r\nOr should I desert my wife? She is truly devoted to me and suffereth this\r\ndistress for my sake. Separated from me, she may perchance wander to her\r\nrelatives. Devoted as she is to me, if she stayeth with me, distress will\r\nsurely be hers; while it is doubtful, if I desert her. On the other hand,\r\nit is not unlikely that she may even have happiness some time.'\r\nReflecting upon this repeatedly, and thinking of it again and again, he\r\nconcluded, O monarch, that the desertion of Damayanti was the best course\r\nfor him. And he also thought, 'Of high fame and auspicious fortune, and\r\ndevoted to me, her husband, she is incapable of being injured by any one\r\non the way on account of her energy.' Thus his mind that was influenced\r\nby the wicked Kali, dwelling upon Damayanti, was made up for deserting\r\nher. And then thinking of his own want of clothing, and of her being clad\r\nin a single garment, he intended to cut off for himself one half of\r\nDamayanti's attire. And he thought, 'How shall I divide this garment, so\r\nthat my beloved one may not perceive?' And thinking of this, the royal\r\nNala began to walk up and down that shed. And, O Bharata, pacing thus to\r\nand fro, he found a handsome sword lying near the shed, unsheathed. And\r\nthat repressor of foes, having, with that sword cut off one half of the\r\ncloth, and throwing the instrument away, left the daughter of Vidharbha\r\ninsensible in her sleep and went away. But his heart failing him, the\r\nking of the Nishadhas returned to the shed, and seeing Damayanti (again),\r\nburst into tears. And he said, 'Alas! that beloved one of mine whom\r\nneither the god of wind nor the sun had seen before, even she sleepeth\r\nto-day on the bare earth, like one forlorn. Clad in this severed piece of\r\ncloth, and lying like one distracted, how will the beauteous one of\r\nluminous smiles behave when she awaketh? How will the beautiful daughter\r\nof Bhima, devoted to her lord, all alone and separated from me, wander\r\nthrough these deep woods inhabited by beasts and serpents? O blessed one,\r\nmay the Adityas and the Vasus, and the twin Aswins together with the\r\nMarutas protect thee, thy virtue being thy best guard.' And addressing\r\nthus his dear wife peerless on earth in beauty, Nala strove to go, reft\r\nof reason by Kali. Departing and still departing, king Nala returned\r\nagain and again to that shed, dragged away by Kali but drawn back by\r\nlove. And it seemed as though the heart of the wretched king was rent in\r\ntwain, and like a swing, he kept going out from cabin and coming back\r\ninto it. At length after lamenting long and piteously, Nala stupefied and\r\nbereft of sense by Kali went away, forsaking that sleeping wife of his.\r\nReft of reason through Kali's touch, and thinking of his conduct, the\r\nking departed in sorrow, leaving his, wife alone in that solitary\r\nforest.'\""

Oh, I am lost and undone, frightened in\r\nthis desolate place. O illustrious prince, thou art truthful in speech,\r\nand conversant with morality. How hast thou then, having pledged thy\r\nword, deserted me asleep in the woods?

I only grieve to\r\nthink how thou wilt pass thy days alone, O king. In the evening oppressed\r\nwith hunger and thirst and fatigue, underneath the trees, how wilt it\r\ntake with thee when thou seest me not?' And then Damayanti, afflicted\r\nwith anguish and burning with grief, began to rush hither and thither,\r\nweeping in woe. And now the helpless princess sprang up, and now she sank\r\ndown in stupor; and now she shrank in terror, and now she wept and wailed\r\naloud.

And the\r\ndaughter of Bhima, wailing bitterly, wandered hither and thither like a\r\nmaniac, exclaiming, 'Alas! Alas! Oh king!' And as she was wailing loudly\r\nlike a female osprey, and grieving and indulging in piteous lamentations\r\nunceasingly, she came near a gigantic serpent. And that huge and hungry\r\nserpent thereupon suddenly seized Bhima's daughter, who had come near and\r\nwas moving about within its range. And folded within serpent's coils and\r\nfilled with grief, she still wept, not for herself but for Naishadha. And\r\nshe said 'O lord, why dost thou not rush towards me, now that I am\r\nseized, without anybody to protect me, by this serpent in these desert\r\nwilds? And, O Naishadha, how will it fare with thee when thou rememberest\r\nme? O lord, why hast thou gone away, deserting me today in the forest?\r\nFree from thy course, when thou wilt have regained thy mind and senses\r\nand wealth, how will it be with thee when thou thinkest of me? O\r\nNaishadha, O sinless one, who will soothe thee when thou art weary, and\r\nhungry, and fainting, O tiger among kings?' And while she was wailing\r\nthus, a certain huntsman ranging the deep woods, hearing her\r\nlamentations, swiftly came to the spot. And beholding the large-eyed one\r\nin the coils of the serpent, he rushed towards it and cut off its head\r\nwith his sharp weapon. And having struck the reptile dead, the huntsman\r\nset Damayanti free. And having sprinkled her body with water and fed and\r\ncomforted her. O Bharata, he addressed her saying, 'O thou with eyes like\r\nthose of a young gazelle, who art thou? And why also hast thou come into\r\nthe woods? And, O beauteous one, how hast thou fallen into this extreme\r\nmisery' And thus accosted, O monarch, by that man, Damayanti, O Bharata,\r\nrelated unto him all that had happened.

And afflicted by the god of love, the\r\nhuntsman began to soothe her in winning voice and soft words. And as soon\r\nas the chaste and beauteous Damayanti, beholding him understood his\r\nintentions, she was filled with fierce wrath and seemed to blaze up in\r\nanger. But the wicked-minded wretch, burning with desire became wroth,\r\nattempted to employ force upon her, who was unconquerable as a flame of\r\nblazing fire. And Damayanti already distressed upon being deprived of\r\nhusband and kingdom, in that hour of grief beyond utterance, cursed him\r\nin anger, saying, 'I have never even thought of any other person than\r\nNaishadha, therefore let this mean-minded wrath subsisting on chase, fall\r\ndown lifeless.' And as soon as she said this, the hunter fell down\r\nlifeless upon the ground, like a tree consumed by fire.\" 131"

And she saw numberless\r\nsnakes and goblins and Rakshasas of grim visage, and pools and tanks and\r\nhillocks, and brooks and fountains of wonderful appearance. And the\r\nprincess of Vidarbha saw there herds of buffaloes. And boars, and bears\r\nas well as serpents of the wilderness. And safe in virtue and glory and\r\ngood fortune and patience, Damayanti wandered through those woods alone,\r\nin search of Nala. And the royal daughter of Bhima, distressed only at\r\nher separation from her lord, was not terrified at aught in that fearful\r\nforest. And, O king, seating herself down upon a stone and filled with\r\ngrief, and every limb of hers trembling with sorrow on account of her\r\nhusband, she began to lament thus: 'O king of the Nishadhas, O thou of\r\nbroad chest and mighty arms, whither hast thou gone, O king, leaving me\r\nin this lone forest? O hero, having performed the Aswamedha and other\r\nsacrifices, with gifts in profusion (unto the Brahmanas), why hast thou,\r\nO tiger among men, played false with me alone? O best of men, O thou of\r\ngreat splendour, it behoveth thee. O auspicious one, to remember what\r\nthou didst declare before me, O bull among kings! And, O monarch, it\r\nbehoveth thee also to call to mind what the sky-ranging swans spake in\r\nthy presence and in mine. O tiger among men, the four Vedas in all their\r\nextent, with the Angas and the Upangas, well-studied, on one side, and\r\none single truth on the other, (are equal). Therefore, O slayer of foes,\r\nit behoveth thee, O lord of men, to make good what thou didst formerly\r\ndeclare before me. Alas, O hero! warrior! O Nala! O sinless one being\r\nthine, I am about to perish in this dreadful forest. Oh! wherefore dost\r\nthou not answer me? This terrible lord of the forest, of grim visage and\r\ngaping jaws, and famishing with hunger, filleth me with fright. Doth it\r\nnot behove thee to deliver me? Thou wert wont to say always, 'Save thee\r\nthere existeth not one dear unto me.' O blessed one, O king, do thou now\r\nmake good thy words so spoken before. And, O king, why dost thou not\r\nreturn an answer to thy beloved wife bewailing and bereft of sense,\r\nalthough thou lovest her, being loved in return? O king of the earth, O\r\nrespected one, O represser of foes, O thou of large eyes, why dost thou\r\nnot regard me, emaciated, and distressed and pale, and discoloured, and\r\nclad in a half piece of cloth, and alone, and weeping, and lamenting like\r\none forlorn, and like unto a solitary doe separated from the herd? O\r\nillustrious sovereign, it is, I, Damayanti, devoted to thee, who, alone\r\nin this great forest, address thee. Wherefore, then, dost thou not reply\r\nunto me? Oh, I do not behold thee today on this mountain, O chief of men,\r\nO thou of noble birth and character with every limb possesed of grace! In\r\nthis terrible forest, haunted by lions and tigers, O king of the\r\nNishadhas, O foremost of men, O enhancer of my sorrows, (Wishing to know)\r\nwhether thou art lying down, or sitting, or standing, or gone, whom shall\r\nI ask, distressed and woe-stricken on thy account, saying, 'Hast thou\r\nseen in this woods the royal Nala?' Of whom shall I in this forest\r\nenquire alter the departed Nala, handsome and of high soul, and the\r\ndestroyer of hostile arrays? From whom shall I today hear the sweet\r\nwords, viz., 'That royal Nala, of eyes like lotus-leaves, whom thou\r\nseekest, is even here?' Yonder cometh the forest-king, that tiger of\r\ngraceful mien, furnished with four teeth and prominent cheeks. Even him\r\nwill I accost fearlessly: Thou art the lord of all animals, and of this\r\nforest the king. Know me for Damayanti, the daughter of the king of the\r\nVidarbhas, and the wife of Nala, destroyer of foes, and the king of the\r\nNishadhas. Distressed and woe-stricken, I am seeking my husband alone in\r\nthese woods. Do thou, O king of beasts, comfort me (with news of Nala) if\r\nthou hast seen him. Or, O lord of the forest, if thou cannot speak of\r\nNala, do thou, then, O best of beasts, devour me, and free me from this\r\nmisery. Alas! hearing my plaintive appeal in the wilderness, this king of\r\nmountains, this high and sacred hill, crested with innumerable [...?-JBH]\r\nrolleth towards the sea. Let me, then, for tidings of the king, ask this\r\nking of mountains, this high and sacred hill, crested with innumerable\r\nheaven-kissing and many-hued and beauteous peaks, and abounding in\r\nvarious ores, and decked with gems of diverse kings, and rising like a\r\nbanner over this broad forest, and ranged by lions and tigers and\r\nelephants and boars and bears and stags, and echoing all around with (the\r\nnotes of) winged creatures of various species, and adorned with kinsukas\r\nand Asokas and Vakulas and Punnagas, with blossoming Karnikaras, and\r\nDhavas and Plakshas, and with streams haunted by waterfowls of every\r\nkind, and abounding in crested summits, O sacred one! O best of\r\nmountains! O thou of wondrous sight! O celebrated hill! O refuge (of the\r\ndistressed)! O highly auspicious one! I bow to thee, O pillar of the\r\nearth! Approaching, I bow to thee. Know me for a king's daughter, and a\r\nking's daughter-in-law, and king's consort, Damayanti by name that lord\r\nof earth who ruleth the Vidarbhas, that mighty warrior-king Bhima by\r\nname, who protecteth the four orders, is my sire. That best of kings\r\ncelebrated the Rajasuya and Aswamedha sacrifices, with profuse gifts to\r\nthe Brahmanas. Possessed of beautiful and large eyes, distinguished for\r\ndevotion to the Vedas, of unblemished character, truth-telling, devoid of\r\nguile, gentle, endued with prowess, lord of immense wealth, versed in\r\nmorality, and pure, he having vanquished all his foes, effectually\r\nprotecteth the inhabitants of Vidarbha. Know me, O holy one, for his\r\ndaughter, thus come to thee. That best of men--the celebrated ruler of\r\nthe Nishadha--known by the name of Virasena of high fame, was my\r\nfather-in-law. The son of that king, heroic and handsome and possessed of\r\nenergy incapable of being baffled, who ruleth well the kingdom which hath\r\ndescended to him from his father, is named Nala. Know, O mountain, that\r\nof that slayer of foes, called also Punyasloka, possessed of the\r\ncomplexion of gold, and devoted to the Brahmanas, and versed in the\r\nVedas, and gifted with eloquence,--of that righteous and Soma-quaffing\r\nand fire-adoring king, who celebrateth sacrifices and is liberal and\r\nwarlike and who adequately chastiseth (criminals), I am the innocent\r\nspouse--the chief of his queens--standing before thee. Despoiled of\r\nprosperity and deprived of (the company of my) husband without a\r\nprotector, and afflicted with calamity, hither have I come, O best of\r\nmountains, seeking my husband. Hast thou, O foremost of mountains, with\r\nthy hundreds of peaks towering (into the sky) seen king Nala in this\r\nfrightful forest? Hast thou seen my husband, that ruler of the Nishadhas,\r\nthe illustrious Nala, with the tread of a mighty elephant, endued with\r\nintelligence, long-armed, and of fiery energy, possessed of prowess and\r\npatience and courage and high fame? Seeing me bewailing alone,\r\noverwhelmed with sorrow, wherefore, O best of mountains, dost thou not\r\ntoday soothe me with thy voice, as thy own daughter in distress? O hero,\r\nO warrior of prowess, O thou versed in every duty, O thou adhering to\r\ntruth--O lord of the earth, if thou art in this forest, then, O king,\r\nreveal thyself unto me. Oh, when shall I again hear the voice of Nala,\r\ngentle and deep as that of the clouds, that voice, sweet as Amrita, of\r\nthe illustrious king, calling me Vidharva's daughter, with accents\r\ndistinct, and holy, and musical as the chanting of the Vedas and rich,\r\nand soothing all my sorrows. O king, I am frightened. Do thou, O virtuous\r\none, comfort me.'\r\n\r\n\"Having addressed that foremost of mountain thus, Damayanti then went in\r\na northerly direction. And having proceeded three days and nights, that\r\nbest of women came to an incomparable penance grove of ascetics,\r\nresembling in beauty a celestial grove. And the charming asylum she\r\nbeheld was inhabited and adorned by ascetics like Vasishtha and Bhrigu\r\nand Atri, self-denying and strict in diet, with minds under control,\r\nendued with holiness, some living on water, some on air, and some on\r\n(fallen) leaves, with passions in check, eminently blessed, seeking the\r\nway to heaven, clad in barks of trees and deer-skins, and with senses\r\nsubdued. And beholding that hermitage inhabited by ascetics, and\r\nabounding in herds of deer and monkeys, Damayanti was cheered. And that\r\nbest of women, the innocent and blessed Damayanti, with graceful\r\neye-brows, and long tresses, with lovely hips and deep bosom, and face\r\ngraced with fine teeth and with fine black and large eyes, in her\r\nbrightness and glory entered that asylum. And saluting those ascetics\r\ngrown old in practising austerities, she stood in an attitude of\r\nhumility. And the ascetics living in that forest, said, 'Welcome!' And\r\nthose men of ascetic wealth, paying her due homage, said, 'Sit ye down,\r\nand tell us what we may do for thee.' That best of women replied unto\r\nthem, saying, 'Ye sinless and eminently blessed ascetics, is it well with\r\nyour austerities, and sacrificial fire, and religious observances, and\r\nthe duties of your own order? And is it well with the beasts and birds of\r\nthis asylum? And they answered, 'O beauteous and illustrious lady,\r\nprosperity attendeth us in every respect. But, O thou of faultless limbs,\r\ntell us who thou art, and what thou seekest. Beholding thy beauteous form\r\nand thy bright splendour, we have been amazed. Cheer up and mourn not.\r\nTell us, O blameless and blessed one, art thou the presiding deity of\r\nthis forest, or of this mountain, or of this river?' Damayanti replied\r\nunto those ascetics, saying, 'O Brahmanas, I am not the goddess of this\r\nforest, or of this mountain, or of this stream. O Rishis of ascetic\r\nwealth, know that I am a human being. I will relate my history in detail.\r\nDo ye listen to me. There is a king--the mighty ruler of the\r\nVidarbhas--Bhima by name. O foremost of regenerate ones, know me to be\r\nhis daughter. The wise ruler of the Nishadhas, Nala by name, of great\r\ncelebrity, heroic, and ever victorious in battle, and learned, is my\r\nhusband. Engaged in the worship of the gods, devoted to the twice-born\r\nones, the guardian of the line of the Nishadhas, of mighty energy,\r\npossessed of great strength, truthful, conversant with all duties, wise,\r\nunwavering in promise, the crusher of foes, devout, serving the gods,\r\ngraceful, the conqueror of hostile towns, that foremost of kings, Nala by\r\nname, equal in splendour unto the lord of celestials, the slayer of foes,\r\npossessed of large eyes, and a hue resembling the full moon, is my\r\nhusband. The celebrator of great sacrifices, versed in the Vedas and\r\ntheir branches, the destroyer of enemies in battle, and like unto the sun\r\nand the moon in splendour, is he. That king devoted to truth and religion\r\nwas summoned to dice by certain deceitful persons of mean mind and\r\nuncultured soul and of crooked ways, and skilful in gambling, and was\r\ndeprived of wealth and kingdom. Know that I am the wife of that bull\r\namong kings, known to all by the name of Damayanti, anxious to find out\r\nmy (missing) lord. In sadness of heart am I wandering among woods, and\r\nmountains, and lakes, and rivers, and tanks and forests, in search of\r\nthat husband of mine--Nala, skilled in battle, high-souled, and\r\nwell-versed in the use of weapons, O hath king Nala, the lord of the\r\nNishadhas, come to this delightful asylum of your holy selves? It is for\r\nhim, O Brahmanas, that I have come to this dreary forest full of terrors\r\nand haunted by tigers and other beasts. If I do not see king Nala within\r\na few days and nights, I shall seek my good by renouncing this body. Of\r\nwhat use is my life without that bull among men? How shall I live\r\nafflicted with grief on account of my husband?'\r\n\r\nUnto Bhima's daughter, Damayanti, lamenting forlorn in that forest, the\r\ntruth-telling ascetics replied, saying, 'O blessed and beauteous one, we\r\nsee by ascetic power that the future will bring happiness to thee, and\r\nthat thou wilt soon behold Naishadha. O daughter of Bhima, thou wilt\r\nbehold Nala, the lord of the Nishadhas, the slayer of foes, and the\r\nforemost of the virtuous freed from distress. And O blessed lady, thou\r\nwilt behold the king--thy lord--freed from all sins and decked with all\r\nkinds of gems, and ruling the selfsame city, and chasting his enemies,\r\nand striking terror into the hearts of foes, and gladdening the hearts of\r\nfriends, and crowned with every blessing.'\r\n\r\n\"'Having spoken unto that princess--the beloved queen of Nala--the\r\nascetics with their sacred fires and asylum vanished from sight. And\r\nbeholding that mighty wonder, the daughter-in-law of king Virasena,\r\nDamayanti of faultless limbs, was struck with amazement. And she asked\r\nherself, 'Was it a dream that I saw? What an occurrence hath taken place!\r\nWhere are all those ascetics? And where is that asylum? Where, further,\r\nis that delightful river of sacred waters--the resort of diverse kinds of\r\nfowls? And where, again, are those charming trees decked with fruits and\r\nflowers?' And after thinking so for some time, Bhima's daughter,\r\nDamayanti of sweet smiles melancholy and afflicted with grief on account\r\nof her lord, lost the colour of her face (again). And going to another\r\npart of the wood, she saw an Asoka tree. And approaching that first of\r\ntrees in the forest, so charming with blossoms and its load of foliage,\r\nand resounding with the notes of birds, Damayanti, with tears in her eyes\r\nand accents choked in grief, began to lament, saying, 'Oh, this graceful\r\ntree in the heart of the forest, decked in flowers, looketh beautiful,\r\nlike a charming king of hills. O beauteous Asoka, do thou speedily free\r\nme from grief. Hast thou seen king Nala, the slayer of foes and the\r\nbeloved husband of Damayanti,--freed from fear and grief and obstacles?\r\nHast thou seen my beloved husband, the ruler of the Nishadhas, clad in\r\nhalf a piece of cloth, with delicate skin, that hero afflicted with woe\r\nand who hath come into this wilderness? O Asoka tree, do thou free me\r\nfrom grief! O Asoka, vindicate thy name, for Asoka meaneth destroyer of\r\ngrief. And going round that tree thrice, with an afflicted heart, that\r\nbest of women, Bhima's daughter, entered a more terrible part of the\r\nforest. And wandering in quest of her lord, Bhima's daughter beheld many\r\ntrees and streams and delightful mountains, and many beasts and birds,\r\nand caves, and precipices, and many rivers of wonderful appearance. And\r\nas she proceeded she came upon a broad way where she saw with wonder a\r\nbody of merchants, with their horses and elephants, landing on the banks\r\nof a river, full of clear and cool water, and lovely and charming to\r\nbehold, and broad, and covered with bushes of canes, and echoing with the\r\ncries of cranes and ospreys and Chakravakas, and abounding in tortoises\r\nand alligators and fishes, and studded with innumerable islets. And as\r\nsoon as as she saw that caravan, the beauteous and celebrated wife of\r\nNala, wild like a maniac, oppressed with grief, clad in half a garment,\r\nlean and pale and smutted, and with hair covered with dust, drew near and\r\nentered into its midst. And beholding her, some fled in fear, and some\r\nbecame extremely anxious, and some cried aloud, and some laughed at her,\r\nand some hated her. And some, O Bharata, felt pity for, and even\r\naddressed, her, saying, 'O blessed one, who art thou, and whose? What\r\nseekest thou in woods? Seeing thee here we have been terrified. Art thou\r\nhuman? Tell us truly, O blessed one if thou art the goddess of this wood\r\nor of this mountain or of the points of the heaven. We seek thy\r\nprotection. Art thou a female Yaksha, or a female Rakshasa, or a\r\ncelestial damsel? O thou of faultless features, do thou bless us wholly\r\nand protect us. And, O blessed one, do thou so act that his caravan may\r\nsoon go hence in prosperity and that the welfare of all of us may be\r\nsecured.' Thus addressed by that caravan, the princess Damayanti, devoted\r\nto her husband and oppressed by the calamity that had befallen her,\r\nanswered, saying, 'O leader of the caravan, ye merchants, ye youths, old\r\nmen, and children, and ye that compose this caravan, know me for a human\r\nbeing. I am the daughter of a king, and the daughter in-law of a king,\r\nand the consort also of a king, eager for the sight of my lord. The ruler\r\nof the Vidarbhas is my father, and my husband is the lord of the\r\nNishadhas, named Nala. Even now I am seeking that unvanquished and\r\nblessed one. If ye have chanced to see my beloved one, king Nala, that\r\ntiger among men, that destroyer of hostile hosts, O tell me quick.'\r\nThereupon the leader of that great caravan, named Suchi, replied unto\r\nDamayanti of faultless limbs, saying, 'O blessed one, listen to my words.\r\nO thou of sweet smiles, I am a merchant and the leader of this caravan. O\r\nillustrious lady, I have not seen any man of the name of Nala. In this\r\nextensive forest uninhabited by men, there are only elephants and\r\nleopards and buffaloes, and tigers and bears and other animals. Except\r\nthee, I have not met with any man or woman here, so help us now\r\nManibhadra, the king of Yakshas!' Thus addressed by them she asked those\r\nmerchants as well as the leader of the host saying, 'It behoveth you to\r\ntell me whither this caravan is bound.' The leader of the band said, 'O\r\ndaughter of a great king, for the purpose of profit this caravan is bound\r\ndirect for the city of Suvahu, the truth-telling ruler of the Chedis.'\""

      "content": "\"Vrihadaswa said, 'Having heard the words of the leader of that caravan,\r\nDamayanti of faultless limbs proceeded with that caravan itself anxious\r\nto behold her lord. And after having proceeded for many days the\r\nmerchants saw a large lake fragrant with lotuses in the midst of that\r\ndense and terrible forest. And it was beautiful all over, and exceedingly\r\ndelightful, (with banks) abounding in grass and fuel and fruits and\r\nflowers. And it was inhabited by various kinds of fowls and birds, and\r\nfall of water that was pure and sweet. And it was cool and capable of\r\ncaptivating the heart. And the caravan, worn out with toil, resolved to\r\nhalt there. And with the permission of their leader, they spread\r\nthemselves around those beautiful woods. And that mighty caravan finding\r\nit was evening halted at that place. And (it came to pass that) at the\r\nhour of midnight when everything was hushed and still and the tired\r\ncaravan had fallen asleep, a herd of elephants in going towards a\r\nmountain stream to drink of its water befouled by their temporal juice,\r\nsaw that caravan as also the numerous elephants belonging to it. And\r\nseeing their domesticated fellows the wild elephants infuriated and with\r\nthe temporal juice trickling down rushed impetuously on the former, with\r\nthe intention of killing them. And the force of the rush of those\r\nelephants was hard to bear, like the impetuosity of peaks lessened from\r\nmountain summits rolling towards the plain. The rushing elephants found\r\nthe forest paths to be all blocked up, for the goodly caravan was\r\nsleeping obstructing the paths around that lake of lotuses. And the\r\nelephants all of a sudden, began to crush the men lying insensible on the\r\nground. And uttering cries of 'Oh!' and 'Alas!' the merchants, blinded by\r\nsleep, fled, in order to escape that danger, to copses and woods for\r\nrefuge. And some were slain by the tusks, and some by the trunks, and\r\nsome by the legs of those elephants. And innumerable camels and horses\r\nwere killed, and crowds of men on foot, running in fright, killed one\r\nanother. And uttering loud cries some fell down on the ground, and some\r\nin fear climbed on trees, and some dropped down on uneven ground. And, O\r\nking, thus accidentally attacked by that large herd of elephants, that\r\ngoodly caravan suffered a great loss. And there arose a tremendous uproar\r\ncalculated to frighten the three worlds, 'Lo! a great fire hath broken\r\nout. Rescue us.\r\n\r\nDo ye speedily fly away. Why do ye fly? Take the heaps of jewels\r\nscattered around. All this wealth is a trifle. I do not speak falsely, 'I\r\ntell you again, (exclaimed some one) think on my words, O ye distracted\r\none!' With such exclamation they ran about in fright. And Damayanti awoke\r\nin fear and anxiety, while that terrible slaughter was raging there. And\r\nbeholding slaughter capable of awaking the fear of all the worlds, and\r\nwhich was so unforeseen, the damsel of eyes like lotus leaves rose up,\r\nwild with fright, and almost out of breath. And those of the caravan that\r\nhad escaped unhurt, met together, and asked one another, 'Of what deed of\r\nours is this the consequence? Surely, we have failed to worship the\r\nillustrious Manibhadras, and likewise the exalted and graceful\r\nVaisravana, the king of the Yaksha. Perhaps, we have not worshipped the\r\ndeities that cause calamities, or perhaps, we have not paid them the\r\nfirst homage. Or, perhaps, this evil is the certain consequence of the\r\nbirds (we saw). Our stars are not unpropitious. From what other cause,\r\nthen hath this disaster come?' Others, distressed and bereft of wealth\r\nand relatives, said, 'That maniac-like woman who came amongst this mighty\r\ncaravan in guise that was strange and scarcely human, alas, it is by her\r\nthat this dreadful illusion had been pre-arranged. Of a certainty, she is\r\na terrible Rakshasa or a Yaksha or a Pisacha woman. All this evil is her\r\nwork, what need of doubts? If we again see that wicked destroyer of\r\nmerchants, that giver of innumerable woes, we shall certainly slay that\r\ninjurer of ours, with stones, and dust, and grass, and wood, and cuffs.'\r\nAnd hearing these dreadful words of the merchants, Damayanti, in terror\r\nand shame and anxiety, fled into the woods apprehensive of evil. And\r\nreproaching herself she said, 'Alas! fierce and great is the wrath of God\r\non me. Peace followeth not in my track. Of what misdeed is this the\r\nconsequence? I do not remember that I did ever so little a wrong to any\r\none in thought, word, or deed. Of what deed, then, is this the\r\nconsequence? Certainly, it is on account of the great sins I had\r\ncommitted in a former life that such calamity hath befallen me, viz., the\r\nloss of my husband's kingdom, his defeat at the hands of his own kinsmen,\r\nthis separation from my lord and my son and daughter, this my unprotected\r\nstate, and my presence in this forest abounding in innumerable beasts of\r\nprey!'\"\r\n\r\n\"The next day, O king, the remnant of that caravan left the place\r\nbewailing the destruction that had overtaken them and lamenting for their\r\ndead brothers and fathers and sons and friends. And the princess of\r\nVidarbha began to lament, saying, 'Alas! What misdeed have I perpetrated!\r\nThe crowd of men that I obtained in this lone forest, hath been destroyed\r\nby a herd of elephants, surely as a consequence of my ill luck. Without\r\ndoubt, I shall have to suffer misery for a long time. I have heard from\r\nold men that no person dieth ere his time; it is for this that my\r\nmiserable self hath not been trodden to death by that herd of elephants.\r\nNothing that befalleth men is due to anything else than Destiny, for even\r\nin my childhood I did not commit any such sin in thought, word, or deed,\r\nwhence might come this calamity. Methinks, I suffer this severance from\r\nmy husband through the potency of those celestial Lokapalas, who had come\r\nto the Swayamvara but whom I disregarded for the sake of Nala.' Bewailing\r\nthus, O tiger among kings, that excellent lady, Damayanti, devoted to her\r\nhusband, went, oppressed with grief and (pale) as the autumnal moon, with\r\nthose Brahmanas versed in the Vedas that had survived the slaughter of\r\nthe caravan. And departing speedily, towards evening, the damsel came to\r\nthe mighty city of the truth-telling Suvahu, the king of the Chedis. And\r\nshe entered that excellent city clad in half a garment. And the citizens\r\nsaw her as she went, overcome with fear, and lean, melancholy, her hair\r\ndishevelled and soiled with dust, and maniac-like. And beholding her\r\nenter the city of the king of the Chedis, the boys of the city, from\r\ncuriosity, began to follow her. And surrounded by them, she came before\r\nthe palace of the king. And from the terrace the queen-mother saw her\r\nsurrounded by the crowd. And she said to her nurse, 'Go and bring that\r\nwoman before me. She is forlorn and is being vexed by the crowd. She hath\r\nfallen into distress and standeth in need of succour. I find her beauty\r\nto be such that it illumineth my house. The fair one, though looking like\r\na maniac, seemeth a very Sree with her large eyes.' Thus commanded, the\r\nnurse went out and dispersing the crowd brought Damayanti to that\r\ngraceful terrace. And struck with wonder, O king, she asked Damayanti,\r\nsaying, 'Afflicted though thou art with such distress, thou ownest a\r\nbeautiful form. Thou shinest like lightning in the midst of the clouds.\r\nTell me who thou art, and whose. O thou possessed of celestial splendour,\r\nsurely, thy beauty is not human, bereft though thou art of ornaments. And\r\nalthough thou art helpless, yet thou art unmoved under the outrage of\r\nthese men.' Hearing these words of the nurse, the daughter of Bhima said,\r\nKnow that I am a female belonging to the human species and devoted to my\r\nhusband. I am a serving woman of good lineage. I live wherever I like,\r\nsubsisting on fruit and roots, and whom a companion, and stay where\r\nevening overtaketh me. My husband is the owner of countless virtues and\r\nwas ever devoted to me. And I also, on my part, was deeply attached to\r\nhim, following him like his shadow. It chanced that once he became\r\ndesperately engaged at dice. Defeated at dice, he came along into the\r\nforest. I accompanied my husband into the woods, comforting the hero clad\r\nin a single piece of cloth and maniac-like and overwhelmed with calamity.\r\nOnce on a time for some cause, that hero, afflicted with hunger and\r\nthirst and grief, was forced to abandon that sole piece of covering in\r\nthe forest. Destitute of garment and maniac-like and deprived of his\r\nsenses as he was, I followed him, myself in a single garment. Following\r\nhim, I did not sleep for nights together. Thus passed many days, until at\r\nlast while I was sleeping, he cut off half of my cloth, and forsook me\r\nwho had done him no wrong. I am seeking my husband but unable to find him\r\nwho is of hue like the filaments of the lotus, without being able to cast\r\nmy eyes on that delight of my heart, that dear lord who owneth my heart\r\nand resembleth the celestials in mien, day and night do I burn in grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unto Bhima's daughter thus lamenting with tearful eyes, and afflicted\r\nand speaking in accents choked in grief, the queen-mother herself said,\r\n'O blessed damsel, do thou stay with me. I am well pleased with thee. O\r\nfair lady, my men shall search for thy husband. Or, perhaps he may come\r\nhere of his own accord in course of his wanderings. And, O beautiful\r\nlady, residing here thou wilt regain thy (lost) lord.' Hearing these\r\nwords of the queen mother, Damayanti replied, 'O mother of heroes, I may\r\nstay with thee on certain conditions. I shall not eat the leavings on any\r\ndish, nor shall I wash anybody's feet, nor shall I have to speak with\r\nother men. And if anybody shall seek me (as a wife or mistress) he should\r\nbe liable to punishment at thy hands. And, further, should he solicit me\r\nover and over again, that wicked one should be punished with death. This\r\nis the vow I have made. I intend to have an interview with those\r\nBrahmanas that will set out to search for my husband. If thou canst do\r\nall this, I shall certainly live with thee. If it is otherwise, I cannot\r\nfind it in my heart to reside with thee.' The queen-mother answered her\r\nwith a glad heart, saying, 'I will do all this. Thou hast done well in\r\nadopting such a vow!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'O king, having spoken so unto the daughter of\r\nBhima, the queen-mother, O Bharata, said to her daughter named Sunanda,\r\n'O Sunanda, accept this lady like a goddess as thy Sairindhri! Let her be\r\nthy companion, as she is of the same age with thee. Do thou, with heart\r\nfree from care, always sport with her in joy.' And Sunanda cheerfully\r\naccepted Damayanti and led her to her own apartment accompanied by her\r\nassociates. And treated with respect, Damayanti was satisfied, and she\r\ncontinued to reside there without anxiety of any kind, for all her wishes\r\nwere duly gratified.'\""

And in the\r\nmidst of that conflagration, he heard the voice of some creature,\r\nrepeatedly crying aloud, 'O righteous Nala, come hither.' And answering,\r\n'Fear not,' he entered into the midst of the fire and beheld a mighty\r\nNaga lying in coils. And the Naga with joined hands, and trembling, spake\r\nunto Nala, saying, 'O king, that I am a snake, Karkotaka by name. I had\r\ndeceived the great Rishi Narada of high ascetic merit, and by him have I\r\nbeen cursed in wrath, O king of men, even in words such as these: 'Stay\r\nthou here like an immobile thing, until one Nala taketh thee hence. And,\r\nindeed, on the spot to which he will carry thee, there shalt thou he\r\nfreed from my curse. It is for that curse of his that I am unable to stir\r\none step. I will instruct thee in respect of thy welfare. It behoveth\r\nthee to deliver me. I will be thy friend. There is no snake equal to me.\r\nI will be light in thy hands. Taking me up, do thou speedily go hence.'\r\nHaving said this, that prince of snakes became as small as the thumb. And\r\ntaking him up, Nala went to a spot free from fire. Having reached an open\r\nspot where there was no fire, Nala intended to drop the serpent, upon\r\nwhich Karkotaka again addressed him, saying, 'O king of the Nishadhas,\r\nproceed thou yet, counting a few steps of thine; meanwhile, O\r\nmighty-armed one, I will do thee great good.' And as Nala began to count\r\nhis steps, the snake bit him at the tenth step. And, lo! As he was bit,\r\nhis form speedily underwent a change. And beholding his change of form,\r\nNala was amazed. And the king saw the snake also assume his own form. And\r\nthe snake Karkotaka, comforting Nala, spake unto him, 'I have deprived\r\nthee of thy beauty, so that people may not recognise thee. And, O Nala,\r\nhe by whom thou hast been deceived and cast into distress, shall dwell in\r\nthee tortured by my venom. And, O monarch, as long as he doth not leave\r\nthee, he will have to dwell in pain in thy body with thee every limb\r\nfilled with my venom. And, O ruler of men I have saved from the hands of\r\nhim who from anger and hate deceived thee, perfectly innocent though thou\r\nart and undeserving of wrong. And, O tiger among men, through my grace,\r\nthou shalt have (no longer) any fear from animals with fangs from\r\nenemies, and from Brahmanas also versed in the Vedas, O king! Nor shalt\r\nthou, O monarch, feel pain on account of my poison. And, O foremost of\r\nkings, thou shalt be ever victorious in battle. This very day, O prince,\r\nO lord of Nishadhas, go to the delightful city of Ayodhya, and present\r\nthyself before Rituparna skilled in gambling, saying, 'I am a charioteer,\r\nVahuka by name.' And that king will give thee his skill in dice for thy\r\nknowledge of horses. Sprung from the line of Ikswaku, and possessed of\r\nprosperity, he will be thy friend. When thou wilt be an adept at dice,\r\nthou shalt then have prosperity. Thou wilt also meet with thy wife and\r\nthy children, and regain thy kingdom. I tell thee this truly. Therefore,\r\nlet not thy mind be occupied by sorrow. And, O lord of men, when thou\r\nshouldst desire to behold thy proper form, thou shouldst remember me, and\r\nwear this garment. Upon wearing this, thou shalt get back thy own form.'\r\nAnd saying this, that Naga then gave unto Nala two pieces of celestial\r\ncloth. And, O son of the Kuru race, having thus instructed Nala, and\r\npresented him with the attire, the king of snakes, O monarch, made\r\nhimself invisible there and then!'\""

And giving them profuse wealth, Bhima\r\nenjoined on them, saying, 'Do ye search for Nala, and also for my\r\ndaughter Damayanti. He who achieveth this task, viz., ascertaining where\r\nthe ruler of the Nishadhas is, bringeth him and my daughter hither, will\r\nobtain from me a thousand kine, and fields, and a village resembling a\r\ntown. Even if failing to bring Damayanti and Nala here, he that succeeds\r\nlearning their whereabouts, will get from me the wealth represented by a\r\nthousand kine.' Thus addressed, the Brahmanas cheerfully went out in all\r\ndirections seeking Nala and his wife in cities and provinces. But Nala or\r\nhis spouse they found not anywhere. Until at length searching in the\r\nbeautiful city of the Chedis, a Brahmana named Sudeva, during the time of\r\nthe king's prayers, saw the princess of Vidarbha in the palace of the\r\nking, seated with Sunanda. And her incomparable beauty was slightly\r\nperceptible, like the brightness of a fire enveloped in curls of smoke.\r\nAnd beholding that lady of large eyes, soiled and emaciated he decided\r\nher to be Damayanti, coming to that conclusion from various reasons. And\r\nSudeva said, 'As I saw her before, this damsel is even so at present. O,\r\nI am blest, by casting my eyes on this fair one, like Sree herself\r\ndelighting the worlds! Resembling the full moon, of unchanging youth, of\r\nwell-rounded breasts, illumining all sides by her splendour, possessed of\r\nlarge eyes like beautiful lotuses, like unto Kama's Rati herself the\r\ndelight of all the worlds like the rays of the full moon, O, she looketh\r\nlike a lotus-stalk transplanted by adverse fortune from the Vidarbha lake\r\nand covered with mire in the process. And oppressed with grief on account\r\nof her husband, and melancholy, she looketh like the night of the full\r\nmoon when Rahu hath swallowed that luminary, or like a stream whose\r\ncurrent hath dried up. Her plight is very much like that of a ravaged\r\nlake with the leaves of its lotuses crushed by the trunks of elephants,\r\nand with its birds and fowls affrighted by the invasion. Indeed, this\r\ngirl, of a delicate frame and of lovely limbs, and deserving to dwell in\r\na mansion decked with gems, is (now) like an uprooted lotus-stalk\r\nscorched by the sun. Endued with beauty and generosity of nature, and\r\ndestitute of ornaments, though deserving of them, she looketh like the\r\nmoon 'new bent in haven' but covered with black clouds. Destitute of\r\ncomforts and luxuries, separated from loved ones and friends, she liveth\r\nin distress, supported by the hope of beholding her lord. Verily, the\r\nhusband is the best ornament of a woman, however destitute of ornaments.\r\nWithout her husband beside her, this lady, though beautiful, shineth not.\r\nIt is a hard feat achieved by Nala in that he liveth without succumbing\r\nto grief, though separated from such a wife. Beholding this damsel\r\npossessed of black hair and of eyes like lotus-leaves, in woe though\r\ndeserving of bliss, even my heart is pained. Alas! when shall this girl\r\ngraced with auspicious marks and devoted to her husband, crossing this\r\nocean of woe, regain the company of her lord, like Rohini regaining the\r\nMoon's? Surely, the king of the Nishadhas will experience in regaining\r\nher the delight that a king deprived of his kingdom experienceth in\r\nregaining his kingdom. Equal to her in nature and age and extraction,\r\nNala deserveth the daughter of Vidarbha, and this damsel of black eyes\r\nalso deserveth him. It behoveth me to comfort the queen of that hero of\r\nimmeasurable prowess and endued with energy and might, (since) she is so\r\neager to meet her husband. I will console this afflicted girl of face\r\nlike the full moon, and suffering distress that she had never before\r\nendured, and ever meditating on her lord.'\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Having thus reflected on these various\r\ncircumstances and signs, the Brahmana, Sudeva, approached Damayanti, and\r\naddressed her, saying, 'O princess of Vidarbha, I am Sudeva, the dear\r\nfriend of thy brother. I have come here, seeking thee, at the desire of\r\nking Bhima. Thy father is well, and also thy mother, and thy brothers.\r\nAnd thy son and daughter, blessed with length of days, are living in\r\npeace. Thy relatives, though alive, are almost dead on thy account, and\r\nhundreds of Brahmanas are ranging the world in search of thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'O Yudhishthira, Damayanti recognising Sudeva,\r\nasked him respecting all her relatives and kinsmen one after another.\r\nAnd, O monarch, oppressed with grief, the princess of Vidarbha began to\r\nweep bitterly, at the unexpected sight of Sudeva, that foremost of\r\nBrahmanas and the friend of her brother. And, O Bharata, beholding\r\nDamayanti weeping, and conversing in private with Sudeva, Sunanda was\r\ndistressed, and going to her mother informed her, saying, 'Sairindhri is\r\nweeping bitterly in the presence of a Brahmana. If thou likest, satisfy\r\nthyself.' And thereupon the mother of the king of the Chedis, issuing\r\nfrom the inner apartments of the palace, came to the place where the girl\r\n(Damayanti) was with that Brahmana. Then calling Sudeva, O king, the\r\nqueen-mother asked him, 'Whose wife is this fair one, and whose daughter?\r\nHow hath this lady of beautiful eyes been deprived of the company of her\r\nrelatives and of her husband as well? And how also hast thou come to know\r\nthis lady fallen into such a plight? I wish to hear all this in detail\r\nfrom thee. Do truly relate unto me who am asking thee about this damsel\r\nof celestial beauty.' Then, O king, thus addressed by the queen-mother,\r\nSudeva, that best of Brahmanas, sat at his ease, and began to relate the\r\ntrue history of Damayanti.'\""

And there is a king ruling the Nishadhas,\r\nnamed Nala, the son of Virasena. This blessed lady is the wife of that\r\nwise and righteous monarch. Defeated at dice by his brother, and\r\ndespoiled of his kingdom, that king, accompanied by Damayanti, went away\r\nwithout the knowledge of any one. We have been wandering over the whole\r\nearth in search of Damayanti. And that girl is at last found in the house\r\nof thy son. No woman existeth that is her rival in beauty. Between the\r\neye-brows of this ever-youthful damsel, there is an excellent mole from\r\nbirth, resembling a lotus. Noticed by us (before) it seems to have\r\ndisappeared, covered, (as her forehead is) with (a coat of) dust even\r\nlike the moon hid in clouds. Placed there by the Creator himself as an\r\nindication of prosperity and wealth, that mole is visible faintly, like\r\nthe cloud-covered lunar crescent of the first day of the lighted\r\nfortnight. And covered as her body is with dust, her beauty hath not\r\ndisappeared. Though careless of her person, it is still manifest, and\r\nshineth like gold. And this girl--goddess-like--capable of being\r\nidentified by this form of hers and that mole, hath been discovered by me\r\nas one discovereth a fire that is covered, by its heat!'\r\n\r\n\"O king, hearing these words of Sudeva, Sunanda washed the dust that\r\ncovered the mole between Damayanti's eye-brows. And thereupon it became\r\nvisible like the moon in the sky, just emerged from the clouds. And\r\nseeing that mole, O Bharata, Sunanda and the queen-mother began to weep,\r\nand embracing Damayanti stood silent for a while. And the queen-mother,\r\nshedding tears as she spoke, said in gentle accents, 'By this thy mole, I\r\nfind that thou art the daughter of my sister. O beauteous girl, thy\r\nmother and I are both daughters of the high-souled Sudaman, the ruler of\r\nthe Dasarnas. She was bestowed upon king Bhima, and I on Viravahu. I\r\nwitnessed thy birth at our father's palace in the country of the\r\nDasarnas. O beautiful one, my house is to thee even as thy father's. And\r\nthis wealth, O Damayanti, is thine as much as mine.' As this, O king,\r\nDamayanti bowing down to her mother's sister with a glad heart, spake\r\nunto her these words, 'Unrecognised, I have still lived happily with\r\nthee, every want of mine satisfied and myself cared for by thee. And\r\nhappy as my stay hath been, it would, without doubt, be happier still.\r\nBut, mother, I have long been an exile. It behoveth thee, therefore, to\r\ngrant me permission (to depart). My son and daughter, sent to my father's\r\npalace, are living there. Deprived of their father, and of their mother\r\nalso, how are they passing their days stricken with sorrow. If thou\r\nwishest to do what is agreeable to me, do thou without loss of time,\r\norder a vehicle, for I wish to go to the Vidarbhas.' At this, O king, the\r\nsister to (Damayanti's) mother, with a glad heart, said, 'So be it'. And\r\nthe queen-mother with her son's permission, O chief of the Bharatas, sent\r\nDamayanti in handsome litter carried by men, protected by a large escort\r\nand provided with food and drink and garments of the first quality. And\r\nsoon enough she reached the country of the Vidarbhas. And all her\r\nrelatives, rejoicing (in her arrival) received her with respect. And\r\nseeing her relatives, her children, both her parents, and all her maids,\r\nto be well, the illustrious Damayanti, O king, worshipped the gods and\r\nBrahmanas according to the superior method. And the king rejoiced at\r\nbeholding his daughter gave unto Sudeva a thousand kine and much wealth\r\nand a village. And, O king, having spent that night at her father's\r\nmansion and recovered from fatigue, Damayanti addressed her mother,\r\nsaying, 'O mother, if thou wishest me to live, I tell thee truly, do thou\r\nendeavour to bring Nala, that hero among men.' Thus addressed by\r\nDamayanti, the venerable queen became filled with sorrow. And bathed in\r\ntears, she was unable to give any answer. And beholding her in that\r\nplight, all the inmates of the inner apartments broke out into\r\nexclamation of 'Oh!' And 'Alas'! and began to cry bitterly. And then the\r\nqueen addressed the mighty monarch Bhima, saying, 'Thy daughter Damayanti\r\nmourneth on account of her husband. Nay, banishing away all bashfulness,\r\nshe hath herself, O king, declared her mind to me. Let thy men strive to\r\nfind out (Nala) the righteous.' Thus informed by her the king sent the\r\nBrahmanas under him in all directions, saying, 'Exert ye to discover\r\nNala.' And those Brahmanas, commanded by the ruler of the Vidarbhas (to\r\nseek Nala) appeared before Damayanti and told her of the journey they\r\nwere about to undertake. And Bhima's daughter spake unto them saying, 'Do\r\nye cry in every realm and in every assembly, 'O beloved gambler, where\r\nhast thou gone cutting off half of my garment, and deserting the dear and\r\ndevoted wife asleep in the forest? And that girl, as commanded by thee\r\nstayeth expecting thee, clad in half a piece of cloth and burning with\r\ngrief! O king, O hero, relent towards, and answer, her who incessantly\r\nweepeth for that grief. This and more ye will say, so that he may be\r\ninclined to pity me. Assisted by the wind, fire consumeth the forest.\r\n(Further, ye will say that) the wife is always to be protected and\r\nmaintained by the husband. Why then, good as thou art and acquainted with\r\nevery duty, hast thou neglected both the duties? Possessed of fame and\r\nwisdom, and lineage, and kindness, why hast thou be unkind? I fear, this\r\nis owing to the loss of my good luck! Therefore, O tiger among men, have\r\npity on me. O bull among men! I have heard it from thee that kindness is\r\nthe highest virtue. Speaking so, if anybody answereth you, that person\r\nshould by all means, be known, and ye should learn who he is, and where\r\nhe dwelleth. And ye foremost of regenerate ones, do ye bring me the words\r\nof him who hearing this your speech will chance to answer. Ye should also\r\nact with such care that no one may know the words ye utter to be at my\r\ncommand, nor that ye will come back to me. And ye should also learn\r\nwhether that answers is wealthy, or poor, or destitute of power, in fact\r\nall about him.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus instructed by Damayanti, O king, the Brahmanas set out in all\r\ndirections in search of Nala overtaken with such disaster. And the\r\nBrahmanas, O king, searched for him in cities and kingdoms and villages,\r\nand retreats of ascetics, and places inhabited by cow-herds.

And Vahuka is the\r\ncharioteer of that king, of unsightly appearance and possessed of short\r\narms. And he is skillful in driving with speed, and well acquainted with\r\nthe culinary art. And sighing frequently, and weeping again and again, he\r\ninquired about my welfare and afterwards said these words, 'Chaste women,\r\nalthough fallen into distress, yet protect themselves and thus certainly\r\nsecure heaven. Although they may be deserted by their lords, they do not\r\nyet become angry on that account, for women that are chaste lead their\r\nlives, encased in the armour of virtuous behaviour. It behoveth her not\r\nto be angry, since he that deserted her was overwhelmed with calamity,\r\nand deprived of every bliss. A beauteous and virtuous woman should not be\r\nangry with one that was deprived by birds of his garment while striving\r\nto procure sustenance and who is being consumed with grief. Whether\r\ntreated well or ill, such a wife should never indulge in ire, beholding\r\nher husband in that plight, despoiled of kingdom and destitute of\r\nprosperity, oppressed with hunger and overwhelmed with calamity.' Hearing\r\nthese words of his, I have speedily come here. Thou hast now heard all.\r\nDo what thou thinkest proper, and inform the king of it.'\r\n\r\n\"O king, having heard these words of Parnada, Damayanti with tearful eyes\r\ncame to her mother, and spake unto her in private, 'O mother, king Bhima\r\nshould not, by any means, be made acquainted with my purpose. In thy\r\npresence will I employ that best of Brahmanas, Sudeva! If thou desirest\r\nmy welfare, act in such a way that king Bhima may not know my purpose.\r\nLet Sudeva without delay go hence to the city of Ayodhya, for the purpose\r\nof bringing Nala, O mother, having performed the same auspicious rites by\r\nvirtue of which he had speedily brought me into the midst of friends.'\r\nWith these words, after Parnada had recovered from fatigue, the princess\r\nof Vidarbha worshipped him with profuse wealth and also said, 'When Nala\r\nwill come here, O Brahmana, I will bestow on thee wealth in abundance\r\nagain. Thou hast done me the immense service which none else, indeed, can\r\ndo me, for, (owing to that service of thine), O thou best of the\r\nregenerate ones, I shall speedily regain my (lost) lord.' And thus\r\naddressed by Damayanti, that high-minded Brahmana comforted her, uttering\r\nbenedictory words of auspicious import, and then went home, regarding his\r\nmission to have been successful. And after he had gone away, Damayanti\r\noppressed with grief and distress, calling Sudeva, addressed him, O\r\nYudhishthira, in the presence of her mother, saying, 'O Sudeva, go thou\r\nto the city of Ayodhya, straight as a bird, and tell king Rituparna\r\nliving there, these words: 'Bhima's daughter, Damayanti will hold another\r\nSwayamvara.

Tomorrow,\r\nafter the sun hath risen, she will choose a second husband, as she doth\r\nnot know whether the heroic Nala liveth or not. And addressed by her, O\r\nmonarch thus, Sudeva set out.

And repeatedly urged by\r\nRituparna to make haste, Vahuka after much scrutiny and careful\r\ndeliberation, selected some steeds that were lean-fleshed, yet strong and\r\ncapable of a long journey and endued with energy and strength of high\r\nbreed and docility, free from inauspicious marks, with wide nostrils and\r\nswelling cheeks, free from faults as regards the ten hairy curls, born in\r\n(the country of) Sindhu, and fleet as the winds. And seeing those horses,\r\nthe king said somewhat angrily, 'What is this, that thou wishest to do?\r\nThou shouldst not jest with us. How can these horses of mine, weak in\r\nstrength and breath, carry us? And how shall we be able to go this long\r\nway by help of these?' Vahuka replied, 'Each of these horses bears one\r\ncurl on his forehead, two on his temples, four on his sides, four on his\r\nchest, and one on his back. Without doubt, these steeds will be able to\r\ngo to the country of the Vidarbhas. If, O king, thou thinkest of choosing\r\nothers, point them out and I shall yoke them for thee.' Rituparna\r\nrejoined, 'O Vahuka, thou art versed in the science of horses and art\r\nalso skillful (in guiding them). Do thou speedily yoke those that thou\r\nthinkest to be able.' Thereupon the skillful Nala yoked upon the car four\r\nexcellent steeds of good breed that were, besides, docile and fleet. And\r\nafter the steeds had been yoked, the king without loss of time mounted\r\nupon the car, when those best of horses fell down upon the ground on\r\ntheir knees. Then, O king, that foremost of men, the blessed king Nala\r\nbegan to soothe horses endued with energy and strength. And raising them\r\nup with the reins and making the charioteer Varshneya sit on the car, he\r\nprepared to set out with great speed. And those best of steeds, duly\r\nurged by Vahuka, rose to the sky, confounding the occupant of the\r\nvehicle. And beholding those steeds gifted with the speed of the wind\r\nthus drawing the car, the blessed king of Ayodhaya was exceedingly\r\namazed. And noticing the rattle of the car and also the management of the\r\nsteeds, Varshneya reflected upon Vahuka's skill in guiding horses. And he\r\nthought, 'Is he Matali, the charioteer of the king of the celestials? I\r\nfind the same magnificent indications in the heroic Vahuka. Or, hath\r\nSalihotra versed in the science of horses taken this human shape so\r\nbeautiful? Or, is it king Nala the reducer of hostile towns that hath\r\ncome here? Or, it may be that this Vahuka knoweth the science that Nala\r\nknoweth, for I perceive that the knowledge of Vahuka is equal to that of\r\nNala. Further, Vahuka and Nala are of the same age. This one, again, may\r\nnot be Nala of high prowess, but somebody of equal knowledge. Illustrious\r\npersons, however, walk this earth in disguise in consequence of\r\nmisfortune, or agreeably to the ordinance of the scriptures. That this\r\nperson is of unsightly appearance need not change my opinion; for Nala, I\r\nthink, may even be despoiled of his personal features. In respect of age\r\nthis one equals Nala. There is difference, however, in personal\r\nappearance. Vahuka, again is endued with every accomplishment. I think,\r\ntherefore, he is Nala.' Having thus reasoned long in his mind, O mighty\r\nmonarch, Varshneya, the (former) charioteer of the righteous Nala, became\r\nabsorbed in thought. And that foremost of kings Rituparna, also,\r\nbeholding the skill of Vahuka in equestrian science experienced great\r\ndelight, along with his charioteer Varshneya. And thinking of Vahuka's\r\napplication and ardour and the manner of his holding the reins, the king\r\nfelt exceedingly glad.'\""

And while the car was\r\ncoursing thus, that conqueror of hostile cities, the royal son of\r\nBhangasura, saw his upper garment drop down on the ground. And at soon as\r\nhis garment had dropped down the high-minded monarch, without loss of\r\ntime, told Nala, 'I intend to recover it. O thou of profound\r\nintelligence, retain these steeds endued with exceeding swiftness until\r\nVarshneya bringeth back my garment.' Thereupon Nala replied unto him,\r\n'The sheet is dropped down far away. We have travelled one yojana thence.\r\nTherefore, it is incapable of being recovered.' After Nala had addressed\r\nhim thus, O king, the royal son of Bhangasura came upon a Vibhitaka tree\r\nwith fruits in a forest. And seeing that tree, the king hastily said to\r\nVahuka, 'O charioteer, do thou also behold my high proficiency in\r\ncalculation. All men do not know everything. There is no one that is\r\nversed in every science of art. Knowledge in its entirety is not found in\r\nany one person, O Vahuka, the leaves and fruits of this tree that are\r\nlying on the ground respectively exceed those that are on it by one\r\nhundred and one. The two branches of the tree have fifty millions of\r\nleaves, and two thousand and ninety five fruits. Do thou examine these\r\ntwo branches and all their boughs.' Thereupon staying the car Vahuka\r\naddressed the king, saying, 'O crusher of foes, thou takest credit to\r\nthyself in a matter which is beyond my perception. But, O monarch, I will\r\nascertain it by the direct evidence of my senses, by cutting down the\r\nVibhitaka. O king, when I actually count, it will no longer be matter of\r\nspeculation. Therefore, in thy presence, O monarch, I will hew down this\r\nVibhitaka. I do not know whether it be not (as thou hast said). In thy\r\npresence, O ruler of men, I will count the fruits and leaves. Let\r\nVarshneya hold the reins of the horses for a while.' Unto the charioteer\r\nthe king replied, 'There is no time to lose.' But Vahuka answered with\r\nhumility, 'Stay thou a short space, or, if thou art in a hurry, go then,\r\nmaking Varshneya thy charioteer. The road lies direct and even.' And at\r\nthis, O son of the Kuru race, soothing Vahuka, Rituparna said, 'O Vahuka,\r\nthou art the only charioteer, there is none other in this world. And, O\r\nthou versed in horse lore, it is through thy help that I expect to go to\r\nthe Vidarbhas. I place myself in thy hands. It behoveth thee not to cause\r\nany obstacle. And, O Vahuka, whatever thy wish. I will grant it if taking\r\nme to the country of the Vidarbhas to-day, thou makest me see the sun\r\nrise.' At this, Vahuka answered him, saying, 'After having counted (the\r\nleaves and fruits of the) Vibhitaka, I shall proceed to Vidarbha, do thou\r\nagree to my words. Then the king reluctantly told him, 'Count. And on\r\ncounting the leaves and fruits of a portion of this branch, thou wilt be\r\nsatisfied of the truth of my assertion.' And thereupon Vahuka speedily\r\nalighted from the car, and felled that tree. And struck with amazement\r\nupon finding the fruits, after calculation, to be what the king had said,\r\nhe addressed the king, saying, 'O monarch, this thy power is wonderful. I\r\ndesire, O prince, to know the art by which thou hast ascertained all\r\nthis.' And at this king, intent upon proceeding speedily, said unto\r\nVahuka. 'Know that I am proficient at dice besides being versed in\r\nnumbers. And Vahuka said unto him, 'Impart unto me this knowledge and, O\r\nbull among men, take from me my knowledge of horses.' And king Rituparna,\r\nhaving regard to the importance of the act that depended upon Vahuka's\r\ngood-will, and tempted also by the horse-lore (that his charioteer\r\npossessed), said, 'So be it.' As solicited by thee, receive this science\r\nof dice from me, and, O Vahuka, let my equine science remain with thee in\r\ntrust.' And saying this, Rituparna imparted unto Nala the science (he\r\ndesired). And Nala upon becoming acquainted with the science of dice,\r\nKali came out of his body, incessantly vomiting from his mouth the\r\nvirulent poison of Karkotaka.\r\n\r\nAnd when Kali, afflicted (by Damayanti's curse) came out (of Nala's\r\nbody), the fire of that curse also left Kali. Indeed, long had been the\r\ntime for which the king had been afflicted by Kali, as if he were of\r\nunregenerate soul. And Kala the ruler of the Nishadhas, in wrath, was\r\nbent upon cursing Kali, when the latter, frightened, and trembling, said\r\nwith joined hands, 'Control thy wrath, O king! I will render thee\r\nillustrious. Indrasena's mother had formerly cursed me in anger when she\r\nhad been deserted by thee. Ever since that time undergoing sore\r\naffliction I resided in thee, O mighty monarch, O unconquered one,\r\nmiserably and burning night and day with the venom of the prince of\r\nsnakes. I seek thy protection. If thou dost not curse me who am\r\naffrighted and seek thy protection, then those men that will attentively\r\nrecite thy history, shall be even free from fear on my account.' And thus\r\naddressed by Kali, king Nala controlled his wrath. And thereupon the\r\nfrightened Kali speedily entered into the Vibhitaka tree. And while the\r\nKali was conversing with Naishadha, he was invisible to others. And\r\ndelivered from his afflictions, and having counted the fruits of that\r\ntree, the king, filled with great joy and of high energy, mounted on the\r\ncar and proceeded with energy, urging those fleet horses. And from the\r\ntouch of Kali the Vibhitaka tree from that hour fell into disrepute. And\r\nNala, with a glad heart, began to urge those foremost of steeds which\r\nsprang into the air once and again like creatures endued with wings. And\r\nthe illustrious monarch drove (the car) in the direction of the\r\nVidarbhas. And after Nala had gone far away, Kali also returned to his\r\nabode. And abandoned by Kali, O king, that lord of earth, the royal Nala,\r\nbecame freed from calamity though he did not assume his native form.'\""

And at the\r\ninvitation of Bhima, the king (of Ayodhya) entered the city of Kundina,\r\nfilling with the rattle of his car all the ten points, direct and\r\ntransverse, of the horizon. And the steeds of Nala that were in that city\r\nheard that sound, and hearing it they became delighted as they used to be\r\nin the presence of Nala himself. And Damayanti also heard the sound of\r\nthat car driven by Nala, like the deep roar of the clouds in the rainy\r\nseason. And Bhima and the steeds (of Nala) regarded the clatter of that\r\ncar to be like that which they used to hear in days of yore when king\r\nNala himself urged his own steeds. And the peacocks on the terraces, and\r\nthe elephants in the stables, and the horses also, all heard the rattle\r\nof Rituparna's car. And hearing the sound, so like the roar of the\r\nclouds, the elephants and the peacocks, O king, began to utter their\r\ncries, facing that direction, and filled with delight such as they\r\nexperience when they hear the actual roar of the clouds. And Damayanti\r\nsaid, 'Because the rattle of his car filling the whole earth, gladdens my\r\nheart, it must be King Nala (that has come). If I do not see Nala, of\r\nface bright as the moon, that hero with countless virtues, I shall\r\ncertainly die. If I am not clasped today in that hero's thrilling\r\nembrace, I shall certainly cease to be. If Naishadha with voice deep as\r\nthat of the clouds doth not come to me today, I shall enter into a pyre\r\nof golden brilliance. If that foremost of kings, powerful as a lion and\r\ngifted with the strength of an infuriated elephant, doth not present\r\nhimself before me, I shall certainly cease to live. I do not remember a\r\nsingle untruth in him, or a single wrong done by him to others. Never\r\nhath he spoken an untruth even in jest. Oh, my Nala is exalted and\r\nforgiving and heroic and magnificent and superior to all other kings, and\r\nfaithful to his marriage vow and like unto a eunuch in respect of other\r\nfemales. Night and day dwelling upon his perceptions, my heart, in\r\nabsence of that dear one, is about to burst in grief.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus bewailing as if devoid of sense, Damayanti, O Bharata, ascended the\r\nterrace (of her mansion) with the desire of seeing the righteous Nala.\r\nAnd in the yard of the central mansion she beheld king Rituparna on the\r\ncar with Varshneya and Vahuka. And Varshneya and Vahuka, descending for\r\nthat excellent vehicle, unyoked the steeds, and kept the vehicle itself\r\nin a proper place. And king Rituparna also, descending from the car,\r\npresented himself before king Bhima possessed of terrible prowess. And\r\nBhima received him with great respect, for in the absence of a proper\r\noccasion, a great person cannot be had (as a guest). And honoured by\r\nBhima, king Rituparna looked about him again and again, but saw no traces\r\nof the Swayamvara. And the ruler of the Vidarbhas, O Bharata, approaching\r\nRituparna, said, 'Welcome! What is the occasion of this thy visit?' And\r\nking Bhima asked this without knowing that Rituparna had come to obtain\r\nthe hand of his daughter. And king Rituparna, of unbaffled prowess and\r\ngifted with intelligence, saw that there were no other kings or princes.\r\nNor did he hear any talk relating to the Swayamvara, nor saw any\r\nconcourse of Brahmanas. And at this, the king of Kosala reflected a while\r\nand at length said, 'I have come here to pay my respects to thee.' And\r\nthe king Bhima was struck with astonishment, and reflected upon the\r\n(probable) cause of Rituparna's coming, having passed over a hundred\r\nyojanas. And he reflected, 'That passing by other sovereigns, and leaving\r\nbehind him innumerable countries, he should come simply to pay his\r\nrespect to me is scarcely the reason of his arrival. What he assigneth to\r\nbe the cause of his coming appeareth to be a trifle. However, I shall\r\nlearn the true reason in the future.' And although king Bhima thought so,\r\nhe did not dismiss Rituparna summarily, but said unto him again and\r\nagain, 'Rest, thou art weary.' And honoured thus by the pleased Bhima,\r\nking Rituparna was satisfied, and with a delighted heart, he went to his\r\nappointed quarters followed by the servants of the royal household.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'And, O king, after Rituparna had gone away with\r\nVarshneya, Vahuka took the car to the stables. And there freeing the\r\nsteeds, and tending them according to rule, and soothing them himself,\r\nsat down on a side of the car. Meanwhile, the princess of Vidharva,\r\nDamayanti, afflicted with grief, having beheld the royal son of\r\nBhangasura, and Varshneya of the Suta race, and also Vahuka in that\r\nguise, asked herself, 'Whose is this car-rattle? It was loud as that of\r\nNala, but I do not see the ruler of the Nishadhas. Certainly, Varshneya\r\nhath learnt the art from Nala, and it is for this the rattle of the car\r\ndriven by him hath been even like that of Nala. Or, is Rituparna equally\r\nskilled with Nala so that the rattle of his car seemeth to be like that\r\nof Nala?'

O blessed one,\r\nO faultless one, approaching him, cautiously and with suit words, make\r\nthou the usual inquiries of courtesy and learn all particulars truly.\r\nHaving regard to the feeling of satisfaction my mind experienceth, and\r\nthe delight my heart feeleth, I am greatly afraid this one is king Nala\r\nhimself. And, O faultless one, having inquired after his welfare, thou\r\nshalt speak unto him the words of Parnada. And, O beauteous one,\r\nunderstand the reply he may make thereto.' Thus instructed, that female\r\nmessenger, going cautiously, while the blessed Damayanti watched from the\r\nterrace, addressed Vahuka in these words, 'O foremost of men, thou art\r\nwelcome. I wish thee happiness. O bull among men, hear now the words of\r\nDamayanti. When did ye all set out, and with what object have ye come\r\nhither. Tell us truly, for the princess of Vidarbha wisheth to hear it.'\r\nThus addressed, Vahuka answered, the illustrious king of Kosala had heard\r\nfrom a Brahmana that a second Swayamvara of Damayanti would take place.\r\nAnd hearing it, he hath come here, by the help of excellent steeds fleet\r\nas the wind and capable of going a hundred yojanas. I am his charioteer.\r\nKesini then asked, 'Whence doth the third among you come, and whose (son)\r\nis he? And whose son art thou, and how hast thou come to do this work?'\r\nThus questioned, Vahuka replied, 'He (of whom thou inquirest) was the\r\ncharioteer of the virtuous Nala, and known to all by the name of\r\nVarshneya. After Nala had, O beauteous one, left his kingdom, he came to\r\nthe son of Bhangasura. I am skilled in horse-lore, and have, therefore,\r\nbeen appointed as charioteer. Indeed, king Rituparna hath himself chosen\r\nme as his charioteer and cook.' At this Kesini rejoined, 'Perhaps\r\nVarshneya knoweth where king Nala hath gone, and O Vahuka, he may also\r\nhave spoken to thee (about his master).' Vahuka then said, 'Having\r\nbrought hither the children of Nala of excellent deeds, Varshneya went\r\naway whither he listed: He doth not know where Naishadha is. Nor, O\r\nillustrious one, doth anybody else know of Nala's whereabouts; for the\r\nking (in calamity) wandereth over the world in disguise and despoiled of\r\n(his native) beauty. Nala's self only knoweth Nala. Nala never\r\ndiscovereth his marks of identity anywhere.' Thus addressed, Kesini\r\nreturned, 'The Brahmana that had before this gone to Ayodhya, had\r\nrepeatedly said these words suitable to female lips, 'O beloved gambler,\r\nwhere hast thou gone cutting off half my piece of cloth, and deserting\r\nme, his dear and devoted wife asleep in the woods? And she herself, as\r\ncommanded by him, waiteth expecting him clad in half a garment and\r\nburning day and night in grief. O king, O hero, do thou relent towards\r\nher that weepeth ceaselessly for that calamity and do thou give her an\r\nanswer. O illustrious one, do thou speak the words agreeable to her for\r\nthe blameless one panteth to hear them. Hearing these words of the\r\nBrahmana thou didst formerly give a reply! The princess of Vidarbha again\r\nwisheth to hear the words thou didst then say.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'O son of the Kuru race, hearing these words of\r\nKesini, Nala's heart was pained, and his eyes filled with tears. And\r\nrepressing his sorrow, the king who was burning in grief, said again\r\nthese words, in accents choked with tears: 'Chaste women, though\r\novertaken by calamity, yet protect themselves, and thereby secure heaven.\r\nWomen that are chaste, deserted by their lords, never become angry, but\r\ncontinue to live, cased in virtue's mail. Deserted by one fallen into\r\ncalamity, bereft of sense, and despoiled of bliss, it behoveth her not to\r\nbe angry. A virtuous lady should not be angry with one that was deprived\r\nby birds of his garment while striving to procure sustenance and who is\r\nburning in misery. Whether treated well or ill she would never be angry,\r\nseeing her husband in that plight, despoiled of his kingdom, bereft of\r\nprosperity, oppressed with hunger, and overwhelmed with calamity.' And, O\r\nBharata, while speaking thus, Nala oppressed with grief, could not\r\nrestrain his tears, but began to weep.

Thus commanded, Kesini, ever bent on doing what was agreeable\r\nto Damayanti, went to Vahuka, and taking some hot meat came back without\r\nloss of time.

Who, except the virtuous Nala, could go\r\naway, deserting in the woods, his dear and unoffending wife overcome with\r\nfatigue?

Before the fire, and\r\nin presence also of the celestials, he had taken my hand, vowing, 'Verily\r\nI will be thine.' Oh, where was that vow when he deserted me. O represser\r\nof foes.' While Damayanti was saying all this, tears of sorrow began to\r\nflow plentifully from her eyes. And beholding her thus afflicted with\r\ngrief, Nala also, shedding tears, black of those of the gazelle with\r\nextremities of reddish hue, said, 'O timid one, neither the loss of my\r\nkingdom nor my desertion of thee was my act. Both were due to Kali. And,\r\nO foremost of virtuous women, lamenting for me day and night, and\r\novercome with sorrow, thou hadst in the woods cursed Kali, and so he\r\nbegan to dwell in my body, burning in consequence of thy curse. Indeed\r\nburning with thy curse, he lived within me like fire within fire. O\r\nblessed girl, that our sorrows might terminate, that wretch have I\r\novercome by my observances and austerities. The sinful wretch hath\r\nalready left me, and it is for this that I have come hither. My presence\r\nhere, O fair lady, is for thy sake. I have no other object. But, O timid\r\none, can any other woman, forsaking her loving and devoted husband, ever\r\nchoose a second lord like thee? At the command of the king, messengers\r\nare ranging this entire earth, saying, 'Bhima's daughter will, of her own\r\naccord, choose a second husband worthy of her.' Immediately on hearing\r\nthis, the son of Bhangasura hath arrived here.' Hearing these\r\nlamentations of Nala, Damayanti, frightened and trembling, said with\r\njoined hand, 'It behoveth thee not, O blessed one, to suspect any fault\r\nin me. O ruler of the Nishadhas, passing over the celestials themselves,\r\nI choose thee as my lord. It was to bring thee hither that the Brahmanas\r\nhad gone out in all directions, even to all the sides of the horizon,\r\nsinging my words, in the form of ballads. At last, O king, a learned\r\nBrahmana named Parnada had found thee in Kosala in the palace of\r\nRituparna. When thou hadst returned a fit answer to those words of his,\r\nit was then, O Naishadha, that I devised this scheme to recover thee.\r\nExcept thee, O lord of earth, there is no one in this world, who in one\r\nday can clear, O King, a hundred yojanas with horses. O monarch, touching\r\nthy feet I can swear truly that I have not, even in thought, committed\r\nany sin. May the all-witnessing Air that courseth through this world,\r\ntake my life, if I have committed any sin. May the Sun that ever courseth\r\nthrough the sky take my life, if I have committed any sin. May the Moon,\r\nthat dwelleth within every creature as a witness, take my life, if I have\r\ncommitted any sin. Let the three gods that sustain the triple worlds in\r\ntheir entirety, declare truly, or let them forsake me today.' And thus\r\naddressed by her, the Wind-god said from the sky, 'O Nala, I tell thee\r\ntruly that she hath done no wrong. O king, Damayanti, well guarding the\r\nhonour of thy family, hath enhanced it. Of this we are the witnesses, as\r\nwe have been her protectors for these three years. It is for thy sky that\r\nshe hath devised this unrivalled scheme, for, except thee, none on earth\r\nis capable of travelling in a single day a hundred yojanas. O monarch,\r\nthou hast obtained Bhima's daughter, and she hath also obtained thee.\r\nThou needst not entertain any suspicion but be united with thy partner.'\r\nAnd after the Wind-god had said this, a floral shower fell there and the\r\ncelestial kettle-drum began to play, and auspicious breezes began to\r\nblow. And beholding those wonders, O Bharata, king Nala, the represser of\r\nfoes, cast away all his doubts in respect of Damayanti. And then that\r\nlord of earth, remembering the king of serpents, wore that pure garment\r\nand regained his native form. And beholding her righteous lord in his own\r\nform, Bhima's daughter of faultless limbs embraced him, and began to weep\r\naloud. And king Nala also embraced Bhima's daughter devoted to him, as\r\nbefore, and also his children, and experienced great delight. And burying\r\nher face in his bosom, the beauteous Damayanti of large eyes began to\r\nsigh heavily, remembering her griefs. And overwhelmed with sorrow, that\r\ntiger among men stood for some time, clasping the dust-covered Damayanti\r\nof sweet smiles. And, O king, the queen-mother then, with a glad heart,\r\ntold Bhima all that had passed between Nala and Damayanti. And the mighty\r\nmonarch answered, 'Let Nala pass this day in peace, to-morrow I shall see\r\nhim after his bath and prayers, with Damayanti by his side.' And, O king,\r\nthey passed that night pleasantly, in relating to each other the past\r\nincidents of their life in the forest. And with hearts filled with joy,\r\nthe princess of Vidarbha and Nala began to pass their days in the palace\r\nof king Bhima, intent upon making each other happy. And it was in the\r\nfourth year (after the loss of his kingdom) that Nala was re-united with\r\nhis wife, and all his desires gratified, once more experienced the\r\nhighest bliss. And Damayanti rejoiced exceedingly in having recovered her\r\nlord even as fields of tender plants on receiving a shower. And Bhima's\r\ndaughter, thus recovering her lord, obtained her wish, and blazed forth\r\nin beauty, her weariness gone, her anxieties dispelled and herself\r\nswelling with joy, ever like a night that is lit by the bright disc of\r\nthe moon!\""

And Nala saluted his father-in-law with becoming\r\nhumility and after him the fair Damayanti paid her respects to her\r\nfather. And the exalted Bhima, with great joy, received him as a son, and\r\nhonouring him duly along with his devoted wife, comforted them in proper\r\nwords. And duly accepting the homage rendered unto him, king Nala offered\r\nhis father-in-law his services as became him. And seeing Nala arrived,\r\nthe citizens were in great joy. And there arose in the city a loud uproar\r\nof delight. And the citizens decorated the city with flags and standards\r\nand garlands of flowers. And the streets were watered and decked in\r\nfloral wreaths and other ornaments. And at their gates citizens piled\r\nflowers, and their temples and shrines were all adorned with flowers. And\r\nRituparna heard that Vahuka had already been united with Damayanti. And\r\nthe king was glad to hear of all this. And calling unto him king Nala, he\r\nasked his forgiveness. And the intelligent Nala also asked Rituparna's\r\nforgiveness, showing diverse reasons. And that foremost of speakers\r\nversed in the truth, king Rituparna, after being thus honoured by Nala,\r\nsaid, with a countenance expressive of wonder, these words unto the ruler\r\nof the Nishadhas. 'By good fortune it is that regaining the company of\r\nthy own wife, thou hast obtained happiness. O Naishadha, while dwelling\r\nin disguise at my house, I hope I did not wrong thee in any way, O lord\r\nof the earth! If knowingly I have done thee any wrong, it behoveth thee\r\nto forgive me.' Hearing this, Nala replied, 'Thou hast not, O monarch,\r\ndone me ever so little an injury. And if thou hast, it hath not awakened\r\nmy ire, for surely thou shouldst be forgiven by me. Thou wert formerly my\r\nfriend, and, O ruler of men, thou art also related to me. Henceforth I\r\nshall find greater delight in thee. O king, with all my desires\r\ngratified, I lived happily in thy abode, in fact more happily there than\r\nin my own house. This thy horse-lore is in my keeping. If thou wishest, O\r\nking, I will make it over to thee.' Saying this, Naishadha gave unto\r\nRituparna that science and the latter took it with the ordained rites.\r\nAnd, O monarch, the royal son of Bhangasura, having obtained the\r\nmysteries of equestrian science and having given unto the ruler of the\r\nNaishadhas the mysteries of dice, went to his own city, employing another\r\nperson for his charioteer.

With a single car white in hue, sixteen elephants, fifty\r\nhorses, and six hundred infantry, that illustrious king, causing the\r\nearth itself to tremble, entered (the country of the Nishadhas) without\r\nloss of a moment and swelling with rage. And the mighty son of Virasena,\r\napproaching his brothers Pushkara said unto him, 'We will play again, for\r\nI have earned vast wealth. Let Damayanti and all else that I have be my\r\nstake, let, O Pushkara, thy kingdom be thy stake. Let the play begin\r\nagain. This is my certain determination. Blessed be thou, let us stake\r\nall we have along with our lives. Having won over and acquired another's\r\nwealth or kingdom, it is a high duty, says the ordinance, to stake it\r\nwhen the owner demands. Or, if thou dost not relish play with dice, let\r\nthe play with weapons begin. O king, let me or thyself have peace by a\r\nsingle combat. That this ancestral kingdom should, under all\r\ncircumstances and by any means, be recovered, there is the authority of\r\nsages for holding. And, O Pushkara, choose thou one of these two\r\nthings--gambling with dice or bending the bow in battle!' Thus addressed\r\nby Nishadha, Pushkara, sure of his own success, laughingly answered that\r\nmonarch, saying, 'O Naishadha, it is by good fortune that thou hast\r\nearned wealth again to stake. It is by good fortune also that Damayanti's\r\nill-luck hath at last come to an end. And O king, it is by good fortune\r\nthat thou art still alive with thy wife, O thou of mighty arms! It is\r\nevident that Damayanti, adorned with this wealth of thine that I will\r\nwin, will wait upon me like an Apsara in heaven upon Indra. O Naishadha,\r\nI daily recollect thee and am even waiting for thee, since I derive no\r\npleasure from gambling with those that are not connected with me by\r\nblood. Winning over to-day the beauteous Damayanti of faultless features,\r\nI shall regard myself fortunate, indeed, since she it is that hath ever\r\ndwelt in my heart.' Hearing these words of that incoherent braggart, Nala\r\nin anger desired to cut off his head with a scimitar. With a smile,\r\nhowever, though his eyes were red in anger, king Nala said, 'Let us play.\r\nWhy do you speak so now? Having vanquished me, you can say anything you\r\nlike.' Then the play commenced between Pushkara and Nala. And blessed be\r\nNala who at a single throw won his wealth and treasures back along with\r\nthe life of his brother that also had been staked. And the king, having\r\nwon, smilingly said unto Pushkara, 'This whole kingdom without a thorn in\r\nits side is now undisturbedly mine. And, O worst of kings, thou canst not\r\nnow even look at the princess of Vidarbha. With all thy family, thou art\r\nnow, O fool, reduced to the position of her slave. But my former defeat\r\nat thy hands was not due to any act of thine. Thou knowest it not, O\r\nfool, that it was Kali who did it all. I shall not, therefore, impute to\r\nthee the faults of others. Live happily as thou choosest, I grant thee\r\nthy life. I also grant thee thy portion (in the paternal kingdom) along\r\nwith all necessaries. And, O hero, without doubt, my affection towards\r\nthee is now the same as before. My fraternal love also for thee will\r\nnever know any diminution. O Pushkara, thou art my brother, live thou for\r\na hundred years!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And Nala of unbaffled prowess, having comforted his brother thus gave\r\nhim permission to go to his own town, having embraced him repeatedly. And\r\nPushkara himself, thus comforted by the ruler of the Nishadhas saluted\r\nthat righteous king, and addressed him, O monarch, saying these words\r\nwith joined hands, 'Let thy fame be immortal and live thou happily for\r\nten thousand years, thou who grantest me, O king, both life and refuge.\r\nAnd entertained by the king, Pushkara dwelt there for a month and then\r\nwent to his own town accompanied by large force and many obedient\r\nservants and his own kindred, his heart filled with joy. And that bull\r\namong men all the while blazed forth in beauty of person like a second\r\nSun.

And upon the arrival\r\nof the princess of Vidarbha accompanied by her son and daughter, king\r\nNala began to pass his days in joy like the chief of the celestials in\r\nthe gardens of Nandana. And the king of undying fame, having regained his\r\nkingdom and becoming illustrious among monarchs of the island of Jamvu,\r\nbegan once more to rule it. And he duly performed numerous sacrifices\r\nwith abundant gifts to Brahmanas. O great king, thou also wilt with thy\r\nkindred and relatives, so blaze forth in effulgence soon. For, O foremost\r\nof men, it was thus that subjugator of hostile cities, king Nala, had\r\nfallen into distress along with his wife, in consequence, O bull of\r\nBharata race of dice. And, O lord of the earth, Nala suffered such dire\r\nwoe all alone and recovered his prosperity, whereas thou, O son of Pandu,\r\nwith heart fixed on virtue, art sporting in joy in this great forest,\r\naccompanied by thy brothers and Krishna.

They\r\nthat will repeatedly recite this noble history of Nala, and that will\r\nhear it recited, will never be touched by adversity. He that listeneth to\r\nthis old and excellent history hath all his purposes crowned with success\r\nand, without doubt, obtaineth fame, besides sons and grandsons and\r\nanimals, a high position among men, and health, and joy. And, O king, the\r\nfear also that thou entertainest, viz., (Some one skilled in dice will\r\nsummon me), I will for once dispel. O thou of invincible prowess, I know\r\nthe science of dice in its entirety.

And\r\nhe heard that the mighty-armed Partha was engaged in such fierce\r\nasceticism that none else before him had ever been engaged in such\r\npenances. And Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, engaged in ascetic\r\nausterities with regulated vows and fixed mind and observing the vow of\r\nperfect silence, was, he heard, like the blazing god of justice himself\r\nin his embodied form. And, O king, (Yudhishthira) the son of Pandu\r\nhearing that his dear brother Jaya, the son of Kunti, was engaged in such\r\nasceticism in the great forest, began to grieve for him.

It\r\nseemeth to me that mighty bowman and vanquisher of armies was their\r\nrefuge, as Vishnu of the celestials. How did my heroic grandsires pass\r\ntheir time in the forest, deprived of the company of that hero, who\r\nresembled Indra himself in prowess and never turned his back in battle?\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"After Arjuna of unbaffled prowess had gone away from\r\nKamyaka, the sons of Pandu, O son, were filled with sorrow and grief.

And without that hero of\r\nwhite steeds that forest looked like the Chaitraratha woods when deprived\r\nof the presence of Kuvera. And, O Janamejaya, those tigers among men--the\r\nsons of Pandu--deprived of the company of Arjuna, continued to live in\r\nKamyaka in perfect cheerlessness. And, O chief of the Bharata race, those\r\nmighty warriors endowed with great prowess slew with pure arrows various\r\nkinds of sacrificial animals for the Brahmanas. And those tigers among\r\nmen and repressors of foes, daily slaying those wild animals and\r\nsanctifying them properly, offered them unto the Brahmanas. And it was\r\nthus, O king, that those bulls among men afflicted with sorrow lived\r\nthere with cheerless hearts after Dhananjaya's departure. The princess of\r\nPanchala in particular, remembering her third lord, addressed the anxious\r\nYudhishthira and said, 'That Arjuna who with two hands rivals the\r\nthousand-armed Arjuna (of old), alas, without that foremost of the sons\r\nof Pandu, this forest doth not seem at all beautiful in my eyes. Without\r\nhim, whenever I cast my eyes, this earth seems to be forlorn. Even this\r\nforest with its blossoming trees and so full of wonders, without Arjuna\r\nseems not so delightful as before. Without him who is like a mass of blue\r\nclouds (in hue), who hath the prowess of an infuriated elephant, and\r\nwhose eyes are like the leaves of the lotus, this Kamyaka forest doth not\r\nseem beautiful to me. Remembering that hero capable of drawing the bow\r\nwith his left hand, and the twang of whose bow sounds like the roar of\r\nthunder, I cannot feel any happiness, O king!'

Without him who having\r\ngone towards the north had vanquished mighty Gandharva chiefs by\r\nhundreds, and who having obtained numberless handsome horses of the\r\nTittiri and Kalmasha species all endowed with the speed of the wind,\r\npresented them from affection unto his brother the king, on the occasion\r\nof the great Rajasuya sacrifice, without that dear and illustrious one,\r\nwithout that terrible warrior born after Bhima, without that hero equal\r\nunto a god I do not desire to live in the Kamyaka woods any longer.'\r\n\r\n\"After Nakula's lamentations, Sahadeva said, 'He who having vanquished\r\nmighty warriors in battle won wealth and virgins and brought them unto\r\nthe king on the occasion of the great Rajasuya sacrifice, that hero of\r\nimmeasurable splendour who having vanquished single-handed the assembled\r\nYadavas in battle, ravished Subhadra with the consent of Vasudeva, he,\r\nwho having invaded the dominion of the illustrious Drupada gave, O\r\nBharata, unto the preceptor Drona his tuition fee--beholding, O king,\r\nthat Jishnu's bed of grass empty in our asylum, my heart refuses\r\nconsolation.

O thou best of the Bharata\r\nrace, sojourns in tirthas which are meritorious and which constitute one\r\nof the high mysteries of the Rishis, are even superior to sacrifices. He\r\nis a poor man who having gone to a tirtha hath not fasted for three\r\nnights, who hath not given away gold, and who hath not distributed kine.\r\nIndeed, one acquireth not, by the performance of the Agnishtoma and other\r\nsacrifices distinguished by large gifts, that merit which one requireth\r\nby a sojourn to a tirtha. In the world of men, there is that tirtha of\r\nthe God of gods, celebrated over the three worlds by the name of\r\nPushkara. One that sojourneth there becometh equal unto that deity. O\r\nhigh-souled son of the Kuru race, during the two twilights and mid-day\r\nthere is the presence of hundred thousand millions of tirthas in\r\nPushkara. The Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Maruts,\r\nthe Gandharvas, and the Apsaras are ever present, O exalted one, in\r\nPushkara. It was there, O king, that the gods, the Daityas and\r\nBrahmarshis, having performed ascetic devotions there, obtained great\r\nmerit and finally attained to god-hood.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Men of self-control, by even thinking mentally of Pushkara, are cleansed\r\nfrom their sins, and regarded in heaven. O king, the illustrious\r\ngrand-sire having the lotus for his seat, had dwelt with great pleasure\r\nin this tirtha. O blessed one, it was in Pushkara that the gods with the\r\nRishis having acquired of old great merit, finally obtained the highest\r\nsuccess. The person who, devoted to the worship of the gods and the\r\nPitris, batheth in this tirtha, obtaineth, it hath been said by the wise,\r\nmerit that is equal to ten times that of the horse-sacrifice. Having gone\r\nto the Pushkara woods, he that feedeth even one Brahmana, becometh happy\r\nhere and hereafter, O Bhishma, for that act. He that supporteth himself\r\non vegetables and roots and fruits, may with pious regard and without\r\ndisrespect, give even such fare to a Brahmana. And, O best of kings, the\r\nman of wisdom, even by such a gift, will acquire the merit of a\r\nhorse-sacrifice. Those illustrious persons among Brahmanas or Kshatriyas\r\nor Vaisyas or Sudras that bathe in Pushkara are freed from the obligation\r\nof rebirth. That man in special who visits Pushkara on the full moon of\r\nthe month of Karttika, acquireth ever-lasting regions in the abode of\r\nBrahma. He that thinketh with joined hands morning and evening, of the\r\nPushkara, practically batheth, O Bharata, in every tirtha. Whether a male\r\nor a female, whatever sins one may commit since birth, are all destroyed\r\nas soon as one batheth in Pushkara. As the slayer of Madhu is the\r\nforemost of all the celestials, so is Pushkara, O king, the foremost of\r\nall tirthas. A man by residing with purity and regulated vows for twelve\r\nyears in Pushkara, acquireth the merit of all the sacrifices, and goeth\r\nto the abode of Brahma. The merit of one who performeth the Agni-hotra\r\nfor full one hundred years, is equal to that of him who resideth for the\r\nsingle month of Karttika in Pushkara. There are three white hillocks and\r\nthree springs known from the remotest times, we do not know why, by the\r\nname of the Pushkara. It is difficult to go to Pushkara; it is difficult\r\nto undergo ascetic austerities at Pushkara; it is difficult to give away\r\nat Pushkara; and it is difficult to live at Pushkara.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having dwelt for twelve nights at Pushkara with regulated diet and vows,\r\nand having walked round (the place), one must go to Jamvu-marga. One that\r\ngoeth to Jamvu-marga which is resorted to by the celestials, the Rishis,\r\nand the Pitris, acquireth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and the\r\nfruition of all his wishes. The man that resideth there for five nights,\r\nhath his soul cleansed from all sins. He never sinketh into hell, but\r\nacquireth high success. Leaving Jamvu-marga one must go to\r\nTandulikasrama. He that goeth there never sinketh into hell but ascendeth\r\nto the abode of Brahma. He that goeth to the lake of Agastya and\r\noccupieth himself with the worship of the Pitris and celestials, fasting\r\nfor three nights, acquireth, O king, the fruit of the Agnishtoma. Going\r\nthither, he that liveth on vegetables or fruits acquireth the status\r\ncalled Kaumara. One should next proceed to the beautiful asylum of Kanwa,\r\nwhich is worshipped by the whole world. That sacred wood characterised by\r\nholiness, existeth, O bull of the Bharata race, from very remote times.\r\nAs soon as one entereth it, he is freed from all his sins. He who with\r\nregulated diet and vows worshippeth the Pitris and the gods there,\r\nobtaineth the fruit of a sacrifice that is capable of bestowing the\r\nfruition of all one's desires. Having walked round this asylum one must\r\nthen go to the spot where Yayati fell (from heaven). He that goeth\r\nthither, acquireth the merit of a horse-sacrifice. One must then go to\r\nMahakala with regulated diet and senses subdued. And having bathed in the\r\ntirtha called Koti, one obtaineth the merit of a horse-sacrifice. A\r\nvirtuous man should next proceed to the tirtha of Sthanu, the husband of\r\nUma, known over the three worlds by the name of Bhadravata. That best of\r\nmen who goeth to Bhadravata, beholdeth Isana and obtaineth the fruit of a\r\ngift of a thousand kine. And through the grace of Mahadeva, he acquireth\r\nthe status of Ganapatya blessed with prosperity and peace and high grace.\r\nHaving arrived then at the Narmada, that river celebrated over the three\r\nworlds, and given oblations of water to the Pitris and the gods, one\r\nacquireth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. He that goeth into the\r\nSouthern ocean, practising the Brahmacharya mode of life, and with senses\r\nsubdued, acquireth the fruit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and ascendeth to\r\nheaven. Having arrived at Charmanwati, with regulated diet and senses\r\nsubdued, one acquireth, at the command of Rantideva, the merit of the\r\nAgnishtoma sacrifice. One must then go, O virtuous chief of warriors, to\r\nArvuda, the son of Himavat, where there was a hole through the earth in\r\ndays of yore. There is the asylum of Vasistha, celebrated over the three\r\nworlds. Having resided for one night, one obtaineth the merit of the gift\r\nof a thousand kine. He that, leading a Brahmacharya mode of life batheth\r\nin the tirtha called Pinga, obtaineth, O tiger among kings, the merit of\r\nthe gift of a hundred Kapila kine. One must next go, O king, to that\r\nexcellent tirtha called Prabhasa. There Hutasana is always present in his\r\nown person. He, the friend of Pavana, O hero, is the mouth of all the\r\ngods. The man that with subdued and sanctified soul batheth in that\r\ntirtha, obtaineth merit greater than that of the Agnishtoma or Atiratra\r\nsacrifices. Proceeding next to the spot where the Saraswati mingleth with\r\nthe sea, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand kine and\r\nheaven also besides, O bull of the Bharata race, blazing forth for all\r\ntime like Agni himself. He that with subdued soul batheth in the tirtha\r\nof the king of waters, and giveth oblations of water unto the Pitris and\r\nthe gods, living there for three nights, blazeth forth like the Moon, and\r\nobtaineth also the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. One should next proceed,\r\nO best of the Bharata, unto the tirtha known by the name of Varadana,\r\nwhere (the Rishi) Durvasa had given a boon unto Vishnu. A man by bathing\r\nin Varadana obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand kine. One\r\nshould next proceed with subdued senses and regulated diet to Dwaravati,\r\nwhere by bathing in Pindaraka, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of\r\ngold in abundance. O blessed one, it is wonderful to relate that in that\r\ntirtha, to this day, coins with the mark of the lotus and lotuses also\r\nwith the mark of the trident, are seen. O represser of heroes! And O bull\r\namong men, the presence of Mahadeva is there. Arriving then, O Bharata,\r\nat the spot where the Sindhu mingleth with the sea, one should with\r\nsubdued soul bathe in that tirtha of Varuna. And bathing there and giving\r\noblations of water to the Pitris, the Rishis, and the gods one acquireth,\r\nO bull of the Bharata race, the region of Varuna, and blazeth forth in\r\neffulgence of his own. Men of wisdom say that, by worshipping the god\r\nknown by the name of Shankukarneswara, one acquireth ten times the merit\r\nof the horse-sacrifice. O bull of the Bharata race, having walked round\r\nthat tirtha, one should, O thou foremost of the Kurus, go to that tirtha\r\ncelebrated over the three worlds and known by the name of Drimi. That\r\ntirtha cleanseth from every sin, and it is there that the gods including\r\nBrahma worship Maheswara. Having bathed there and worshipped Rudra\r\nsurrounded by the other gods, one is freed from all sins since birth. It\r\nwas there, O best of men, that Drimi was adored by all the gods. Bathing\r\nthere, O best of men, one obtaineth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. O\r\nthou of great intelligence, Vishnu the creator of the universe, after\r\nslaying the Daityas and Danavas, went thither to purify himself. O\r\nvirtuous one, one should next proceed to Vasudhara adored by all. The\r\nmoment one arrives at that tirtha, one acquireth the fruit of the\r\nhorse-sacrifice. And, O thou best of the Kurus, by bathing there with\r\nsubdued soul and rapt attention, and giving oblations of water unto the\r\ngods and the Pitris one ascendeth unto the region of Vishnu and is adored\r\nthere. In that tirtha, O bull of the Bharata race, there is a sacred lake\r\nof the Vasus. By bathing there and drinking of its water, one becometh\r\nregarded of the Vasus. There is a celebrated tirtha of the name of\r\nSindhuttama, which destroyeth every sin. O best of men, by bathing there,\r\none acquireth the fruit of the gift of gold in abundance. By arriving at\r\nBhadratunga with sanctified soul and purity of conduct, one acquireth the\r\nregion of Brahma and a high state of blessedness. There is then the\r\ntirtha of the Kumarikas of Indra, that is much resorted to by the\r\nSiddhas. O best of men, by bathing there, one obtaineth the region of\r\nIndra. In Kumarika there is another tirtha called Renuka, which is also\r\nresorted to by the Siddhas. A Brahmana by bathing there would become as\r\nbright as the Moon. Proceeding next to the tirtha called the Panchananda,\r\nwith subdued sense and regulated diet, one obtaineth the fruit of the\r\nfive sacrifices that have been mentioned one after another in the\r\nscriptures. Then, O king, one should go to the excellent region of Bhima.\r\nO best of the Bharatas by bathing in the tirtha there, that is called\r\nYoni, a man (in his next birth) becometh, O king, the son of a goddess,\r\nbearing ear-rings decked with pearls, and obtaineth also the merit of the\r\ngift of a hundred thousand kine. Proceeding next to Srikunda, celebrated\r\nover the three worlds and worshipping the grandsire, one obtaineth the\r\nfruit of the gift of a thousand kine. O virtuous one, one should then go\r\nto the excellent tirtha called Vimala, where to this day may be seen\r\nfishes of golden and silver hues. By bathing there, one soon acquireth\r\nthe region of Vasava, and his soul being cleansed from every sin, he\r\nattaineth to a high state of blessedness. Proceeding next to Vitasta and\r\ngiving oblations of water unto the Pitris and the gods, a man, O Bharata,\r\nobtaineth the fruit of the Vajapeya sacrifice. That sin-destroying tirtha\r\nknown by the name of Vitasta, is situate in the country of the Kasmiras\r\nand is the abode of the Naga Takshaka. Bathing there, a man certainly\r\nobtaineth the fruit of the Vajapeya sacrifice, and his soul cleansed from\r\nevery sin, he attaineth to a high state of blessedness. One should next\r\nproceed to Vadava celebrated over the three worlds. Bathing there with\r\ndue rites in the evening, one should offer rice boiled in butter and\r\nmilk, according to the best of his might, unto the deity of seven flames.\r\nMen of wisdom say that a gift made here in honour of the Pitris, becometh\r\ninexhaustible. The Rishis, the Pitris, the gods, the Gandharvas, several\r\ntribes of Apsaras, the Guhyakas, the Kinnaras, the Yakshas, the Siddhas,\r\nthe Vidhyadharas, the Rakshasas, Daityas, Rudras, and Brahma himself, O\r\nking, having with subdued senses, accepted a course of austerities for a\r\nthousand years in order to move Vishnu to grace, cooked rice in milk and\r\nbutter and gratified Kesava with oblations, each offered with seven Riks.\r\nAnd, O king, the gratified Kesava thereupon conferred on them the\r\neight-fold attributes called Aiswarya and other objects that they\r\ndesired. And having bestowed upon them these, that god disappeared in\r\ntheir sight like lightning in the clouds. And it is for this, O Bharata,\r\nthat that tirtha became known by the name of Saptacharu, and if one\r\noffereth Charu there to the seven flamed deity, he obtaineth merit\r\nsuperior to that of the gift of a hundred thousand kine, to that of a\r\nhundred Rajasuya sacrifices, as also of a hundred horse-sacrifices.\r\nLeaving Vadava, O king, one should then proceed to Raudrapada, and\r\nbeholding Mahadeva there one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice.\r\nProceeding then, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of\r\nlife, to Manimat, and residing there for one night, one acquireth, O\r\nking, the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. One should then go, O king,\r\nto Devika celebrated over the whole world. It was there, O bull of\r\nBharata race, that, as heard by us, the Brahmanas first sprang into\r\nexistence. There also is the region of the holder of the trident--a\r\nregion that is celebrated over the world. Having bathed in Devika and\r\nworshipped Maheswara by offering him, to the best of one's might, rice\r\nboiled in milk and butter, a man obtaineth, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nthe merit of a sacrifice that is capable of filling every desire. There\r\nalso is another tirtha of Rudra called Kamakhya, which is much resorted\r\nto by the gods. Bathing there, a man speedily obtaineth success. By\r\ntouching also the water of Yajana. Brahmavaluka, and Pushpamva, one\r\nbecometh free from sorrow in after life. The learned have said that the\r\nsacred tirtha of Devika, the resort of the gods and the Rishis, is five\r\nYojanas in length and half a Yojana in breadth. One should then, in due\r\norder, proceed, O king, to Dirghasatra. There the gods with Brahma at\r\ntheir head, the Siddhas, and the greatest Rishis, with regulated vows and\r\nthe recitation and acceptance of the preliminary pledge, perform the\r\nlong-extending sacrifice. O king, by going only to Dirghasatra, O\r\nrepresser of foes, one obtaineth merit that is superior, O Bharata, to\r\nthat of the Rajasuya or the horse-sacrifice. One should next proceed with\r\nsubdued senses and regulated diet to Vinasana, where Saraswati\r\ndisappearing on the breast of Meru, re-appeareth at Chamasa, Shivodbheda\r\nand Nagadbheda. Bathing in Chamasadbheda, one obtaineth the merit of the\r\nAgnishtoma sacrifice. Bathing in Shivodbheda, one acquireth the merit of\r\nthe gift of a thousand kine. And bathing in Nagodbheda, one obtaineth the\r\nregion of the Nagas. One should proceed, next, to the inaccessible tirtha\r\nof Shasayana, where the cranes, O Bharata, disappearing in the form of\r\nsasas, re-appear every year in the month of Karttika, and bathe, O\r\nblessed chief of the Bharata race, in the Sarsawati. Bathing there, O\r\ntiger among men, one blazeth forth like the Moon, and obtaineth, O bull\r\nof the Bharata race, the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. One should\r\nnext proceed, O thou of the Kuru race, to Kumarakoti, with subdued\r\nsenses, and bathing there, worship the gods and the Puris. By doing this,\r\none obtaineth the merit of the gift of ten thousand kine, and raiseth all\r\nhis ancestors to higher regions. One should next, O virtuous one, proceed\r\nwith subdued soul to Rudrakoti, where in olden days, O king, ten millions\r\nof Munis had assembled. And, O king, filled with great joy at the\r\nprospect of beholding Mahadeva, the Rishis assembled there, each saying,\r\n'I will first behold the god! I will first behold the god!' And, O king,\r\nin order to prevent disputes amongst those Rishis of subdued souls, the\r\nLord of Yoga, by the help of his Yoga power, multiplied himself into ten\r\nmillion forms, and stood before every one of them. And every one of these\r\nRishis said, 'I have seen him first!' And gratified, O king, with the\r\ndeep devotion of those Munis of subdued souls, Mahadeva granted them a\r\nboon, saying, 'From this day your righteousness shall grow!' And, O tiger\r\namong men, one that bathes, with a pure mind, in Rudrakoti obtaineth the\r\nmerit of the horse-sacrifice and delivereth his ancestors. One should\r\nnext proceed, O king, to that highly sacred and celebrated region where\r\nthe Saraswati mingles with the sea. Thither, O king, the gods with Brahma\r\nat their head and Rishis with wealth of asceticism repair for adoring\r\nKesava on the fourteenth day of the lighted fortnight of the month of\r\nChaitra. Bathing there, O tiger among men, one obtaineth the merit of\r\ngiving away gold in abundance, and his soul being cleansed from every\r\nsin, he ascendeth to the region of Brahma. It is there, O king, that the\r\nRishis have completed many a sacrifice. By a trip to that spot one\r\nobtaineth the merit of the gifts of a thousand kine.'\""

He\r\nis freed from all sins who constantly sayeth, 'I will live in\r\nKurukshetra.' The very dust of Kurukshetra, conveyed by the wind, leadeth\r\na sinful man to a blessed course (in after-life). They that dwell in\r\nKurukshetra which lieth to the south of the Saraswati and the north of\r\nthe Drishadwati, are said to dwell in heaven. O hero, one should reside\r\nthere, O thou foremost of warriors, for a month. There, O lord of earth,\r\nthe gods with Brahma at their head, the Rishis, the Siddhas, the\r\nCharanas, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas and the Nagas, often\r\nrepair, O Bharata, to the highly sacred Brahmakshetra. O foremost of\r\nwarriors, the sins of one that desireth to repair to Kurukshetra even\r\nmentally are all destroyed, and he finally goeth into the region of\r\nBrahma. O son of the Kuru race, by repairing to Kurukshetra in a pious\r\nframe of mind, one obtaineth the fruit of the Rajasuya and horse\r\nsacrifices. By saluting next the Yaksha called Mankanaka, that mighty\r\ngate-keeper (of Kuvera), cue obtaineth the fruit of giving away a\r\nthousand kine. O virtuous king, one should next repair to the excellent\r\nregion of Vishnu, where Hari is always present. Bathing there and bowing\r\ndown unto Hari, the Creator of the three worlds, one obtaineth the fruit\r\nof the horse-sacrifice and repaireth to the abode of Vishnu. One should\r\nnext repair to Pariplava, that tirtha celebrated over the three worlds,\r\nand (bathing there), O Bharata, one obtaineth merit that is greater than\r\nthat of the Agnishtoma and the Atiratra sacrifices. Repairing next to the\r\ntirtha called Prithivi, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand\r\nkine. The pilgrim should next, O king, proceed to Shalukini and bathing\r\nthere in the Dasaswamedha one obtaineth the merit of ten\r\nhorse-sacrifices. Proceeding next to Sarpadevi, that excellent tirtha of\r\nthe Nagas, one obtaineth the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice and\r\nattaineth to the region of the Nagas. O virtuous one, one should next\r\nproceed to Tarantuka, the gatekeeper, and residing there for one night\r\none obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Proceeding next\r\nwith subdued senses and regulated diet to Panchananda and bathing in the\r\ntirtha there, called Koti, one obtaineth the fruit of the\r\nhorse-sacrifice. Proceeding then to the tirtha of the twin Aswins one\r\nobtaineth personal beauty. O virtuous one, one should next proceed to the\r\nexcellent tirtha called Varaha, where Vishnu formerly stood in the form\r\nof a boar. Bathing there one obtaineth, O foremost of men, the merit of\r\nthe horse-sacrifice. One should next, O king, repair to the tirtha called\r\nSama in Jayanti. Bathing there one obtaineth the merit of Rajasuya\r\nsacrifice. By bathing in Ekahansa, a man obtaineth the merit of giving\r\naway a thousand kine. O king, a pilgrim repairing to Kritasaucha\r\nobtaineth the lotus-eyed deity (Vishnu) and perfect purity of soul. One\r\nshould next proceed to Munjavata, that spot sacred to the illustrious\r\nSthanu. Residing there without food for one night, one obtaineth the\r\nstatus called Ganapatya. There, O king, is the celebrated tirtha called\r\nYakshini. O king, repairing to that tirtha and bathing there, one\r\nobtaineth fruition of all his desires. O bull of the Bharata race, that\r\ntirtha is regarded as the gate of Kurukshetra. The pilgrim should with\r\nconcentrated soul, walk round it. Equal unto the Pushkaras, it was\r\ncreated by the high-souled Rama, the son of Jamadagni. Bathing there and\r\nworshipping the Pitris and the gods, one obtaineth, O king, the merit of\r\nthe horse-sacrifice and becometh successful in everything. The pilgrim\r\nshould next repair with concentrated soul to the Rama-hrada. There, O\r\nking, the heroic Rama of resplendent energy, exterminating the Kshatriyas\r\nby his might, dug five lakes and filled them, O tiger among men, with the\r\nblood of his victims, as heard by us. And having filled those lakes with\r\nKshatriya blood, Rama offered oblations of blood to his sires and\r\ngrandsires. Gratified (with the oblations) those Rishis then addressed\r\nRama and said, 'O Rama, O Rama, O thou of great good fortune, we have\r\nbeen gratified with thee, O thou of the Bhrigu race, for this thy regard\r\nfor the Pitris, and thy prowess, O exalted one! Blessed be thou and ask\r\nthou the boon thou choosest. What is that thou desirest, O thou of great\r\nsplendour!' Thus addressed (by them), Rama, that foremost of smiters,\r\nsaid with joined hands these words unto the Pitris, stationed in the\r\nfirmament, 'If ye have been gratified with me, if I have deserved your\r\nfavour, I desire this favour of the Pitris, viz., that I may have\r\npleasure again in ascetic austerities. Let me also, through your power,\r\nbe freed from the sin I have committed by exterminating, from wrath, the\r\nKshatriya race. Let also my lakes become tirthas celebrated over the\r\nworld. The Pitris, hearing these blessed words of Rama, were highly\r\ngratified, and filled with joy they answered him saying, 'Let thy\r\nasceticism increase in consequence of thy regard for the Pitris. Thou\r\nhast exterminated the Kshatriyas from wrath. Freed art thou already from\r\nthat sin, for they have perished as a consequence of their own misdeeds.\r\nWithout doubt, these lakes of thine will become tirthas. And if one,\r\nbathing in these lakes, offereth oblations of the water thereof to the\r\nPitris, the latter gratified with him will grant him desire, difficult of\r\nfulfilment in the world as also eternal heaven.' O king, having granted\r\nhim these boons, the Pitris joyfully saluted Rama of the Bhrigu race and\r\ndisappeared there and then. It was thus that the lakes of the illustrious\r\nRama of the Bhrigu race became sacred. Leading a Brahmacharya mode of\r\nlife and observing sacred vows, one should bathe in the lakes of Rama.\r\nBathing therein and worshipping Rama, one obtaineth, O king, the merit of\r\ngift of gold in abundance. Proceeding next, O son of the Kuru race, to\r\nVansamulaka, a pilgrim by bathing there, raiseth, O king, his own race. O\r\nbest of the Bharatas, arriving next at the tirtha called Kayasodhana, and\r\nbathing there, one purifieth, without doubt, his body, and proceeded with\r\npurified body to the blessed region of unrivalled excellence. One should\r\nnext repair, O virtuous one, to that tirtha, celebrated over the three\r\nworlds, called Lokoddara, where formerly Vishnu of great prowess had\r\ncreated the worlds. Arriving at that tirtha which is adored by the three\r\nworlds one earneth, O king, by bathing there, numerous worlds for\r\nhimself. Repairing next with subdued soul to the tirtha called Sree, one\r\nacquires, by bathing there and worshipping the Pitris and the gods, high\r\nprosperity. Leading a Brahmacharya mode of life and with concentrated\r\nsoul, one should proceed next to the tirtha called Kapila. Bathing there\r\nand worshipping one's own Pitris and the gods, a man earneth the fruit of\r\nthe gift of a thousand Kapila kine. Repairing next to the tirtha called\r\nSurya and bathing there with subdued soul and worshipping the Pitris and\r\nthe gods, fasting all the while, one obtaineth the fruit of the\r\nAgnishtoma sacrifice and goeth (finally) to the region of the Sun. The\r\npilgrim by proceeding next to Gobhavana and bathing there obtaineth the\r\nmerit of the gift of a thousand kine. O son of the Kuru race, a pilgrim\r\nby repairing then to the tirtha called Shankhini and bathing in the\r\nDevi-tirtha that is there, obtaineth high prowess. O king, one should\r\nthen proceed to the tirtha called Tarandaka situated in the Saraswati and\r\nbelonging to the illustrious chief of the Yakshas who is one of the\r\ngate-keepers (of Kuvera). O king, bathing there one obtaineth the fruit\r\nof the Agnishtoma sacrifice. O virtuous king, one should next repair to\r\nthe tirtha called Brahmavarta. Bathing in Brahmavarta, one ascendeth to\r\nthe abode of Brahma. O king, one should then repair to the excellent\r\ntirtha called Sutirtha. There the Pitris are ever present along with the\r\ngods. One should bathe there and worship the Pitris and the gods. By so\r\ndoing, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and goeth (finally)\r\ninto the region of the Pitris. It is for this, O virtuous one, that\r\nSutirtha situate in Amvumati is regarded as so excellent. And, O thou\r\nbest of the Bharata race, having bathed in the tirtha of Kasiswara, one\r\nbecometh freed from all diseases and is adored in the abode of Brahma.\r\nThere, in that tirtha, is another called Matri. One that bathes in Matri\r\ntirtha hath a large progeny and obtaineth, O king, great prosperity. One\r\nshould next proceed with subdued sense and regulated diet to the tirtha\r\ncalled Shitavana. And, O great king, it hath been seen that one merit of\r\nthat tirtha which rarely belongs to any other, is that one only going\r\nthither obtaineth holiness. By casting off his hair in that tirtha one\r\nacquireth, O Bharata, great sanctity. There, in that tirtha, is another\r\ncalled Shwavillomapaha, where, O tiger among men, and chief of the\r\nBharata race, learned Brahmanas that go to tirthas obtain great\r\nsatisfaction by a dip into its waters. Good Brahmanas, O king, by casting\r\noff their hair in that tirtha acquire holiness by Pranayama and finally\r\nattain to a high state. There, O king, in that tirtha is also another\r\ncalled Dasaswamedhika. Bathing there, O tiger among men, one attains to a\r\nhigh state. One should next proceed, O king, to the celebrated tirtha\r\ncalled Manusha where, O king, a number of black antelopes afflicted by\r\nthe hunter's arrows, plunging into its waters, were transformed into\r\nhuman beings. Bathing in that tirtha, leading a Brahmacharya mode of life\r\nand with concentrated soul, a man becomes freed from all his sins and is\r\nadored in heaven. Distant by a krosa, O king, to the east of Manusha\r\nthere is a river celebrated by the name of Apaga that is restored to by\r\nthe Siddhas. The man that offereth there the syamaka grain in honour of\r\nthe gods and the Pitris acquireth great religious merit. And if one\r\nBrahmana is fed there, it becomes equivalent to feeding ten millions of\r\nBrahmanas. Having bathed in that tirtha and worshipped the gods and the\r\nPitris and resided there for one night, a man obtaineth the merit of the\r\nAgnishtoma sacrifice. One should then repair, O king, to that excellent\r\nregion of Brahma which, O Bharata, is known on earth by the name of\r\nBrahmodumvara. Bathing in the tank of the seven Rishis that is there, O\r\nbull among men, with pure mind and subdued soul, as also in the tirtha\r\ncalled Kedara of the high-souled Kapila, and beholding Brahma who is\r\nthere, one's soul being purified from all sins, one goeth to the abode of\r\nBrahma. Proceeding next to the inaccessible tirtha called Kedara of\r\nKapila, and burning one's sins there by ascetic penances, one acquireth\r\nthe power of disappearance at will. One should next proceed, O king, to\r\nthe celebrated tirtha called Saraka, and beholding Mahadeva there on the\r\nfourteenth day of the dark fortnight, one obtaineth all his wishes and\r\ngoeth also into heaven. O son of the Kuru race, in Saraka and Rudrakoti\r\nas also in the well and the lakes that are there, thirty millions of\r\ntirthas are present. There in that tirtha, O chief of the Bharatas, is\r\nanother called Ilaspada. Bathing there and worshipping the gods and the\r\nPitris, one never sinketh into hell but obtaineth the fruit of the\r\nVajapeya sacrifice. Repairing next to Kindana and Kinjapya, one\r\nacquireth, O Bharata, the merit of giving away in measureless abundance\r\nand the infinite recitation of prayers. Repairing next to the tirtha\r\ncalled Kalasi and bathing there devoutly and with the senses under\r\ncontrol, a man obtaineth the fruit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. To the\r\neast of Saraka, O chief of the Kurus, there is an auspicious tirtha known\r\nby the name of Anajanma, of the high-souled Narada. He that bathes there,\r\nO Bharata, obtaineth, after death, at the command of Narada various\r\nunrivalled regions. One should next proceed, on the tenth day of the\r\nlighted fortnight, to the tirtha called Pundarika. Bathing there, O king,\r\none obtaineth the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice. One should next\r\nproceed to the tirtha called Tripishtapa that is known over the three\r\nworlds. There in that tirtha is the sacred and sin-destroying river\r\ncalled Vaitarani. Bathing there and adoring the god known by the mark of\r\nthe bull and holding the trident in his hand, one's soul being purified\r\nfrom every sin one attaineth to the highest state. One should next\r\nproceed, O king, to the excellent tirtha called Phalakivana. There in\r\nthat tirtha the gods, O monarch, having been present, performed their\r\nascetic austerities extending for many thousand years. One should then\r\nproceed to the Dhrishadwati. Bathing there and worshipping the gods, one\r\nobtaineth, O Bharata, merit that is superior to that of both the\r\nAgnishtoma and the Atiratra sacrifices. O chief of the Bharatas, bathing\r\nin that tirtha called Sarvadeva, a man obtaineth, O king, the merit of\r\ngiving away a thousand kine. Bathing next in the tirtha called Panikhata\r\nand worshipping all the gods, a man obtaineth merit that is superior to\r\nthat of both the Agnishtoma and the Atiratra sacrifices, besides\r\nacquiring that of the Rajasuya sacrifice and finally going into the\r\nregion of the Rishis. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to that\r\nexcellent tirtha called Misraka. There, O tiger among kings, it hath been\r\nheard by us that the high-souled Vyasa, for the sake of the Brahmanas,\r\nhath mixed all the tirthas. He, therefore, that bathes in Misraka really\r\nbathes in all the tirtha. One should next proceed with subdued senses and\r\nregulated diet, to the tirtha called Vyasavana. Bathing in the tirtha\r\ncalled Manojava that is there, one obtaineth the merit of the gift of a\r\nthousand kine. Proceeding next to the Devi tirtha that is in Madhuvati,\r\none that bathes there and worships the gods and the Pitris obtains at the\r\ncommand of the Goddess the merit of the gift of a thousand kine.\r\nProceeding with regulated diet, he that bathes in the confluence of the\r\nKausiki and the Drishadwati, becometh free from all his sins. One should\r\nnext proceed to Vyasasthali where Vyasa of great intelligence, burning\r\nwith grief for his son had resolved to cast off his body but was cheered\r\nagain by the gods. Proceeding to that spot of Vyasa, one obtaineth the\r\nmerit of a thousand kine. O son of the Kuru race, proceeding next to the\r\nwell called Kindatta, he that throweth into it a measure of sesame, is\r\nfreed from all his debts and obtaineth his success. Bathing in the tirtha\r\ncalled Vedi, one obtaineth the merit of the gift of a thousand kine.\r\nThere are two other celebrated tirthas called Ahas and Sudina. Bathing\r\nthere, O tiger among men, one goeth to the region of the Sun. One should\r\nnext proceed to the tirtha called Mrigadhuma that is celebrated\r\nthroughout the three worlds. One should bathe there, O king, in Ganga.\r\nBathing there and worshipping Mahadeva, one obtaineth the merit of the\r\nhorse-sacrifice. Bathing next in the Devi tirtha one obtaineth the merit\r\nof the gift of a thousand kine. One should then proceed to Vamanaka\r\ncelebrated over the three worlds. Bathing there in Vishnupada and\r\nworshipping Vamana one's soul being purified from every sin, one goeth to\r\nthe abode of Vishnu. Bathing next in Kulampuna, one sanctifieth his own\r\nrace. Proceeding then to the Pavana-hrada, that excellent tirtha of the\r\nMarutas, and bathing there, O king and tiger among men, one becometh\r\nadored in the region of the Wind-god. Bathing in the Amara-hrada and\r\nworshipping with devotion the chief of the celestials, one becometh\r\nadored in heaven and courseth, seated on an excellent car, in the company\r\nof the immortals. O best of great men, bathing next with due rites in the\r\ntirtha called Sali surya, of Salihotra, one obtaineth the merit of the\r\ngift of a thousand kine. O best of the Bharatas, there is a tirtha called\r\nSreekunja in the Saraswati. Bathing there, O best of men, one obtaineth\r\nthe merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. O son of the Kuru race, one should\r\nnext repair to Naimishakunja. O king, the Rishis engaged in ascetic\r\nausterities in the woods of Naimisha had, in days of old, taking the vow\r\nof pilgrimage, gone to Kurukshetra. There, on the banks of the Saraswati,\r\nO chief of the Bharatas, a grove was made, which might serve for a\r\nresting spot for themselves, and which was highly gratifying to them.\r\nBathing in the Saraswati there, one obtaineth the merit of the Agnishtoma\r\nsacrifice. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to the excellent\r\ntirtha called Kanya. Bathing there one obtaineth the merit of the gift of\r\na thousand kine. One should next proceed to the excellent tirtha of\r\nBrahma. Bathing there, a person, of the (three) inferior orders,\r\nobtaineth the status of a Brahmana, and if one be a Brahmana, his soul\r\nbeing purified from every sin, he attaineth to the highest state. One\r\nshould then, O best of men, proceed to the excellent tirtha called Soma.\r\nBathing there, O king, one obtaineth the region of Soma. One should next\r\nproceed, O king, to the tirtha called Saptasaraswata, where the\r\ncelebrated Rishi, Mankanaka, had obtained ascetic success. O king, it\r\nhath been heard by us that in days of old Mankanaka having cut his hand\r\nwith the pointed blade of the Kusa grass, there flowed from his wound\r\nvegetable juice (instead of blood). And beholding vegetable juice flow\r\nfrom his wound, the Rishi began to dance with wonder-expanded eyes. And\r\nas the Rishi danced, all the mobile and immobile creatures also,\r\noverwhelmed with his prowess, began to dance with him. Then, O king, the\r\ngods with Brahma at their head and Rishis endued with the wealth of\r\nasceticism moved by the act of Mankanaka, represented the matter to\r\nMahadeva, saying, 'It behoveth thee, O god, to act in such a way that\r\nthis Rishi may not dance.' Thus addressed, Mahadeva, with heart filled\r\nwith joy, approached the dancing Rishi, and moved by the desire of doing\r\ngood to the gods, said, 'O great Rishi, O virtuous one, why dost thou\r\ndance? O bull among Munis, what can be the reason of this thy present\r\njoy?' The Rishi answered, 'O best of Brahmanas, I am an ascetic that\r\ntread the path of virtue. Dost thou not behold, O Brahmana, that\r\nvegetable juice floweth from the wound in my hand? Filled with great joy\r\nat sight of this, I am dancing.' Addressing the Rishi blinded by emotion,\r\nthe god laughingly said, 'O Brahmana, I do not wonder at this. Behold\r\nme.' Having said this, O best of men, Mahadeva, O sinless king, pressed\r\nhis thumb by the tip of his own finger. And, lo, from the wound thus\r\ninflicted, there came out ashes white as snow. And beholding this, O\r\nking, that Muni became ashamed and fell at the feet of the god. And\r\nbelieving that there was nothing better and greater than the god Rudra,\r\nhe began to adore him in these words:\r\n\r\n\"O holder of the trident, thou art the refuge of the celestials and the\r\nAsuras, of, indeed, the universe. By thee have been created the three\r\nworlds with their mobile and immobile beings. It is thou again that\r\nswallowest everything at the end of the Yuga. Thou art incapable of being\r\nknown by the gods themselves, far less by me. O sinless one, the gods\r\nwith Brahma at their heads are all displayed in thee. Thou art all, the\r\nCreator himself and the Ordainer of the worlds. It is by thy grace that\r\nall the gods sport without anxiety or fear. And adoring Mahadeva thus the\r\nRishi also said, 'O god of gods, grant me thy grace, so that my\r\nasceticism may not diminish.' Then that god of cheerful soul answered the\r\nregenerate Rishi,--saying, 'Let thy asceticism, O Brahmana, increase a\r\nthousandfold through my grace. And, O great Muni, I shall dwell with thee\r\nin this thy asylum. Bathing in Saptasaraswata, they that will worship me,\r\nshall be able to attain everything here and hereafter. And, without\r\ndoubt, they shall all attain to the Saraswata region in the end.' Having\r\nsaid this, Mahadeva disappeared then and there.\r\n\r\n\"After visiting Saraswata, one should proceed to Ausanasa celebrated over\r\nthe three worlds. There, O Bharata, the gods with Brahma at their head,\r\nand Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, and the illustrious\r\nKartikeya, were ever present during two twilights and the mid-day,\r\nimpelled by the desire of doing good to Bhargava. There in that tirtha is\r\nanother called Kapalamochana, which cleanseth from every sin. O tiger\r\namong men, bathing there one is cleansed from every sin. One should then\r\nproceed to the tirtha called Agni. Bathing there, O bull among men, one\r\nobtaineth the regions of agni and raiseth his own race (from lower\r\nregions). There in that tirtha is another, O chief of the Bharatas, that\r\nbelongeth to Viswamitra. Bathing there, O best of men, one obtaineth the\r\nstatus of a Brahmana. Proceeding next to Brahmayoni in purity of body and\r\nwith subdued soul, one obtaineth, O tiger among men, by bathing there,\r\nthe abode of Brahma, and sanctifieth, without doubt, his own race to the\r\nseventh generation up and down. One should next proceed, O king, to the\r\ntirtha celebrated over the three worlds, which is called Prithudaka,\r\nbelonging to Kartikeya. One should bathe there and occupy oneself in the\r\nworship of the Pitris and the gods. Whatever evil hath been committed,\r\nknowingly or unknowingly, by man or woman, impelled by human motives, is\r\nall destroyed, O Bharata, by a bath in that tirtha. Bathing there one\r\nobtaineth, too, the merit of the horse-sacrifice and heaven also. The\r\nlearned have said that Kurukshetra is holy; that holier than Kurukshetra\r\nis the Saraswati; that holier than the Saraswati are all the tirthas\r\ntogether, and that holier than all the tirthas together is Prithudaka. He\r\nthat engaged in the recitation of prayers casteth off his body at\r\nPrithudaka, which is the best of all tirthas, becometh an immortal. It\r\nhath been sung by Sanatkumara and by the high-souled Vyasa, and it is in\r\nthe Vedas also, that one should, O king, go to Prithudaka, with subdued\r\nsoul. O son of Kuru race, there is no tirtha which is superior to\r\nPrithudaka. Without doubt, that tirtha is purifying, holy and\r\nsin-destroying. O best of men, it hath been said by learned persons that\r\nmen, however sinful, by bathing in Prithudaka, go to heaven. O best of\r\nthe Bharatas, there in that tirtha is another called Madhusrava. Bathing\r\nthere, O king, one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine.\r\nOne should then proceed, O king, to that celebrated and sacred tirtha\r\nwhere the Saraswati uniteth with the Aruna. One that batheth there,\r\nhaving fasted for three nights, is cleansed of even the sin of slaying a\r\nBrahmana, and obtaineth also merit that is superior to that of either the\r\nAgnishtoma or Atiratra sacrifice, and rescueth his race to the seventh\r\ngeneration up and down. There in that tirtha is another, O perpetuator of\r\nthe Kuru race, that is called Ardhakila. From compassion for the\r\nBrahmanas, that tirtha was made by Darbhi in days of old. Without doubt,\r\nby vows, by investiture of the sacred, by fasts, by rites and by Mantras,\r\none becometh a Brahmana. O bull among men, it hath been seen, however, by\r\nlearned persons of old that even one destitute of rites and Mantras, by\r\nonly bathing in that tirtha becometh learned and endued with the merit of\r\nvows. Darbhi had also brought hither the four oceans. O best of men, one\r\nthat batheth here, never meeteth with distress hereafter and obtaineth\r\nalso the merit of giving away four thousand kine. One should next repair,\r\nO virtuous one, to the tirtha called Satasahasraka. Near to this is\r\nanother called Sahasraka. Both are celebrated, and one that batheth in\r\nthem, obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Fasts and gifts\r\nthere multiply a thousandfold. One should next proceed, O king, to the\r\nexcellent tirtha called Renuka. One should bathe there and worship the\r\nPitris and the gods. By this, cleansed from every sin, he obtaineth the\r\nmerit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Bathing next in the tirtha called\r\nVimochana with passions and senses under control, one is cleansed from\r\nall the sins generated by the acceptance of gifts. With senses under\r\ncontrol and practising the Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next\r\nrepair to the woods of Panchavati. By a sojourn thither, one earneth much\r\nvirtue and becometh adored in the regions of the virtuous. One should\r\nnext go to the tirtha of Varuna called Taijasa, blazing in effulgence of\r\nits own. There in that tirtha is the lord of Yoga, Sthanu himself, having\r\nfor his vehicle the bull. He that sojourneth there, obtaineth success by\r\nworshipping the god of gods. It was there that the gods with Brahma at\r\ntheir head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, installed Guha as\r\nthe generalissimo of the celestials. To the east of that tirtha is\r\nanother, O perpetuator of Kuru race, that is called Kuru tirtha. With\r\nsenses under control and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, he that\r\nbathes in Kuru-tirtha, becometh cleansed of all his sins and obtaineth\r\nthe region of Brahma. With subdued senses and regulated diet one should\r\nnext proceed to Svargadwara. Sojourning thither, one obtaineth the merit\r\nof the Agnishtoma sacrifice and goeth to the abode of Brahma. The pilgrim\r\nshould then, O king, proceed to the tirtha called Anaraka. Bathing there,\r\nO king, one never meeteth with distress hereafter. There, O king, Brahma\r\nhimself with the other gods having Narayana at their head, is ever\r\npresent, O tiger among men! And, O royal son of the Kuru race, the wife\r\nalso of Rudra is present there. Beholding the goddess, one never meeteth\r\nwith distress hereafter. There in that tirtha O king, is also (an image\r\nof) Visweswara, the lord of Uma. Beholding the god of gods there, one is\r\ncleansed of all his sins. Beholding also (the image of) Narayana from\r\nwhose navel had sprung the lotus, one blazeth forth, O royal represser of\r\nall foes, and goeth to the abode of Vishnu. O bull among men, he that\r\nbatheth in the tirthas of all the gods, is exempted from every sorrow and\r\nblazeth forth like the Moon. The pilgrim should next proceed, O king, to\r\nSwastipura. By walking around that place, one obtaineth the merit of\r\ngiving away a thousand kine. Arriving next at the tirtha called Pavana,\r\none should offer oblations to the Pitris and the gods. By this, he\r\nobtaineth, O Bharata, the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Near to that\r\nis Ganga-hrada, and another, O Bharata, called Kupa. Thirty millions of\r\ntirthas, O king, are present in that Kupa. Bathing there, O king, a\r\nperson obtaineth heaven. Bathing also in the Ganga-hrada and adoring\r\nMaheswara, one obtaineth the status of Ganapatya and rescueth his own\r\nrace. One should next proceed to Sthanuvata, celebrated over the three\r\nworlds. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth heaven. One should then\r\nproceed to Vadaripachana, the asylum of Vasishtha. Having tasted there\r\nfor three nights, one should eat jujubes. He that liveth on jujubes for\r\ntwelve years, and he that fasteth at the tirtha for three nights,\r\nacquireth merit that is eternal. Arriving then at Indramarga, O king, and\r\nfasting there for a day and night the pilgrim becometh adored in the\r\nabode of Indra. Arriving next at the tirtha called Ekaratra, a person\r\nthat stayeth there for one night, with regulated vows and refraining from\r\nuntruth, becometh adored in the abode of Brahma. One should next go, O\r\nking, to the asylum of Aditya--that illustrious god who is a mass of\r\neffulgence. Bathing in that tirtha celebrated over three worlds, and\r\nworshipping the god of light, one goeth to the region of Aditya and\r\nrescueth his own race. The pilgrim then, O king, bathing in the tirtha of\r\nSoma, obtaineth, without doubt, the region of Soma. One should next\r\nproceed, O virtuous one, to the most sacred tirtha of the illustrious\r\nDadhicha, that sanctifying tirtha which is celebrated over the whole\r\nworld. It was here that Angiras, that ocean of ascetic austerities\r\nbelonging to the Saraswata race, was born, Bathing in that tirtha, one\r\nobtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and without doubt, gaineth\r\nalso residence in the legion of Saraswati. With subdued senses and\r\nleading a Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next proceed to\r\nKanyasrama. Residing there for three nights, O king, with subdued senses\r\nand regulated diet, one obtaineth a hundred celestial damsels and goeth\r\nalso to the abode of Brahma. One should next, O virtuous one, proceed to\r\nthe tirtha called Sannihati. Sojourning thither the gods with Brahma at\r\ntheir head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism earn much virtue.\r\nBathing in the Saraswati during a solar eclipse, one obtaineth the merit\r\nof a hundred horse-sacrifices, and any sacrifice that one may perform\r\nthere produceth merit that is eternal. Whatever tirthas exist on earth or\r\nin the firmament, all the rivers, lakes, smaller lakes, springs, tanks,\r\nlarge and small, and spots sacred to particular gods, without doubt, all\r\ncome, O tiger among men, month after month, and mingle with Sannihati, O\r\nking of men! And it is because that all other tirthas are united together\r\nhere, that this tirtha is so called. Bathing there and drinking of its\r\nwater, one becometh adored in heaven. Listen now, O king, to the merit\r\nacquired by that mortal who performeth a Sraddha on the day of the new\r\nmoon during a solar eclipse. The person that performeth a Sraddha there,\r\nafter having bathed in that tirtha, obtaineth the merit that one earneth\r\nby properly celebrating a thousand horse-sacrifices. Whatever sins a man\r\nor woman committeth, are, without doubt, all destroyed as soon as one\r\nbatheth in that tirtha. Bathing there one also ascendeth to the abode of\r\nBrahma on the lotus-coloured tar. Bathing next in Koti-tirtha, after\r\nhaving worshipped the Yaksha doorkeeper, Machakruka, one obtaineth the\r\nmerit of giving away gold in abundance. Near to this, O best of the\r\nBharatas, is a tirtha called Gangahrada. One should bathe there, O\r\nvirtuous one, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life.\r\nBy this, one obtaineth merit that is greater than that of a Rajasuya and\r\nhorse-sacrifices. The tirtha called Naimisha is productive of good on\r\nearth. Pushkara is productive of good in the regions of the firmament;\r\nKurukshetra, however, is productive of good in respect of all the three\r\nworlds. Even the dust of Kurukshetra, carried by the wind, leadeth sinful\r\nmen to a highly blessed state. They that reside in Kurukshetra, which\r\nlieth to the north of the Drishadwati and the south of the Saraswati,\r\nreally reside in heaven. 'I will go to Kurukshetra,' 'I will dwell in\r\nKurukshetra,' he that uttereth those words even once, becometh cleansed\r\nof all sins. The sacred Kurukshetra which is worshipped by Brahmarshis,\r\nis regarded as the sacrificial altar of the celestials. Those mortals\r\nthat dwell there, have nothing to grieve for at any time. That which\r\nlieth between Tarantuka and Arantuka and the lakes of Rama and Machakruka\r\nis Kurukshetra. It is also called Samantapanchaka and is said to be the\r\nnorthern sacrificial altar of the Grandsire.'"

      "content": "\"Pulastya said, 'Then, O great king, one should proceed to the excellent\r\ntirtha of Dharma, where the illustrious god of justice had practised\r\nhighly meritorious austerities. And it is for this that he made the spot\r\na sacred tirtha and rendered it celebrated by his own name. Bathing\r\nthere, O king, a virtuous man with concentrated soul certainly\r\nsanctifieth his family to the seventh generation. One should then repair,\r\nO king, to the excellent Jnanapavana. Sojourning thither, one obtaineth\r\nthe merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice, and goeth to the region of the\r\nMunis. Then, O monarch, a man should repair to the Saugandhika-vana.\r\nThere dwell the celestials with Brahma at their head, Rishis endued with\r\nwealth of asceticism, the Siddhas, the Charanas, the Gandharvas, the\r\nKinnaras and the serpents. As soon as one entereth these woods, he is\r\ncleansed of all his sins. Then, O king, should one repair to the sacred\r\ngoddess Saraswati, known there as the goddess Plaksha, that best of\r\nstreams and foremost of rivers. There should one bathe in the water\r\nissuing from an ant-hill. (Bathing there and) worshipping the Pitris and\r\nthe gods, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. There existeth\r\na rare tirtha called Isanadhyushita, lying from the ant-hill at the\r\ndistance of six throws of a heavy stick. As seen in the Puranas, O tiger\r\namong men, bathing there a man obtaineth the merit of giving away a\r\nthousand Kapila kine and of the horse-sacrifice. Journeying next, O\r\nforemost of men, to Sugandha, and Satakumbha and Panchayaksha, a man\r\nbecometh adored in heaven. Repairing to another tirtha there called\r\nTrisulakhata, one should bathe and set himself to worship the Pitris and\r\nthe gods. Doing so, without doubt, one obtaineth, after death, the status\r\nof Ganapatya. One should next proceed, O king, to the excellent spot of\r\nthe Goddess celebrated over the three worlds by the name of Sakamvari.\r\nThere, for the space of a thousand celestial years, she of excellent\r\nvows, month after month, had subsisted upon herbs, O king of men! And\r\nattracted by their reverence for the Goddess, many Rishis with wealth of\r\nasceticism, came thither, O Bharata. and were entertained by her with\r\nherbs. And it is for this that they bestowed on her the name of\r\nSakamvari. O Bharata, the man who arriveth at Sakamvari, with rapt\r\nattention and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life and passeth three\r\nnights there in purity and subsisting on herbs alone, obtaineth, at the\r\nwill of the goddess, the merit of him that liveth upon herbs for twelve\r\nyears. Then should one proceed to the tirtha called Suvarna, famed\r\nthrough the three worlds. There in days of old, Vishnu had paid his\r\nadorations to Rudra, for his grace, and obtaineth also many boons\r\ndifficult of acquisition even by the gods. And, O Bharata, the gratified\r\ndestroyer of Tripura said, 'O Krishna, thou shalt, without doubt, be much\r\nbeloved in the world, and the foremost of everything in the universe.'\r\nRepairing thither, O king, and worshipping the deity having the bull for\r\nhis mark, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice as also the\r\nstatus of Ganapatya. One should next proceed to the tirtha of Dhumavati.\r\nFasting there for three nights, one obtaineth, without doubt, all the\r\nwishes cherished by him. To the southern half of this spot of the\r\nGoddess, there is, O king, a tirtha called Rathavarta. One should, O\r\nvirtuous one, go up to that place, with devout heart, and having his\r\nsenses under control. By this, through the grace of Mahadeva, one\r\nattaineth to an exalted state. After walking round the place, one should,\r\nO bull of the Bharata race, proceed to the tirtha named Dhara, which, O\r\nthou of great wisdom, washeth off all sins. Bathing there, O tiger among\r\nmen, a man is freed from every sorrow. One should then repair, O virtuous\r\none, after bowing to the great mountain (Himavat), to the source of the\r\nGanges, which is, without doubt, like the gate of heaven. There should\r\none, with concentrated soul, bathe in the tirtha called Koti. By this,\r\none obtaineth the merit of the Pundarika sacrifice, and delivereth his\r\nrace. Residing one night there, one acquireth the merit of giving away a\r\nthousand kine. By offering oblations of water duly to the gods and the\r\nPitris, at Saptaganga, Triganga and Sakravarta, (which are all there),\r\nbecometh adored in the regions of the virtuous. Bathing next at\r\nKanakhala, and fasting there for three nights, a person reapeth the merit\r\nof the horse-sacrifice and goeth to heaven.

And at this, the ascetics again\r\nrecollected all that they had learnt before. It was there that the Rishis\r\nand the gods Varuna, Agni, Prajapati, Narayana also called Hari, Mahadeva\r\nand the illustrious Grandsire of great splendour, appointed the\r\nresplendent Bhrigu to officiate at a sacrifice. Gratifying Agni by\r\nlibations of clarified butter poured according to the ordinance, the\r\nillustrious Bhrigu once performed the Agnyadhana sacrifice for all those\r\nRishis, after which both they and the gods went away to their respective\r\nhomes one after another. One who enters the forest of Tungaka, is, O best\r\nof kings, male or female, cleansed of every sin. There in that tirtha, O\r\nhero, one should reside for a month, with subdued senses and regulated\r\ndiet. By this, O king, one ascendeth to the region of Brahma, and\r\ndelivereth also his race. Arriving next at Medhavika, one should offer\r\noblations of water to the gods and the Pitris. By this, one acquires the\r\nmerit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice, and also memory and intellect. There\r\nin that tirtha is the mountain known over the whole world and called\r\nKalanjara. Bathing in the celestial lake that is there, one acquires the\r\nmerit of giving away a thousand kine. He that, O king, after a bath,\r\noffereth oblations (to the gods and the Pitris) on the Kalanjara\r\nmountain, is, without doubt, regarded in heaven. Proceeding next, O\r\nmonarch, to the river Mandakini capable of destroying all sins and which\r\nis on that best of mountains called Chitrakuta, he that bathes there and\r\nworships the gods and the Pitris, obtains the merit of the\r\nhorse-sacrifice and attains to an exalted state. One should next, O\r\nvirtuous one, proceed to the excellent tirtha called Bhartristhana,\r\nwhere, O king, ever dwells the celestial generalissimo Kartikeya. By a\r\njourney only to that spot, a person, O foremost of kings, attaineth to\r\nsuccess. Bathing next at the tirtha called Koti, one earneth the merit of\r\ngiving away a thousand kine. Having walked round Koti, one should proceed\r\nnext to Jyeshthasthana. Beholding Mahadeva who is there, one shineth like\r\nthe moon. There, O mighty monarch, is a celebrated well. O bull of the\r\nBharata race! There in that well, O foremost of warriors, are the four\r\nseas. He that bathes there, O foremost of kings, and with subdued soul\r\nworships the gods and the Pitris, is cleansed of all his sins and\r\nattaineth to an exalted state. Then, O mighty king, should one proceed to\r\nthe great Sringaverapura, where, O foremost of kings, formerly Rama,\r\nDasharatha's son, had crossed (the Ganga). Bathing in that tirtha, one, O\r\nmighty-armed one, is cleansed of all his sins. Bathing with subdued\r\nsenses and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, in the Ganga, one is\r\ncleansed of every sin, and obtains also the merit of the Vajapeya\r\nsacrifice. One should next proceed to the place called Mayuravata,\r\nconsecrated to Mahadeva of high intelligence. Beholding there the god,\r\nbowing down to him and walking round the spot, one acquireth, O Bharata,\r\nthe Ganapatya status. Bathing in Ganga at that tirtha, one is cleansed of\r\nall his sins. Then, O king, should one proceed to Prayaga, whose praises\r\nhave been sung by Rishis and where dwell the gods with Brahma at their\r\nhead, the Directions with their presiding deities, the Lokapalas, the\r\nSiddhas, the Pitris adored by the worlds, the great Rishis-Sanatkumara\r\nand others, stainless Brahmarshis--Angiras and others,--the Nagas, the\r\nSuparnas, the Siddhas, the Snakes, the Rivers, the Seas, the Gandharvas,\r\nthe Apsaras, and the Lord Hari with Prajapati. There in that tirtha are\r\nthree fiery caverns between which the Ganga, that foremost of tirthas,\r\nrolleth rapidly. There in that region also the world-purifying daughter\r\nof the sun, Yamuna, celebrated over the three worlds, uniteth with the\r\nGanga. The country between the Ganga and the Yamuna is regarded as the\r\nmons veneris of the world, and Prayaga as the foremost point of that\r\nregion. The tirthas Prayaga, Pratisthana, Kamvala, Aswatara and Bhogavati\r\nare the sacrificial platforms of the Creator. There in those places, O\r\nforemost of warriors, the Vedas and the Sacrifices, in embodied forms,\r\nand the Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, adore Brahma, and there\r\nthe gods and rulers of territories also celebrate their sacrifices. The\r\nlearned, however, say that of all these tirthas, O exalted one, Prayaga\r\nis the most sacred, in fact, the foremost of all tirthas in the three\r\nworlds. By going to that tirtha, by singing its praises, or by taking a\r\nlittle earth from it, one is cleansed from every sin. He that bathes in\r\nthat confluence celebrated over the world, acquires all the merits of the\r\nRajasuya and the horse-sacrifices. This sacrificial place is worshipped\r\nby the gods themselves. If a man giveth there ever so little, it\r\nincreaseth, O Bharata, a thousandfold. O child, let not the texts of the\r\nVeda, nor the opinions of men dissuade thy mind from the desire of dying\r\nat Prayaga. O son of the Kuru race, the wise say that six hundred million\r\nand ten thousand tirthas exist at Prayaga. Bathing in the confluence of\r\nGanga and Yamuna, one obtains the merit that attaches to the four kinds\r\nof knowledge and the merits also of those that are truthful. There at\r\nPrayaga is the excellent tirtha of Vasuki called Bhogavati. He that\r\nbatheth in it, obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice. There also in\r\nthe Ganga is the tirtha famed over the three worlds, called\r\nRamaprapatana, which conferreth the merit of ten horse-sacrifices. O son\r\nof the Kuru race! Wherever may a person bathe in the Ganga, he earneth\r\nmerit equal to that of a trip to Kurukshetra. An exception, however, is\r\nmade in favour of Kanakhala, while the merit attaching to Prayaga is the\r\ngreatest. Having committed a hundred sins, he that bathes in the Ganga,\r\nhath all his sins washed off by the waters thereof, even as fuel is\r\nconsumed by fire. It hath been said that in the Satyayuga all the tirthas\r\nwere sacred; in the Treta, Pushkara alone was such; in Dwapara,\r\nKurukshetra; and in the Kali-yuga, the Ganga alone is sacred. In\r\nPushkara, one should practise austerities; in Mahalaya, one should give\r\naway; in the Malaya mountains, one should ascend the funeral pyre; and in\r\nBhrigutunga, one should renounce one's body by forgoing food. Bathing in\r\nPushkara, in Kurukshetra, in the Ganga and in the confluence (of the\r\nGanga and the Yamuna), one sanctifieth seven generations of one's race up\r\nand down. He that reciteth the name of the Ganga is purified; while he\r\nthat beholdeth her, receiveth prosperity; while he that bathes in her and\r\ndrinks of her waters sanctifieth seven generations of his race up and\r\ndown. As long, O king, as one's bones lie in contact with the waters of\r\nthe Ganga, so long doth he live regarded in heaven, even as one liveth in\r\nheaven in consequence of the merit he earneth by pious pilgrimages to\r\nsacred tirthas and holy spots. There is no tirtha that is like unto the\r\nGanga, there is no god like unto Kesava, and there is none superior to\r\nBrahmanas,--this hath been said even by the Grandsire. O great king, the\r\nregion through which the Ganga flows should be regarded as a sacred\r\nasylum, and a spot of land that is on the Ganga's banks, should be\r\nregarded as one favourable to the attainment of ascetic success.\r\n\r\nThis truthful description (of the tirthas) one should recite only unto\r\nthe regenerate ones, unto those that are pious, unto one's son and\r\nfriends and disciples and dependents. This narrative, without a rival, is\r\nblessed and holy and leadeth to heaven. Holy and entertaining and\r\nsanctifying, it is productive of merit and high worth. Destructive of\r\nevery sin, it is a mystery that the great Rishis cherish with care. By\r\nreciting it in the midst of Brahmanas, one is cleansed of every sin, and\r\nascends to heaven. This description of tirthas is auspicious and\r\nheaven-giving and sacred; ever blessed as it is, it destroys one's\r\nenemies; foremost of all accounts, it sharpens the intellect. By reading\r\nthis narrative the sonless obtains sons, the destitute obtains riches, a\r\nperson of the royal order conquereth the whole earth, the Vaisya cometh\r\nby wealth, the Sudra obtaineth all his desires, and the Brahmana crosseth\r\nthe ocean (of the world). Purifying himself, he that listens daily to the\r\nmerits of the different tirthas, recollects the incidents of many\r\nprevious births and rejoices in heaven. Of the tirthas that have been\r\nrecited here, some are easily accessible, while others are difficult of\r\naccess. But he that is inspired with the desire of beholding all tirthas,\r\nshould visit them even in imagination. Desirous of obtaining merit, the\r\nVasus, and the Sadhyas, the Adityas, the Maruts, the Aswins, and the\r\nRishis equal unto celestials, all bathed in these tirthas. Do thou also,\r\nO thou of the Kuru race, observing the ordinance as explained by me,\r\nvisit, with subdued senses, these tirthas, increasing thy merit, O thou\r\nof excellent vows. Men of piety and learning are able to visit these\r\ntirthas, by reason of their purified senses, their belief in Godhead, and\r\ntheir acquaintance with the Vedas. He that doth not observe vows, he that\r\nhath not his soul under control, he that is impure, he that is a thief,\r\nand he that is of crooked mind, doth not, O Kauravya, bathe in tirthas.\r\nThou art ever observant of virtue, and art of pure character. By thy\r\nvirtue, O virtuous one, thou hast always gratified thy father and thy\r\ngrand-father, and great-grand-fathers, and the gods with Brahma at their\r\nhead, and the Rishis also, O thou versed in virtue! Thou who resemblest\r\nVasava, thou wilt, O Bhishma, attain to the region of the Vasus, and also\r\neternal fame on earth!'\r\n\r\n\"Narada continued, 'Having cheerfully spoken thus, the illustrious Rishi\r\nPulastya, well-pleased, bidding Bhishma farewell, disappeared there and\r\nthen. And Bhishma also, O tiger among men, well understanding the true\r\nimport of the Shastras, wandered over the world at the command of\r\nPulastya. Thus, O thou blessed one, did Bhishma end at Prayaga his highly\r\nmeritorious journey to the tirthas capable of destroying all sins. The\r\nman that ranges the earth in accordance with these injunctions, obtains\r\nthe highest fruit of a hundred horse-sacrifices and earns salvation\r\nhereafter. Thou wilt, O son of Pritha, obtain merit consisting of the\r\neight attributes, even like that which Bhishma, the foremost of the\r\nKurus, had obtained of yore. And as thou wilt lead these ascetics to\r\nthose tirthas, thy merit will be much greater. Those tirthas are infested\r\nby Rakshasas, and no one, save thyself, O son of Kuru race, can go there.\r\nRising early he that reciteth this narrative by the celestial Rishis on\r\nthe subject of the tirthas, becometh free from all sins. Those foremost\r\nof Rishis, Valmiki, and Kasyapa, and Atreya, and Kundajathara, and\r\nViswamitra, and Gautama, and Asita, and Devala, and Markandeya, and\r\nGalava, and Bharadwaja, and Vasishtha, and the Muni Uddalaka, and Saunaka\r\nwith his son, and Vyasa, that best of ascetics, and Durvasas, that\r\nforemost of Munis, and Javali of great austerities--all these illustrious\r\nRishis endued with wealth of asceticism, are staying in expectation of\r\nthee. With these, O mighty king, do thou meet by visiting these tirthas.\r\nAnd, O illustrious monarch, a great Rishi of immeasurable energy, Lomasa\r\nby name, will come to thee. Do thou follow him, and me, and by turns\r\nvisit these tirthas, O thou virtuous one! By this, thou wilt acquire\r\ngreat fame, like king Mahabhisha! O tiger among kings, even as the\r\nvirtuous Yayati and king Pururavas, dost thou blaze forth with thy own\r\nvirtue. Like king Bhagiratha and the illustrious Rama, dost thou shine\r\namong kings even as the Sun himself. And thou art, O great king,\r\ncelebrated (in the world) even as Muni or Ikshwaku, or the highly famous\r\nPuru or Vainya! And as in days of yore the slayer of Vritra, after\r\nburning all his foes, ruled the three worlds, his mind freed from\r\nanxiety, so wilt thou rule thy subjects, after slaying all thy enemies.\r\nAnd, O thou of eyes like lotus leaves, having conquered the earth\r\naccording to the customs of thy order, thou wilt obtain renown by thy\r\nvirtue, even like Kartaviryaryuna.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"O great king, having comforted the monarch thus,\r\nthe illustrious Rishi Narada, bidding farewell to the king, disappeared\r\nthere and then. And the virtuous Yudhishthira, reflecting upon the\r\nsubject, began to recite unto the ascetics the merit attaching to\r\ntirthas!\""

O thou of ascetic wealth, that hero is devoted to me,\r\nendued with ability, and well-skilled in weapons, and like unto the\r\nexalted Vasudeva himself. I know them both, Krishna and Arjuna, those\r\ndestroyers of enemies, O Brahmana, endued with prowess, even as the\r\npuissant Vyasa knoweth them. I know Vasudeva and Dhananjaya to be none\r\nelse than Vishnu himself, possessed of the six attributes. And this is\r\nalso what Narada knoweth, for he hath always spoken so unto me. I also\r\nknow them to be Rishis, Nara and Narayana. Knowing him to possess the\r\nability, I have sent him (on the mission). Not inferior unto Indra and\r\nfully competent (for the task), I have sent that son of a god to see the\r\nlord of the celestials and obtain weapons from him. Bhishma and Drona are\r\nAtirathas. Kripa and the son of Drona are invincible; these mighty\r\nwarriors have been installed by Dhritarashtra's son in the command of his\r\narmy. All these are versed in the Vedas, are heroic, and possessed of the\r\nknowledge of every weapon. Endued with great strength, these always\r\ndesire to encounter Arjuna in fight. And Karna also of the Suta caste is\r\na mighty warrior versed in celestial weapons. In respect of the impetus\r\nof his weapons, he is endued with the strength of the Wind-god. Himself\r\nlike a flame of fire, the arrows (proceeding from him) constitute its\r\ntongues. The slaps of his left hand cased in leathern fence constitute\r\nthe crackling of that flame. The dust of the battle-field is its smoke.\r\nUrged by the sons of Dhritarashtra even as the wind urgeth the fire,\r\nKarna like unto the all-consuming fire at the end of the Yuga that is\r\nsent by Death himself, will, without doubt, consume my troops like unto a\r\nheap of straw. Only that mighty mass of clouds called Arjuna, aided by\r\nKrishna like unto a powerful wind, with celestial weapon representing its\r\nfierce lightning, the white steeds, the rows of white cranes coursing\r\nunderneath and the unbearable Gandiva, the rainbow ahead, is capable of\r\nextinguishing the blazing flame represented by Karna by means of its\r\narrowy showers let off with unflagging steadiness. That conqueror of\r\nhostile cities, Vibhatsu, will, without doubt, succeed in obtaining from\r\nIndra himself all the celestial weapons with their fullness and life.\r\nAlone he is equal, I think, unto them all. Otherwise it is impossible\r\n(for us) to vanquish in fight all those foes, who have attained to\r\neminent success in all their purposes. We shall behold Arjuna, that\r\nrepressor of foes, fully equipped with celestial weapons, for Vibhatsu\r\nhaving once undertaken a task, never, droopeth under its weight. Without\r\nthat hero, however, that best of men, ourselves, with Krishna, cannot be\r\nat rest in Kamyaka. Therefore, do thou mention some other wood that is\r\nsacred and delightful, and abounds in food and fruits, and that is\r\ninhabited by men of pious practices:--where we may pass some time,\r\nexpecting the warlike Arjuna of unbaffled prowess, like the Chataka in\r\nexpectation of gathering clouds. Do thou tell us of some asylums open to\r\nthe regenerate ones, and lakes and streams and beautiful mountains. O\r\nBrahmana, deprived of Arjuna, I do not like to stay in this wood of\r\nKamyaka. We wish to go somewhere else.'\""

O king, listen to me as I speak,\r\nthyself with the daughter of Drupada and thy brothers, wilt, O lord of\r\nmen, be relieved from grief. And, O son of Pandu, by hearing only of\r\nthese places, thou wilt acquire merit. And by visiting them thou wilt\r\nobtain merit a hundred times greater, O best of men! First, O king, I\r\nwill, so far as I recollect, speak of the beautiful eastern country, much\r\nregarded, O Yudhishthira, by royal Rishis. In that direction, O Bharata\r\nis a place called Naimisha which is regarded by the celestials. There in\r\nthat region are several sacred tirthas belonging to the gods. There also\r\nis the sacred and beautiful Gomati which is adored by celestial Rishis\r\nand there also in [possibly 'is'?--JBH] the sacrificial region of the\r\ngods and the sacrificial stake of Surya. In that quarter also is that\r\nbest of hills called Gaya, which is sacred and much regarded by royal\r\nascetics. There on that hill, is the auspicious lake called Brahmasara\r\nwhich is adored by celestial Rishis. It is for this that the ancients say\r\nthat one should wish for many sons, so that even one among them may visit\r\nGaya, celebrate the horse-sacrifice or give away a nila bull, and thereby\r\ndeliver ten generations of his race up and down. There, O monarch, is a\r\ngreat river, and spot called Gayasira. In Gayasira is a banian, which is\r\ncalled by the Brahmanas the Eternal banian, for the food that is offered\r\nthere to the Pitris becometh eternal, O exalted one! The great river that\r\nfloweth by the place is known by the name of Phalgu, and its waters are\r\nall sacred. And, O bull among the Bharatas, there also, in that place, is\r\nthe Kausiki, whose basin abounds in various fruit and roots, and where\r\nViswamitra endued with wealth of asceticism acquired Brahmanahood.\r\nTowards that direction also is the sacred Ganga, on whose banks\r\nBhagiratha celebrated many sacrifices with profuse gifts (to Brahmanas).\r\nThey say that in the country of Panchala, there is a wood called Utpala,\r\nwhere Viswamitra of Kusika's race had performed sacrifices with his son,\r\nand where beholding the relics of Viswamitra's superhuman power, Rama,\r\nthe son of Jamadagni, recited the praises of his ancestry. At Kamyaka,\r\nKusika's son had quaffed the Soma juice with Indra. Then abandoning the\r\nKshatriya order, he began to say, I am a Brahmana.' In that quarter, O\r\nhero is the sacred confluence of Ganga and Yamuna which is celebrated\r\nover the world. Holy and sin-destroying, that tirtha is much regarded by\r\nthe Rishis. It is there that the soul of all things, the Grandsire, had,\r\nin olden days, performed his sacrifice, and it is for this, O chief of\r\nthe Bharata race, that the place hath come to be called Prayaga. In this\r\ndirection, O foremost of kings, lieth the excellent asylum of Agastya, O\r\nmonarch, and the forest called Tapasa, decked by many ascetics. And there\r\nalso is the great tirtha called Hiranyavinda on the Kalanjara hills, and\r\nthat best of mountains called Agastya, which is beautiful, sacred and\r\nauspicious. In that quarter, O descendant of the Kuru race, is the\r\nmountain called Mahendra, sacred to the illustrious Rama of the Bhrigu\r\nrace. There, O son of Kunti, the Grandsire performed sacrifices of yore.\r\nThere, O Yudhishthira, the sacred Bhagiratha entereth a lake and there\r\nalso, O king, is that sacred river known by the name of the\r\nmerit-bestowing Brahmasara, whose banks are inhabited by persons whose\r\nsins have been washed away, and whose sight alone produceth merit. In\r\nthat direction also lieth the high-souled Matanga's excellent asylum,\r\ncalled Kedara which is sacred and auspicious and celebrated over the\r\nworld. And there also is the mountain called Kundoda, which is so\r\ndelightful and abounding in fruits and roots and waters, and where the\r\nking of the Nishadhas (Nala) had slaked his thirst and rested for a\r\nwhile. In that quarter also is the delightful Deva-vana which is graced\r\nby ascetics. There also are the rivers Vahuda and Nanda on the mountain's\r\ncrest. O mighty king, I have described unto thee all the tirthas and\r\nsacred spots in the Eastern quarter.

In that direction\r\nalso are the rivers Venna and Bhimarathi, both capable of destroying sin\r\nand fear, and abounding in birds and deer, and graced with abodes of\r\nascetics. In that region also, O bull of the Bharata race, is the tirtha\r\nof the royal ascetic, Nriga viz., the river Payoshni, which is delightful\r\nand full of waters and visited by Brahmanas. There the illustrious\r\nMarkandeya, of high ascetic merit sang the praises in verse of king\r\nNriga's line! We have heard respecting the sacrificing king Nriga that\r\nwhich really took place while he was performing a sacrifice in the\r\nexcellent tirtha called Varaha on the Payoshni. In that sacrifice Indra\r\nbecame intoxicated with quaffing the Soma, and the Brahmanas, with the\r\ngifts they received. The water of the Payoshni, taken up (in vessel), or\r\nflowing along the ground, or conveyed by the wind, can cleanse a person\r\nfrom whatever sins he may commit till the day of his death. Higher than\r\nheaven itself, and pure, and created and bestowed by the trident-bearing\r\ngod, there in that tirtha is an image of Mahadeva beholding which a\r\nmortal goeth to the region of Siva.

And, O Yudhishthira, in the\r\ncountry of the Pandyas are the tirthas named Agastya and Varuna! And, O\r\nbull among men, there, amongst the Pandavas, is the tirtha called the\r\nKumaris. Listen, O son of Kunti, I shall now describe Tamraparni. In that\r\nasylum the gods had undergone penances impelled by the desire of\r\nobtaining salvation. In that region also is the lake of Gokarna which is\r\ncelebrated over the three worlds, hath an abundance of cool waters, and\r\nis sacred, auspicious, and capable, O child, of producing great merit.\r\nThat lake is extremely difficult of access to men of unpurified souls.\r\nNear to that tirtha is the sacred asylum of Agastya's disciple, the\r\nmountain Devasabha, which abounds in trees and grass, and fruits and\r\nroots. And there also is the Vaiduryya mountain, which is delightful\r\nabounding in gems and capable of bestowing great merit. There on that\r\nmountain is the asylum of Agastya abounding in fruits and roots and\r\nwater.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall now, O lord of men, describe the sacred spots, and asylums, and\r\nrivers and lakes belonging to the Surashtra country! O Yudhishthira, the\r\nBrahmanas say that on the sea-coast is the Chamasodbheda, and also\r\nPrabhasa, that tirtha which is much regarded by the gods. There also is\r\nthe tirtha called Pindaraka, frequented by ascetics and capable of\r\nproducing great merit. In that region is a mighty hill named Ujjayanta\r\nwhich conduceth to speedy success. Regarding it the celestial Rishi\r\nNarada of great intelligence hath recited an ancient sloka. Do thou\r\nlisten to it, O Yudhishthira! By performing austerities on the sacred\r\nhill of Ujjayanta in Surashtra, that abounds in birds and animals, a\r\nperson becometh regarded in heaven. There also is Dwaravati, producing\r\ngreat merit, where dwelleth the slayer of Madhu, who is the Ancient one\r\nin embodied form, and eternal virtue. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas, and\r\npersons acquainted with the philosophy of the soul say that the\r\nillustrious Krishna is eternal Virtue.

There, O subjugator of hostile cities, is the sacred river called\r\nViswamitra belonging to the royal sage of that name and which abounds, O\r\nking, in many sacred tirthas. It was on the banks of this river, that\r\nYayati, the son of Nahusha, (fell from heaven) among the virtuous, and\r\nobtained once more the eternal regions of the righteous. Here also are\r\nthe well-known lake called Punya, the mountain called Mainaka, and that\r\nother mountain called Asita abounding in fruits and roots. And here also\r\nis the sacred asylum of Kakshasena, and O Yudhishthira, the asylum of\r\nChyavana also, which is famed over every country, O son of Pandu! In that\r\nspot, O exalted one, men attain to (ascetic) success without severe\r\nausterities. Here also, O mighty king, is the region called Jamvumarga,\r\ninhabited by birds and deer, and which constitutes the retreat of\r\nascetics with souls under control, O thou foremost of those that have\r\nsubdued their senses! Next lie the exceedingly sacred Ketumala, and\r\nMedhya ever graced with ascetics, and, O lord of earth, Gangadwara, and\r\nthe well-known woods of Saindhava which are sacred and inhabited by the\r\nregenerate ones. There also is the celebrated tank of the Grandsire,\r\ncalled Pushkara, the favourite abode of the Vaikanasas, and Siddhas and\r\nRishis. Moved by the desire of obtaining its protection, the Creator sang\r\nthis verse at Pushkara, O chief of the Kurus and foremost of virtuous\r\nmen! If a person of pure soul purposes a pilgrimage to the Pushkaras in\r\nimagination even, he becometh purged from all his sins and rejoiceth in\r\nheaven!'\""

By hearing this narration, O hero, one\r\nacquireth a reverential frame of mind, which conduceth to much good. In\r\nthat region is the highly sacred Saraswati abounding in tirthas and with\r\nbanks easy of descent. There also, O son of Pandu, is the ocean-going and\r\nimpetuous Yamuna, and the tirtha called Plakshavatarana, productive of\r\nhigh merit and prosperity. It was there that the regenerate ones having\r\nperformed the Saraswata sacrifice, bathed on the completion there of. O\r\nsinless one, is the well-known celestial tirtha called Agnisiras, which\r\nis productive of great merit. There king Sahadeva had celebrated a\r\nsacrifice measuring out the ground by a throw of the Samya. It is for\r\nthis reason, O Yudhishthira, that Indra sang the praises of Sahadeva in\r\nverse. Those verses are still current in this world, being recited by the\r\nregenerate ones, e. g., on the Yamuna Sahadeva worshipped the sacrificial\r\nfire, with gifts in a hundred thousands to Brahmanas. There the\r\nillustrious king, the imperial Bharata, performed five and thirty\r\nhorse-sacrifices. O child, we have heard that Sarabhanga of yore used to\r\nfully gratify the desires of the regenerate ones. There in this region is\r\nhis celebrated asylum productive of great merit. In that region also, O\r\nson of Pritha, is the river Saraswati, which is ever worshipped by the\r\ngod, where, in days of yore, the Valikhilyas, O great king, performed\r\nsacrifices. In that region also, O Yudhishthira, is the well-known river\r\nDrisadwati, which is productive of great merit. Then, O chief of men, are\r\nNyagrodhakhya, and Panchalya, and Punyaka and Dalbhyaghosha, and Dalbhya,\r\nwhich are, O son of Kunti, the sacred asylum in the world of illustrious\r\nAnandayasas of excellent vows and great energy, and which are celebrated\r\nover the three worlds. Here also, O lord of men, the illustrious Etavarna\r\nand Avavarana versed in the Vedas, learned in Vedic lore, and proficient\r\nin the knowledge of Vedic rites, performed meritorious sacrifices, O\r\nchief of the Bharata race! There also is Visakhayupa to which, in days of\r\nyore, came the gods with Varuna and Indra, and practised ascetic\r\nausterities. And therefore is that spot so eminently sacred. Here also is\r\nPalasaka, where the great and illustrious and highly blessed Rishi\r\nJamadagni performed sacrifices. There all the principal rivers in their\r\nembodied forms taking their respective waters stood surrounding that best\r\nof sages. And there also, O monarch, Vibhavasu (fire) himself, beholding\r\nthat high-souled one's initiation, sang the following sloka: 'The river\r\ncoming to the illustrious Jamadagni while sacrificing unto the gods\r\ngratified the Brahmanas with offerings of honey.' O Yudhishthira, the\r\nspot where Ganga rusheth past, cleaving the foremost of mountains which\r\nis frequented by Gandharvas and Yakshas and Rakshasas and Apsaras, and\r\ninhabited by hunters, and Kinnaras, is called Gangadwara. O king,\r\nSanatkumara regardeth that spot visited by Brahmarshis, as also the\r\ntirtha Kanakhala (that is near to it), as sacred. There also is the\r\nmountain named Puru which is resorted to by great Rishis and where\r\nPururavas was born, and Bhrigu practised ascetic austerities. For this it\r\nis, O king, that asylum hath become known as the great peak of\r\nBhrigutunga. Near that peak is the sacred and extensive Vadari, that\r\nhighly meritorious asylum, famed over the three worlds, of him, O bull of\r\nthe Bharata race, who is the Present, the Past and the Future, who is\r\ncalled Narayana and the lord Vishnu, who is eternal and the best of male\r\nbeings, and who is pre-eminently illustrious. Near Vadari, the cool\r\ncurrent of Ganga was formerly warm, and the banks there were overspread\r\nwith golden sands. There the gods and Rishis of high fortune and\r\nexceeding effulgence, approaching the divine lord Narayana, always\r\nworship him. The entire universe with all its tirthas and holy spots is\r\nthere where dwelleth the divine and eternal Narayana, the Supreme soul,\r\nfor he is Merit, he is the Supreme Brahma, he is tirtha, he is the\r\nascetic retreat, he is the First, he is the foremost of gods, and he is\r\nthe great Lord of all creatures. He is eternal, he is the great Creator,\r\nand he is the highest state of blessedness. Learned persons versed in the\r\nscriptures attain to great happiness by knowing him. In that spot are the\r\ncelestial Rishis, the Siddhas, and, indeed, all the Rishis,--where\r\ndwelleth the slayer of Madhu, that primeval Deity and mighty Yogin! Let\r\nno doubt enter thy heart that that spot is the foremost of all holy\r\nspots. These, O lord of earth, are the tirthas and sacred spots on earth,\r\nthat I have recited, O best of men! These all are visited by the Vasus,\r\nthe Sadhyas, the Adityas, the Marutas, the Aswins and the illustrious\r\nRishis resembling the celestials themselves. By journeying, O son of\r\nKunti, to those places, with the Brahmanas and ascetics that are with\r\nthee and with thy blessed brothers, thou wilt be freed from anxiety!\""

And the king, who was the eldest of Pandu's sons, with his\r\nfollowers and those Brahmanas sat round the highly righteous one, like\r\ncelestials in heaven sitting round Sakra. And having received him duly,\r\nYudhishthira the just enquired after the reason of his arrival, and the\r\nobject also of his wanderings. Thus asked by Pandu's son, the illustrious\r\nascetic, well-pleased, replied in sweet words delighting the Pandavas,\r\n'Travelling at will, O Kaunteya, over all the regions, I came to Sakra's\r\nabode, and saw there the lord of the celestials. There, I saw thy heroic\r\nbrother capable of wielding the bow with his left hand, seated on the\r\nsame seat with Sakra. And beholding Partha on that seat I was greatly\r\nastonished, O tiger among men! And the lord of the celestials then said\r\nunto me, 'Go thou unto the sons of Pandu.' At the request, therefore, of\r\nIndra as also of the high-souled son of Pritha have I come hither with\r\nspeed, desiring to see thee with thy younger brothers. O child, I will\r\nrelate what will please thee highly, O son of Pandu! Do thou listen to\r\nit, O king, with Krishna and the Rishis that are with thee. O bull of the\r\nBharata race, Partha hath obtained from Rudra that incomparable weapon\r\nfor the acquisition of which thou hadst sent him to heaven. That fierce\r\nweapon, known by the name of Brahma-sira which arose after Amrita, and\r\nwhich Rudra had obtained by means of ascetic austerities, hath been\r\nacquired by Arjuna together with the Mantras for hurling and withdrawing\r\nit, and the rites of expiation and revival. And, O Yudhishthira, Arjuna\r\nof immeasurable prowess hath also acquired Vajras and Dandas and other\r\ncelestial weapons from Yama and Kuvera and Varuna and Indra, O son of the\r\nKuru race! And he hath also thoroughly learnt music, both vocal and\r\ninstrumental, and dancing and proper recitation of the Saman (Veda) from\r\nVishwavasu's son. And having thus acquired weapons and mastered the\r\nGandharva Veda, thy third brother Vibhatsu liveth happily (in heaven).\r\nListen to me, O Yudhishthira, for I shall now deliver to thee the message\r\nof that foremost of celestials. He hath commanded me saying, \"Thou wilt,\r\nno doubt, go to the world of men. O best of Brahmanas, tell thou\r\nYudhishthira these words of mine. Soon will thy brother Arjuna come to\r\nthee, having acquired arms and accomplished a great deed for the\r\ncelestials that is incapable of being accomplished by themselves. Do thou\r\nmeanwhile devote thyself to ascetic austerities, with thy brothers. There\r\nis nothing superior to asceticism, and it is by asceticism that a person\r\nachieveth great results. And, O bull of the Bharata race, well do I know\r\nthat Karna is endued with great ardour and energy and strength and\r\nprowess that is incapable of being baffled. Well do I know that, skilled\r\nin fierce conflict, he hath not his rival in battle; that he is a mighty\r\nbowman, a hero deft in the use of fierce weapons and cased in the best of\r\nmail. Well do I know that that exalted son of Aditya resembleth the son\r\nof Maheswara himself. Well do I also know the high natural prowess of the\r\nbroad-shouldered Arjuna. In battle Karna is not equal unto even a\r\nsixteenth part of Pritha's son. And as for the fear of Karna which is in\r\nthy heart, O repressor of foes, I shall dispel when Savyasachin will have\r\nleft heaven. And as regards thy purpose, O hero, to set out on a\r\npilgrimage to tirthas, the great Rishi Lomasa will, without doubt, speak\r\nunto thee. And whatever that regenerate Rishi will relate unto thee\r\ntouching the merits of asceticism and tirthas, thou shouldst receive with\r\nrespect and not otherwise!'\""

Endued with wealth of asceticism, thou art\r\nconversant with the highest morality, with ascetic austerities of every\r\nkind, with the eternal duties of kings blessed with prosperity, and the\r\nhigh and sanctifying merit that men obtain from tirthas. Persuade thou\r\nthe sons of Pandu to acquire the merit attaching to tirthas. Do thou with\r\nthy whole soul persuade the king to visit the tirthas and give away\r\nkine.' This is what Arjuna said unto me. Indeed he also said, 'Let him\r\nvisit all the tirthas protected by thee. Thou wilt also protect him from\r\nRakshasas, and watch over him in inaccessible regions and rugged mountain\r\nbreasts. And as Dadhichi had protected Indra, and Angiras had protected\r\nthe Sun, so do thou, O best of regenerate ones, protect the sons of Kunti\r\nfrom Rakshasas.

Obedient to the words of Indra and at the request of\r\nArjuna also protecting thee from dangers, I shall wander with thee.\r\nBefore this, O son of the Kuru race, I have twice visited the tirthas.\r\nWith thee I shall repair to them for the third time. O Yudhishthira, Manu\r\nand other royal Rishis of meritorious deeds had undertaken journeys to\r\ntirthas. Indeed, a trip to them is capable of dispelling all fear, O\r\nking! They that are crooked-minded, they that have not their souls under\r\ncontrol, they that are illiterate and perverse, do not, O Kauravya, bathe\r\nin tirthas. But thou art ever of a virtuous disposition and conversant\r\nwith morality and firm in thy promises. Thou wilt surely be able to free\r\nthyself from the world.

Who can be more fortunate than\r\nhe who is remembered even by the lord of the celestials? Who can be more\r\nfortunate than he who hath been favoured with thy company, who hath\r\nDhananjaya for a brother, and who is thought of by Vasava himself? As to\r\nthy words, O illustrious one, in respect of a trip to the tirthas, my\r\nmind had already been made up at the words of Dhaumya. O Brahmana, I\r\nshall start, at whatever hour thou mayst be pleased to appoint, on the\r\nproposed journey to tirthas. Even this is my firm resolve!'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Lomasa then said unto Yudhishthira, who had made\r\nup his mind to start on the proposed journey, 'O mighty king, be thou\r\nlight as regards thy retinue, for by this thou wilt be able to go more\r\neasily!'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira then said, 'Let those mendicants and Brahmanas and Yogis\r\nthat are incapable of bearing hunger and thirst, the fatigues of travel\r\nand toil, and the severity of winter, desist. Let those Brahmanas also\r\ndesist that live on sweetmeats, and they also that desire cooked viands\r\nand food that is sucked or drunk as well as meat. And let those also\r\nremain behind that are dependent on cooks. Let those citizens that have\r\nfollowed me from motives of loyalty, and whom I have hitherto kept on\r\nproper stipends, repair to king Dhritarashtra. He will give them their\r\nallowances in due time. If, however, that king refuses to grant them\r\nproper allowances, the king of the Panchalas will, for our satisfaction\r\nand welfare, give them these.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"And thereupon oppressed with grief, the citizens\r\nand the principal Brahmanas and Yatis set out for Hastinapura.

I think, however, that my enemies are destitute of\r\ngood qualities and even destitute of morality. Yet why, O Lomasa, do they\r\nprosper in this world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Grieve not ever, O king, O son of Pritha, that sinful men\r\nshould often prosper in consequence of the sins they commit. A man may be\r\nseen to prosper by his sins, obtain good therefrom and vanquish his foes.\r\nDestruction, however, overtakes him to the roots. O king, I have seen\r\nmany Daityas and Danavas prosper by sin but I have also seen destruction\r\novertake them. O exalted one, I have seen all this in the righteous age\r\nof yore. The gods practised virtue, while the Asuras abandoned it. The\r\ngods visited the tirthas, while the Asuras did not visit them. And at\r\nfirst the sinful Asuras were possessed with pride. And pride begat vanity\r\nand vanity begat wrath. And from wrath arose every kind of evil\r\npropensities, and from these latter sprang shamelessness. And in\r\nconsequence of shamelessness, good behaviour disappeared from among them.\r\nAnd because they had become shameless and destitute of virtuous\r\npropensities and good conduct and virtuous vows, forgiveness and\r\nprosperity and morality forsook them in no time. And prosperity then, O\r\nking, sought the gods, while adversity sought the Asuras. And when the\r\nDaityas and the Danavas, deprived of sense by pride, were possessed by\r\nadversity. Kali also sought to possess them. And, O son of Kunti,\r\noverwhelmed with pride, and destitute of rites and sacrifices, and devoid\r\nof reason and feeling, and their hearts full of vanity, destruction\r\novertook them soon. And covered with infamy, the Daityas were soon\r\nexterminated.

And because the gods always performed sacrifices and holy\r\ndeeds abandoning every practice that was evil, and visited the tirthas,\r\nas the consequence thereof they acquired great good fortune. Guided by\r\nthis, O king, do thou also, with thy brothers, bathe in tirthas, for then\r\nthou wilt obtain prosperity once more. Even this is the eternal road.\r\nAnd, O monarch, as king Nriga and Shivi and Ausinara and Bhagiratha and\r\nVasumanas and Gaya and Puru and Pururavas, by practising ascetic penances\r\nand visiting tirthas and touching sacred waters and beholding illustrious\r\nascetics, obtained fame and sanctity and merit and wealth, so wilt thou\r\nalso obtain prosperity that is great. And as Ikshwaku with his sons,\r\nfriends and followers, as Muchukunda and Mandhatri and king Marutta, as\r\nthe gods through power of asceticism and the celestial Rishis also, had\r\nall obtained fame, so wilt thou also obtain great celebrity.

O\r\nking, reaching the Gomati, the Pandavas bathed in the sacred tirtha of\r\nthat stream, and having performed their ablutions there, they gave away,\r\nO Bharata, both kine and wealth! And repeatedly offering oblations of\r\nwater, O Bharata, to the gods, the pitris, and the Brahmanas, in the\r\ntirthas called Kanya, Aswa, and Go and staying (as directed) in Kalakoti\r\nand the Vishaprastha hills, the Kauravas then, O king, reached Vahuda and\r\nperformed their ablution in that stream. Proceeding next, O lord of\r\nearth, to the sacrificial region of the gods known by the name Prayaga,\r\nthey bathed in the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna and residing there\r\npractised ascetic penances of great merit. And the Pandavas, of truthful\r\npromises, bathing in the tirtha, cleansed themselves of every sin. The\r\nsons of Pandu then, O king of the Bharata race, accompanied by those\r\nBrahmanas, proceeded to the tirtha called Vedi, sacred to the Creator and\r\nadored by the ascetics. Residing there for some time and gratifying the\r\nBrahmanas with the fruit and roots of the wilderness and clarified\r\nbutter, those heroes began to practise ascetic penances of great merit.\r\nThey then proceeded to Mahidhara consecrated by that virtuous royal sage\r\nGaya of unrivalled splendour. In that region is the hill called Gayasira,\r\nas well as the delightful river called Mahanadi, with fine banks graced\r\nby bushes of canes. On that celestial hill of holy peaks is a sacred\r\ntirtha called Brahmasara  which is much adored by ascetics. There on the\r\nbanks of that lake had dwelt of yore the eternal god himself of justice,\r\nand it was thither that the illustrious Rishi Agastya had repaired to\r\nbehold that deity. It is from that lake that all the rivers take their\r\nrise and there in that tirtha, Mahadeva the wielder of the Pinaka, is\r\npresent for aye. Arriving at that spot, the heroic sons of Pandu\r\npractised the vow that is known by the name of the Chaturmasya according\r\nto all the rites and ordinances of the great sacrifice called Rishiyajna.\r\nIt is there that that mighty tree called the Eternal banian stands. Any\r\nsacrifice performed there produces merit that is eternal. In that\r\nsacrificial platform of the gods producing eternal merit, the Pandavas\r\nbegan to fast with concentrated souls. And there came unto them Brahmanas\r\nby hundreds endued with wealth of asceticism. And those Brahmanas also\r\nall performed the Chaturmasya sacrifice according to the rites inculcated\r\nby the Rishis. And there in that tirtha, those Brahmanas old in knowledge\r\nand ascetic merit and fully versed in the Vedas, that constituted the\r\ncourt of the illustrious sons of Pandu, talked in their presence upon\r\nvarious subject of sacred import. And it was in that place that the\r\nlearned vow-observing, and sacred Shamatha, leading, besides, a life of\r\ncelibacy, spake unto them, O king, of Gaya, the son of Amurttaraya. And\r\nShamatha said, 'Gaya, the son of Amurttaraya, was one of the foremost of\r\nroyal sages. Listen to me, O Bharata, as I recite his meritorious deeds.\r\nIt was here, O king, that Gaya had performed many sacrifices\r\ndistinguished by the enormous quantities of food (that were distributed)\r\nand the profuse gifts that were given away (unto Brahmanas). Those\r\nsacrifices, O king, were distinguished by mountains in hundreds and\r\nthousands of cooked rice, lakes of clarified butter and rivers of curds\r\nin many hundreds, and streams of richly-dressed curries in thousands. Day\r\nafter day were these got ready and distributed amongst all comers, while,\r\nover and above this, Brahmanas and others, O king, received food that was\r\nclean and pure. During the conclusion also (of every sacrifice) when\r\ngifts were dedicated to the Brahmanas, the chanting of the Vedas reached\r\nthe heavens. And so loud, indeed, was the sound of the Vedic Mantras that\r\nnothing else, O Bharata, could be heard there. Thus sacred sounds, O\r\nking, filled the earth, the points of the horizon, the sky and heaven\r\nitself. Even these were the wonders that persons noticed on those\r\noccasions. And gratified with the excellent viands and drinks that the\r\nillustrious Gaya provided, men, O bull of the Bharata race, went about\r\nsinging these verses. In Gaya's great sacrifice, who is there today,\r\namongst creatures, that still desireth to eat? There are yet twenty-five\r\nmountains of food there after all have been fed!

It was here that that\r\nforemost of speakers, king Yudhishthira asked Lomasa as to why Agastya\r\nhad slain Vatapi there. And the king also enquired after the extent of\r\nthat man-destroying Daitya's prowess, and the reason also of the\r\nillustrious Agastya's wrath being excited against that Asura.\r\n\r\n\"Thus questioned, Lomasa said, 'O son of Kuru race, there was in the city\r\ncalled Manimati, in days of yore, a Daitya named Ilwala, whose younger\r\nbrother was Vatapi. One day that son of Diti addressed the Brahmana\r\nendued with ascetic merit, saying, 'O holy one, grant me a son equal unto\r\nIndra.' The Brahmana, however, did not grant the Asura a son like Indra.\r\nAnd at this, the Asura was inflamed with wrath against the Brahmana. And\r\nfrom that day, O king, the Asura Ilwala became a destroyer of Brahmanas.\r\nAnd endued with power of illusion the angry Asura transformed his brother\r\ninto a ram. And Vatapi also capable of assuming any form at will, would\r\nimmediately assume the shape of a ram. And the flesh of that ram, after\r\nbeing properly dressed, was offered to Brahmanas as food. And after they\r\nhad eaten of it, they were slain. For whomsoever Ilwala summoned with his\r\nvoice, he would come back to Ilwala even if he had gone to the abode of\r\nYama, in re-embodied form endued with life, and show himself to Ilwala.\r\nAnd so having transformed the Asura Vatapi into a ram and properly cooked\r\nhis flesh and feeding Brahmanas therewith, he would summon Vatapi. And\r\nthe mighty Asura Vatapi, that foe of Brahmanas, endued with great\r\nstrength and power of illusion, hearing, O king, those sounds uttered\r\nwith a loud voice by Ilwala, and ripping open the flanks of the Brahmana\r\nwould come laughingly out, O lord of earth! And it was thus, O monarch,\r\nthat the wicked-hearted Daitya Ilwala, having fed Brahmanas, frequently\r\ntook away their lives.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, the illustrious Agastya beheld his deceased ancestors hanging\r\nin a pit with heads downwards. And he asked those personages thus\r\nsuspended in that hole, saying, 'What is the matter with you? Thus\r\nquestioned those utterers of Brahma replied, 'It is even for offspring.'\r\nAnd they also told him, 'We are your ancestors. It is even for offspring\r\nthat we stay suspended in this pit. If O Agastya, thou canst beget us a\r\ngood son, we may then be saved from this hell and thou also wilt obtain\r\nthy blessed state of those having offspring.' Endued with great energy\r\nand observant of truth and morality Agastya replied, saying, 'Ye Pitris,\r\nI will accomplish your desire. Let this anxiety of yours be dispelled.'\r\nAnd the illustrious Rishi then began to think of perpetuating his race.\r\nBut he saw not a wife worthy of him on whom he himself could take his\r\nbirth in the form of a son. The Rishi accordingly, taking those parts\r\nthat were regarded as highly beautiful, from creatures possessing them,\r\ncreated therewith an excellent woman. And the Muni, endued with great\r\nascetic merit, thereupon gave that girl created for himself to the king\r\nof the Vidharbhas who was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining\r\noffspring. And that blessed girl of sweet face (thus disposed of) then\r\ntook her birth (in Vidarbha's royal line) and, beautiful as the effulgent\r\nlightning, her limbs began to grow day by day. And as soon as that lord\r\nof earth--the ruler of the Vidarbhas--saw her ushered into life, he\r\njoyfully communicated the intelligence, O Bharata, unto the Brahmanas.\r\nAnd the Brahmanas thereupon, O lord of earth, blessed the girl and they\r\nbestowed upon her the name Lopamudra. And possessed of great beauty, she\r\nbegan, O monarch, to grow quickly like unto a lotus in the midst of water\r\nor the effulgent flame of a fire. And when the girl grew and attained to\r\npuberty, a hundred virgins decked in ornaments and a hundred maids waited\r\nin obedience upon her blessed self. And surrounded by those hundred maids\r\nand virgins, she shone in their midst, endued as she was with bright\r\neffulgence, like Rohini in the firmament amid an inferior multitude of\r\nstars. And possessed as she was of good behaviour and excellent manners,\r\nnone dared ask for her hand even when she attained to puberty, through\r\nfear of her father, the king of the Vidharbhas. And Lopamudra, devoted to\r\ntruth, surpassing the Apsaras even in beauty, gratified her father and\r\nrelatives by means of her conduct. And her father, beholding his\r\ndaughter-the princess of Vidharbha-attain to puberty, began to reflect in\r\nhis mind, saying, 'To whom should I give this daughter of mine?'\""

Thus addressed by the Muni, the king of\r\nthe Vidharbhas swooned away. And though unwilling to give the Muni his\r\ndaughter, he dared not refuse. And that lord of earth then, approaching\r\nhis queen, said, 'This Rishi is endued with great energy. If angry, he\r\nmay consume me with the fire of his curse. O thou of sweet face, tell me\r\nwhat is thy wish.\" Hearing these words of the king, she uttered not a\r\nword.

Bestow me on Agastya, and, O father,\r\nsave thyself, by giving me away.' And at these words of his daughter, O\r\nmonarch, the king gave away Lopamudra unto the illustrious Agastya with\r\ndue rites. And obtaining her as wife, Agastya addressed Lopamudra,\r\nsaying, 'Cast thou away these costly robes and ornaments.' And at these\r\nwords of her lord, that large-eyed damsel of thighs tapering as the stem\r\nof the plantain tree cast away her handsome and costly robes of fine\r\ntexture. And casting them away she dressed herself in rags and barks and\r\ndeerskins, and became her husband's equal in vows and acts. And\r\nproceeding then to Gangadwara that illustrious and best of Rishis began\r\nto practise the severest penances along with his helpful wife. And\r\nLopamudra herself, well pleased, began to serve her lord from the deep\r\nrespect that she bore him. And the exalted Agastya also began to manifest\r\ngreat love for his wife.\r\n\r\n\"After a considerable time, O king, the illustrious Rishi one day beheld\r\nLopamudra, blazing in ascetic splendour come up after the bath in her\r\nseason. And pleased with the girl, for her services, her purity, and self\r\ncontrol, as also with her grace and beauty, he summoned her for marital\r\nintercourse. The girl, however, joining her hands, bashfully but lovingly\r\naddressed the Rishi, saying, 'The husband, without doubt, weddeth the\r\nwife for offspring. But it behoveth thee, O Rishi, to show that love to\r\nme which I have for thee. And it behoveth thee, O regenerate one, to\r\napproach me on a bed like to that which I had in the palace of my father.\r\nI also desire that thou shouldst be decked in garlands of flowers and\r\nother ornaments, and that I should approach thee adorned in those\r\ncelestial ornaments that I like. Otherwise, I cannot approach thee,\r\ndressed in these rags dyed in red. Nor, O regenerate Rishi, it is sinful\r\nto wear ornaments (on such an occasion).' Hearing these words of his\r\nwife, Agastya replied, 'O blessed girl, O thou of slender waist, I have\r\nnot wealth like what thy father hath, O Lopamudra!' She answered saying,\r\n'Thou who art endued with wealth of asceticism, art certainly able to\r\nbring hither within a moment, by ascetic power, everything that exists in\r\nthe world of men.' Agastya said, 'It is even so as thou hast said. That,\r\nhowever, would waste my ascetic merit. O bid me do that which may not\r\nloosen my ascetic merit.' Lopamudra then said, 'O thou endued with wealth\r\nof asceticism, my season will not last long, I do not desire, however, to\r\napproach thee otherwise. Nor do I desire to diminish thy (ascetic) merit\r\nin any way. It behoveth thee, however, to do as I desire, without\r\ninjuring thy virtue.'\r\n\r\n\"'Agastya then said, 'O blessed girl, if this be the resolve that thou\r\nhast settled in thy heart, I will go out in quest of wealth.

And that prince of Asuras received\r\nthem hospitably, entertaining them, O son of the Kuru race, with well\r\ndressed meat supplied by his brother Vatapi (transformed into a ram).\r\nThen all those royal sages, beholding the mighty Asura Vatapi, who had\r\nbeen transformed into a ram thus cooked for them, became sad and\r\ncheerless and were nearly deprived of themselves. But that best of\r\nRishis--Agastya--addressing those royal sages, said, 'Yield ye not to\r\ngrief, I will eat up the great Asura.' And the mighty Rishi then sat\r\nhimself down on an excellent seat, and the prince of Asuras, Ilwala,\r\nbegan to distribute the food smilingly. And Agastya ate up the whole of\r\nthe meat supplied by Vatapi (transformed into a ram). And after the\r\ndinner was over, Ilwala began to summon his brother. But thereupon a\r\nquantity of air alone came out of the illustrious Rishi's stomach, with a\r\nsound that was as loud, O child, as the roar of the clouds. And Ilwala\r\nrepeatedly said, 'Come out, O Vatapi!' Then that best of\r\nMunis--Agastya--bursting out in laughter, said, 'How can he come out? I\r\nhave already digested that great Asura.' And beholding his brother\r\nalready digested, Ilwala became sad and cheerless and joining his hands,\r\nalong with his ministers, addressing the Rishi (and his companions),\r\nsaid, 'What for have ye come hither, and what can I do for you?' And\r\nAgastya smilingly answered Ilwala, saying, 'We know thee, O Asura, to be\r\npossessed of great power and also enormous wealth. These kings are not\r\nvery wealthy while my need also of wealth is great. Give us what thou\r\ncanst, without injuring others.' Thus addressed Ilwala saluted the Rishi\r\nand said, 'If thou say what it is that I mean to give, then will I give\r\nyou wealth.' Hearing this Agastya said, 'O great Asura, thou hast even\r\npurposed to give unto each of these kings ten thousand kine and as many\r\ngold coins. And unto me thou hast purposed to give twice as much, as also\r\na car of gold and a couple of horses fleet as thought. If thou enquirest\r\nnow, thou wilt soon learn that your car is made of gold.' Thereupon, O\r\nson of Kunti, Ilwala made enquiries and learnt that the car he had\r\nintended to give away was really a golden one. And the Daitya then with a\r\nsad heart, gave away much wealth and that car, unto which were yoked two\r\nsteeds called Virava and Surava. And those steeds, O Bharata, took those\r\nkings and Agastya and all that wealth to the asylum of Agastya within the\r\ntwinkling of an eye. And those royal sages then obtaining Agastya's\r\npermission, went away to their respective cities. And Agastya also (with\r\nthat wealth) did all that his wife Lopamudra had desired. And Lopamudra\r\nthen said, 'O illustrious one, thou hast now accomplished all my wishes.\r\nBeget thou a child on me that shall be possessed of great energy.' And\r\nAgastya replied unto her, saying, 'O blessed and beauteous one, I have\r\nbeen much gratified with thy conduct. Listen thou unto me as regards the\r\nproposal I make in respect of thy offspring. Wouldst thou have a thousand\r\nsons, or a century of sons each equal to ten, or ten sons equal each to\r\nan hundred, or only one son who may vanquish a thousand?' Lopamudra\r\nanswered, 'Let me have one son equal unto a thousand, O thou endued with\r\nwealth of asceticism! One good and learned son is preferable to many evil\r\nones.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa continued, 'Saying, 'So be it,' that pious Muni thereupon knew\r\nhis devout wife of equal behaviour. And after she had conceived, he\r\nretired into the forest. And after the Muni had gone away, the foetus\r\nbegan to grow for seven years. And after the seventh year had expired,\r\nthere came out of the womb, the highly learned Dridhasyu, blazing, O\r\nBharata, in his own splendour. And the great Brahmana and illustrious\r\nascetic, endued with mighty energy, took his birth as the Rishi's son,\r\ncoming out of the womb, as if repeating the Vedas with the Upanishads and\r\nthe Angas. Endued with great energy while yet a child, he used to carry\r\nloads of sacrificial fuel into the asylum of his father, and was thence\r\ncalled Idhmavaha (carrier of sacrificial wood). And the Muni, beholding\r\nhis son possessed of such virtues, became highly glad.\r\n\r\n\"And it was thus, O Bharata, that Agastya begat an excellent son in\r\nconsequence of which his ancestors, O king, obtained the regions they\r\ndesired. And it is from that time that this spot hath become known on the\r\nearth as the asylum of Agastya. Indeed, O king, this is the asylum graced\r\nwith numerous beauties, of that Agastya who had slain Vatapi of\r\nPrahrada's race. The sacred Bhagirathi, adored by gods and Gandharvas\r\ngently runneth by, like a breeze-shaken pennon in the welkin. Yonder also\r\nshe floweth over craggy crests descending lower and lower, and looketh\r\nlike an affrighted she-snake lying along the hilly slopes. Issuing out of\r\nthe matted locks of Mahadeva, she passeth along, flooding the southern\r\ncountry and benefiting it like a mother, and ultimately mingleth with the\r\nocean as if she were his favourite bride. Bathe ye as ye like in this\r\nsacred river, ye son of Pandu! And behold there, O Yudhisthira, the\r\ntirtha of Bhrigu that is celebrated over the three worlds and adored, O\r\nking, by great Rishis. Bathing here, Rama (of Bhrigu's race) regained his\r\nmight, which had been taken away from him (by Dasaratha's son). Bathing\r\nhere, O son of Pandu, with thy brothers and Krishna, thou wilt certainly\r\nregain that energy of thine that hath been taken away by Duryodhana, even\r\nas Rama regained his that had been taken away by Dasaratha's son in\r\nhostile encounter.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"At these words of Lomasa, Yudhishthira bathed\r\nthere with his brothers and Krishna, and offered oblations of water, O\r\nBharata, to the gods and the Pitris. And, O bull among men, after\r\nYudhishthira had bathed in that tirtha, his body blazed forth in brighter\r\neffulgence, and he became invisible in respect of all foes. The son of\r\nPandu then, O king, asked Lomasa, saying, 'O illustrious one, why had\r\nRama's energy and might been taken away? And how also did he regain it? O\r\nexalted one, I ask thee, tell me everything.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Listen, O king, to the history of Rama (the son of\r\nDasaratha) and Rama of Bhrigu's line gifted with intelligence. For the\r\ndestruction of Ravana, O king, Vishnu, in his own body, took his birth as\r\nthe son of illustrious Dasaratha. We saw in Ayodhya that son of Dasaratha\r\nafter he had been born. It was then that Rama of Bhrigu's line, the son\r\nof Richika by Renuka, hearing of Rama the son of Dasaratha--of spotless\r\ndeeds--went to Ayodhya, impelled by curiosity, and taking with him that\r\ncelestial bow so fatal to the Kshatriyas, for ascertaining the prowess of\r\nDasaratha's son. And Dasaratha, hearing that Rama of Bhrigu's race had\r\narrived on the confines of his domains, set his own son Rama to receive\r\nthe hero with respect. And beholding Dasaratha's son approach and stand\r\nbefore him with ready weapons, Rama of Bhrigu's line smilingly addressed\r\nhim, O son of Kunti, saying, 'O king, O exalted one, string, if thou\r\ncanst, with all thy mighty, this bow which in my hands was made the\r\ninstrument of destroying the Kshatriya race.' Thus addressed, Dasaratha's\r\nson answered, 'O illustrious one, it behoveth thee not to insult me thus.\r\nNor am I, amongst the regenerate classes, deficient in the virtues of the\r\nKshatriya order. The descendants of Ikshwaku in special never boast of\r\nthe prowess of their arms.' Then unto Dasaratha's son who said so, Rama\r\nof Bhrigu's line replied, 'A truce to all crafty speech, O king! Take\r\nthis bow.' At this, Rama the son of Dasaratha, took in anger from the\r\nhands of Rama of Bhrigu's line that celestial bow that had dealt death to\r\nthe foremost of Kshatriyas. And, O Bharata, the mighty hero smilingly\r\nstrung that bow without the least exertion, and with its twang loud as\r\nthe thunder-rattle, affrighted all creatures. And Rama, the son of\r\nDasaratha, then, addressing Rama of Bhrigu's said, 'Here, I have strung\r\nthis bow. What else, O Brahmana, shall I do for thee?' Then Rama, the son\r\nof Jamadagni, gave unto the illustrious son of Dasaratha a celestial\r\narrow and said, 'Placing this on the bow-string, draw to thy ear, O\r\nhero!' \"Lomasa continued, 'Hearing this, Dasaratha's son blazed up in\r\nwrath and said, 'I have heard what thou hast said, and even pardoned\r\nthee. O son of Bhrigu's race, thou art full of vanity. Through the\r\nGrandsire's grace thou hast obtained energy that is superior to that of\r\nthe Kshatriyas. And it is for this that thou insultest me. Behold me now\r\nin my native form: I give thee sight.' Then Rama of Bhrigu's race beheld\r\nin the body of Dasaratha's son the Adityas with the Vasus, the Rudras,\r\nthe Sadhyas with the Marutas, the Pitris, Hutasana, the stellar\r\nconstellations and the planets, the Gandharvas, the Rakshasas, the\r\nYakshas, the Rivers, the tirthas, those eternal Rishis identified with\r\nBrahma and called the Valkhilyas, the celestial Rishis, the Seas and\r\nMountains, the Vedas with the Upanishads and Vashats and the sacrifices,\r\nthe Samans in their living form, the Science of weapons, O Bharata, and\r\nthe Clouds with rain and lightning, O Yudhishthira! And the illustrious\r\nVishnu then shot that shaft. And at this the earth was filled with sounds\r\nof thunder, and burning meteors. O Bharata, began to flash through the\r\nwelkin. And showers of dust and rain fell upon the surface of the earth.\r\nAnd whirlwinds and frightful sounds convulsed everything, and the earth\r\nherself began to quake. And shot by the hand of Rama, that shalt,\r\nconfounding by its energy the other Rama, came back blazing into Rama's\r\nhands. And Bhargava, who had thus been deprived of his senses, regaining\r\nconsciousness and life, bowed unto Rama--that manifestation of Vishnu's\r\npower. And commanded by Vishnu, he proceeded to the mountains of\r\nMahendra. And thenceforth that great ascetic began to dwell there, in\r\nterror and shame. And after the expiration of a year, the Pitris,\r\nbeholding Rama dwelling there deprived of energy, his pride quelled, and\r\nhimself sunk in affliction, said unto him, 'O son, having approached\r\nVishnu, thy behaviour towards him was not proper. He deserveth for aye\r\nworship and respect in the three worlds. Go, O son, to that sacred river\r\nwhich goeth by name of Vadhusara! Bathing in all the tirthas of that\r\nstream, thou wilt regain thy energy! There in that river is the tirthas\r\ncalled Diptoda where thy grandsire Bhrigu, O Rama, in the celestial age\r\nhad practised ascetic penances of great merit.' Thus addressed by them,\r\nRama, O son of Kunti, did what the Pitris bade him, and obtained back at\r\nthis tirtha, O son of Pandu, the energy he had lost. Even this O child,\r\nwas what befell Rama of spotless deeds in days in of yore, after he had,\r\nO king, met Vishnu (in the form of Dasaratha's son)!'\""

There were in the Krita age certain\r\ntribes of fierce Danavas that were invincible in battle. And they were\r\nknown by the name of Kalakeyas and were endued with terrible prowess.\r\nPlacing themselves under Vritra and arming themselves with diverse\r\nweapons they pursued the celestials with Indra at their head in all\r\ndirections. The gods then all resolved upon the destruction of Vritra,\r\nand went with Indra at their head to Brahma. And beholding them standing\r\nbefore him with joined hands, Parameshthi addressed them all and said,\r\n\"Everything is known to me, ye gods, about what ye seek. I shall indicate\r\nnow the means by which ye may slay Vritra. There is a high-souled and\r\ngreat Rishi known by the name of Dadhicha. Go ye all together unto him\r\nand solicit of him a boon.

Desirous as ye are of\r\nvictory, go ye all together unto him and tell him, 'For the good of the\r\nthree worlds, give us thy bones.' Renouncing his body, he will give you\r\nhis bones.

Thus addressed by him, the gods with the\r\nGrandsire's leave (came away), and with Narayana at their head proceeded\r\nto the asylum of Dadhicha. That asylum was on the other bank of the river\r\nSaraswati and covered with diverse trees and creepers. And it resounded\r\nwith the hum of bees as if they were reciting Samans. And it also echoed\r\nwith the melodious notes of the male Kokila and the Chakora. And\r\nbuffaloes and boars and deer and Chamaras wandered there at pleasure\r\nfreed from the fear of tigers. And elephants with the juice trickling\r\ndown from rent temples, plunging in the stream, sported with the\r\nshe-elephants and made the entire region resound with their roars. And\r\nthe place also echoed with the loud roars of lions and tigers, while at\r\nintervals might be seen those grisly monarchs of the forest lying\r\nstretched in caves and glens and beautifying them with their presence And\r\nsuch was the asylum, like unto heaven itself, of Dadhicha, that the gods\r\nentered. And there they beheld Dadhicha looking like the sun himself in\r\nsplendour and blazing in grace of person like the Grandsire himself. And\r\nthe celestials saluted the feet of the Rishi and bowed unto him and\r\nbegged of him the boon that the Grandsire had bade them do. Then\r\nDadhicha, well pleased, addressing those foremost of celestials, said,\r\n'Ye celestials, I will do what is for your benefit. I will even renounce\r\nthis body of mine myself.' And that foremost of men with soul under\r\ncontrol, having said this, suddenly renounced his life. The gods then\r\ntook the bones of the deceased Rishi as directed. And the celestials,\r\nglad at heart, went to Twashtri (the celestial Artificer) and spake to\r\nhim of the means of victory. And Twashtri, hearing those words of theirs,\r\nbecame filled with joy, and constructed (out of those bones) with great\r\nattention and care the fierce weapons called Vajra. And having\r\nmanufactured it, he joyfully addressed Indra, saying, 'With this foremost\r\nof weapons, O exalted one, reduce that fierce foe of the gods to ashes.\r\nAnd having slain the foe, rule thou happily the entire domain of heaven,\r\nO chief of the celestials, with those that follow thee.' And thus\r\naddressed by Twashtri, Purandara took the Vajra from his hand, joyfully\r\nand with proper respect.\""

And he was guarded on all\r\nsides by huge-bodied Kalakeyas with upraised weapons resembling gigantic\r\nmountains with towering peaks. And the encounter that took place between\r\nthe gods and the Danavas lasted for a short while and was, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, terrific in the extreme, appalling as it did the three worlds.\r\nAnd loud was the clash of swords and scimitars upraised and warded off by\r\nheroic hands in course of those fierce encounters. And heads (severed\r\nfrom trunks) began to roll from the firmament to the earth like fruits of\r\nthe palmyra palm falling upon the ground, loosened from their stalks. And\r\nthe Kalakeyas armed with iron-mounted bludgeons and cased in golden mail\r\nran against the gods, like moving mountains on conflagration. And the\r\ngods, unable to stand the shock of that impetuous and proudly advancing\r\nhost, broke and fled from fear. Purandara of a thousand eyes, beholding\r\nthe gods flying in fear and Vritra growing in boldness, became deeply\r\ndejected. And the foremost of gods Purandara, himself, agitated with the\r\nfear of the Kalakeyas, without losing a moment, sought the exalted\r\nNarayana's refuge. And the eternal Vishnu beholding Indra so depressed\r\nenhanced his might by imparting unto him a portion of his own energy. And\r\nwhen the celestials beheld that Sakra was thus protected by Vishnu, each\r\nof them imparted unto him his own energy. And the spotless Brahmarshis\r\nalso imparted their energies unto the chief of the celestials. And\r\nfavoured thus by Vishnu and all the gods and by the high-blessed Rishis\r\nalso, Sakra became mightier than before. And when Vritra learnt that the\r\nchief of the celestials had been filled with might of others, he sent\r\nforth some terrific roars. And at these roars of his, the earth, the\r\ndirections, the firmament, heaven, and the mountains all began to\r\ntremble. And the chief of the celestials, deeply agitated on hearing that\r\nfierce and loud roar, was filled with fear, and desiring to slay the\r\nAsura soon, hurled, O king, the mighty Vajra. And struck with Indra's\r\nVajra the great Asura decked in gold and garlands fell head-long, like\r\nthe great mountain Mandara hurled of yore from Vishnu's hands; and\r\nalthough the prince of Daityas was slain, yet Sakra in panic ran from the\r\nfield, desiring to take shelter in a lake, thinking that the Vajra itself\r\nhad not been hurled from his hands and regarding that Vritra himself was\r\nstill alive. The celestials, however, and the great Rishis became filled\r\nwith joy, and all of them began to cheerfully chant the praise of Indra.\r\nAnd mustering together, the celestials began to slay the Danavas, who\r\nwere dejected at the death of their leader. And struck with panic at\r\nsight of the assembled celestial host, the afflicted Danavas fled to the\r\ndepths of the sea. And having entered the fathomless deep, teeming with\r\nfishes and crocodiles, the Danavas assembled together and began to\r\nproudly conspire for the destruction of the three worlds. And some\r\namongst them that were wise in inferences suggested courses of action,\r\neach according to his judgment. In course of time, however, the dreadful\r\nresolution arrived at those conspiring sons of Diti, was that they\r\nshould, first of all, compass the destruction of all persons possessed of\r\nknowledge and ascetic virtue. The worlds are all supported by asceticism.\r\nTherefore, they said, 'Lose no time for the destruction of asceticism.\r\nCompass ye without delay the destruction of those on earth that are\r\npossessed of ascetic virtues, that are conversant with duties and the\r\nways of morality, and that have a knowledge of Brahma; for when these are\r\ndestroyed, the universe itself will be destroyed.' And all the Danavas,\r\nhaving arrived at this resolution for the destruction of the universe,\r\nbecame highly glad.

But all those sons of Sagara, all mutually united, could not\r\nfind the horse, nor the person who had stolen it. And coming back then,\r\nthey with joined palms (thus addressed) their father, (standing) before\r\nthem, 'O Protector of men! O ruler of the earth! O king! by thy command,\r\nthe whole of this world with its hills and its forest tracts, with its\r\nseas, and its woods, and its islands, with its rivulets and rivers and\r\ncaves, hath been searched through by us. But we cannot find either the\r\nhorse, or the thief who had stolen the same.' And hearing the words, the\r\nsame king became senseless with wrath, and then told them all, carried\r\naway by Destiny, 'Go ye all, may ye never return! Search ye again for the\r\nhorse. Without that sacrificial horse, ye must never return, my boys!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And those same sons of Sagara, accepted this command of their father,\r\nand once more began to search through the entire world. Now these heroes\r\nsaw a rift on the surface of the earth. And having reached this pit, the\r\nsons of Sagara began to excavate it. And with spades and pickaxes they\r\nwent on digging the sea, making the utmost efforts. And that same abode\r\nof Varuna (namely the ocean), being thus, excavated by the united sons of\r\nSagara and rent and cut on all sides round, was placed in a condition of\r\nthe utmost distress. And the demons and snakes and Rakshasas and various\r\n(other) animated beings began to utter distressful cries, while being\r\nkilled by Sagara's sons. And hundreds and thousands of animated beings\r\nwere beheld with severed heads and separated trunks and with their skins\r\nand bones and joints rent asunder and broken. Thus they went on digging\r\nthe ocean, which was the abode of Varuna and an exceedingly long space of\r\ntime expired in this work, but still the horse was not found. Then, O\r\nlord of earth! towards the north-eastern region of the sea, the incensed\r\nsons of Sagara dug down as far as the lower world, and there they beheld\r\nthe horse, roaming about on the surface of the ground. And they saw the\r\nmagnanimous Kapila, who looked like a perfect mass of splendour. And\r\nhaving beheld him shining with his brightness, just as the fire shineth\r\nwith its flames, they, O king! seeing the horse, were flushed with\r\ndelight. And they being incensed, sent forward by their fate, paid no\r\nheed to the presence of the magnanimous Kapila, and ran forward with a\r\nview to seizing the horse. Then, O great king! Kapila, the most righteous\r\nof saints,--he whom the great sages name as Kapila Vasudeva--assumed a\r\nfiery look, and the mighty saint shot flames towards them, and thereby\r\nburnt down the dull-headed sons of Sagara. And Narada, whose practice of\r\nausterities was very great, when he beheld them reduced to ashes, came to\r\nSagara's side, and gave the information to him. And when the king learnt\r\nthis terrible news which proceeded from the mouth of the saint, for\r\nnearly an hour he remained sad, and then he bethought himself of what\r\nSiva had said. Then sending for Ansuman, the son of Asamanjas, and his\r\nown grandson, he, O chief of Bharata's race! spake the following words,\r\n'Those same sixty thousand sons of unmeasured strength having encountered\r\nKapila's wrath, have met their death on my account. And, O my boy of\r\nstainless character! thy father also hath been forsaken by me, in order\r\nto discharge my duty (as a king), and being desirous of doing good to my\r\nsubjects.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O saint, whose sole wealth consists in religious\r\npractices! Tell me for what reason, Sagara, the foremost of kings,\r\nabandoned his own begotten son, endued with valour--an act so difficult\r\n(for all other men).\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'A son was born to Sagara, known by the name of Asamanjas,\r\nhe who was given birth to by the princess of Sivi. And he used to seize\r\nby throat the feeble children of the townsmen, and threw them while\r\nscreaming into the river. And thereupon the townsmen, overwhelmed with\r\nterror and grief, met together, and all standing with joined palms,\r\nbesought Sagara in the following way, 'O great king! Thou art our\r\nprotector from the dreaded peril of attack from a hostile force.\r\nTherefore it is proper for thee to deliver us from the frightful danger,\r\nproceeding from Asamanjas.' And the most righteous of the rulers of men,\r\nhaving heard this frightful news from his subjects, for nearly an hour\r\nremained sad and then spake to his ministers, saying, 'This day from the\r\ncity let my son Asamanjas be driven forth. If ye wish to do what will be\r\nacceptable to me, let this be quickly done. 'And, O protector of men!\r\nthose same ministers, thus addressed by the king, performed in a hurry\r\nexactly what the king had commanded them to do. Thus have I narrated to\r\nthee how the magnanimous Sagara banished his son, with a view to the\r\nwelfare of the residents of the town. I shall now fully narrate to thee\r\nwhat Ansuman of the powerful bow was told by Sagara. Listen to me!\r\n\r\n\"Sagara said, 'O my boy! sore am I at heart for having abandoned thy\r\nfather, on account of the death of my sons, and also on being\r\nunsuccessful in getting back the horse. Therefore, O grandson! harassed\r\nwith grief and confounded with the obstruction to my religious rites as I\r\nam, thou must bring back the horse and deliver me from hell.' Thus\r\naddressed by the magnanimous Sagara, Ansuman went with sorrow to that\r\nspot where the earth had been excavated. And by that very passage he\r\nentered into the sea, and beheld that illustrious Kapila and that same\r\nhorse. And having beheld that ancient saint, most righteous of his order,\r\nlooking like a mass of light, he bowed with his head to the ground, and\r\ninformed him of the reason of his visit. Then, O great king, Kapila was\r\npleased with Ansuman, and that saint of a virtuous soul told him to ask\r\nfor a favour from him. And he in the first place prayed for the horse,\r\nfor the purpose of using it in the sacrifice; in the second place he\r\nprayed for the purification of his fathers. Then the mighty chief of\r\nsaints, Kapila spake to him, saying, 'I shall grant thee everything that\r\nthou desirest, O stainless (prince). May good luck be thine! In thee are\r\nfixed (the virtues of) forbearance, and truth, and righteousness. By thee\r\nhath Sagara had all his desires fulfilled. Thou are (really) a son to thy\r\nfather. And by thy ability the sons of Sagara will go to heaven (i.e.,\r\nwill be delivered from the consequences of their unhallowed death). And\r\nthe son of thy son, with a view to purifying the sons of Sagara, will\r\nobtain the favour of the great god Siva, (by means of practising great\r\nausterities), and will (thus) bring (to this world) the river that\r\nfloweth in three (separate) streams, Ganga, O chief of men! May good luck\r\nbe thine! Take thou with thee the sacrificial horse. Finish, my lad! the\r\nsacrificial rites of the magnanimous Sagara.' Thus addressed by the\r\nillustrious Kapila, Ansuman took the horse with him, and came back to the\r\nsacrificial yard of the mighty-minded Sagara. Then he fell prostrate at\r\nthe feet of the high-souled Sagara, who smelt him on the head and\r\nnarrated all the events to him, all that had been seen and heard by him,\r\nand likewise the destruction of Sagara's sons. He also announced that the\r\nhorse had been brought back to the sacrificial yard. And when king Sagara\r\nheard of this, he no more grieved on account of his sons. And he praised\r\nand honoured Ansuman, and finished those same sacrificial rites. His\r\nsacrifice finished, Sagara was greeted honourably by all the gods; and he\r\nconverted the sea, Varuna's dwelling place, into a son of himself. And\r\nthe lotus-eyed (King Sagara) having ruled his kingdom for a period of\r\nexceeding length, placed his grandson on the throne, (full of)\r\nresponsibilities and then ascended to heaven. And Ansuman likewise, O\r\ngreat king! virtuous in soul, ruled over the world as far as the edge of\r\nthe sea, following the foot-prints of his father's father. His son was\r\nnamed Dilipa, versed in virtue. Upon him placing the duties of his\r\nsovereign post, Ansuman like-wise departed this life. And then when\r\nDilipa heard what an awful fate had overtaken his forefathers, he was\r\nsorely grieved and thought of the means of raising them. And the ruler of\r\nmen made every great effort towards the descent of Ganga (to the mortal\r\nworld). But although trying to the utmost of his power, he could not\r\nbring about what he so much wished. And a son was born to him, known by\r\nthe name of Bhagiratha beauteous, and devoted to a virtuous life, and\r\ntruthful, and free from feelings of malice. And Dilipa appointed him as\r\nking, and betook himself to the forest life. And, O best of all the\r\nscions of Bharata's race! that same king (Dilipa), devoted himself to a\r\nsuccessful course of austerities, and at the end of (sufficient) period,\r\nfrom the forest departed to heaven.\""

And he of the powerful arm came\r\nto learn how his forefathers had met an awful end from Kapila of mighty\r\nsoul, and how they had been unable to attain the region of gods. And he\r\nwith a sorrowful heart made over his kingly duties to his minister, and,\r\nO lord of men! for practising austerities, went to the side of the snowy\r\nMountain (the Himalayas). And, O most praiseworthy of men, desirous of\r\nextinguishing his sins by leading an austere life, and (thereby)\r\nobtaining the favour of the (goddess) Ganga, he visited that foremost of\r\nmountains--Himalaya. And he beheld it adorned with peaks of diverse forms\r\nfull of mineral earth; besprinkled on all sides with drops from clouds\r\nwhich were resting themselves upon the breeze; beautiful with rivers and\r\ngroves and rocky spurs, looking like (so many) palaces (in a city);\r\nattended upon by lions and tigers that had concealed themselves in its\r\ncaves and pits; and also inhabited by birds of checkered forms, which\r\nwere uttering diverse sounds, such as the Bhringarajas, and ganders, and\r\nDatyuhas, and water-cocks, and peacocks and birds with a hundred\r\nfeathers, and Jivanjivakas, and black birds, and Chakoras of eyes\r\nfurnished with black corners, and the birds that love their young. And he\r\nsaw the mountain abounding in lotus plants growing in delightful\r\nreservoirs of water. And the cranes rendered it charming with their\r\nsounds; and the Kinnaras and the celestial nymphs were seated on its\r\nstony slabs. And the elephants occupying the cardinal points had\r\neverywhere robbed its trees with the end of their tusks; and the\r\ndemi-gods of the Vidyadhara class frequented the hill. And it was full of\r\nvarious gems, and was also infested by snakes bearing terrible poison and\r\nof glowing tongues. And the mountain at places looked like (massive)\r\ngold, and elsewhere it resembled a silvery (pile), and at some places it\r\nwas like a (sable) heap of collyrium. Such was the snowy hill where the\r\nking now found himself. And that most praiseworthy of men at that spot\r\nbetook himself to an awful austere course of life. And for one thousand\r\nyears his subsistence was nothing but water, fruit and roots. When,\r\nhowever, a thousand years according to the calculation of gods had\r\nelapsed, then the great river Ganga having assumed a material form,\r\nmanifested to him her (divine) self.'\r\n\r\n\"Ganga said. 'O great king! what dost thou desire of me? And what must I\r\nbestow on thee? Tell me the same, O most praiseworthy of men! I shall do\r\nas thou mayst ask me.' Thus addressed, the king then made his reply to\r\nGanga, the daughter of the snowy Hill, saying, 'O grantress of boons! O\r\ngreat river! my father's fathers, while searching for the horse, were\r\nsent by Kapila to the abode of the god of death. And those same sixty\r\nthousand sons of Sagara of mighty soul, having met with the majestic\r\nKapila, perished, (to a soul) in an instant of time. Having thus\r\nperished, there hath been no place for them in the region of heaven. O\r\ngreat river! So long as thou dost not besprinkle those same bodies with\r\nthy water, there is no salvation for these same Sagara's sons. O blessed\r\ngoddess! carry thou my forefathers, Sagara's sons, to the region of\r\nheaven. O great river! on their account am I beseeching thee forsooth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Ganga, the goddess saluted by the world, having heard\r\nthese words of the king, was well pleased, and spake to Bhagiratha the\r\nfollowing words: 'O great king! I am prepared to do what thou dost ask\r\nme; there is no doubt therein. But when I shall descend from the sky to\r\nthe earth, the force of my fall will be difficult to sustain. O protector\r\nof men! In the three worlds there exists none who is able to sustain the\r\nsame, excepting Siva, the most praiseworthy of gods, the great Lord with\r\nthe throat of sable blue. O (prince) of a powerful arm! Obtain the\r\nfavour, by practising austerities, of that same Siva-giver of boons. That\r\nsame god will sustain my descent upon his head. Thy desire he will\r\nfulfill, the desire, namely, to be of service to thy fathers, O king!'\r\nThen the great king Bhagiratha having heard the same, went to the Kailasa\r\nhill, and betaking himself to a severe course of penances, at the\r\nexpiration of a certain length of time obtained the favour of that worker\r\nof blessings (Siva). And, O protector of men! that same best of men, in\r\norder that his forefathers might have a place in heaven secured to them,\r\nreceived from that very Siva the fulfilment of his wish, namely the wish\r\nthat the descending Ganga might be sustained.'\""

For thy sake I shall\r\nsustain the river of the gods, when she will take her descent from the\r\nsky, she who is pure and blessed and divine, O (king) of a mighty arm!'\r\nSaying this, he came to the snowy mountain, surrounded by his attendants,\r\nof awful mien, and with uplifted weapons of diverse forms.

I shall sustain that most praiseworthy of rivers when she\r\nfalls down from the third region of the world (heaven).' Having heard\r\nthese words uttered by Siva, the king became devout (in heart), made\r\nobesiance and directed his thoughts towards Ganga. Then the delightful\r\n(river), of pure water in being so thought of by the king, and seeing\r\nthat the great lord (Siva) was standing (to receive her fall), came down\r\nall of a sudden from the sky. And seeing that she had taken her leap from\r\nthe sky, the gods, together with the mighty saints, the Gandharvas, the\r\nsnakes, and the Yakshas, assembled there as spectators. Then came down\r\nfrom the sky Ganga, the daughter of the snowy mountain. And her\r\nwhirlpools were raging, and she was teeming with fishes and sharks. O\r\nking! she directing her course towards the sea, separated herself, into\r\nthree streams; and her water was bestrewn with piles of froth, which\r\nlooked like so many rows of (white) ganders. And crooked and tortuous in\r\nthe movement of her body, at places; and at others stumbling at it were;\r\nand covered with foam as with a robe: she went forward like a woman\r\ndrunk. And elsewhere, by virtue of the roar of her waters, she uttered\r\nloud sounds.

Having\r\nheard these words, king Bhagiratha directed his course towards the spot\r\nwhere lay those bodies of mighty Sagara's sons, in order that, O most\r\npraiseworthy of men, the holy water might flood (the same). Having\r\nachieved the task of sustaining Ganga, Siva, saluted by men, went to\r\nKailasa the most praiseworthy of mountains, accompanied by the\r\ncelestials.

And the protector of men having\r\nreached the healthy hill Hemakuta, beheld there very many strange and\r\ninconceivable sights. There the very utterance of words caused the\r\ngathering of clouds, and a thousand volleys of stones. And people at its\r\nsight, were struck sad, and were unable to ascend the hill. There the\r\nwinds blew for aye, and the heavens always poured down rains; and\r\nlikewise the sounds of the recitation of the sacred writ were heard, yet\r\nnobody was seen. In the evening and in the morning would be seen the\r\nblessed fire that carries offerings to the gods and there flies would\r\nbite and interrupt the practice of austerities. And there a sadness would\r\novertake the soul, and people would become sick. The son of Pandu, having\r\nobserved very many strange circumstances of this character again\r\naddressed his questions to Lomasa with reference to these wonderful\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'O slayer of foes! O king! I am going to tell thee as we\r\nheard it before; do thou attend to the same with intent mind. In this\r\npeak of Rishava, there was once a saint known by that name. And his life\r\nhad lasted for many hundred years. And he was devoted to penances and was\r\ngreatly wrathful. And he, forsooth, for having been spoken to by others,\r\nfrom wrath addressed the hill thus, 'Whoever should utter any words here,\r\nthou must throw stones at him, and thou must call up the winds to prevent\r\nhim from making any noise.' This was what the saint said. And so at this\r\nplace, as soon as a man utters any words, he is forbidden by a roaring\r\ncloud. O king! thus these deeds were performed by that great saint, and\r\nfrom wrath he also forbade other acts. O king! tradition says that when\r\nthe gods of yore had come to the Nanda, suddenly came over (there) a\r\nnumber of men to look at the celestials. Those same gods at whose head\r\nstood Indra did not, however, like to be seen; and so they rendered this\r\nspot inaccessible, by raising obstructions in the form of hills. And from\r\nthat day forward, O Kunti's son! men could not cast their eyes at any\r\ntime on what looked like a hill, far less could they ascend the same.\r\nThis big mountain is incapable of being seen by one who hath not led an\r\naustere life, nor can such a one ascend it. Therefore, O son of Kunti!\r\nkeep thou thy tongue under control. Here at that time all those gods\r\nperformed the best sacrificial rites. O Bharata's son! Even up to this\r\nday these marks thereof may be seen. This grass here hath the form of the\r\nsacred kusa grass: the ground here seemeth to be overspread with the\r\nsacred grass; and. O lord of men! many of these trees here look like the\r\nspots for tying the sacrificial beasts. O Bharata's son! still the Gods\r\nand saints have residence here; and their sacred fire is observed in the\r\nmorning and in the evening. Here if one bathes, his sin is forthwith\r\ndestroyed, O Kunti's son! O most praiseworthy of the race of Kuru! do\r\nthou, therefore, perform thy ablutions, together with thy younger\r\nbrothers. Then after having washed thyself in the Nanda, thou wilt repair\r\nto the river Kausiki, the spot where the most excellent and severest form\r\nof penances was practised by Viswamitra. Then the king with his\r\nattendants, having washed his body there, proceeded to the river Kausiki,\r\nwhich was pure and delightful and pleasant with cool water.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'This is the pure divine river by name Kausiki. O chief of\r\nBharata's race! and this is the delightful hermitage of Viswamitra,\r\nconspicuous here. And this is a hermitage, with a holy name, belonging to\r\nKasyapa of mighty soul; whose son was Rishyasringa, devoted to penances,\r\nand of passions under control. He by force of his penances caused Indra\r\nto rain; and that god, the slayer of the demons Vala and Vritra, dreading\r\nhim, poured down rain during a drought. That powerful and mighty son of\r\nKasyapa was born of a hind. He worked a great marvel in the territory of\r\nLomapada. And when the crops had been restored, king Lomapada gave his\r\ndaughter Santa in marriage to him, as the sun gave in marriage his\r\ndaughter Savitri.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'How was the son of Kasyapa, Rishyasringa, born of a\r\nhind? And how was he endowed with holiness, being the issue of a\r\nreprehensible sexual connexion? And for what reason was Indra, the slayer\r\nof the demons Vala and Vritra, afraid of that same sagacious boy, and\r\npoured down rain during a period of drought? And how beautiful was that\r\nprincess Santa, pure in life, she who allured the heart of him when he\r\nhad turned himself into a stag? And since the royal saint Lomapada is\r\nsaid to have been of a virtuous disposition, why was it that in his\r\nterritory, Indra, the chastiser of the demon Paka, had withheld rain? O\r\nholy saint! all this in detail, exactly as it happened, thou wilt be\r\npleased to narrate to me, for I am desirous of hearing the deeds of\r\nRishyasringa's life.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Hear how Rishyasringa, of dreaded name, was born as a son\r\nto Vibhandaka, who was a saint of the Brahmana caste, who had cultured\r\nhis soul by means of religious austerities, whose seed never failed in\r\ncausing generation, and who was learned and bright like the Lord of\r\nbeings. And the father was highly honoured, and the son was possessed of\r\na mighty spirit, and, though a boy, was respected by aged man. And that\r\nson of Kasyapa, Vibhandaka, having proceeded to a big lake, devoted\r\nhimself to the practice of penances. And that same saint, comparable to a\r\ngod, laboured for a long period. And once while he was washing his mouth\r\nin the waters, he beheld the celestial nymph Urvasi--whereupon came out\r\nhis seminal fluid. And, O king! a hind at that time lapped it up along\r\nwith the water that she was drinking, being athirst; and from this cause\r\nshe became with child. That same hind had really been a daughter of the\r\ngods, and had been told of yore by the holy Brahma, the creator of the\r\nworlds, 'Thou shall be a hind; and when in that form, thou shall give\r\nbirth to a saint; thou shalt then be freed.' As Destiny would have it,\r\nand as the word of the creator would not be untrue, in that same hind was\r\nborn his (Vibhandaka's) son a mighty saint. And Rishyasringa, devoted to\r\npenances, always passed his days in the forest. O king! there was a horn\r\non the head of that magnanimous saint and for this reason did he come to\r\nbe known at the time by the name of Rishyasringa. And barring his father,\r\nnot a man had ever before been seen by him; therefore his mind, O\r\nprotector of men! was entirely devoted to the duties of a continent life.\r\nAt this very period there was a ruler of the land of Anga known by the\r\nname of Lomapada who was a friend of Dasaratha. We have heard that he\r\nfrom love of pleasure had been guilty of a falsehood towards a Brahmana.\r\nAnd that same ruler of the world had at that time been shunned by all\r\npersons of the priestly class. And he was without a ministering priest\r\n(to assist him in his religious rites). And the god of a thousand eyes\r\n(Indra) suddenly abstained from giving rain in his territory; so that his\r\npeople began to suffer and O lord of the earth! he questioned a number of\r\nBrahmanas, devoted to penances, of cultivated minds, and possessed of\r\ncapabilities with reference to the matter of rain being granted by the\r\nlord of gods, saying, 'How may the heavens grant us the rain? Think of an\r\nexpedient (for this purpose).' And those same cultured men, being thus\r\nquestioned, gave expression to their respective views. And one among\r\nthem--the best of saints--spake to that same king, saying, 'O lord of\r\nkings! the Brahmanas are angry with thee. Do some act (therefore) for\r\nappeasing them. O ruler of the earth! send for Rishyasringa, the son of a\r\nsaint, resident of the forest knowing nothing of the female sex, and\r\nalways taking delight in simplicity. O king! if he, great in the practice\r\nof penances, should show himself in thy territory, forthwith rain would\r\nbe granted by the heavens, herein I have no doubt at all.' And, O king!\r\nhaving heard these words Lomapada made atonement for his sins. And he\r\nwent away; and when the Brahmanas had been appeased, he returned again,\r\nand seeing the king returned, the people were again glad at heart. Then\r\nthe king of Anga convened a meeting of his ministers, proficient in\r\ngiving counsel. And he took great pains in order to settle some plan for\r\nsecuring a visit from Rishyasringa. And, O unswerving (prince)! with\r\nthose ministers, who were versed in all branches of knowledge, and\r\nexceedingly proficient in worldly matters, and had a thorough training in\r\npractical affairs, he at last settled a plan (for gaining his object).\r\nAnd then he sent for a number of courtesans, women of the town, clever in\r\neverything. And when they came, that same ruler of the earth spake to\r\nthem, saying, 'Ye lovely women! Ye must find some means to allure, and\r\nobtain the confidence of the son of the saint--Rishyasringa, whom ye must\r\nbring over to my territory.' And those same women, on the one hand afraid\r\nof the anger of the king and on the other, dreading a curse from the\r\nsaint, became sad and confounded, and declared the business to be beyond\r\ntheir power. One, however, among them--a hoary woman, thus spake to the\r\nking, 'O great king! him whose wealth solely consists in penances, I\r\nshall try to bring over here. Thou wilt, however, have to procure for me\r\ncertain things, in connection with the plan. In that case, I may be able\r\nto bring over the son of the saint--Rishyasringa.' Thereupon the king\r\ngave an order that all that she might ask for should be procured. And he\r\nalso gave a good deal of wealth and jewels of various kinds. And then, O\r\nLord of the earth, she took with herself a number of women endowed with\r\nbeauty and youth, and went to the forest without delay.\""

      "content": "\"Lomasa said, 'O descendant of Bharata! she in order to compass the\r\nobject of the king, prepared a floating hermitage, both because the king\r\nhad ordered so, and also because it exactly accorded with her plan. And\r\nthe floating hermitage, containing artificial trees adorned with various\r\nflowers and fruits, and surrounded by diverse shrubs and creeping plants\r\nand capable of furnishing choice and delicious fruits, was exceedingly\r\ndelightful, and nice, and pleasing, and looked as if it had been created\r\nby magic. Then she moored the vessel at no great distance from the\r\nhermitage of Kasyapa's son, and sent emissaries to survey the place where\r\nthat same saint habitually went about. And then she saw an opportunity;\r\nand having conceived a plan in her mind, sent forward her daughter a\r\ncourtesan by trade and of smart sense. And that clever woman went to the\r\nvicinity of the religious man and arriving at the hermitage beheld the\r\nson of the saint.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The courtesan said, 'I hope, O saint! that is all well with the\r\nreligious devotees. And I hope that thou hast a plentiful store of fruits\r\nand roots and that thou takest delight in this hermitage. Verily I come\r\nhere now to pay thee a visit. I hope the practice of austerities among\r\nthe saints is on the increase. I hope that thy father's spirit hath not\r\nslackened and that he is well pleased with thee. O Rishyasringa of the\r\npriestly caste! I hope thou prosecutest the studies proper for thee.'\"\r\n\r\nRishyasringa said, 'Thou art shining with lustre, as if thou wert a\r\n(mass) of light. And I deem thee worthy of obeisance. Verily I shall give\r\nthee water for washing thy feet and such fruits and roots also as may be\r\nliked by thee, for this is what my religion hath prescribed to me. Be\r\nthou pleased to take at thy pleasure thy seat on a mat made of the sacred\r\ngrass, covered over with a black deer-skin and made pleasant and\r\ncomfortable to sit upon. And where is thy hermitage? O Brahmana! thou\r\nresemblest a god in thy mien. What is the name of this particular\r\nreligious vow, which thou seemest to be observing now?'\r\n\r\n\"The courtesan said, O son of Kasyapa! on the other side of yonder hill,\r\nwhich covers the space of three Yojanas, is my hermitage--a delightful\r\nplace. There, not to receive obeisance is the rule of my faith nor do I\r\ntouch water for washing my feet. I am not worthy of obeisance from\r\npersons like thee; but I must make obeisance to thee. O Brahmana! This is\r\nthe religious observance to be practised by me, namely, that thou must be\r\nclasped in my arms.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Rishyasringa said, 'Let me give thee ripe fruits, such as gallnuts,\r\nmyrobalans, Karushas, Ingudas from sandy tracts and Indian fig. May it\r\nplease thee to take a delight in them!'\"\r\n\r\nLomasa said, \"She, however, threw aside all those edible things and then\r\ngave him unsuitable things for food. And these were exceedingly nice and\r\nbeautiful to see and were very much acceptable to Rishyasringa. And she\r\ngave him garlands of an exceedingly fragrant scent and beautiful and\r\nshining garments to wear and first-rate drinks; and then played and\r\nlaughed and enjoyed herself. And she at his sight played with a ball and\r\nwhile thus employed, looked like a creeping plant broken in two. And she\r\ntouched his body with her own and repeatedly clasped Rishyasringa in her\r\narms. Then she bent and break the flowery twigs from trees, such as the\r\nSala, the Asoka and the Tilaka. And overpowered with intoxication,\r\nassuming a bashful look, she went on tempting the great saint's son. And\r\nwhen she saw that the heart of Rishyasringa had been touched, she\r\nrepeatedly pressed his body with her own and casting glances, slowly went\r\naway under the pretext that she was going to make offerings on the fire.\r\nOn her departure, Rishyasringa became over-powered with love and lost his\r\nsense. His mind turned constantly to her and felt itself vacant. And he\r\nbegan to sigh and seemed to be in great distress. At that moment appeared\r\nVibhandaka, Kasyapa's son, he whose eyes were tawny like those of a lion,\r\nwhose body was covered with hair down to the tip of the nails, who was\r\ndevoted to studies proper for his caste, and whose life was pure and was\r\npassed in religious meditation. He came up and saw that his son was\r\nseated alone, pensive and sad, his mind upset and sighing again and again\r\nwith upturned eyes. And Vibhandaka spake to his distressed son, saying,\r\n'My boy! why is it that thou art not hewing the logs for fuel. I hope\r\nthou hast performed the ceremony of burnt offering today. I hope thou\r\nhast polished the sacrificial ladles and spoons and brought the calf to\r\nthe milch cow whose milk furnisheth materials for making offerings on the\r\nfire. Verily thou art not in thy wonted state, O son! Thou seemest to be\r\npensive, and to have lost thy sense. Why art thou so sad today? Let me\r\nask thee, who hath been to this place today?'\""

      "content": "'Rishyasringa said, 'Here came to-day a religious student with a mass of\r\nhair on his head. And he was neither short nor tall. And he was of a\r\nspirited look and a golden complexion, and endued with eye large as\r\nlotuses; and he was shining and graceful as a god. And rich was his\r\nbeauty blazing like the Sun; and he was exceedingly fair with eyes\r\ngraceful and black. And his twisted hair was blue-black and neat and long\r\nand of a fragrant scent and tied up with strings of gold. A beautiful\r\nornament was shining on his neck which looked like lightning in the sky.\r\nAnd under the throat he had two balls of flesh without a single hair upon\r\nthem and of an exceedingly beautiful form. And his waist was slender to a\r\ndegree and his navel neat; and smooth also was the region about his ribs.\r\nThen again there shone a golden string from under his cloth, just like\r\nthis waist-string of mine. And there was something on his feet of a\r\nwonderful shape which give forth a jingling sound. Upon his wrists\r\nlikewise was tied a pair of ornaments that made a similar sound and\r\nlooked just like this rosary here. And when he walked, his ornaments\r\nuttered a jingling sound like those uttered by delighted ganders upon a\r\nsheet of water. And he had on his person garments of a wonderful make;\r\nthese clothes of mine are by no means beautiful like those. And his face\r\nwas wonderful to behold; and his voice was calculated to gladden the\r\nheart; and his speech was pleasant like the song of the male blackbird.\r\nAnd while listening to the same I felt touched to my inmost soul. And as\r\na forest in the midst of the vernal season, assumes a grace only when it\r\nis swept over by the breeze, so, O father! he of an excellent and pure\r\nsmell looks beautiful when fanned by the air. And his mass of hair is\r\nneatly tied up and remains adhering to the head and forehead evenly\r\nsundered in two. And his two eyes seemed to be covered with wonderful\r\nChakravaka birds of an exceedingly beautiful form. And he carried upon\r\nhis right palm a wonderful globur fruit, which reaches the ground and\r\nagain and again leaps up to the sky in a strange way. And he beats it and\r\nturns himself round and whirls like a tree moved by the breeze. And when\r\nI looked at him, O father! he seemed to be a son of the celestials, and\r\nmy joy was extreme, and my pleasure unbounded. And he clasped my body,\r\ntook hold of my matted hair, and bent down my mouth, and, mingling his\r\nmouth with my own, uttered a sound that was exceedingly pleasant. And he\r\ndoth not care for water for washing his feet, nor for those fruits\r\noffered by me; and he told me that such was the religious observance\r\npractised by him. And he gave unto me a number of fruits. Those fruits\r\nwere tasteful unto me: these here are not equal to them in taste. They\r\nhave not got any rind nor any stone within them, like these. And he of a\r\nnoble form gave me to drink water of an exceedingly fine flavour; and\r\nhaving drunk it, I experienced great pleasu e; and the ground seemed to\r\nbe moving under my feet. And these are the garlands beautiful and\r\nfragrant and twined with silken threads that belong to him. And he,\r\nbright with fervent piety, having scattered these garlands here, went\r\nback to his own hermitage. His departure hath saddened my heart; and my\r\nframe seems to be in a burning sensation! And my desire is to go to him\r\nas soon as I can, and to have him every day walk about here. O father,\r\nlet me this very moment go to him. Pray, what is that religious\r\nobservance which is being practised by him. As he of a noble piety is\r\npractising penances, so I am desirous to live the same life with him. My\r\nheart is yearning after similar observances My soul will be in torment if\r\nI see him not,'\""

      "content": "\"Vibhandaka said, 'Those are, O son! Rakshasas. They walk about in that\r\nwonderfully beautiful form. Their strength is unrivalled and their beauty\r\ngreat And they always meditate obstruction to the practice of penances.\r\nAnd, O my boy, they assume lovely forms and try to allure by diverse\r\nmeans. And those fierce beings hurled the saints, the dwellers of the\r\nwoods, from blessed regions (won by their pious deeds) And the saint who\r\nhath control over his soul, and who is desirous of obtaining the regions\r\nwhere go the righteous, ought to have nothing to do with them. And their\r\nacts are vile and their delight is in causing obstruction to those who\r\npractise penance; (therefore) a pious man should never look at them. And,\r\nO son! those were drinks unworthy to be drunk, being as they were\r\nspirituous liquors consumed by unrighteous men. And these garlands, also,\r\nbright and fragrant and of various hues, are not intended for saints.'\r\nHaving thus forbidden his son by saying that those were wicked demons,\r\nVibhandaka went in quest of her. And when by three day's search he was\r\nunable to trace where she was he then came back to his own hermitage. In\r\nthe meanwhile, when the son of Kasyapa had gone out to gather fruits,\r\nthen that very courtesan came again to tempt Rishyasringa in the manner\r\ndescribed above. And as soon as Rishyasringa had her in sight, he was\r\nglad and hurriedly rushing towards him said, 'Let us go to thy hermitage\r\nbefore the return of my father.' Then, O king! those same courtesans by\r\ncontrivances made the only son of Kasyapa enter their bark, and unmoored\r\nthe vessel. And by various means they went on delighting him and at\r\nlength came to the side of Anga's king. And leaving then that floating\r\nvessel of an exceedingly white tint upon the water, and having placed it\r\nwithin sight of the hermitage, he similarly prepared a beautiful forest\r\nknown by the name of the Floating Hermitage. The king, however, kept that\r\nonly son of Vibhandaka within that part of the palace destined for the\r\nfemales when of a sudden he beheld that rain was poured by the heavens\r\nand that the world began to be flooded with water. And Lomapada, the\r\ndesire of his heart fulfilled, bestowed his daughter Santa on\r\nRishyasringa in marriage. And with a view to appease the wrath of his\r\nfather, he ordered kine to be placed, and fields to be ploughed, by the\r\nroad that Vibhandaka was to take, in order to come to his son. And the\r\nking also placed plentiful cattle and stout cowherds, and gave the latter\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n\"When the great saint Vibhandaka should enquire of you about his son, ye\r\nmust join your palms and say to him that these cattle, and these ploughed\r\nfields belong to his son and that ye are his slaves, and that ye are\r\nready to obey him in all that he might bid.' Now the saint, whose wrath\r\nwas fierce, came to his hermitage, having gathered fruits and roots and\r\nsearched for his son. But not finding him he became exceedingly wroth.\r\nAnd he was tortured with anger and suspected it to be the doing of the\r\nking. And therefore, he directed his course towards the city of Champa\r\nhaving made up his mind to burn the king, his city, and his whole\r\nterritory. And on the way he was fatigued and hungry, when he reached\r\nthose same settlements of cowherds, rich with cattle. And he was honoured\r\nin a suitable way by those cowherds and then spent the night in a manner\r\nbefitting a king. And having received very great hospitality from them,\r\nhe asked them, saying, 'To whom, O cowherds, do ye belong?' Then they all\r\ncame up to him and said, 'All this wealth hath been provided for thy\r\nson.' At different places he was thus honoured by that best of men, and\r\nsaw his son who looked like the god Indra in heaven. And he also beheld\r\nthere his daughter-in-law, Santa, looking like lightning issuing from a\r\n(cloud). And having seen the hamlets and the cowpens provided for his son\r\nand having also beheld Santa, his great resentment was appeased. And O\r\nking of men! Vibhandaka expressed great satisfaction with the very ruler\r\nof the earth. And the great saint, whose power rivalled that of the sun\r\nand the god of fire, placed there his son, and thus spake, 'As soon as a\r\nson is born to thee, and having performed all that is agreeable to the\r\nking, to the forest must thou come without fail.' And Rishyasringa did\r\nexactly as his father said, and went back to the place where his father\r\nwas. And, O king of men! Santa obediently waited upon him as in the\r\nfirmament the star Rohini waits upon the Moon, or as the fortunate\r\nArundhati waits upon Vasishtha, or as Lopamudra waits upon Agastya. And\r\nas Damayanti was an obedient wife to Nala, or as Sachi is to the god who\r\nholdeth the thunderbolt in his hand or as Indrasena, Narayana's daughter,\r\nwas always obedient to Mudgala, so did Santa wait affectionately upon\r\nRishyasringa, when he lived in the wood. This is the holy hermitage which\r\nbelonged to him. Beautifying the great lake here, it bears holy fame.\r\nHere perform thy ablutions and have thy desire fulfilled. And having\r\npurified thyself, direct thy course towards other holy spots,'\""

Then, O ruler of the earth, accompanied by his\r\nbrothers, the valiant prince proceeded by the shore of the sea towards\r\nthe land where the Kalinga tribes dwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'There is the land, O Kunti's son, where the Kalinga tribes\r\ndwell. Through it passeth the river Vaitarani, on the banks whereof even\r\nthe god of virtue performed religious river, having first placed himself\r\nunder the protection of the celestials. Verily, this is the northern\r\nbank, inhabited by saints, suitable for the performance of religious\r\nrites beautified by a hill, and frequented by persons of the regenerate\r\ncaste. This spot (in holiness) rivals the path whereby a virtuous man,\r\nfit for going to heaven, repairs to the region inhabited by gods. And\r\nverily at this spot in former times, other saints likewise worshipped the\r\nimmortals by the performance of religious rites. And at the very spot it\r\nwas that the god Rudra, O king of kings, seized the sacrificial beast and\r\nexclaimed, 'This is my share!' O chief of the descendants of Bharata,\r\nthen when the beast was carried away by Siva, the gods spake to him\r\nsaying, 'Cast not a covetous glance at the property of others,\r\ndisregarding all the righteous rules.' Then they addressed words of\r\nglorification of a pleasing kind to the god Rudra. And they satisfied him\r\nby offering a sacrifice, and paid him suitable honours. Thereupon he gave\r\nup the beast, and went by the path trodden by the gods. Thereupon what\r\nhappened to Rudra, learn from me, O Yudhishthira! Influenced by the dread\r\nof Rudra, the gods set apart for evermore, the best allotment out of all\r\nshares, such as was fresh and not stale (to be appropriated by the god).\r\nWhosoever performs his ablutions at this spot, while reciting this\r\nancient story, beholds with his mortal eyes the path that leads to the\r\nregion of the gods.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Then all the sons of Pandu and likewise the daughter\r\nof Drupada--all of whom were the favoured of Fate--descended to the river\r\nVaitarani, and made libations to the names of their fathers.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O Lomasa, how great must be the force of a pious\r\ndeed! Having taken my bath at this spot in a proper form, I seem to touch\r\nno more the region inhabited by mortal men! O saint of a virtuous life, I\r\nam beholding all the regions. And this is the noise of the magnanimous\r\ndwellers of the wood, who are reciting their audible prayers.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'O Yudhishthira, the place whence this noise comes and\r\nreaches thy ears is at the distance of three hundred thousand yojanas, to\r\nbe sure. O lord of men, rest thou quiet and utter no word. O king, this\r\nis the divine forest of the Self-existent One, which hath now come to our\r\nview. There, O king, Viswakarma of a dreaded name performed religious\r\nrites. On the mighty occasion of that sacrifice, the Self-existent One\r\nmade a gift of this entire earth with all its hilly and forest tracts, to\r\nKasyapa, by way of gratuity, for ministering as a priest. And then, O\r\nKuru's son, as soon as that goddess Earth was giving away, she became sad\r\nat heart, and wrathfully spake the following words to that great lord,\r\nthe ruler of the worlds, 'O mighty god, it is unworthy of thee to give me\r\naway to an ordinary mortal. And this act of gift on thy part will come to\r\nnothing; (for) here am I going to descend into the bottom of the nether\r\nworld.' Then when the blessed saint Kasyapa beheld the goddess Earth,\r\ndespondent and sad, he, O protector of men, performed a propitiatory act\r\ncalculated to appease her wrath. And then, O Pandu's son, the Earth was\r\npleased with his pious deed. And she uprose again from within the waters,\r\nand showed herself in the form of a sacred altar. This, O king, is the\r\nspot which distinctly manifests the form of an altar. O great monarch,\r\nascend over it, and thou wilt gain valour and strength. And, O king, this\r\nis the very altar which reaches as far as the sea, and rests itself upon\r\nits bosom. May good luck be thine, do thou mount hereupon, and of thyself\r\ncross the sea. And while thou this day mountest upon it, I shall\r\nadminister the ceremony for averting all evil from thee; for this altar\r\nhere, as soon as it gets a mortal's touch, at once enters into the sea.\r\nSalutation to the god who protects the universe! Salutation to thee that\r\nart beyond the universe! O Lord of gods, vouchsafe thy presence in this\r\nsea. O Pandu's son, thou must recite the following words of truth, and\r\nwhile so reciting, thou must quickly ascend this altar, 'The god of fire,\r\nand the sun, and the organ of generation, and water, and goddess and the\r\nseed of Vishnu, and the navel of nectar. The god of fire is the organ\r\nthat generated the (ocean); the earth is thy body; Vishnu deposited the\r\nseed that caused thy being and thou art the navel of nectar.' Thus, O\r\nPandu's son, the words of truth must be audibly recited, and while so\r\nreciting, one must plunge into the lord of rivers. O most praiseworthy of\r\nKunti's son, otherwise this lord of waters of divine birth, this best\r\nstorehouse of the waters (of the earth), should not be touched, O son of\r\nKunti, even with the end of a sacred grass.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Then when the ceremony for averting evil had been\r\ncompleted in his behalf, the magnanimous Yudhishthira went into the sea,\r\nand having performed all that the saint had bid, repaired to the skirts\r\nof the Mahendra hill, and spent the night at that spot.'\""

I\r\nshall also relate the achievements of the great ruler of the Haihaya\r\ntribe. That king, Arjuna by name, the mighty lord of the Haihaya tribe\r\nwas killed by Rama. He, O Pandu's son, was endued with a thousand arms;\r\nand by the favour of Dattatreya he likewise had a celestial car made of\r\ngold. And, O protector of the earth, his rule extended over the entire\r\nanimated world, wheresoever located on this earth. And the car of that\r\nmighty monarch could proceed everywhere in an unobstructed course. And\r\ngrown resistless by the virtue of a granted boon, he ever mounted on that\r\ncar, trampled upon gods and Yakshas and saints on all sides round. And\r\nall the born beings wheresoever placed, were harassed by him. Then the\r\ncelestials and the saints of a rigidly virtuous life, met together, and\r\nthus spake to Vishnu, the god of gods, the slayer of demons, and\r\npossessed of prowess that never failed, saying. 'O blessed and revered\r\nlord, for the purpose of preserving all the born beings, it is necessary\r\nthat Arjuna should be killed by thee.' And the mighty ruler of the\r\nHaihaya tribe placing himself on his celestial car, affronted Indra,\r\nwhile that deity was enjoying himself with Sachi, his queen. Then, O\r\nBharata's son, the blessed and the revered god (Vishhnu) held a\r\nconsultation with Indra, with a view to destroying Kartavirya's son. And\r\non that occasion, all that was for the good of the world of beings, was\r\ncommunicated by the lord of gods; and the blessed god worshipped by the\r\nworld, to do all that was necessary, went to the delightful Vadari wood\r\nwhich was his own chosen retreat for practising penances. And at this\r\nvery time there lived on the earth a mighty monarch in the land of\r\nKanyakuvja, a sovereign whose military force was exceedingly great. And\r\nhis name of Gadhi was famous in the world. He, however, betook himself to\r\na forest-life. And while he was dwelling in the midst of the wood, there\r\nwas born to him a daughter beautiful as a nymph of heaven. And Richika,\r\nthe son of Bhrigu, asked for her to be united with himself in marriage.\r\nAnd then Gadhi spake to that Brahmana, who led a rigidly austere life,\r\nsaying. There is a certain family custom in our race; it hath been\r\nfounded by my ancestors of a bygone age. And, O most excellent of the\r\nsacerdotal caste, be it known to thee that the intending bridegroom must\r\noffer a dowry consisting of a thousand fleet steeds, whose colour must be\r\nbrown and every one of whom must possess a single sable car. But, O\r\nBhrigu's son, a reverend saint like thee cannot be asked to offer the\r\nsame. Nor can my daughter be refused to a magnanimous saint of thy\r\n(exalted) rank.' Thereupon Richika said, 'I will give thee a thousand\r\nfleet steeds, brown in hue and possessing a single sable car; let thy\r\ndaughter be given in marriage to me.'\r\n\r\n\"Akritavrana said. Thus having given his word, O king, he went and said\r\nto Varuna, 'Give me a thousand fleet steeds brown in colour, and each\r\nwith one black ear. I want the same as dowry for my marriage.' To him\r\nVaruna forthwith gave a thousand steeds. Those steeds had issued out of\r\nthe river Ganga; hence the spot hath been named: The horse's landing\r\nplace. And in the city of Kanyakuvja, the daughter of Gadhi, Satyavati by\r\nname, was given in marriage; and the gods themselves were of the party of\r\nthe bride. Richika, the most excellent of the sacerdotal caste, thus\r\nprocured a thousand steeds, and had a sight of the dwellers of heaven and\r\nwon a wife in the proper form. And he enjoyed himself with the girl of\r\nslender waist, and thus gratified all the wishes and desire that he ever\r\nhad. And when the marriage had been celebrated, O king, his father Bhrigu\r\ncame on a visit to see him and his wife; and he was glad to see his\r\npraiseworthy son. And the husband and wife together paid their best\r\nrespects to him, who was worshipped by all the gods. And when he had\r\nseated himself, they both with joined palms, stood near him, in order\r\nthat they might to his bidding. And then the revered saint, Bhrigu, glad\r\nat heart, thus spoke to his daughter-in-law, saying, 'O lovely daughter,\r\nas for a boon I am ready to grant thee any object of thy wish.' And there\r\nupon she asked for his favour in this, that a son might be born to both\r\nherself and her mother. And he vouchsafed the favour thus asked for.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhrigu said, 'During the days that your season lasts, thou and thy\r\nmother must take a bath, with the ceremony for bringing forth a male\r\nchild. And ye two must then separately embrace two different trees--she a\r\npeepal tree, and thou a fig tree. And, O dutiful girl, here are two pots\r\nof rice and milk, prepared by me with the utmost care. I having ransacked\r\nthe whole universe to find the drugs, the essence whereof hath been\r\nblended with this milk and rice. It must be taken as food with the\r\ngreatest care.' And saying this, he vanished from sight. The two ladies,\r\nhowever, made an interchange both in the matter of the pots of rice, and\r\nlikewise as regards the trees (to be embraced by each). Then after the\r\nlapse of very many days, the revered saint, once more came. And he came\r\nknowing (what had happened) by his attribute of divine knowledge. Then\r\nBhrigu possessed of mighty strength, spake to Satyavati, his\r\ndaughter-in-law, saying, 'O dutiful girl! O my daughter of a lovely brow,\r\nthe wrong pot of rice thou tookest as food. And it was the wrong tree\r\nwhich was embraced by thee. It was thy mother who deluded thee. A son\r\nwill be born of thee, who, though of the priestly caste, will be of a\r\ncharacter fit for the military order; while a mighty son will be born of\r\nthy mother, who, though by birth a Kshatriya will assume a life suitable\r\nto the sacerdotal order. And his power will be great, and he will walk on\r\nthe path trodden by righteous men.' Then she entreated her father-in-law\r\nagain and again, saying, 'Let not my son be of this character; but let my\r\ngrandson be such.' And, O Pandu's son, he replied, 'So let it be!' And\r\nthus he was pleased to grant her prayer. Then she brought forth on the\r\nexpected day a son by name Jamadagni. And this son of Bhrigu was endowed\r\nwith both splendour and grace. And he grew in years and in strength, and\r\nexcelled he other saints in the proficiency of his Vaidik lore. O\r\nchieftain of Bharata's race, to him, rivalling in lustre the author of\r\nlight (the sun), came spontaneously and without instruction the knowledge\r\nof the entire military art and of the fourfold missile arms.'\""

      "content": "\"Akritavrana said, 'Jamadagni devoted himself to the study of the Veda\r\nand the practice of sacred penances, and became famous for his great\r\nausterities. Then he pursued a methodical course of study and obtained a\r\nmastery over the entire Veda. And, O king, he paid a visit to Prasenajit\r\nand solicited the hand of Renuka in marriage. And this prayer was granted\r\nby the king. And the delight of Bhrigu's race having thus obtained Renuka\r\nfor his wife, took his residence with her in a hermitage, and began to\r\npractice penances, being assisted by her. And four boys were born of her,\r\nwith Rama for the fifth. And although the youngest, Rama was superior to\r\nall in merit. Now once upon a time, when her sons had gone out for the\r\npurpose of gathering fruits, Renuka who had a pure and austere life, went\r\nout to bathe. And, O king, while returning home, she happened to cast her\r\nglance towards the king of Martikavata, known by the name of Chitraratha.\r\nThe king was in the water with his wives, and wearing on his breast a\r\nlotus wreath, was engaged in sport. And beholding his magnificent form,\r\nRenuka was inspired with desire. And this unlawful desire she could not\r\ncontrol, but became polluted within the water, and came back to the\r\nhermitage frightened at heart. Her husband readily perceived what state\r\nshe was in. And mighty and powerful and of a wrathful turn of mind, when\r\nhe beheld that she had been giddy and that the lustre of chastity had\r\nabandoned her, he reproached her by crying out 'Fie!' At that very moment\r\ncame in the eldest of Jamadagni's sons, Rumanvan; and then, Sushena, and\r\nthen, Vasu, and likewise, Viswavasu. And the mighty saint directed them\r\nall one by one to put an end to the life of their mother. They, however,\r\nwere quite confounded and lost heart. And they could not utter a single\r\nword. Then he in ire cursed them. And on being cursed they lost their\r\nsense and suddenly became like inanimate objects, and comparable in\r\nconduct to beasts and birds. And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes,\r\ncame to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of\r\ngreat austerities, addressed, saying, 'Kill this wicked mother of thine,\r\nwithout compunction, O my son.' Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe\r\nand therewith severed his mother's head. Then, O great king, the wrath of\r\nJamadagni of mighty soul, was at once appeased; and well-pleased, he\r\nspake the following words, 'Thou hast, my boy, performed at my bidding\r\nthis difficult task, being versed in virtue. Therefore, whatsoever wishes\r\nthere may be in thy heart, I am ready to grant them all. Do thou ask me.'\r\nThereupon Rama solicited that his mother might be restored to life, and\r\nthat he might not be haunted by the remembrance of this cruel deed and\r\nthat he might not be affected by any sin, and that his brothers might\r\nrecover their former state, and that he might be unrivalled on the field\r\nof battle, and that he might obtain long life. And, O Bharata's son,\r\nJamadagni, whose penances were the most rigid, granted all those desires\r\nof his son. Once, however, O lord, when his sons had gone out as before,\r\nthe valourous son of Kartavirya, the lord of the country near the shore\r\nof the sea, came up to the hermitage. And when he arrived at that\r\nhermitage, the wife of the saint received him hospitably. He, however,\r\nintoxicated with a warrior's pride, was not at all pleased with the\r\nreception accorded to him, and by force and in defiance of all\r\nresistance, seized and carried off from that hermitage the chief of the\r\ncows whose milk supplied the sacred butter, not heeding the loud lowing\r\nof the cow. And he wantonly pulled down the large trees of the wood. When\r\nRama came home, his father himself told him all that had happened. Then\r\nwhen Rama saw how the cow was lowing for its calf, resentment arose in\r\nhis heart. And he rushed towards Kartavirya's son, whose last moments had\r\ndrawn nigh. Then the descendant of Bhrigu, the exterminator of hostile\r\nheroes, put forth his valour on the field of battle, and with sharpened\r\narrows with flattened tips, which were shot from a beautiful bow, cut\r\ndown Arjuna's arms, which numbered a thousand, and were massive like\r\n(wooden) bolts for barring the door. He, already touched by the hand of\r\ndeath, was overpowered by Rama, his foe. Then the kinsmen of Arjuna,\r\ntheir wrath excited against Rama, rushed at Jamadagni in his hermitage,\r\nwhile Rama was away. And they slew him there; for although his strength\r\nwas great, yet being at the time engaged in penances, he would not fight.\r\nAnd while thus attacked by his foes, he repeatedly shouted the name of\r\nRama in a helpless and piteous way. And, O Yudhishthira, the sons of\r\nKartavirya shot Jamadagni, with their arrows, and having thus chastised\r\ntheir foe, went their way. And when they had gone away, and when\r\nJamadagni had breathed his last, Rama, the delight of Bhrigu's race,\r\nreturned to the hermitage, bearing in his arms, fuel for religious rites.\r\nAnd the hero beheld his father who had been put to death. And grieved\r\nexceedingly he began to bewail the unworthy fate that had laid his father\r\nlow.\""

And O father, virtuous and unswerving\r\nfrom the path of righteousness and inoffensive to all animated beings as\r\nthou wert, how came it to be permitted by Fate that thou shouldst die in\r\nthis way? What an awful sin must have been committed by them, who have\r\nkilled thee with hundreds of sharpened shafts, although thou wert an aged\r\nman, and engaged in penances at the time and absolutely averse to\r\nfighting with them. With what face will those shameless persons speak of\r\nthis deed of theirs to their friends and servants, viz., that they have\r\nslain an unassisted and unresisting virtuous man?--O protector of men,\r\nthus he, great in penance, bewailed much in a piteous manner, and then\r\nperformed the obsequies of his departed sire. And Rama, the conqueror of\r\nhostile cities, cremated his father on the funeral pyre, and vowed, O\r\nscion of Bharata's race, the slaughter of the entire military caste, and\r\nof exceeding strength in the field of battle, and possessed of valour\r\nsuited to a heroic soul, and comparable to the god of death himself, he\r\ntook up his weapon in wrathful mood, and singlehanded put Kartavirya's\r\nsons to death. And, O chieftain of the military caste, Rama, the leader\r\nof all capable of beating their foes, thrice smote down all the\r\nKashatriya followers of Kartavirya's sons. And seven times did that\r\npowerful lord exterminate the military tribes of the earth. In the tract\r\nof land, called Samantapanchaka five lakes of blood were made by him.\r\nThere the mightiest scion of Bhrigu's race offered libations to his\r\nforefathers--the Bhrigus, and Richika appeared to him in a visible form,\r\nand spake to him words of counsel. Then the son of Jamadagni of dreaded\r\nname, performed a mighty sacrifice and gratified the lord of the\r\ncelestials, and bestowed the earth to the ministering priests. And, O\r\nprotector of human beings, he raised an altar made of gold, ten Vyamas in\r\nbreadth and nine in height, and made a gift of the same to the\r\nmagnanimous Kasyapa. Then at Kasyapa's bidding the Brahamanas divided the\r\naltar into a number of shares, and thus they became reputed as the\r\nKhandavayamas (share takers). And the exterminator of the military race\r\npossessed of immense strength, bestowed the earth upon the high-souled\r\nKasyapa, and then became engaged in penance of an exceedingly severe\r\nform. He now dwells in this Mahendra, monarch of hills. Thus did\r\nhostilities arise between him and the members of the military caste,--all\r\nof them who dwell on this earth; and Rama, endowed with immense strength,\r\nin this way subdued the entire world.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Then on the fourteenth day of the moon, the\r\nmighty-souled Rama at the proper hour showed himself to those members of\r\nthe priestly caste and also to the virtuous king (Yudhishthira) and his\r\nyounger brothers. And, O king of kings, the lord together with his\r\nbrothers, worshipped Rama, and, O most righteous of the rulers of men,\r\nthe very highest honours were paid by him to all those members of the\r\ntwice-born class.

And O son of Parikshit! He in proper form took his bath in them\r\ntogether with his younger brothers and then went to an excellent river,\r\nthe holiest of all. There also the magnanimous king, took his plunge, and\r\noffered libations to his forefathers and the gods, and distributed riches\r\nto the leaders of the twice-born class. Then he went to the Godavari, a\r\nriver that falls directly into the sea. There he was freed from his sins.\r\nAnd he reached the sea in the Dravida land, and visited the holy spot\r\npassing under Agastya's name, which was exceedingly sacred and\r\nexceptionally pure. And the valiant king visited the feminine sacred\r\nspots. Here he listened to the story of that well-known feat which was\r\nachieved by Arjuna, chief of all wielders of the bow, and which was\r\nbeyond the power of human beings to perform. And here he was praised by\r\nthe highest members of the saintly class, and the son of Pandu\r\nexperienced the greatest delight. And, O protector of the earth! the\r\nruler of the world, accompanied by Krishna bathed in those holy spots,\r\nand speaking of Arjuna's valour in laudatory terms delightfully spent his\r\ntime in the place. Then he gave away thousands of cows at those holy\r\nspots on the coast of the sea; and with his brothers narrated well\r\npleased how Arjuna had made a gift of kine. And he, O king! visited one\r\nby one those holy places on the coast of the sea and many other sacred\r\nspots, and thus fulfilled his heart's desire, till he came to the holiest\r\nof all known by the name of Suparaka. Then having crossed a certain tract\r\non the coast of the sea, he reached a forest celebrated on earth. There\r\nthe deities had practised asceticism in former days, and likewise\r\nvirtuous rulers of men had performed sacrificial rites. There he,\r\npossessed of long and lusty arms, beheld the celebrated altar of\r\nRichika's son, who was the foremost of all wielders of the bow. And the\r\naltar was girt round by hosts of ascetics, and was fit to be worshipped\r\nby persons of a virtuous life. Then the king beheld the holy and\r\ndelightful shrines of all the gods and of the Vasus, and of the hosts of\r\nwind and of the two celestial physicians and of Yama, son of the sun and\r\nof the lord of riches, and of Indra, and of Vishnu, and of the lord\r\nCreator and of Siva, and of the moon, and of the author of day, and of\r\nthe lord of waters, and of the host of Sadhyas, and of Brahma, and of the\r\nforefathers, and of Rudra together with all his followers, and of the\r\ngoddess of learning, and of the host of Siddhas, and of many immortal\r\nholy gods besides. And in those shrines the king observed various fasts,\r\nand gave away large quantities of gems. He plunged his body in all the\r\nholy spots, and then came again to Surparaka. And he by the same\r\nlanding-place of the sea again proceeded with his uterine brothers and\r\ncame over to the holy spot Prabhasa, whereof fame hath been spread by\r\nmighty Brahmanas throughout the world. There he, possessed of a pair of\r\nlarge red eyes, washed himself with all his younger brothers, and offered\r\nlibations to the forefathers and the celestial hosts; and so did Krishna\r\nand all those Brahmanas together with Lomasa. For twelve days he\r\nsubsisted upon air and water. And he performed ablutions for days and\r\nnights and surrounded himself with fires kindled on all sides. Thus that\r\ngreatest of all virtuous men engaged himself in asceticism. While he was\r\nacting thus, information reached both Valarama and Krishna that the king\r\nwas practising penances of a most austere form and these two leaders of\r\nthe entire Vrishni tribe accompanied with troops came to Yudhishthira of\r\nAjamidha's race. And when the Vrishnis beheld that the sons of Pandu lay\r\ndown on the ground, their bodies besmeared all over with dirt and when\r\nthey beheld the daughter of Drupada in a sad state, their grief was great\r\nand they could not refrain from breaking out in loud lamentations. Then\r\nthe king, whose courage was such that misfortune never could cast him\r\ndown, cordially met Rama and Krishna and Samva, Krishna's son, and the\r\ngrand-son of Sini and other Vrishnis, and paid honour to them in a\r\nsuitable form. And they also in return paid honour to all the sons of\r\nPritha, and were similarly honoured by Pandu's sons. And they seated\r\nthemselves round about Yudhishthira, as round Indra, O king! are seated\r\nthe celestial hosts. And highly pleased, he recounted to them all the\r\nmachinations of his adversaries, and how also he had resided in the\r\nforest, and how Arjuna had gone to Indra's abode in order to learn the\r\nscience of arms--all this he related with a gladdened heart. And they\r\nwere happy to learn all this news from him; but when they saw the\r\nPandavas so exceedingly lean, the majestic and magnanimous Vrishnis could\r\nnot forbear shedding tears, which spontaneously gushed from their eyes on\r\naccount of the agony they felt.\""

And Duryodhana is now ruling\r\nthe earth, and the ground doth not yet swallow him up. From this, a\r\nperson of limited sense would believe a vicious course of life is\r\npreferable to a virtuous one. When Duryodhana is in a flourishing state\r\nand Yudhishthira, robbed of his throne, is suffering thus, what should\r\npeople do in such a matter?--This is the doubt that is now perplexing all\r\nmen. Here is the lord of men sprung from the god of virtue, holding fast\r\nto a righteous path, strictly truthful and of a liberal heart. This son\r\nof Pritha would give up his kingdom and his pleasure but would not swerve\r\nfrom the righteous path, in order to thrive. How is it that Bhishma and\r\nKripa and the Brahmana Drona and the aged king, the senior member of the\r\nhouse, are living happily, after having banished the sons of Pritha? Fie\r\nupon the vicious-minded leaders of Bharata's race! What will that sinner,\r\nthe chieftain of the earth, say to the departed forefathers of his race,\r\nwhen the wretch will meet them in the world to come? Having hurled from\r\nthe throne his in-offensive sons, will he be able to declare that he had\r\ntreated them in a blameless way? He doth not now see with his mind's eye\r\nhow he hath become so sightless, and on account of what act he hath grown\r\nblind among the kings of this entire earth. Is it not because he hath\r\nbanished Kunit's son from his kingdom? I have no doubt that\r\nVichitravirya's son, when he with his sons perpetrated this inhuman act,\r\nbeheld on the spot where dead bodies are burnt, flowering trees of a\r\ngolden hue. Verily he must have asked them, when those stood before him\r\nwith their shoulders projected forward towards him, and with their large\r\nred eyes staring at him, and he must have listened to their evil advice,\r\nsince he fearlessly sent away Yudhishthira to the forest, who had all his\r\nweapons of war with him and was borne company by his younger brothers.\r\nThis Bhima here, whose voracious appetite is like that of a wolf, is able\r\nto destroy with the sole strength of his powerful arms, and without the\r\nhelp of any weapons of war, a formidable array of hostile troops. The\r\nforces in the field of battle were utterly unmanned on hearing his\r\nwar-cry. And now the strong one is suffering from hunger and thirst, and\r\nis emaciated with toilsome journeys. But when he will take up in his hand\r\narrows and diverse other weapons of war, and meet his foes in the field\r\nof battle, he will then remember the sufferings of his exceedingly\r\nmiserable forest-life, and kill his enemies to a man: of a certainty do I\r\nanticipate this. There is not throughout the whole world a single soul\r\nwho can boast of strength and prowess equal to his. And his body, alas!\r\nis emaciated with cold, and heat and winds. But when he will stand up for\r\nfight, he will not leave a single man out of his foes. This powerful\r\nhero, who is a very great warrior when mounted on a car--this Bhima, of\r\nappetite rivalling a wolf's conquered single-handed all the rulers of men\r\nin the east, together with, those who followed them in battle; and he\r\nreturned from those wars safe and uninjured. And that same Bhima,\r\nmiserably dressed in the bark of trees, is now leading a wretched life in\r\nthe woods. This powerful Sahadeva vanquished all the kings in the south;\r\nthose lords of men who had gathered on the coast of the sea,--look at him\r\nnow in an anchorite's dress. Valiant in battle Nakula vanquished\r\nsingle-handed the kings who ruled the regions towards the west,--and he\r\nnow walks about the wood, subsisting on fruit and roots, with a matted\r\nmass of hair on the head, and his body besmeared all over with dirt. This\r\ndaughter of a king, who is a great soldier when mounted on a car, took\r\nher rise from beneath the altar, during the pomp of sacrificial rites.\r\nShe hath been always accustomed to a life of happiness; how is she now\r\nenduring this exceedingly miserable life in this wood! And the son of the\r\ngod of virtue,--virtue which stands at the head of all the there pursuits\r\nof life--and the son of the wind-god and also the son of the lord of\r\ncelestials, and those two sons of the celestial physicians,--being the\r\nsons of all those gods and always accustomed to a life of happiness, how\r\nare they living in this wood, deprived of all comforts?

Likewise, O\r\nRama! those who have appointed functionaries to undertake their work on\r\ntheir own responsibility, as the leaders of men, they may be said to have\r\nreal patrons, and they meet with no difficulty, like helpless beings. How\r\nis it that when the sons of Pritha have for their patrons these two men,\r\nRama and Krishna, and the two others, Pradyumna and Samva, together with\r\nmyself,--these patrons being able to protect all the three worlds,--how\r\nis it that the son of Pritha is living in the wood with his brothers? It\r\nis fit that this very day the army of the Dasarhas should march out,\r\nvariously armed and with checkered mails. Let Dhritarashtra's sons be\r\noverwhelmed with the forces of the Vrishinis and let them go with their\r\nfriends to the abode of the god of death. Let him alone who wields the\r\nbow made of the horn (Krishna), thou alone, if roused, wouldst be able to\r\nsurround even the whole of this earth. I ask thee to kill Dhritarashtra's\r\nson with all his men, as the great Indra, the lord of the gods kill\r\nVritra. Arjuna, the son of Pritha, is my brother, and also my friend, and\r\nalso my preceptor, and is like the second self of Krishna. It is for this\r\nthat men desire for a worthy son, and that preceptor seeks a pupil who\r\nwould contradict him not. It is for this that the time is come for that\r\nexcellent work, which is the best of all tasks and difficult to perform.\r\nI shall baffle Duryodhana's volleys of arms by my own excellent weapons.\r\nI shall overpower all in the field of battle. I shall in my wrath cut off\r\nhis head with my excellent shafts, little inferior to snakes and poison\r\nand fire. And with the keen edge of my sword, I shall forcibly sever his\r\nhead from the trunk, in the field of battle; then I shall kill his\r\nfollowers, and Duryodhana, and all of Kuru's race. O son of Rohini! let\r\nthe followers of Bhima look at me with joy at their heart, when I shall\r\nkeep up the weapons of war in the field of battle, and when I shall go on\r\nslaying all the best fighting men on the side of the Kurus, as at the end\r\nof time fire will burn vast heaps of straw. Kripa and Drona and Vikarna\r\nand Kama are not able to bear the keen arrows shot by Pradyumna. I know\r\nthe power of Arjuna's son--he conducts himself like the son of Krishna in\r\nthe field of battle. Let Samva chastise by the force of his arms\r\nDussasana; let him destroy by force Dussasana and his charioteer and his\r\ncar. In the field of battle when the son of Jamvavati becomes\r\nirresistible in fight, there is nothing which can withstand his force.\r\nThe army of the demon Samvara was speedily routed by him when only a boy.\r\nBy him was killed in fight Asvachakra, whose thighs were round, and whose\r\nmuscular arms were of exceeding length. Who is there that would be able\r\nto go forward to the car of Samva, who is great in fight, when mounted on\r\na car? As a mortal coming under the clutches of death can never escape;\r\nso who is there that once coming under his clutches in the field of\r\nbattle, is able to return with his life? The son of Vasudeva will burn\r\ndown by the volleys of his fiery shafts all the hostile troops, and those\r\ntwo warriors, Bhishma and Drona,--who are great on a car, and Somadatta\r\nsurrounded by all his sons. What is there in all the world including the\r\ngods, which Krishna cannot encounter on an equal footing, when he takes\r\nup the weapons of war, wields in his hands excellent arrows, arms himself\r\nwith his dice, and thus becomes unrivalled in fight? Then let Aniruddha\r\nalso take up in his hand his buckler and sword, and let him cover the\r\nsurface of the earth with Dhritarashtra's sons, their heads separated\r\nfrom their trunks, their bodies devoid of all consciousness as in a\r\nsacrificial rite the altar is overspread with sacred grass placed upon\r\nthe same. And Gada and Uluka, and Vahuka and Bhanu and Nitha and the\r\nyoung Nishatha valiant in battle and Sarana, and Charudeshna,\r\nirresistible in war, let them perform feats befitting their race.

Then let Abhimanyu rule the world so long as\r\nthis most excellent of virtuous men, the magnanimous Yudhishthira, may be\r\nengaged in fulfilling his vow,--the vow that was accepted and declared by\r\nhim, the most righteous of Kuru's race, on the occasion of the famous\r\nplay at dice. Afterwards the virtuous king will protect the earth, all\r\nhis foes defeated in battle by shafts which will be discharged by us.\r\nThen there will remain no sons of Dhritarashtra on earth,--nor the son of\r\nthe charioteer (Kama). This is the most important work for us to do, and\r\nthis will surely lead to fame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Krishna said, 'O scion of the race of Madhu! no doubt what thou sayest\r\nis true; we accept thy words, O thou of courage that is never weak! But\r\nthis bull of the Kuru race (Yudhishthira) would never accept the\r\nsovereignty of the earth, unless it were won by the prowess of his own\r\narms.

And why\r\nshould not this king rule over the entire world when he hath the two sons\r\nof Madri to espouse his cause? The high-souled ruler of Panchala together\r\nwith the Kekaya king, and we also should put forth our united strength,\r\nand then would the enemies of Yudhisthira be annihilated.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'It is not strange that thou shouldst speak thus, O\r\nscion of Madhu's race! but to me truth seems to be the first\r\nconsideration, above that of my sovereign power itself. But it is Krishna\r\nalone who precisely knoweth what I am; and it is I alone who precisely\r\nknow what Krishna (really) is. O thou endued with valour! O scion of\r\nMadhu's race! as soon as he will perceive that the time is come for feats\r\nof bravery, then, O most valiant of Sini's race, he also of beautiful\r\nhair (Krishna) will defeat Suyodhana. Let the brave men of the Dasarha\r\nrace go back today. They are my patrons; and the foremost of human\r\nbeings, they have visited me here. O ye of immeasurable strength! never\r\nfall off from the path of virtue. I shall see you again, when ye will be\r\nhappily gathered together.'\r\n\r\n\"Then after mutual greeting and obeisance to seniors, and having embraced\r\nthe youthful, those valiant men of the Yadu race and the sons of Pandu\r\nseparated. And the Yadus reunited to their home; and the Pandavas\r\ncontinued their journey to the sacred spots. Then having parted with\r\nKrishna, the virtuous king, accompanied by his brothers and servants, and\r\nalso by Lomasa, went to the sacred river Payosini. Its fine landing place\r\nwas constructed by the king of Vidarbha. And he began to dwell on the\r\nbanks of the Payosini, whose waters were mingled with the distilled Soma\r\njuice. There the high-souled Yudhishthira was greeted with excellent\r\nlaudatory, terms by numerous leaders of the twice-born class, who were\r\ndelighted to see him there.\""

And Indra was refreshed and was very much pleased. Here the gods\r\ntogether with Indira, and the protectors of all born beings, celebrated\r\nsacrifices of various kinds on a large scale, and paid abundant\r\ngratuities to the ministering priests. Here king Amurtarayasa, the lord\r\nof the world, satisfied Indra, the holder of the thunderbolt, by the\r\noffer of the Soma juice, when seven horse-sacrifices were performed by\r\nthat king. The articles which in other sacrificial rites are uniformly\r\nmade of the timber, wood and of earth, were all made of gold in the seven\r\nsacrifices performed by him. And it is said that in all those rites,\r\nseven sets of stakes, rings for the sacrificial stakes, spots, ladles,\r\nutensils, spoons were prepared by him. On each sacrificial stake, seven\r\nrings were fastened at the top. And, O Yudhishthira! the celestials\r\ntogether with Indira, themselves erected the sacrificial stakes of\r\nshining gold which had been prepared for his sacred rites. In all those\r\nmagnificent sacrifices instituted by Gaya, the protector of the earth,\r\nIndira, was delighted by drinking the Soma juice, and the ministering\r\npriests were gratified with the gratuities paid to them. And the priests\r\nobtained untold wealth counted out to them. And as the sand-grains of the\r\nearth, or as the stars in the sky, or as the rain-drops when it raineth,\r\ncannot be counted by anyone, so the wealth Gaya gave away was incapable\r\nof being counted by figures. So untold was the wealth, O great king! that\r\nwas given to the ministering priests in all those seven sacrifices that\r\neven the above-mentioned objects might be counted by figures, but the\r\ngratuities bestowed by him whose largeness exceeded all that was known\r\nbefore were not capable of being counted by figures. And images of the\r\ngoddess of speech were made of gold by the sculptor of the gods;--and the\r\nking gratified the members of the sacerdotal caste, who had arrived from\r\nall the cardinal points, by making presents to them of those images, of\r\ngold. O protector of men! when the high-souled Gaya performed his\r\nsacrificial rites, he erected sacrificial piles at so many different\r\nspots that but little space was left on the surface of the earth. And, O\r\nscion of Bharata's race! he by that sacred act attained the regions of\r\nIndra. Whoever should bathe in the river, Payosini, would go to the\r\nregions attained by Gaya. Therefore, O lord of kings! O unswerving\r\nprince! thou and thy brothers should bathe in this river; then, O\r\nprotector of the earth, thou wilt be freed from all these sins.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"O most praiseworthy of men! Yudhishthira with his\r\nbrothers performed ablutions in the Payosini river. Then, O sinless\r\nprince! the powerful monarch together with his brothers, journeyed to the\r\nhill of sapphires and the great river Narmada. The blessed saint Lomasa\r\nthere named to him all the delightful holy spots and all the sacred\r\nshrines of the celestials.

O most praiseworthy of men! this period is the\r\njunction between the Treta and the Kali age, O Kunti's son! This is the\r\nperiod when a person gets rid of all his sins. O respected sir! this is\r\nthe spot where Saryati performed sacrificial rites, wherein Indra\r\nappeared in a visible form and drank the Soma juice, with the two\r\ncelestial physicians. And Bhrigu's son of severe austerities conceived\r\nanger towards the great Indra; and the mighty Chyavana paralysed Indra,\r\nand for his wife obtained the princess, Sukanya.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'How was the chastiser of the demon Paka, the god\r\npossessed of the six attributes, paralysed by Chyavana?

And he, of an exceedingly resplendent form, began to practise\r\nausterities by the side of yonder lake. And, O Pandu's son! O protector\r\nof men! he of mighty energy assumed the posture called Vira, quiet and\r\nstill like an inanimate post, and for a long period, remained at the same\r\nspot of ground. And he was turned into an anthill covered over with\r\ncreepers. And after the lapse of a long period, swarms of ants enveloped\r\nhim. And covered all over with ants, the sagacious saint looked exactly\r\nlike a heap of earth. And he went on practising austerities, enveloped on\r\nall sides with that ant-hill. Now after the lapse of a long space of\r\ntime, that ruler of earth, Saryati by name, for amusement visited this\r\npleasant and excellent lake. With him were four thousand females,\r\nespoused by him, O son of Bharata's race! there was also his only\r\ndaughter endued with beautiful brows, named Sukanya. She surrounded by\r\nher maids, and decked out with jewels fit for the celestials, while\r\nwalking about, approached the anthill where Bhrigu's son was seated. And\r\nsurrounded by her maids, she began to amuse herself there, viewing the\r\nbeautiful scenery, and looking at the lofty trees of the wood. And she\r\nwas handsome and in the prime of her youth; and she was amorous and bent\r\non frolicking. And she began to break the twigs of the forest trees\r\nbearing blossoms. And Bhrigu's son endued with intelligence beheld her\r\nwandering like lightning, without her maids, and wearing a single piece\r\nof cloth and decked with ornaments. And seeing her in the lone forest,\r\nthat ascetic of exceeding effulgence was inspired with desire. And that\r\nregenerate Rishi possessing ascetic energy, who had a low voice, called\r\nthe auspicious one,--but she heard him not. Then seeing the eyes of\r\nBhrigu's son from the ant-hill, Sukanya from curiosity and losing her\r\nsense, said, 'What is this?'--and with thorns pierced the eyes (of the\r\nRishi). And as his eyes being pierced by her, he felt exceeding pain and\r\nbecame wroth. And (from anger) he obstructed the calls of nature of\r\nSaryati's forces. And on their calls of nature being obstructed, the men\r\nwere greatly afflicted. And seeing this state of things, the king asked.\r\n'Who is it that hath done wrong to the illustrious son of Bhrigu, old and\r\never engaged in austerities and of wrathful temper? Tell me quick if ye\r\nknow it'. The soldiers (thereupon) answered him saying, 'We do not know\r\nwhether any one hath done wrong to the Rishi. Do thou, as thou list, make\r\na searching enquiry into the matter. Thereupon that ruler of earth, using\r\n(as he saw occasion) both menace and conciliation, asked his friends\r\n(about the circumstance). But they too did not know anything. Seeing that\r\nthe army was distressed owing to the obstruction of the calls of nature,\r\nand also finding her father aggrieved, Sukanya said, 'Roving in the\r\nforest, I lighted in the ant-hill here upon some brilliant substance.\r\nThereupon taking it for a glow-worm I neared it, and pierced it (with\r\nthorns); Hearing this Saryati immediately came to the ant-hill, and there\r\nsaw Bhrigu's son, old both in years and austerities. Then the lord of\r\nearth with joined hands, besought (the ascetic) saying, 'It behoveth thee\r\nto forgive what my daughter through ignorance and greenness, hath done\r\nunto thee.\" Chyavana the son of Bhrigu, addressed the monarch saying,\r\n'Disregarding me, this one, filled with pride hath pierced my eyes. Even\r\nher, O king, endued with beauty and who was bereft of her senses by\r\nignorance and temptation--even thy daughter would I have for my bride, I\r\ntell thee truly, on this condition alone will I forgive thee.'\r\n\r\nLomasa said, \"Hearing the words of the sage, Saryati, without pausing,\r\nbestowed his daughter on the high-souled Chyavana. Having received the\r\nhand of that girl, the holy one was pleased with the king. And having won\r\nthe Rishi's grace, the king went to his city, accompanied by his troops.\r\nAnd the faultless Sukanya also having obtained that ascetic for her\r\nhusband, began to tend him, practising penances, and observing the\r\nordinance.

And seeing that one of excellent limbs, and like\r\nunto the daughter of the lord of celestials, the nose-born Aswins neared\r\nher, and addressed her, saying, 'O thou of shapely thighs, whose daughter\r\nart thou? And what doest thou in this wood?

'I am devoted to\r\nmy husband, Chyavana: do ye not entertain any doubts (regarding my\r\nfidelity). Thereupon they again spake unto her, 'We two are the celestial\r\nphysicians of note. We will make thy lord young and graceful. Do thou\r\nthen select one of us, viz., ourselves and thy husband,--for thy partner.\r\nPromising this do thou, O auspicious one, bring hither thy husband.' .. O\r\nking, agreeably to their words she went to Bhrigu's son and communicated\r\nto him what the two celestials had said. Hearing her message, Chyavana\r\nsaid unto his wife, 'Do thou so.' Having received the permission of her\r\nlord, (she returned to the celestials) and said, 'Do ye so.' Then hearing\r\nher words, viz., 'Do ye so,' they spoke unto the king's daughter. 'Let\r\nthy husband enter into water.' Thereat Chyavana desirous of obtaining\r\nbeauty, quickly entered into water. The twin Aswins also, O king, sank\r\ninto the sheet of water. And the next moment they all came out of the\r\ntank in surpassingly beautiful forms, and young and wearing burnished\r\nearrings. And all, possessed of the same appearance pleasing to behold,\r\naddressed her saying, 'O fortunate one, do thou choose one of us for\r\nspouse. And O beauteous one, do thou select him for lord who may please\r\nthy fancy.' Finding, however, all of them of the same appearance she\r\ndeliberated; and at last ascertaining the identity of her husband, even\r\nselected him.\r\n\r\n\"Having obtained coveted beauty and also his wife, Chyavana, of exceeding\r\nenergy, well pleased, spake these words unto the nose-born celestials:\r\n'Since at your hands, an old man, I have obtained youth, and beauty, and\r\nalso this wife of mine, I will, well pleased, make you quaffers of the\r\nSoma juice in the presence of the lord of celestials himself.

And he saw Chyavana and Sukanya, like two\r\nchildren sprung from celestials, and his joy and that of his wife were as\r\ngreat as if the king had conquered the entire world. And the ruler of\r\nearth together with his wife was received honourably by that saint. And\r\nthe king seated himself near the ascetic, and entered into a delightful\r\nconversation of an auspicious kind. Then, O king, the son of Bhrigu spake\r\nto the king these words of a soothing nature: 'I shall, O king, officiate\r\nat a religious ceremony to be performed by thee: let the requisite\r\narticles, therefore, be procured.' Thereat, that protector of earth\r\nSaryati, experienced the very height of joy, and O great king, he\r\nexpressed his approbation of the proposal made by Chyavana. And on an\r\nauspicious day, suitable for the commencement of a sacrificial ceremony,\r\nSaryati ordered the erection of a sacrificial shrine of an excellent\r\ndescription and splendidly furnished with all desirable things. There\r\nChyavana, the son of Bhrigu, officiated for the king as his priest. Now\r\nlisten to me relating the wonderful events which happened at that spot.\r\nChyavana took up a quantity of the Soma juice, in order that he might\r\noffer the same to the Aswins, who were physicians to the celestials. And\r\nwhile the saint was taking up the intended offering for those celestial\r\ntwins, Indra pronounced his interdiction, saying, These Aswins both of\r\nthem in my opinion have no right to receive an offering of the Soma\r\njuice.' They are the physicians of the celestials in heaven,--this\r\nvocation of theirs hath disentitled them (in the matter of Soma).\r\nThereupon Chyavana said, 'These two are of mighty enterprise, possessed\r\nof mighty souls, and uncommonly endued with beauty and grace. And they, O\r\nIndra, have converted me into an eternally youthful person, even like\r\nunto a celestial. Why shouldst thou and the other celestials have a right\r\nto the distilled Soma juice, and not they? O lord of the celestials, O\r\ndemolisher of hostile towns! be it known to thee that the Aswins also\r\nrank as gods.' At this, Indra spake saying, These two practise the\r\nhealing art,--so they are but servants. And assuming forms at their\r\npleasure they roam about in the world of mortal beings. How can they then\r\nrightfully claim the juice of the Soma?\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'When these very identical words were spoken again and\r\nagain by the lord of celestials, the son of Bhrigu, setting Indra at\r\nnaught, took up the offering he had intended to make. And as he was about\r\nto take up an excellent portion of the Soma juice with the object of\r\noffering it to the two Aswins, the destroyer of the demon Vala (Indra)\r\nobserved his act, and thus spoke unto him, 'If thou take up the Soma with\r\na view to offering it to those celestials, I shall hurl at thee my\r\nthunderbolt of awful form, which is superior to all the weapons that\r\nexist.' Thus addressed by Indra, the son of Bhrigu, cast at Indra a\r\nsmiling glance, and took up in due form a goodly quantity of the Soma\r\njuice, to make an offering to the Aswins. Then Sachi's lord hurled at him\r\nthe thunderbolt of awful form. And as he was about to launch it, his arm\r\nwas paralysed by Bhrigu's son. And having paralysed his arm, Chyavana\r\nrecited sacred hymns, and made offering on the fire. His object gained,\r\nhe now attempted to destroy that celestial. Then by the virtue of that\r\nsaint's ascetic energy, an evil spirit came into being,--a huge demon,\r\nMada by name, of great strength and gigantic proportions. And his body\r\nwas incapable of being measured either by demons or by gods. And his\r\nmouth was terrible and of huge size, and with teeth of sharpened edge.\r\nAnd one of his jaws rested on the earth, and the other stretched to\r\nheaven. And he had four fangs, each extending as far as one hundred\r\nyojanas, and his other fangs were extended to the distance of ten\r\nyojanas, and were of a form resembling towers on a palace, and which\r\nmight be likened to the ends of spears. And his two arms were like unto\r\nhills, and extended ten thousand yojanas, and both were of equal bulk.\r\nAnd his two eyes resembled the sun and the moon; and his face rivalled\r\nthe conflagration at the universal dissolution. And he was licking his\r\nmouth with his tongue, which, like lightning, knew no rest. And his mouth\r\nwas open, and his glance was frightful, and seemed as if he would\r\nforcibly swallow up the world. The demon rushed at the celestial by whom\r\na hundred sacrifices had been performed. And his intent was to devour\r\nthat deity.

Then the lord of the\r\ncelestials, tortured with fright, spake to Chyavana saying, 'O Bhrigu's\r\nson!

I am desirous of hearing all this in connection with the life and\r\nachievements of that sagacious monarch. I should also like to hear how\r\nhis name of Mandhata originated, belonging as it did to him who rivalled\r\nin lustre Indra himself: and also how he of unrivalled strength was born,\r\nfor thou art skilled in the art of narrating events.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Hear with attention, O king! how the name of Mandhata\r\nbelonging to that monarch of mighty soul hath come to be celebrated\r\nthroughout all the worlds. Yuvanaswa, the ruler of the earth, was sprung\r\nfrom Ikshvaku's race. That protector of the earth performed many\r\nsacrificial rites noted for magnificent gifts. And the most excellent of\r\nall virtuous men performed a thousand times the ceremony of sacrificing a\r\nhorse. And he also performed other sacrifices of the highest order,\r\nwherein he made abundant gifts. But that saintly king had no son. And he\r\nof mighty soul and rigid vows made over to his ministers the duties of\r\nthe state, and became a constant resident of the woods.

And he was suffering from the pangs of hunger and his inner soul\r\nseemed parched with thirst. And (in this state) he entered the hermitage\r\nof Bhrigu. On that very night, O king of kings! the great saint who was\r\nthe delight of Bhrigu's race, had officiated in a religious ceremony,\r\nwith the object that a son might be born to Saudyumni. O king of kings!\r\nat the spot stood a large jar filled with water, consecrated with the\r\nrecitation of sacred hymns, and which had been previously deposited\r\nthere. And the water was endued with the virtue that the wife of\r\nSaudyumni would by drinking the same, bring forth a god-like son. Those\r\nmighty saints had deposited the jar on the altar and had gone to sleep,\r\nhaving been fatigued by keeping up the night. And as Saudyumni passed\r\nthem by, his palate was dry, and he was suffering greatly from thirst.\r\nAnd the king was very much in need of water to drink. And he entered that\r\nhermitage and asked for drink. And becoming fatigued, he cried in feeble\r\nvoice, proceeding from a parched throat, which resembled the weak\r\ninarticulate utterance of a bird. And his voice reached nobody's ears.\r\nThen the king beheld the jar filled with water. And he quickly ran\r\ntowards it, and having drunk the water, put the jar down. And as the\r\nwater was cool, and as the king had been suffering greatly from thirst,\r\nthe draught of water relieved the sagacious monarch and appeased his\r\nthirst. Then those saints together with him of ascetic wealth, awoke from\r\nsleep; and all of them observed that the water of the jar had gone.\r\nThereupon they met together and began to enquire as to who might have\r\ndone it. Then Yuvanaswa truthfully admitted that it was his act. Then the\r\nrevered son of Bhrigu spoke unto him, saying. 'It was not proper. This\r\nwater had an occult virtue infused into it, and had been placed there\r\nwith the object that a son might be born to thee. Having performed severe\r\nausterities, I infused the virtue of my religious acts in this water,\r\nthat a son might be born to thee. O saintly king of mighty valour and\r\nphysical strength! a son would have been born to thee of exceeding\r\nstrength and valour, and strengthened by austerities, and who would have\r\nsent by his bravery even Indra to the abode of the god of death. It was\r\nin this manner, O king! that this water had been prepared by me. By\r\ndrinking this water, O king, thou hast done what was not at all right.\r\nBut it is impossible now for us to turn back the accident which hath\r\nhappened. Surely what thou hast done must have been the fiat of Fate.\r\nSince thou, O great king, being a thirst hast drunk water prepared with\r\nsacred hymns, and filled with the virtue of my religious labours, thou\r\nmust bring forth out of thy own body a son of the character described\r\nabove. To that end we shall perform a sacrifice for thee, of wonderful\r\neffect so that, valorous as thou art, thou wilt bring forth a son equal\r\nto Indra. Nor with thou experience any trouble on account of the labour\r\npains.' Then when one hundred years had passed away, a son shining as the\r\nsun pierced the left side of the king endowed with a mighty soul, and\r\ncame forth. And the son was possessed of mighty strength. Nor did\r\nYuvanaswa die--which itself was strange. Then Indra of mighty strength\r\ncame to pay him a visit. And the deities enquired of the great Indra,\r\n'What is to be sucked by this boy?' Then Indra introduced his own\r\nforefinger into his mouth. And when the wielder of the thunderbolt said,\r\n'He will suck me,' the dwellers of heaven together with Indra christened\r\nthe boy Mandhata, (literally, Me he shall suck). Then the boy having\r\ntasted the forefinger extended by Indra, became possessed of mighty\r\nstrength, and he grew thirteen cubits, O king. And O great king! the\r\nwhole of sacred learning together with the holy science of arms, was\r\nacquired by that masterful boy, who gained all that knowledge by the\r\nsimple and unassisted power of his thought. And all at once, the bow\r\ncelebrated under the name of Ajagava and a number of shafts made of horn,\r\ntogether with an impenetrable coat of mail, came to his possession on the\r\nvery same day, O scion of Bharata's race! And he was placed on the throne\r\nby Indra himself and he conquered the three worlds in a righteous way, as\r\nVishnu did by his three strides. And the wheel of the car of that mighty\r\nking as irresistible in its course (throughout the world). And the gems,\r\nof their own accord, came into the possession of that saintly king. This\r\nis the tract of land, O lord of earth, which belonged to him. It abounds\r\nin wealth. He performed a number of sacrificial rites of various kinds,\r\nin which abundant gratuities were paid to the priests. O king! he of\r\nmighty force and unmeasured lustre, erected sacred piles, and performed\r\nsplendid pious deeds, and attained the position of sitting at Indra's\r\nside. That sagacious king of unswerving piety sent forth his fiat, and\r\nsimply by its virtue conquered the earth, together with the sea--that\r\nsource of gems--and all the cities (or [of?--JBH] the earth), O great\r\nking! The sacrificial grounds prepared by him were to be found all over\r\nthe earth on all sides round--not a single spot, but was marked with the\r\nsame. O great king! the mighty monarch is said to have given to the\r\nBrahmanas ten thousand padmas of kine. When there was a drought, which\r\ncontinued for twelve consecutive years, the mighty king caused rain to\r\ncome down for the growth of crops, paying no heed to Indra, the wielder\r\nof the thunder-bolt, who remained staring (at him). The mighty ruler of\r\nthe Gandhara land, born in the lunar dynasty of kings, who was terrible\r\nlike a a roaring cloud, was slain by him, who wounded him sorely with his\r\nshafts. O king! he of cultured soul protected the four orders of people,\r\nand by him of mighty force the worlds were kept from harm, by virtue of\r\nhis austere and righteous life. This is the spot where he, lustrous like\r\nthe sun, sacrificed to the god. Look at it! here it is, in the midst of\r\nthe field of the Kurus, situated in a tract, the holiest of all. O\r\npreceptor of earth! requested by thee, I have thus narrated to thee the\r\ngreat life of Mandhata, and also the way in which he was born, which was\r\na birth of an extraordinary kind.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"O scion of Bharata's race! Kunti's son, thus\r\naddressed by the mighty saint, Lomasa, immediately put fresh questions to\r\nhim, with regard to Somaka.\""

I am desirous of hearing an exact\r\naccount of his deeds and of his power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'O Yudhishthira! there was a virtuous king Somaka by name.\r\nHe had one hundred wives, O king, all suitably matched to their husband.\r\nHe took great care, but could not succeed in getting a single son from\r\nany one of them, and a long time elapsed during which he continued a\r\nsonless man. Once upon a time, when he had become old, and was trying\r\nevery means to have a son, a son was born to him, Jantu by name, out of\r\nthat century of women. And, O ruler of men! All the mothers used to sit\r\nsurrounding their son and every one giving him such objects as might\r\nconduce to his enjoyment and pleasure. And it came to pass that one day\r\nan ant stung the boy at his hip. And the boy screamed loudly on account\r\nof the pain caused by the sting. And forthwith the mothers were\r\nexceedingly distressed to see how the child had been stung by the ant.\r\nAnd they stood around him and set up cries. Thus there arose a tumultuous\r\nnoise. And that scream of pain suddenly reached (the ears of) the\r\nsovereign of the earth, when he was seated in the midst of his ministers,\r\nwith the family priest at his side. Then the king sent for information as\r\nto what it was about. And the royal usher explained to him precisely what\r\nthe matter was with reference to his son. And Somaka got up together with\r\nhis ministers and hastened towards the female apartments. And on coming\r\nthere, O subjugator of foes! he soothed his son. And having done so and\r\ncoming out from the female apartments, the king sat with his family\r\npriest and ministers.'\r\n\r\n\"Somaka then spoke thus, 'Fie on having only a single son! I had rather\r\nbe a sonless man. Considering how constantly liable to disease are all\r\norganized beings, to have an only son is but a trouble. O Brahmana! O my\r\nlord! With the view that I might have many sons born to me, this century\r\nof wives hath been wedded by me, after inspection, and after I had\r\nsatisfied myself that they would prove suitable to me. But issue they\r\nhave none. Having tried every means, and put forth great efforts, they\r\nhave borne this single son, Jantu. What grief can be greater than this? O\r\nmost excellent of the twice-born caste! I am grown old in years and so\r\nare my wives too. And yet this only son is like the breath of their\r\nnostrils, and so he is to me also. But is there any ceremony, by\r\ncelebrating which one may get a hundred sons? (And if there is one such),\r\ntell me whether it is great or small, and easy or difficult to perform.'\r\n\r\n\"The family priest said, 'There is a ceremony by virtue of which a man\r\nmay get a century of sons. If thou art able to perform it, O Somaka, then\r\nI shall explain it to thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Somaka said, 'Whether it be a good or an evil deed, the ceremony by\r\nwhich a hundred sons may be born, may be taken by thee as already\r\nperformed. Let thy blessed self explain it to me.'\r\n\r\n\"The family priest thereupon said, 'O king! Let me set on foot a\r\nsacrifice and thou must sacrifice thy son, Jantu in it. Then on no\r\ndistant date, a century of handsome sons will be born to thee. When\r\nJantu's fat will be put into the fire as an offering to the gods, the\r\nmothers will take a smell of that smoke, and bring forth a number of\r\nsons, valourous and strong. And Jantu also will once more be born as a\r\nself-begotten son of thine in that very (mother); and on his back there\r\nwill appear a mark of gold.'\""

While the fat was being made an offering of the agonised mothers\r\nsmelt its smell, and of a sudden fell to the ground (and swooned away.)\r\nAnd then all those lovely women became with child, and O lord of men!

And\r\non his back there was that mark of gold and of that century of sons, he\r\nwas also superior in merit. Then that family priest of Somaka departed\r\nthis life as also Somaka after a certain time. Now he beheld that the\r\npriest was being grilled in a terrible hell. And thereupon he questioned\r\nhim, 'Why art thou, O Brahmana! being grilled in this hell?\" Then the\r\nfamily priest exceedingly scorched with fire, spake to him saying, 'This\r\nis the outcome of my having officiated in that sacrifice of thine.'

And when his sins were worked off, he was set free\r\ntogether with the priest. O king! Fond of the priest as he was, he won\r\nall those blessings to which he had entitled himself by his meritorious\r\nacts and shared everything with the family priest. This is his hermitage\r\nwhich looketh lovely before our eyes. Any one would attain the blessed\r\nregions, if he should spend six nights here controlling his passions. O\r\nking of kings!

O respected sir! here,\r\nafter having performed sacrificial rites of the Saraswata king, and\r\nmaking use of the sacrificial stake for their pestle, the highest order\r\nof saints performed the holy plunge prescribed at the end of a sacred\r\nceremony. O monarch! King Bharata here performed sacrificial rites. To\r\ncelebrate the horse-sacrifice, he here set free the horse who was the\r\nintended victim.

Here is the\r\nbeautiful and sacred river, Saraswati, full of water: and here, O lord of\r\nmen, is the spot known as Vinasana, or the place where the Saraswati\r\ndisappeared. Here is the gate of the kingdom of the Nishadas and it is\r\nfrom hatred for them that the Saraswati entered into the earth in order\r\nthat the Nishadas might not see her. Here too is the sacred region of\r\nChamashodbheda where the Saraswati once more became visible to them. And\r\nhere she is joined by other sacred rivers running seawards.

In Yonder lake also\r\npeople desirous of securing welfare to the family, propitiate with\r\nsacrifices the holder of the great bow Pinaka, in the month of Chaitra.\r\nAnd persons of devotion having passions under control, performing their\r\nablutions in this lake, become free from sins and, without doubt, attain\r\nto the holy regions.

I have been sore afflicted with hunger.\r\nDo thou not withhold from me that which hath been appointed by the Deity\r\nfor my food,--under the impression that thereby thou servest the\r\ninterests of virtue, whereas in reality, thou wilt forsake it, (by\r\ncommitting thyself to this act). Thereupon, the king said, 'O best of the\r\nfeathered race, afflicted with fear of thee, and desirous of escaping\r\nfrom thy hands, this bird, all in a hurry, hath come up to me asking for\r\nlife. When this pigeon hath in such a manner sought my protection, why\r\ndost thou not see that the highest merit is even in my not surrendering\r\nit unto thee? And it is trembling with fear, and is agitated, and is\r\nseeking its life from me. It is therefore certainly blameworthy to\r\nforsake it. He that slayeth a Brahmana, he that slaughtered a cow--the\r\ncommon mother of all the worlds--and he that forsaketh one seeking for\r\nprotection are equally sinful.' Thereat the hawk replied, 'O lord of\r\nearth, it is from food that all beings derive their life, and it is food\r\nalso that nourisheth and sustaineth them. A man can live long even after\r\nforsaking what is dearest to him, but he cannot do so, after abstaining\r\nfrom food. Being deprived of food, my life, O ruler of men, will surely\r\nleave this body, and will attain to regions unknown to such troubles. But\r\nat my death, O pious king, my wife and children will surely perish, and\r\nby protecting this single pigeon. O prince, thou dost not protect many\r\nlives. The virtue that standeth in the way of another virtue, is\r\ncertainly no virtue at all, but in reality is unrighteousness. But O\r\nking, whose prowess consisteth in truth, that virtue is worthy of the\r\nname, which is not conflicting. After instituting a comparison between\r\nopposing virtues, and weighing their comparative merits, one, O great\r\nprince, ought to espouse that which is not opposing. Do thou, therefore,\r\nO king, striking a balance between virtues, adopt that which\r\npreponderates.' At this the king said, 'O best of birds, as thou speakest\r\nwords fraught with much good, I suspect thee to be Suparna, the monarch\r\nof birds. I have not the least hesitation to declare that thou art fully\r\nconversant with the ways of virtue. As thou speakest wonders about\r\nvirtue, I think that there is nothing connected with it, that is unknown\r\nto thee. How canst thou then consider the forsaking of one, seeking for\r\nhelp, as virtuous? Thy efforts in this matter, O ranger of the skies,\r\nhave been in quest of food. Thou canst, however, appease thy hunger with\r\nsome other sort of food, even more copious. I am perfectly willing to\r\nprocure for thee any sort of food that to thee may seem most tasteful,\r\neven if it be an ox, or a boar, or a deer, or a buffalo.' Thereupon the\r\nhawk said, 'O great king, I am not desirous of eating (the flesh of) a\r\nboar or an ox or the various species of beasts. What have I to do with\r\nany other sort of food? Therefore, O bull among the Kshatriyas, leave to\r\nme this pigeon, whom Heaven hath today ordained for my food, O ruler of\r\nearth, that hawks eat pigeons is the eternal provision. O prince, do not\r\nfor support embrace a plantain tree, not knowing its want of strength.'\r\nThe king said, 'Ranger of the skies, I am willing to bestow on thee this\r\nrich province of my race, or any other thing that to thee may seem\r\ndesirable. With the sole exception of this pigeon, which hath approached\r\nme craving my protection, I shall be glad to give unto thee anything that\r\nthou mayst like. Let me know what I shall have to do for the deliverance\r\nof this bird. But this I shall not return to thee on any condition\r\nwhatever.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The hawk said, 'O great ruler of men, if thou hast conceived an\r\naffection for this pigeon, then cut off a portion of thine own flesh, and\r\nweigh it in a balance, against this pigeon. And when thou hast found it\r\nequal (in weight) to the pigeon, then do thou give it unto me, and that\r\nwill be to my satisfaction.' Then the king replied, This request of\r\nthine, O hawk, I consider as a favour unto me, and, therefore, I will\r\ngive unto thee even my own flesh, after weighing it in a balance.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Saying this, O mighty son of Kunti, the highly virtuous\r\nking cut off a portion of his own flesh, and placed it in a balance,\r\nagainst the pigeon. But when he found that pigeon exceeded his flesh in\r\nweight, he once more cut off another portion of his flesh, and added it\r\nto the former. When portion after portion had been repeatedly added to\r\nweigh against the pigeon, and no more flesh was left on his body, he\r\nmounted the scale himself, utterly devoid of flesh.\r\n\r\n\"The hawk then said, 'I am Indra, O virtuous king, and this pigeon is\r\nAgni, the carrier of the sacrificial clarified butter. We had come unto\r\nthy sacrificial ground, desirous of testing thy merit. Since thou hast\r\ncut off thy own flesh from thy body, thy glory shall be resplendent, and\r\nshall surpass that of all others in the world. As long as men, O king,\r\nshall speak of thee, so long shall thy glory endure, and thou shalt\r\ninhabit the holy regions.' Saying this to the king, Indra ascended to\r\nheaven. And the virtuous king Usinara, after having filled heaven and\r\nearth with the merit of his pious deeds, ascended to heaven in a radiant\r\nshape. Behold, O king, the residence of that noble-hearted monarch. Here,\r\nO king, are seen holy sages and gods, together with virtuous and\r\nhighsouled Brahmanas.\""

Worship, O son of Kunti, with thy\r\nbrothers, the sacred hermitage of him who had for his grandson\r\nAshtavakra, who, even when a mere child, had caused Vandin to be drowned\r\nin a river, after having defeated him in a (literary) contest.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, Tell me, O Lomasa, all about the power of this man,\r\nwho had in that way defeated Vandin. Why was he born as Ashtavakra\r\n(crooked in eight parts in his body)?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, The sage Uddalaka had a disciple named Kahoda of subdued\r\npassions, and entirely devoted to the service of his preceptor and who\r\nhad continued his studies long. The Brahmana had served his tutor long,\r\nand his preceptor, recognising his service, gave him his own daughter,\r\nSujata, in marriage, as well as a mastery over the Shastras. And she\r\nbecame with child, radiant as fire. And the embryo addressed his father\r\nwhile employed in reading, 'O father, thou hast been reading the whole\r\nnight, but (of all that) thy reading doth not seem to me correct. Even in\r\nmy fetal state I have, by thy favour, become versed in the Shastras and\r\nthe Vedas with their several branches. I say, O father, that what\r\nproceeds from thy mouth, is not correct.' Thus insulted in the presence\r\nof his disciples, the great sage in anger cursed his child in the womb,\r\nsaying, 'Because thou speakest thus even while in the womb, therefore\r\nthou shalt be crooked in eight parts of the body.' The child was\r\naccordingly born crooked, and the great sage was ever after known by the\r\nname of Ashtavakra. Now, he had an uncle named Swetaketu who was the same\r\nage with himself. Afflicted by the growth of the child in the womb,\r\nSujata, desirous of riches, conciliating her husband who had no wealth\r\ntold him in private: 'How shall I manage, O great sage, the tenth month\r\nof my pregnancy having come? Thou hast no substance whereby I may\r\nextricate myself from the exigencies, after I have been delivered.\" Thus\r\naddressed by his wife, Kahoda went unto king Janaka for riches. He was\r\nthere defeated in a controversy by Vandin, well versed in the science of\r\narguments, and (in consequence) was immersed into water. And hearing that\r\nhis son-in-law had been defeated in a controversy by Vandin and caused to\r\nbe drowned by him, Uddalaka spake unto his daughter Sujata, saying, 'Thou\r\nshall keep it a secret from Ashtavakra.' She accordingly kept her\r\ncounsel--so that Ashtavakra, when born, had heard nothing about the\r\nmatter. And he regarded Uddalaka as his father and Swetaketu as his\r\nbrother. And when Ashtavakra was in his twelfth year, Swetaketu one day\r\nsaw the former seated on his father's lap. And thereat he pulled him by\r\nthe hand, and on Ashtavakra's beginning to cry, he told him, 'It is not\r\nthe lap of thy father.' This cruel communication went direct into\r\nAshtavakra's heart and it pained him sorely. And he went home and asked\r\nhis mother saying, 'Where is my father?' Thereupon Sujata who was greatly\r\nafflicted (by his question), and apprehending a curse told him all that\r\nhad happened. And having heard all, the Brahmana at night said unto his\r\nuncle Swetaketu, 'Let us go unto the sacrifice of king Janaka, wherein\r\nmany wonderful things are to be seen. There we shall listen to the\r\ncontroversy between the Brahmanas and shall partake of excellent food.\r\nOur knowledge also will increase. The recitation of the sacred Vedas is\r\nsweet to hear and is fraught with blessings.' Then they both--uncle and\r\nnephew--went unto the splendid sacrifice of king Janaka. And on being\r\ndriven from the entrance, Ashtavakra met the king and addressed him in\r\nthe following words.\""

But when a Brahmana is met with on the way, it\r\nbelongeth to him alone.' Thereupon the king said, 'I give the privilege\r\nto enter. Do thou, therefore, go in by whatever way thou likest. No fire\r\never so small is to be slighted. Even Indra himself boweth unto the\r\nBrahmanas.' At this Ashtavakra said, 'We have come, O ruler of men, to\r\nwitness thy sacrificial ceremony and our curiosity, O king, is very\r\ngreat. And we have come here as guests. We want the permission of thy\r\norder (to enter). And, O son of Indradyumna, we have come, desirous of\r\nseeing the sacrifice, and to meet king Janaka and speak to him. But thy\r\nwarder obstructs us and for this our anger burneth us like fever.' The\r\nwarder said, 'We carry out the orders of Vandin. Listen to what I have to\r\nsay. Lads are not permitted to enter here and it is only the learned old\r\nBrahmanas that are allowed to enter.' Ashtavakra said. 'If this be the\r\ncondition, O warder, that the door is open to those only that are old,\r\nthen we have a right to enter. We are old and we have observed sacred\r\nvows and are in possession of energy proceeding from the Vedic lore. And\r\nwe have served our superiors and subdued our passions--and have also won\r\nproficiency in knowledge. It is said that even boys are not to be\r\nslighted,--for a fire, small though it be, burneth on being touched.' The\r\nwarder replied, 'O young Brahmana, I consider you a boy, and therefore\r\nrecite, if you know, the verse demonstrating the existence of the Supreme\r\nBeing, and adored by the divine sages, and which, although composed of\r\none letter, is yet multifarious. Make no vain boast. Learned men are\r\nreally very rare.' Ashtavakra said, 'True growth cannot be inferred from\r\nthe mere development of the body, as the growth of the knots of the\r\nSalmali tree cannot signify its age. That tree is called full-grown which\r\nalthough slender and short, beareth fruits. But that which doth not bear\r\nfruits, is not considered as grown.' The warder said, 'Boys receive\r\ninstruction from the old and they also in time grow old. Knowledge\r\ncertainly is not attainable in a short time. \"Wherefore then being a\r\nchild, dost thou talk like an old man?' Then Ashtavakra said, 'One is not\r\nold because his head is gray. But the gods regard him as old who,\r\nalthough a child in years, is yet possessed of knowledge. The sages have\r\nnot laid down that a man's merit consists in years, or gray hair, or\r\nwealth, or friends. To us he is great who is versed in the Vedas. I have\r\ncome here, O porter, desirous of seeing Vandin in the court. Go and\r\ninform king Janaka, who hath a garland of lotuses on his neck, that I am\r\nhere. Thou shalt to-day see me enter into a dispute with the learned men,\r\nand defeat Vandin in a controversy. And when others have been silenced,\r\nthe Brahmanas of matured learning and the king also with his principal\r\npriests, bear witness to the superior or the inferior quality of my\r\nattainments.' The warder said, 'How canst thou, who art but in thy tenth\r\nyear, hope to enter into this sacrifice, into which learned and educated\r\nmen only are admitted? I shall, however, try some means for thy\r\nadmittance. Do thou also try thyself'. Ashtavakra then addressing the\r\nking said, 'O king, O foremost of Janaka's race, thou art the paramount\r\nsovereign and all power reposeth in thee. In times of old, king Yayati\r\nwas the celebrator of sacrifices. And in the present age, thou it is that\r\nart performer thereof. We have heard that the learned Vandin, after\r\ndefeating (in controversy) men expert in discussion, causeth them to be\r\ndrowned by faithful servants employed by thee. Hearing this, I have come\r\nbefore these Brahmanas, to expound the doctrine of the unity of the\r\nSupreme Being. Where is now Vandin? Tell me so that I may approach him,\r\nand destroy him, even as the sun destroyeth the stars. Thereupon the king\r\nsaid, 'Thou hopest, O Brahmana, to defeat Vandin, not knowing his power\r\nof speech. Can those who are familiar with his power, speak as thou dost?\r\nHe hath been sounded by Brahmanas versed in the Vedas. Thou hopest to\r\ndefeat Vandin, only because thou knowest not his powers (of speech). Many\r\na Brahmana hath waned before him, even as the stars before the sun.\r\nDesirous of defeating him, people proud of their learning, have lost\r\ntheir glory on appearing before him, and have retired from his presence,\r\nwithout even venturing to speak with the members of the assembly.'\r\nAshtavakra said, 'Vandin hath never entered into disputation with a man\r\nlike myself, and it is for this only that he looketh upon himself as a\r\nlion, and goeth about roaring like one. But to-day meeting me he will lie\r\ndown dead, even like a cart on the highway, of which the wheels have been\r\nderanged.' The king said, 'He alone is a truly learned man who\r\nunderstandeth the significance of the thing that hath thirty divisions,\r\ntwelve parts twentyfour joints, and three hundred and sixty spokes.'\r\nAshtavakra said, 'May that ever-moving wheel that hath twentyfour joints,\r\nsix naves, twelve peripheries, and sixty spokes protect thee![19]' The\r\nking said, 'Who amongst the gods beareth those two which go together like\r\ntwo mares (yoked to a car), and sweep like a hawk, and to what also do\r\nthey give birth?' Ashtavakra said, 'May God, O king, forfend the presence\r\nof these two[20] in thy house; aye, even in the house of thine enemies.\r\nHe who appeareth, having for his charioteer the wind,[21] begetteth them,\r\nand they also produce him.' Thereupon the king said, 'What is that doth\r\nnot close its eyes even while sleeping; what is it that doth not move,\r\neven when born; what is it that hath no heart; and what doth increase\r\neven in its own speed?' Ashtavakra said, 'It is a fish[22] that doth not\r\nclose its eye-lids, while sleeping; and it is an a egg[23] that doth not\r\nmove when produced; it is stone[24] that hath no heart; and it is a\r\nriver[25] that increase in its own speed.'\r\n\r\n\"The king said, 'It seemeth, O possessor of divine energy, that thou art\r\nno human being. I consider thee not a boy, but a matured man; there is no\r\nother man who can compare with thee in the art of speech. I therefore\r\ngive thee admittance. There is Vandin.'\""

When though\r\nwilt engage with me in staking, thou wilt not be able to flow like the\r\ncurrent of a river. I am like a full-flaming fire. Be silent before me, O\r\nVandin!

Thereat Vandin said,\r\n'One only fire blazeth forth in various shapes; one only sun illumineth\r\nthis whole world; one only hero, Indra, the lord of celestials,\r\ndestroyeth enemies; and one only Yama is the sole lord of the Pitris.[26]\r\nAshtavakra said, 'The two friends, Indra and Agni, ever move together;\r\nthe two celestial sages are Narada and Parvata; twins are the\r\nAswinikumaras; two is the number of the wheels of a car; and it is as a\r\ncouple that husband and wife live together, as ordained by the\r\ndeity.'[27] Vandin said, 'Three kinds of born beings are produced by\r\nacts; the three Vedas together perform the sacrifice, Vajapeya; at three\r\ndifferent times, the Adhwaryus commence sacrificial rites; three is the\r\nnumber of words: and three also are the divine lights.'[28] Ashtavakra\r\nsaid, 'Four are the Asramas of the Brahmanas; the four orders perform\r\nsacrifices; four are the cardinal points; four is the number of letters;\r\nand four also, as is ever known, are the legs of a cow.'[29] Vandin said,\r\n'Five is the number of fires; five are the feet of the metre called\r\nPunki; five are the sacrifices; five locks, it is said in the Vedas, are\r\non the heads of the Apsaras; and five sacred rivers are known in the\r\nworld.'[30] Ashtavakra said. 'Six cows, it is asserted by some, and paid\r\nas a gratuity on the occasion of establishing the sacred fire; six are\r\nthe seasons belonging to the wheel of time; six is the number of the\r\nsenses; six stars constitute the constellation Kirtika; and six, it is\r\nfound in all the Vedas, is the number of the Sadyaska sacrifice.'[31]\r\nVandin said, 'Seven is the number of the domesticated animals; seven are\r\nthe wild animals; seven metres are used in completing a sacrifice; seven\r\nare the Rishis, seven forms of paying homage are extant (in the world);\r\nand seven, it is known, are the strings of the Vina.'[32] Ashtavakra\r\nsaid, 'Eight are the bags containing a hundred fold; eight is the number\r\nof the legs of the Sarabha, which preyeth upon lions; eight Vasus, as we\r\nhear, are amongst the celestials; and eight are the angles of yupa\r\n(stake), in all sacrificial rites.'[33] Vandin said, 'Nine is the number\r\nof the mantras used in kindling the fire in sacrifices to the Pitris;\r\nnine are the appointed functions in the processes of creation; nine\r\nletters compose the foot of the metre, Vrihati; and nine also is ever the\r\nnumber of the figures (in calculation).'[34] Ashtavakra said, 'Ten is\r\nsaid to be the number of cardinal points, entering into the cognition of\r\nmen in this world; ten times hundred make up a thousand; ten is the\r\nnumber of months, during which women bear; and ten are the teachers of\r\ntrue knowledge, and ten, the haters thereof, and ten again are those\r\ncapable of learning it.'[35] Vandin said, 'Eleven are the objects\r\nenjoyable by beings; eleven is the number of the yupas; eleven are the\r\nchanges of the natural state pertaining to those having life; and eleven\r\nare the Rudras among the gods in heaven.'[36] Ashtavakra said, Twelve\r\nmonths compose the year; twelve letters go to the composition of a foot\r\nof the metre called Jagati; twelve are the minor sacrifices; and twelve,\r\naccording to the learned, is the number of the Adityas.'[37] Vandin said,\r\n'The thirteenth lunar day is considered the most auspicious; thirteen\r\nislands exist on earth.[38]\r\n\r\nLomasa said, 'Having proceeded thus far, Vandin stopped. Thereupon\r\nAshtavakra supplied the latter half of the sloka. Ashtavakra said,\r\n'Thirteen sacrifices are presided over by Kesi; and thirteen are devoured\r\nby Atichhandas, (the longer metres) of the Veda.[39] And seeing\r\nAshtavakra speaking and the Suta's son silent, and pensive, and with head\r\ndowncast, the assembly broke into a long uproar. And when the tumult thus\r\narose in the splendid sacrifice performed by king Janaka, the Brahmanas\r\nwell pleased, and with joined hands, approached Ashtavakra, and began to\r\npay him homage.'\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon Ashtavakra said, 'Before this, this man, defeating the\r\nBrahmanas in controversy, used to cast them into water. Let Vandin today\r\nmeet with the same fate. Seize him and drown him in water.' Vandin said.\r\n'O Janaka, I am the son of king Varuna. Simultaneously with thy\r\nsacrifice, there also hath commenced a sacrifice extending over twelve\r\nyears. It is for this that I have despatched the principal Brahmanas\r\nthither. They have gone to witness Varuna's sacrifice. Lo! there they are\r\nreturning. I pay homage to the worshipful Ashtavakra, by whose grace\r\nto-day I shall join him who hath begot me.'\r\n\r\n\"Ashtavakra said, 'Defeating the Brahmanas either by words or subtlety.\r\nVandin had cast them into the waters of the sea. (That Vedic truth which\r\nhe had suppressed by false arguments), have I to-day rescued by dint of\r\nmy intellect. Now let candid men judge. As Agni, who knoweth the\r\ncharacter of both the good and the bad, leaveth unscorched by his heat\r\nthe bodies of those whose designs are honest, and is thus partial to\r\nthem, so good men judge the assertions of boys, although lacking the\r\npower of speech, and are favourably disposed towards them. O Janaka, thou\r\nhearest my words as if thou hast been stupefied in consequence of having\r\neaten the fruit of the Sleshmataki tree. Or flattery hath robbed thee of\r\nthy sense, and for this it is that although pierced by my words as an\r\nelephant (by the hook), thou hearest them not.'\r\n\r\n\"Janaka said, 'Listening to thy words, I take them to be excellent and\r\nsuperhuman. Thy form also standeth manifest as superhuman. As thou hast\r\nto-day defeated Vandin in discussion, I place even him at thy disposal.'\r\nAshtavakra said, 'O king, Vandin remaining alive, will not serve any\r\npurpose of mine. If his father be really Varuna, let him be drowned in\r\nthe sea.'\r\n\r\nVandin said, 'I am King Varuna's son. I have no fear (therefore) in being\r\ndrowned. Even at this moment. Ashtavakra shall see his long-lost sire,\r\nKahoda.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Then rose before Janaka all the Brahmanas, after having\r\nbeen duly worshipped by the magnanimous Varuna. Kahoda said, 'It is for\r\nthis, O Janaka, that men pray for sons, by performing meritorious acts.\r\nThat in which I had failed hath been achieved by my son. Weak persons may\r\nhave sons endued with strength; dunces may have intelligent sons; and the\r\nilliterate may have sons possessed of learning.' Vandin said, 'It is with\r\nthy sharpened axe, O monarch, that even Yama severeth the heads of foes.\r\nMay prosperity attend thee! In this sacrifice of king Janaka, the\r\nprincipal hymns relating to the Uktha rites are being chanted, and the\r\nSoma juice also is being adequately quaffed. And the gods themselves, in\r\nperson, and with cheerful hearts, are accepting their sacred shares.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'When in enhanced splendour, the Brahmanas had risen up,\r\nVandin, taking king Janaka's permission, entered into the waters of the\r\nsea. And then Ashtavakra worshipped his father, and he himself also was\r\nworshipped by the Brahmanas. And having thus defeated the Suta's son.[40]\r\nAshtavakra returned to his own excellent hermitage, in company with his\r\nuncle. Then in the presence of his mother, his father addressed him,\r\nsaying, '(O son), thou speedily enter into this river, Samanga.' And\r\naccordingly, he entered (into the water). (And as he plunged beneath the\r\nwater), all his (crooked) limbs were immediately made straight. And from\r\nthat day that river came to be called Samanga and she became invested\r\nwith the virtues of purifying (sins). He that shall bathe in her, will be\r\nfreed from his sins. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, do thou with thy brothers\r\nand wife descend to the river, and perform thy ablutions. O Kunti's son,\r\nO scion of the Ajamidha race, living happily and cheerfully at this place\r\ntogether with thy brothers and the Brahmanas, thou wilt perform with me\r\nother acts of merit, being intent upon good deeds.'\""

O son of Kunti, do thou together with thy ministers, touch (the\r\nwaters) of this lake called Punya, and this mountain Bhrigutunga and also\r\n(the water of) these two rivers, called Tushniganga. Here, O Kunti's son,\r\nappeareth the hermitage of the sage Sthulasiras. Resign here thy anger\r\nand sense of self-importance.

And how also did he perish?\r\nI am anxious to hear all this, just as it happened. I take delight in\r\nlistening to the narration of the deeds of god-like men.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Bharadwaja and Raivya were two friends. And they dwelt\r\nhere, ever taking the greatest pleasure in each other's company. Now,\r\nRaivya had two sons, named Arvavasu and Paravasu. And, Bharadwaja, O\r\nBharata's son, had an only son, named Yavakri. Raivya and his two sons\r\nwere versed in the Vedas, while Bharadwaja practised asceticism. But, O\r\nson of Bharata, from their boyhood, the friendship subsisting between\r\nthose two was unequalled. O sinless one, the highspirited Yavakri finding\r\nthat his father, who practised asceticism, was slighted by the Brahmanas,\r\nwhile Raivya with his sons was greatly respected by them, was overwhelmed\r\nwith sorrow, and became sore aggrieved. Thereupon, O son of Pandu, he\r\nentered upon severe austerities, for (obtaining) a knowledge of the\r\nVedas. And he exposed his body to a flaming fire. By thus practising the\r\nmost rigid austerities, he caused anxiety in the mind of Indra. Then\r\nIndra, O Yudhishthira, went to him and addressed him saying, 'Wherefore,\r\nO sage, hast thou become engaged in practising such rigid austerities?'\r\nYavakri said, 'O thou adored of celestial hosts, I am practising severe\r\npenances, because I wish that such a knowledge of the Vedas as hath never\r\nbeen acquired by any Brahmana whatever, may be manifest unto me. O\r\nconqueror of Paka, these endeavours of mine have been for Vedic lore. O\r\nKausika, by the force of my asceticism. I purpose to obtain all sorts of\r\nknowledge. O lord, a knowledge of the Vedas as learnt through teachers,\r\nis acquired in a long time. Therefore, (with the view of attaining in\r\nshort time a proficiency in the Vedas), I have put forth these high\r\nendeavours.' Indra said, 'O Brahmana sage, the way that thou hast adopted\r\nis not the proper way. What for, O Brahamana, wilt thou destroy thyself?\r\nGo and learn from the lips of a preceptor.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'O son of Bharata, having said this, Sakra went away, and\r\nYavakri of immeasurable energy, once more directed his attention to\r\nasceticism. O king, we have heard that carrying on severe austerities he\r\nagain greatly agitated Indra. And the god Indra, slayer of Vala, again\r\ncame unto that great sage, who was engaged in austere penances; and\r\nforbade him, saying, Thou art striving with the object that Vedic lore\r\nmay be manifest unto thee as well as unto thy father; but thy exertions\r\ncan never be successful, nor is this act of thine well-advised.' Yavakri\r\nsaid, 'O lord of the celestials, if thou wilt not do for me what I want,\r\nI shall, observing stricter vows, practise still severer penances. O lord\r\nof celestials! know that if thou do not fulfil all my desires, I shall\r\nthen cut off my limbs and offer them as a sacrifice into a blazing fire.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Knowing the determination of that high-souled sage, the\r\nsagacious Indra reflected and hit upon some expedient to dissuade him.\r\nThen Indra assumed the guise of an ascetic Brahmana, hundreds of years\r\nold, and infirm, and suffering from consumption. And he fell to throwing\r\nup a dam with sands, at that spot of the Bhagirathi to which Yavakri used\r\nto descend for performing ablutions. Because Yavakri, chief of the\r\nBrahmanas, paid no heed to Indra's words, the latter began to fill the\r\nGanga with sands. And without cessation, he threw handfuls of sand into\r\nthe Bhagirathi, and began to construct the dam attracting the notice of\r\nthe sage. And when that bull among the sages, Yavakri, saw Indra thus\r\nearnestly engaged in constructing the dam, he broke into laughter, and\r\nsaid the following words, 'What art thou engaged in, O Brahmana, and what\r\nis thy object? Why dost thou, for nothing, make this mighty endeavour?'\r\nIndra said, 'I am trying, O my son, to dam the Ganga so that there may be\r\na commodious passage. People experience considerable difficulty in\r\ncrossing and recrossing (the river) by boat.' Yavakri said, 'O thou of\r\nascetic wealth, thou canst not dam up this mighty current. O Brahmana,\r\ndesist from, what is impracticable, and take up something that is\r\npracticable.' Indra said, 'O sage, I have imposed on myself this heavy\r\ntask, even as, for obtaining a knowledge of the Vedas, thou hast begun\r\nthese penances, which can never be fruitful.' Yavakri said, 'If, O chief\r\nof the celestials, those efforts of mine be fruitless, even as those of\r\nthy own, then, O lord of heavenly hosts, be thou pleased to do for me\r\nwhat is practicable. Vouchsafe unto me boons whereby I may excel other\r\nmen.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said 'Then Indra granted boons, as was prayed for by the mighty\r\nascetic, Indra said, 'As thou desirest, the Vedas will be manifest unto\r\nthee, yea--even unto thy father. And all thy other desires will also be\r\nfulfilled. Return home, O Yavakri.'\r\n\r\n\"Having thus obtained the object of his desire, Yavakri came unto his\r\nfather and said, The Vedas, O father, will be manifest unto thee as well\r\nas unto myself and I have obtained boons whereby we shall excel all men.'\r\nThereat Bharadwaja said, 'O my son, as thou hast obtained the objects of\r\nthy desire, thou wilt be proud. And when thou art puffed up with pride\r\nand hast also become uncharitable, destruction will soon overtake thee. O\r\nmy son, there is a current anecdote narrated by the gods. In ancient\r\ntimes, O son, there lived a sage named Valadhi, possessed of great\r\nenergy. And in grief for the death of a child, he practised the severest\r\npenances to have a child that should be immortal. And he obtained a son\r\neven as he desired. But the gods, though very favourably disposed\r\n(towards him), did not yet make his son immortal like unto the gods. They\r\nsaid, 'On condition can a mortal being be made immortal. Thy son's life,\r\nhowever, shall depend on some instrumental cause.' Thereupon, Valadhi\r\nsaid, 'O chiefs of the celestials, these mountains have been existing\r\neternally, and indestructible, let them be the instrumental cause of my\r\nson's life. Afterwards a son was born to the sage, named Medhavi. And he\r\nwas of a very irritable temper. And hearing of (the incident of his\r\nbirth), he grew haughty, and began to insult the sages. And he ranged\r\nover the earth, doing mischief to the munis. And one day, meeting with\r\nthe learned sage Dhannushaksha endued with energy. Medhavi maltreated\r\nhim. Thereupon, the former cursed him, saying, 'Be thou reduced to\r\nashes.' Medhavi, however, was not reduced to ashes. Then Dhannushaksha\r\ncaused the mountain which was the instrumental cause of Medhavi's life,\r\nto be shattered by buffaloes. And the boy perished, with the destruction\r\nof the instrumental cause of his life. And embracing his dead son,\r\nMedhavi's father began to bewail his fate. Now hear from me, O my son,\r\nwhat was chanted by the sages conversant with the Vedas, when they found\r\nthe sage mourning. A mortal on no condition whatever can overcome what\r\nhath been ordained by Fate, Lo! Dhannushaksha succeeded in shattering\r\neven the mountain by buffaloes. Thus young ascetics, puffed up with pride\r\nfor having obtained boons, perish in a short time. Be thou not one of\r\nthem. This Raivya, O my son, is possessed of great energy, and his two\r\nsons are like him. Therefore, be thou vigilant--so as never to approach\r\nhim. O my son, Raivya is a great ascetic of an irritable temper. When\r\nangry, he can do thee harm. Yavakri said, 'I shall do as thou biddest me.\r\nOf father, do thou not by any means entertain anxiety for that. Raivya\r\ndeserveth my regard even as thou, my father.' Having replied unto his\r\nfather in these sweet words, Yavakri, fearing nothing and nobody, began\r\nto delight in wantonly offending other munis.\""

And O son\r\nof Bharata, in that beautiful hermitage, adorned with trees bearing\r\nblossoms, he happened to behold the daughter-in-law of Raivya, sauntering\r\nabout like a Kinnara woman. And having lost his senses through passion,\r\nYavakri shamelessly spake unto the bashful maiden, saying, 'Be thou\r\nattached unto me.' Thereupon, knowing his nature, and afraid of a curse,\r\nas well as thinking of Raivya's power, she went unto him saying, 'I\r\nagree.' Then, O son of Bharata, taking him in private, she kept him\r\nchained. O conqueror of foes, returning to his hermitage, Raivya found\r\nhis daughter-in-law, Paravasu's wife, in tears. O Yudhishthira, thereat\r\nconsoling her with soft words, he enquired of her as to the cause of her\r\ngrief. Thereupon, the beautiful damsel told him all that Yavakri had said\r\nunto her, and what she also had cleverly said unto him. Hearing of this\r\ngross misbehaviour of Yavakri, the mind of the sage flamed up, and he\r\nwaxed exceedingly wroth. And being thus seized with passion, the great\r\nsage of a highly irascible temper, tore off a matted lock of his hair,\r\nand with holy mantras, offered it as a sacrifice on the sacred fire. At\r\nthis, there sprang out of it a female exactly resembling his\r\ndaughter-in-law. And then he plucked another matted lock of his hair, and\r\nagain offered it as a sacrifice into the fire. Thereupon sprang out of it\r\na demon, terrible to behold, and having fierce eyes. Then those, two\r\nspake unto Raivya, saying, 'What shall we do?' Thereat, the angry sage\r\nsaid unto them, 'Go and kill Yavakri.' Then saying, 'We shall do (as thou\r\nbiddest)'--they two went away with the intention of slaying Yavakri. And\r\nwith her charms, the female whom the large-hearted sage had created,\r\nrobbed Yavakri of his sacred water-pot. Then with his uplifted spear the\r\ndemon flew at Yavakri, when he had been deprived of his water-pot and\r\nrendered unclean. And seeing the demon approach with uplifted spear for\r\nthe purpose of slaying him, Yavakri rose up all on a sudden and fled\r\ntowards a tank. But finding it devoid of water, he hurried towards all\r\nthe rivers. But they too were all dried up. And being obstructed again\r\nand again by the fierce demon, holding the spear, Yavakri in fright\r\nattempted to enter into the Agnihotra room of his father. But there, O\r\nking, he was repulsed by a blind Sudra warder, and he remained at the\r\ndoor, grasped by the man. And, finding Yavakri thus grasped by the Sudra,\r\nthe demon hurled his spear at him, and thereupon he fell down dead,\r\npierced in the heart. After slaying Yavakri, the demon went back to\r\nRaivya, and with the permission of that sage, began to live with the\r\nfemale.\""

And because his son had been slain, the sacrificial\r\nfires which used to welcome him everyday, did not on that day come\r\nforward to welcome him. And marking this change in the Agnihotra, the\r\ngreat sage asked the blind Sudra warder seated there, saying, 'Why is it.\r\nO Sudra, that the fires rejoice not at sight of me? Thou too dost not\r\nrejoice as is thy wont. Is it all well with my hermitage? I hope that my\r\nson of little sense had not gone to the sage Raivya.

The Sudra\r\nsaid, 'Thy son of little sense had gone to the sage Raivya, and therefore\r\nit is that lie lieth prostrate (on the ground), having been slain by a\r\npowerful demon. Being attacked by the Rakshasa, holding a spear, he\r\nattempted to force his way into this room, and I therefore barred his way\r\nwith my arms. Then desirous of having water in an unclean state, as he\r\nstood hopeless, he was slain by the vehement Rakshasa, carrying a spear\r\nin his hand.'

Thy\r\nbehaviour towards the Brahmanas had always been for their good, and thou\r\nhadst also been innocent in regard to all creatures. But, alas! (at last)\r\nthou didst lapse into rudeness. I had prohibited thee, O my son, from\r\nvisiting the residence of Raivya; but alas! to that very hermitage,\r\n(destructive to thee) as the god of death himself, Yama, didst thou\r\nrepair. Evil-minded is that man, who, (knowing that I am an old man), and\r\nalso that (Yavakri) was my only son, had given way to wrath. It is\r\nthrough the agency of Raivya that I have sustained the loss of my child.\r\nWithout thee, O my son, I shall give up my life, the most precious thing\r\nin the world.

And the\r\ntwo sons of Raivya, Arvavasu and Paravasu, were engaged by that\r\nintelligent monarch, to assist him in the performance of the ceremony.\r\nAnd, O son of Kunti, taking the permission of their father, they two went\r\nto the sacrifice, while Raivya with Paravasu's wife remained in the\r\nhermitage. And it came to pass that one day, desirous of seeing his wife.\r\nParavasu returned home alone. And he met his father in the wood, wrapped\r\nin the skin of a black antelope. And the night was far advanced and dark;\r\nand Paravasu, blinded by drowsiness in that deep wood, mistook his father\r\nfor a straggling deer. And mistaking him for a deer, Paravasu, for the\r\nsake of personal safety, unintentionally killed his father. Then, O son\r\nof Bharata, after performing the funeral rites (of his father), he\r\nreturned to the sacrifice and there addressed his brother saying, 'Thou\r\nwilt never be able to perform this task unassisted. I again, have killed\r\nour father, mistaking him for a deer. O brother, for me do thou observe a\r\nvow, prescribed in the case of killing a Brahmana. O Muni, I shall be\r\nable to perform this work (sacrifice), without any assistant.' Arvavasu\r\nsaid, 'Do thou then thyself officiate at this sacrifice of the gifted\r\nVrihadyumna; and for thee will I, bringing my senses under perfect\r\ncontrol, observe the vow prescribed in the case of slaying a Brahmana.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Having observed the vow relative to the killing of a\r\nBrahmana, the sage Arvavasu came back to the sacrifice.

Even by a glance, the killer of a\r\nBrahmana can, without doubt, do thee harm.' O lord of men, immediately on\r\nhearing this, the king ordered his attendants (to turn out Arvavasu). O\r\nking, on being driven out by the king's attendants, and repeatedly\r\naddressed by them--'O slayer of  a Brahmana--Arvavasu more than once\r\ncried, 'It is not I that have killed a Brahmana. Not did he own that he\r\nhad observed the vow for his own sake. He said that his brother had\r\ncommitted the sin, and that he had freed him therefrom.' Having said this\r\nin anger, and being reprimanded by the attendants, the Brahmana sage of\r\naustere penances, retired in silence into the woods. There betaking\r\nhimself to the severest penances, the great Brahmana sought the\r\nprotection of the Sun. Thereupon, the revelation teaching the mantra\r\nrelative to the worship of the Sun, became manifest unto him and that\r\neternal deity who obtaineth his share (of the sacrificial butter) first,\r\nappeared before him in an embodied form.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'The celestials, O king, were well pleased with Arvavasu\r\nfor his acts.

Now wilt thou see the\r\nplay-ground of the gods, marked with their footprints, as we have passed\r\nthe mountain Kala. We shall now ascend that white rock--the mountain\r\nMandara, inhabited by the Yakshas, Manibhadra and Kuvera, king of the\r\nYakshas. O king, at this place eighty thousand fleet Gandharvas, and four\r\ntimes as many Kimpurushas and Yakshas of various shapes and forms,\r\nholding various weapons, attend upon Manibhadra, king of the Yakshas. In\r\nthese regions their power is very great. And in speed they are even as\r\nthe wind. They can, without doubt, displace even the lord of the\r\ncelestials from his seat.

O hero, I do not see\r\nDhananjaya at my side. I reside in the wood with my younger brothers,\r\nanxious for beholding him.

In\r\norder to see that hero, Dhananjaya, firm in promise, for these five years\r\nhave I been wandering in various tirthas, and beautiful forests and lakes\r\nand yet I do meet with him. For this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. I do\r\nnot see the long-armed Gudakesa, of dark blue hue, and leonine gait. For\r\nthis, O Vrikodara, I am miserable.

Distressed for I am I do not see that\r\nson of Pritha, Dhananjaya, born under the influence of the star Phalguni;\r\nranging amidst foes even like Yama at the time of the universal\r\ndissolution; possessed of the prowess of an elephant with the temporal\r\njuice trickling down; endued with leonine shoulders; not inferior to\r\nSakra himself in prowess and energy; elder in years to the twins; of\r\nwhite steeds; unrivalled in heroism; invincible; and wielding a strong\r\nbow. For this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. And he is always of a\r\nforgiving temper,--even when insulted by the meanest individual. And he\r\nconferreth benefit and protection to the righteous; but to that tortuous\r\nperson who by craft attempts to do him mischief, Dhananjaya is like unto\r\nvirulent poison, albeit that one were Sakra himself. And the mighty\r\nVibhatsu of immeasurable soul and possessing great strength, showeth\r\nmercy and extendeth protection even to a foe when fallen. And he is the\r\nrefuge of us all and he crusheth his foes in fight. And he hath the power\r\nto collect any treasure whatever, and he ministereth unto our happiness.\r\nIt was through his prowess that I had owned formerly measureless precious\r\njewels of various kinds which at present Syodhana hath usurped. It was by\r\nhis might, O hero, that I had possessed before that palatial amphitheatre\r\nembellished with all manner of jewels, and celebrated throughout the\r\nthree worlds. O Pandu's son, in prowess, Phalguni is like unto Vasudeva,\r\nand in fight he is invincible and unrivalled, even like unto Kartavirya.\r\nAlas! I see him not, O Bhima. In might, that conqueror of foes goeth in\r\nthe wake of the invincible and most powerful Sankarshana (Valarama) and\r\nVasudeva. In strength of arms, and spirit, he is like unto Purandara\r\nhimself. And in swiftness, he is even as the wind, and in grace, as the\r\nmoon, and in ire, he is the eternal Death himself. O mighty-armed one,\r\nwith the object of beholding that war-like tiger among men, shall we\r\nrepair to the Gandhamadana mountain, where lies the hermitage of Nara and\r\nNarayana at the site of the celebrated jujube tree, and which is\r\ninhabited by the Yakshas. We shall see that best of mountains. And,\r\npractising severe austerities only on foot we shall go to Kuvera's\r\nbeautiful lake guarded by Rakshasas. That place cannot be reached by\r\nvehicles, O Vrikodara. Neither can cruel or avaricious, or irascible\r\npeople attain to that spot, O Bharata's son. O Bhima, in order to see\r\nArjuna, thither shall we repair, in company, with Brahmanas of strict\r\nvows, girding on our swords, and wielding our bows. Those only that are\r\nimpure, meet with flies gad-flies, mosquitoes, tigers, lions, and\r\nreptiles, but the pure never come across them.

It is frequented and worshipped\r\nby high-souled Vaihayasas, Valakhilyas and Gandharvas of mighty souls.\r\nAccustomed to sing the Sama hymns, the sages, Marichi, Pulaha, Bhrigu and\r\nAngiras, chanted them at this spot. Here the lord of celestials\r\nperformeth with the Maruts his daily prayers. And the Sadhyas and the\r\nAswins attend on him. The sun, the moon and all the luminaries with the\r\nplanets resort to this river, alternately by day and by night. O highly\r\nfortunate monarch, that protector of the world; Mahadeva, having a bull\r\nfor his mark, received on his head the fall of the waters of this river,\r\nat the source of the Ganga. O children, approach this goddess of the six\r\nattributes and bow down before her with concentrated minds.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing the words of the high-souled Lomasa, the son of Pandu\r\nreverentially worshipped the river (Ganga), flowing through the\r\nfirmament. And after having adored her the pious sons of Pandu resumed\r\ntheir journey accompanied by the sages. And it came to pass that those\r\nbest of men beheld at a distance some white object of vast proportions,\r\neven like Meru and stretching on all sides. And knowing that Pandu's sons\r\nwere intent upon asking (him), Lomasa versed in speech said, 'Hear, O\r\nsons of Pandu! O best of men, what ye see before you, of vast proportions\r\nlike unto a mountain and beautiful as the Kailasa cliff, is a collection\r\nof the bones of the mighty Daitya Naraka, Being placed on a mountain, it\r\nlooketh like one. The Daitya was slain by that Supreme Soul, the eternal\r\nGod Vishnu, for the good of the lord of celestials. Aiming at the\r\npossession of Indra's place, by the force of austere and Vedic lore, that\r\nmighty-minded (demon) had practised austere penances for ten thousand\r\nyears. And on account of his asceticism, as also of the force and might\r\nof his arms he had grown invincible and always harassed (Indra). And O\r\nsinless one, knowing his strength and austerities and observance of\r\nreligious vows, Indra became agitated and was overwhelmed with fear. And\r\nmentally he thought of the eternal deity, Vishnu. And thereat the\r\ngraceful lord of the universe, who is present everywhere, appeared and\r\nstood before him manifest. And the sages and celestials began to\r\npropitiate Vishnu with prayers. And in his presence even Agni of the six\r\nattributes and of blazing beauty being overpowered by his effulgence,\r\nbecame shorn of radiance and seeing before him the God Vishnu, the chief\r\nof the celestials who wields the thunder-bolt, bowing with head down\r\nreadily apprised Vishnu of the source of his fear. Thereupon Vishnu said,\r\n'I know, O Sakra, that thy fear proceedeth from Naraka, that lord of the\r\nDaityas. By the merit of his successful ascetic acts he aimeth at Indra's\r\nposition. Therefore, for pleasing thee, I shall certainly sever his soul\r\nfrom his body, although he hath achieved success in asceticism. Do thou,\r\nlord of celestials, wait for a moment.' Then the exceedingly powerful\r\nVishnu deprived (Naraka) of his senses (by striking him) with his hand.\r\nAnd he fell down on the earth even like the monarch of mountains struck\r\nby (thunder). He was thus slain by a miracle and his bones lie gathered\r\nat this spot. Here also is manifest another deed of Vishnu's. Once the\r\nwhole earth having been lost and sunk into the nether regions she was\r\nlifted up by him in the shape of a boar having a single tusk.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O worshipful one, relate in particular how Vishnu,\r\nthe lord of the celestials, raised up the earth sunk a hundred yojanas?\r\nIn what manner also was that support of all created things--the goddess\r\nEarth of high fortune--who dispenseth blessings and bringeth forth all\r\nsorts of corn rendered stable? Through whose power had she sunk an\r\nhundred yojanas below, and under what circumstances was exhibited this\r\ngreatest exploit of the Supreme Being? O chief of the twice-born race, I\r\nwish to hear all about it in detail as it happened. Certainly, it is\r\nknown to thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'O Yudhishthira, listen to all at length as I relate the\r\nstory, which thou hast asked me (to narrate). O child, in days of yore,\r\nthere was (once) a terrible time in the Krita Yuga when the eternal and\r\nprimeval Deity assumed the duties of Yama. And, O thou that never fallest\r\noff, when the God of gods began to perform the functions of Yama, there\r\ndied not a creature while the births were as usual. Then there began to\r\nmultiply birds and beasts and kine, and sheep, and deer and all kinds of\r\ncarnivorous animals. O tiger among men and vanquisher of foes, then the\r\nhuman race also increased by thousands even like unto a current of water.\r\nAnd, O my son, when the increase of population had been so frightful, the\r\nEarth oppressed with the excessive burden, sank down for a hundred\r\nyojanas. And suffering pain in all her limbs, and being deprived of her\r\nsenses by excessive pressure, the earth in distress sought the protection\r\nof Narayana, the foremost of the gods. The earth spake saying, 'It is by\r\nthy favour, O possessor of the six attributes, that I had been able to\r\nremain so long in my position. But I have been overcome with burden and\r\nnow I cannot hold myself any longer. It behoveth thee, O adorable one, to\r\nrelieve this load of mine. I have sought thy protection. O lord; and do\r\nthou, therefore, extend unto me thy favour.' Hearing these words of hers,\r\nthe eternal lord, possessor of the six attributes, complaisantly said, in\r\nwords uttered in distinct letters. Vishnu said, 'Thou need not fear, O\r\nafflicted Earth, the bearer of all treasures. I shall act so that thou\r\nmayst be made light.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Having thus dismissed the Earth, who hath the mountains\r\nfor her ear-rings, he suddenly became turned into a boar with one tusk,\r\nand of exceeding effulgence. Causing terror with his glowing red eyes and\r\nemitting fumes from his blazing lustre, he began to swell in magnitude in\r\nthat region. O hero, then holding the earth with his single radiant tusk\r\nthat being who pervadeth the Vedas, raised her up a hundred yojanas. And\r\nwhile she was being thus raised, there ensued a mighty agitation and all\r\nthe celestials, together with the sages of ascetic wealth became\r\nagitated. And heaven, and the firmament, and also the Earth were filled\r\nwith exclamations of Oh! and Alas! and neither the celestials nor men\r\ncould rest in peace. Then countless celestials together with the sages\r\nwent to Brahma, who was seated burning as it were in his (own) lustre.\r\nThen approaching Brahma, the lord of celestials, and the witness of the\r\nacts of all beings, they with folded hands spake the following words, 'O\r\nlord of the celestials, all created beings have become agitated and the\r\nmobile and immobile creatures are restless. O lord of the celestials,\r\neven the oceans are found to be agitated and this whole earth hath gone\r\ndown a hundred yojanas. What is the matter? And by whose influence is it\r\nthat the whole universe is in ferment? May it please thee to explain it\r\nunto us without delay, for we are all bewildered.' Thereupon Brahma\r\nreplied, 'Ye immortals! do ye not entertain fear for the Asuras, in any\r\nmatter or place. Hearken, ye celestials, to the reason to which all this\r\ncommotion is owing! This agitation in the heavens hath been produced by\r\nthe influence of the illustrious Being who is omnipresent, eternal and\r\nthe never-perishing Soul. That Supreme soul, Vishnu hath lifted up the\r\nEarth, who had entirely sunk down hundred yojanas. This commotion hath\r\ntaken place in consequence of the earth being raised up. Know ye this and\r\ndispel your doubts.' The celestials said, 'Where is that Being who with\r\npleasure raiseth up the Earth? O possessor of the six attributes, mention\r\nunto us the place. Thither shall we repair.' Brahma said 'Go ye. May good\r\nhappen to you! Ye will find him resting in the Nandana (gardens). Yonder\r\nis visible the glorious worshipful Suparna (Garuda). After having raised\r\nthe Earth, the Supreme Being from whom the world become manifest, flameth\r\neven in the shape of a boar, like unto the all-consuming fire at the\r\nuniversal dissolution. And on his beast is really to be seen the gem\r\nSrivatsa. (Go) and behold that Being knowing no deterioration.'\r\n\r\n\"Lomasa said, 'Then the celestials, placing the grandsire at their head,\r\ncame to that infinite Soul, and having listened to his praise, bade him\r\nadieu and went back to whence they had come.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"O Janamejaya, having heard this story, all the\r\nPandavas without delay and with alacrity, began to proceed by the way\r\npointed out by Lomasa.\""

And, O lord of men, as those mighty heroes were entering the\r\nmountain Gandhamandana, there arose a violent wind, attended with a heavy\r\nshower. And owing to this, mighty clouds of dust bearing lots of dry\r\nleaves, rose, and all on a sudden covered earth, air and firmament. And\r\nwhen the heavens had been covered with dust nothing could be perceived,\r\nneither could they (the Pandavas) speak to one another. And with eyes\r\nenveloped with darkness and pushed by the wind carrying particles of\r\nrocks they could not see one another. And there began to arrive mighty\r\nsounds proceeding from the tree, and also from those breaking down\r\nincessantly under the force of the wind, and falling to the ground. And\r\ndistracted by gusts of the wind, they thought, 'Are the heavens falling\r\ndown; or the earth and the mountains being rent?' And afraid of the wind,\r\nthey felt about with their hands and took shelter under the way-side tree\r\nand ant-hills and in caverns. Then holding his bow and supporting Krishna\r\nthe mighty Bhimasena stood under a tree. And Yudhishthira the just with\r\nDhaumya crept into the deep wood. And Sahedeva carrying the sacred fire\r\nwith him took shelter in a rock. And Nakula together with Lomasa and\r\nother Brahmanas of great asceticism stood in fright, each under a tree.\r\nThen when the wind had abated and the dust subsided, there came down a\r\nshower in torrents. There also arose a loud rattling noise, like unto the\r\nthunder hurled; and quick-flashing lightning began to play gracefully\r\nupon the clouds. And being helped on by the swift wind, showers of rain\r\npoured down without intermissions, filling all sides round. And, O lord\r\nof men, all around there began to flow many rivers covered with foam and\r\nturbid with mud; and these bearing volumes of water spread over the\r\nfrothy rafts rushed down with tremendous roar uprooting trees. And\r\nafterwards when that sound had ceased and the air had arisen they (each\r\nof them) cautiously came out of their coverts and met together, O\r\ndescendant of Bharata.

And carried by the Rakshasas of great speed, proceeding at a\r\nrapid pace, the heroes passed over longextending ways quickly, as if over\r\nshort ones. And on their way they saw various tracts crowded with\r\nMlechchha people, and containing mines of diverse gems. And they also saw\r\nhillocks teeming with various minerals, thronged with Vidyadharas,\r\ninhabited on all sides by monkeys and Kinnaras and Kimpurushas, and\r\nGandharvas, and filled with peacocks, and chamaras, and apes, and rurus,\r\nand bears, and gavayas, and buffaloes, intersected with a network of\r\nrivulets, and inhabited by various birds and beasts, and beautified by\r\nelephants, and abounding in trees and enraptured birds. After having thus\r\npassed many countries, and also the Uttarakurus, they saw that foremost\r\nof mountains, the Kailasa, containing many wonders. And by the side of\r\nit, they beheld the hermitage of Nara and Narayana, with celestial trees\r\nbearing flowers and fruits in all seasons. And they also beheld that\r\nbeautiful jujube of round trunk. And it was fresh; and of deep shade; and\r\nof excellent beauty; and of thick, soft and sleek foliage; and healthful;\r\nand having gigantic boughs; and wide-spreading; and of incomparable\r\nlustre; and bearing full-grown, tasteful, and holy fruits dropping honey.\r\nAnd this celestial tree was frequented by hosts of mighty sages, and was\r\nalways inhabited by various birds maddened with animal spirits. And it\r\ngrew at a spot devoid of mosquitoes and gad-flies, and abounding in\r\nfruits and roots and water, and covered with green grass, and inhabited\r\nby the celestials and the Gandharvas, and of smooth surface, and\r\nnaturally healthful, and beauteous and cool and of delicate feel. Having\r\nreached that (tree) together with those bulls among Brahmanas, the\r\nhigh-souled ones gently alighted from the shoulders of the Rakshasas.\r\nThen in company with those bulls among the twice-born ones, the Pandavas\r\nbeheld that romantic asylum presided over by Nara and Narayana; devoid of\r\ngloom; and sacred; and untouched by the solar rays; and free from those\r\nrubs, viz. hunger, and thirst, heat and cold, and removing (all) sorrow;\r\nand crowded with hosts of mighty sages; and adorned with the grace\r\nproceeding from the Vedas, Saman, Rich, and Yajus; and, O king,\r\ninaccessible to men who have renounced religion; and beautified with\r\nofferings, and homas; and sacred; and well-swept and daubed; and shining\r\nall around with offerings of celestial blossoms; and spread over with\r\naltars of sacrificial fire, and sacred ladles and pots; and graced with\r\nlarge water-jars, and baskets and the refuge of all beings; and echoing\r\nwith the chanting of the Vedas; and heavenly: and worthy of being\r\ninhabited; and removing fatigue; and attended with splendour and of\r\nincomprehensible merit; and majestic with divine qualities. And the\r\nhermitage was inhabited by hosts of great sages, subsisting on fruits and\r\nroots; and having their senses under perfect control; and clad in black\r\ndeer-skins; and effulgent like unto the Sun and Agni; and of souls\r\nmagnified by asceticism and intent on emancipation; and leading the\r\nVanaprastha mode of life; and of subdued senses; and identified with the\r\nSupreme Soul; and of high fortune; and reciting Vaidic hymns. Then having\r\npurified himself and restrained his senses, that son of Dharma, the\r\nintelligent Yudhishthira of exceeding energy, accompanied by his\r\nbrothers, approached those sages. And all the great sages endued with\r\nsupernatural knowledge, knowing Yudhishthira arrived, received him\r\njoyfully.

And having obtained that\r\nexcellent and beautiful lotus, that blessed one became exceedingly\r\ndelighted, O king, and addressed Bhimasena in the following words,\r\n'Behold, O Bhima, this most beautiful unearthly flower having within it\r\nthe very source of fragrance. It gladdenth my heart, O represser of foes.\r\nThis one shall be presented to Yudhishthira the just.

Having said this, the blameless\r\nlady of beautiful glances approached Yudhishthira the just, taking the\r\nflower. And knowing the desire of his beloved queen that bull among men,\r\nBhima of great strength, also set out, in order to gratify her. And\r\nintent upon fetching the flowers, he began to proceed at rapid space,\r\nfacing the wind, in the direction from which the flower had come. And\r\ntaking the bow inlaid with gold on the back as also arrows like unto\r\nvenomous snakes, he proceeded as a lion in anger or an elephant in rut.\r\nAnd all beings gazed at him, holding a mighty bow and arrows. And neither\r\nexhaustion, nor langour, neither fear nor confusion, ever possessed the\r\nson of Pritha and the offspring of Vayu (wind). And desirous of pleasing\r\nDraupadi the mighty one, free from fear or confusion, ascended the peak\r\ndepending on the strength of his arms.

And like an elephant in rut ranging mad in a forest\r\nthat one of mighty prowess smelt the rare odour proceeding from the\r\nflowers of every season. And he was fanned by the fresh breeze of the\r\nGandhamadana bearing the perfumes of various blossoms and cooling like\r\nunto a father's touch. On his fatigue being removed the down on his body\r\nstood on end. And in this state that represser of foes for the flowers\r\nbegan to survey all the mountain, inhabited by Yakshas and Gandharvas and\r\ncelestials and Brahmarshis. And brushed by the leaves of Saptachchada\r\ntree, besmeared with fresh red, black and white minerals, he looked as if\r\ndecorated with lines of holy unguents drawn by fingers. And with clouds\r\nstretching at its sides, the mountain seemed dancing with outspread\r\nwings. And on account of the trickling waters of springs, it appeared to\r\nbe decked with necklaces of pearls. And it contained romantic caverns and\r\ngroves and cascades and caves. And there were excellent peacocks dancing\r\nto the jingling of the bangles of the Apsaras. And its rocky surface was\r\nworn away by the end of tusks of the elephants presiding over the\r\ncardinal points. And with the waters of rivers falling down, the mountain\r\nlooked as if its clothes were getting loosened. And that graceful son of\r\nthe wind-god playfully and cheerfully went on, pushing away by his force\r\ncountless intertwisted creepers. And stags in curiosity gazed at him,\r\nwith grass in their mouths. And not having experienced fear (ever\r\nbefore), they were unalarmed, and did not flee away. And being engaged in\r\nfulfilling the desire of his love, the youthful son of Pandu, stalwart\r\nand of splendour like unto the hue of gold; and having a body strong as a\r\nlion; and treading like a mad elephant; and possessing the force of a mad\r\nelephant; and having coppery eyes like unto those of a mad elephant; and\r\ncapable of checking a mad elephant began to range the romantic sides of\r\nthe Gandhamadana with his beautiful eyes uplifted; and displaying as it\r\nwere a novel type of beauty. And the wives of Yakshas and Gandharvas\r\nsitting invisible by the side of their husbands, stared at him, turning\r\ntheir faces with various motions. Intent upon gratifying Draupadi exiled\r\nunto the woods, as he was ranging the beautiful Gandhamadana, he\r\nremembered the many and various woes caused by Duryodhana. And he\r\nthought, 'Now that Arjuna sojourn in heaven and that I too have come away\r\nto procure the flowers, what will our brother Yudhishthira do at present?\r\nSurely, from affection and doubting their prowess, that foremost of men,\r\nYudhishthira, will not let Nakula and Sahadeva come in search of us. How,\r\nagain, can I obtain the flowers soon?' Thinking thus, that tiger among\r\nmen proceeded in amain like unto the king of birds, his mind and sight\r\nfixed on the delightful side of the mountain. And having for his\r\nprovisions on the journey the words of Draupadi, the mighty son of Pandu,\r\nVrikodara Bhima, endued with strength and the swiftness of the wind, with\r\nhis mind and sight fixed on the blooming slopes of the mountain,\r\nproceeded speedily, making the earth tremble with his tread, even as doth\r\na hurricane at the equinox; and frightening herds of elephants and\r\ngrinding lions and tigers and deer and uprooting and smashing large trees\r\nand tearing away by force plants and creepers, like unto an elephant\r\nascending higher and higher the summit of a mountain; and roaring\r\nfiercely even as a cloud attended with thunder. And awakened by that\r\nmighty roaring of Bhima, tigers came out of their dens, while other\r\nrangers of the forest hid themselves. And the coursers of the skies\r\nsprang up (on their wing) in fright. And herds of deer hurriedly ran\r\naway. And birds left the trees (and fled). And lions forsook their dens.\r\nAnd the mighty lions were roused from their slumber. And the buffaloes\r\nstared. And the elephants in fright, leaving that wood, ran to more\r\nextensive forests company with their mates. And the boars and the deer\r\nand the lions and the buffaloes and the tigers and the jackals and the\r\ngavayas of the wood began to cry in herds. And the ruddy geese, and the\r\ngallinules and the ducks and the karandavas and the plavas and the\r\nparrots and the male kokilas and the herons in confusion flew in all\r\ndirections, while some proud elephants urged by their mates, as also some\r\nlions and elephants in rage, flew at Bhimasena. And as they were\r\ndistracted at heart through fear, these fierce animals discharging urine\r\nand dung, set up loud yells with gapping mouths. Thereupon the\r\nillustrious and graceful son of the wind-god, the mighty Pandava,\r\ndepending upon the strength of his arms, began to slay one elephant with\r\nanother elephant and one lion with another lion while he despatched the\r\nothers with slaps. And on being struck by Bhima the lions and the tigers\r\nand the leopards, in fright gave loud cries and discharged urine and\r\ndung. And after having destroyed these the handsome son of Pandu,\r\npossessed of mighty strength, entered into the forest, making all sides\r\nresound with his shouts. And then the long-armed one saw on the slopes of\r\nthe Gandhamadana a beautiful plantain tree spreading over many a yojana.\r\nAnd like unto a mad lion, that one of great strength proceeded amain\r\ntowards that tree breaking down various plants. And that foremost of\r\nstrong persons--Bhima--uprooting innumerable plantain trunks equal in\r\nheight to many palm-trees (placed one above another), cast them on all\r\nsides with force. And that highly powerful one, haughty like a male lion,\r\nsent up shouts. And then he encountered countless beasts of gigantic\r\nsize, and stags, and monkeys, and lions, and buffaloes, and aquatic\r\nanimals. And what with the cries of these, and what with the shouts of\r\nBhima, even the beasts and birds that were at distant parts of the wood,\r\nbecame all frightened. And hearing those cries of beasts and birds,\r\nmyriads of aquatic fowls suddenly rose up on wetted wings. And seeing\r\nthese fowls of water, that bull among the Bharatas proceeded in that\r\ndirection; and saw a vast and romantic lake. And that fathomless lake\r\nwas, as it were, being fanned by the golden plantain trees on the coast,\r\nshaken by the soft breezes. And immediately descending into the lake\r\nabounding in lilies and lotuses, he began to sport lustily like unto a\r\nmighty maddened elephant. Having thus sported there for a long while, he\r\nof immeasurable effulgence ascended, in order to penetrate with speed\r\ninto that forest filled with trees. Then the Pandava winded with all his\r\nmight his loud-blowing shell. And striking his arms with his hands, the\r\nmighty Bhima made all the points of heaven resound. And filled with the\r\nsounds of the shell, and with the shouts of Bhimasena, and also with the\r\nreports produced by the striking of his arms, the caves of the mountain\r\nseemed as if they were roaring. And hearing those loud arm-strokes, like\r\nunto the crashing of thunder, the lions that were slumbering in the\r\ncaves, uttered mighty howls. And being terrified by the yelling of the\r\nlions, the elephants, O Bharata, sent forth tremendous roars, which\r\nfilled the mountain. And hearing those sounds emitted, and knowing also\r\nBhimasena to be his brother, the ape Hanuman, the chief of monkeys, with\r\nthe view of doing good to Bhima, obstructed the path leading to heaven.\r\nAnd thinking that he (Bhima) should not pass that way,(Hanuman) lay\r\nacross the narrow path, beautified by plantain trees, obstructing it for\r\nthe sake of the safety of Bhima. With the object that Bhima might not\r\ncome by curse or defeat, by entering into the plantain wood, the ape\r\nHanuman of huge body lay down amidst the plantain trees, being overcome\r\nwith drowsiness. And he began to yawn, lashing his long tail, raised like\r\nunto the pole consecrated to Indra, and sounding like thunder. And on all\r\nsides round, the mountains by the mouths of caves emitted those sounds in\r\necho, like a cow lowing. And as it was being shaken by the reports\r\nproduced by the lashing of the tail, the mountain with its summits\r\ntottering, began to crumble all around. And overcoming that roaring of\r\nmad elephants, the sounds of his tail spread over the varied slopes of\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\n\"On those sounds being heard the down of Bhima's body stood on end; and\r\nhe began to range that plantain wood, in search of those sounds. And that\r\none of mighty arms saw the monkey-chief in the plantain wood, on an\r\nelevated rocky base. And he was hard to be looked at even as the\r\nlightning-flash; and of coppery hue like that of the lightning-flash: and\r\nendued with the voice of the lightning-flash; and quick moving as the\r\nlightning-flash; and having his short flesh neck supported on his\r\nshoulders; and with his waist slender in consequence of the fullness of\r\nhis shoulders. And his tail covered with long hair, and a little bent at\r\nthe end, was raised like unto a banner. And (Bhima) saw Hanuman's head\r\nfurnished with small lips, and coppery face and tongue, and red ears, and\r\nbrisk eyes, and bare white incisors sharpened at the edge.' And his head\r\nwas like unto the shining moon; adorned with white teeth within the\r\nmouth; and with mane scattered over, resembling a heap of asoka flowers.\r\nAnd amidst the golden plantain trees, that one of exceeding effulgence\r\nwas lying like unto a blazing fire, with his radiant body. And that\r\nslayer of foes as casting glances with his eyes reddened with\r\nintoxication. And the intelligent Bhima saw that mighty chief of monkeys,\r\nof huge body, lying like unto the Himalaya, obstructing the path of\r\nheaven. And seeing him alone in that mighty forest, the undaunted\r\nathletic Bhima, of long arms, approached him with rapid strides, and\r\nuttered a loud shout like unto the thunder. And at that shout of Bhima,\r\nbeasts and birds became all alarmed. The powerful Hanuman, however,\r\nopening his eyes partially looked at him (Bhima) with disregard, with\r\neyes reddened with intoxication. And then smilingly addressing him,\r\nHanuman said the following words, 'Ill as I am, I was sleeping sweetly.\r\nWhy hast thou awakened me? Thou shouldst show kindness to all creatures,\r\nas thou hast reason. Belonging to the animal species, we are ignorant of\r\nvirtue. But being endued with reason, men show kindness towards\r\ncreatures. Why do then reasonable persons like thee commit themselves to\r\nacts contaminating alike body, speech, and heart, and destructive of\r\nvirtue? Thou knowest not what virtue is, neither hast thou taken council\r\nof the wise. And therefore it is that from ignorance, and childishness\r\nthou destroyest the lower animals. Say, who art thou, and what for hast\r\nthou come to the forest devoid of humanity and human beings? And, O\r\nforemost of men, tell thou also, whither thou wilt go to-day. Further it\r\nis impossible to proceed. Yonder hills are inaccessible. O hero, save the\r\npassage obtained by the practice of asceticism, there is no passage to\r\nthat place. This is the path of the celestials; it is ever impassable by\r\nmortals. Out of kindness, O hero, do I dissuade thee. Do thou hearken\r\nunto my words. Thou canst not proceed further from this place. Therefore,\r\nO lord, do thou desist. O chief of men, to-day in very way thou art\r\nwelcome to this place. If thou think it proper to accept my words, do\r\nthou then, O best of men, rest here, partaking of fruits and roots, sweet\r\nas ambrosia, and do not have thyself destroyed for naught.\""

And\r\nwhy also hast thou assumed the shape of a monkey? It is a Kshatriya--one\r\nof a race next to the Brahmanas--that asketh thee. And he belongeth to\r\nthe Kuru race and the lunar stock, and was borne by Kunti in her womb,\r\nand is one of the sons of Pandu, and is the off spring of the wind-god,\r\nand is known by the name of Bhimasena.' Hearing these words of the Kuru\r\nhero, Hanuman smiled, and that son of the wind-god (Hanuman) spake unto\r\nthat offspring of the wind-god (Bhimasena), saying, 'I am a monkey, I\r\nwill not allow thee the passage thou desirest. Better desist and go back.\r\nDo thou not meet with destruction.' At this Bhimasena replied.\r\n'Destruction at anything else do I not ask thee about, O monkey. Do thou\r\ngive me passage. Arise! Do not come by grief at my hands.' Hanuman said,\r\n'I have no strength to rise; I am suffering from illness. If go thou\r\nmust, do thou go by overleaping me.' Bhima said, 'The Supreme Soul void\r\nof the properties pervadeth a body all over. Him knowable alone by\r\nknowledge, I cannot disregard. And therefore, will I not overleap thee.\r\nIf I had not known Him from Whom become manifest all creatures, I would\r\nhave leapt over thee and also the mountain, even as Hanuman had bounded\r\nover the ocean.' Thereupon Hanuman said, 'Who is that Hanuman, who had\r\nbounded over the ocean? I ask thee, O best of men. Relate if thou canst.'\r\nBhima replied, \"He is even my brother, excellent with every perfection,\r\nand endued with intelligence and strength both of mind and body. And he\r\nis the illustrious chief of monkeys, renowned in the Ramayana. And for\r\nRama's queen, that king of the monkeys even with one leap crossed the\r\nocean extending over a hundred yojanas. That mighty one is my brother. I\r\nam equal unto him in energy, strength and prowess and also in fight. And\r\nable am I to punish thee. So arise. Either give me passage or witness my\r\nprowess to-day. If thou do not listen to my bidding, I shall send thee to\r\nthe abode of Yama.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued. \"Then knowing him (Bhima) to be intoxicated with\r\nstrength, and proud of the might of his arms, Hanuman, slighting him at\r\nheart, said the following words, 'Relent thou, O sinless one. In\r\nconsequence of age, I have no strength to get up. From pity for me, do\r\nthou go, moving aside my tail.' Being thus addressed by Hanuman, Bhima\r\nproud of the strength of his arms, took him for one wanting in energy and\r\nprowess, and thought within himself, 'Taking fast hold of the tail, will\r\nI send this monkey destitute of energy and prowess, to the region of\r\nYama.' Thereat, with a smile he slightingly took hold of the tail with\r\nhis left hand; but could not move that tail of the mighty monkey. Then\r\nwith both arms he pulled it, resembling the pole reared in honour of\r\nIndra. Still the mighty Bhima could not raise the tail with both his\r\narms. And his eye-brows were contracted up, and his eyes rolled, and his\r\nface was contracted into wrinkles and his body was covered with sweat;\r\nand yet he could not raise it. And when after having striven, the\r\nillustrious Bhima failed in raising the tail, he approached the side of\r\nthe monkey, and stood with a bashful countenance. And bowing down,\r\nKunti's son, with joined hands, spake these words, 'Relent thou, O\r\nforemost of monkeys; and forgive me for my harsh words. Art thou a\r\nSiddha, or a god, or a Gandharva, or a Guhyaka? I ask thee out of\r\ncuriosity. Tell me who thou art that hast assumed the shape of monkey, if\r\nit be not a secret, O long-armed one, and if I can well hear it. I ask\r\nthee as a disciple, and I, O sinless one, seek thy refuge.' Thereupon\r\nHanuman said, 'O represser of foes, even to the extent of thy curiosity\r\nto know me, shall I relate all at length. Listen, O son of Pandu! O\r\nlotus-eyed one, I was begotten by the wind-god that life of the\r\nworld--upon the wife of Kesari. I am a monkey, by name Hanuman. All the\r\nmighty monkey-kings, and monkey-chiefs used to wait upon that son of the\r\nsun, Sugriva, and that son of Sakra, Vali. And, O represser of foes, a\r\nfriendship subsisted between me and Sugriva, even as between the wind and\r\nfire. And for some cause, Sugriva, driven out by his brother, for a long\r\ntime dwelt with me at the Hrisyamukh. And it came to pass that the mighty\r\nson of Dasaratha the heroic Rama, who is Vishnu's self in the shape of a\r\nhuman being, took his birth in this world. And in company with his queen\r\nand brother, taking his bow, that foremost of bowmen with the view of\r\ncompassing his father's welfare, began to reside in the Dandaka forest.\r\nAnd from Janasthana, that mighty Rakshasa monarch, the wicked Ravana,\r\ncarried away his (Rama's) queen by stratagem and force, deceiving, O\r\nsinless one, that foremost of men, through the agency of a Rakshasa,\r\nMaricha, who assumed the form of a deer marked with gem-like and golden\r\nspots.\""

Then a friendship\r\nwas contracted between him and the high-souled Raghava. And the latter,\r\nhaving slain Vali installed Sugriva in the kingdom. And having obtained\r\nthe kingdom, Sugriva sent forth monkeys by hundreds and by thousands in\r\nsearch of Sita. And, O best of men, I too with innumerable monkeys set\r\nout towards the south in quest of Sita, O mighty-armed one. Then a mighty\r\nvulture Sampati by name, communicated the tidings that Sita was in the\r\nabode of Ravana. Thereupon with the object of securing success unto Rama,\r\nI all of a sudden bounded over the main, extending for a hundred yojanas.\r\nAnd, O chief of the Bharatas, having by my own prowess crossed the ocean,\r\nthat abode of sharks and crocodiles, I saw in Ravana's residence, the\r\ndaughter of king Janaka, Sita, like unto the daughter of a celestial. And\r\nhaving interviewed that lady, Vaidehi, Rama's beloved, and burnt the\r\nwhole of Lanka with its towers and ramparts and gates, and proclaimed my\r\nname there, I returned. Hearing everything from me the lotus-eyed Rama at\r\nonce ascertained his course of action, and having for the passage of his\r\narmy constructed a bridge across the deep, crossed it followed by myriads\r\nof monkeys. Then by prowess Rama slew those Rakshasas in battle, and also\r\nRavana, the oppressor of the worlds together with his Rakshasa followers.\r\nAnd having slain the king of the Rakshasas, with his brother, and sons\r\nand kindred, he installed in the kingdom in Lanka the Rakshasa chief,\r\nVibhishana, pious, and reverent, and kind to devoted dependants. Then\r\nRama recovered his wife even like the lost Vaidic revelation. Then\r\nRaghu's son, Rama, with his devoted wife, returned to his own city,\r\nAyodhya, inaccessible to enemies; and that lord of men began to dwell\r\nthere. Then that foremost of kings, Rama was established in the kingdom.\r\nThereafter, I asked a boon of the lotus-eyed Rama, saying, 'O slayer of\r\nfoes, Rama, may I live as long as the history of thy deeds remaineth\r\nextant on earth!\" Thereupon he said, 'So be it. O represser of foes, O\r\nBhima, through the grace of Sita also, here all excellent objects of\r\nentertainment are supplied to me, whoever abide at this place. Rama\r\nreigned for the thousand and ten hundred years. Then he ascended to his\r\nown abode. Ever since, here Apsaras and Gandharvas delight me, singing\r\nfor aye the deeds of that hero, O sinless one. O son of the Kurus, this\r\npath is impassable to mortals. For this, O Bharata, as also with the view\r\nthat none might defeat or curse thee, have I obstructed thy passage to\r\nthis path trod by the immortals. This is one of the paths to heaven, for\r\nthe celestials; mortals cannot pass this way. But the lake in search of\r\nwhich thou hast come, lieth even in that direction.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, the powerful Bhimasena of mighty\r\narms, affectionately, and with a cheerful heart, bowed unto his brother,\r\nHanuman, the monkey-chief, and said in mild words, 'None is more\r\nfortunate than I am; now have I seen my elder brother. It is a great\r\nfavour shown unto me; and I have been well pleased with thee. Now I wish\r\nthat thou mayst fulfil this desire of mine. I desire to behold. O hero,\r\nthat incomparable form of thine, which thou at that time hadst had, in\r\nbounding over the main, that abode of sharks and crocodiles. Thereby I\r\nshall be satisfied, and also believe in thy words.' Thus addressed, that\r\nmighty monkey said with a smile, 'That form of mine neither thou, not any\r\none else can behold. At that age, the state of things was different, and\r\ndoth not exist at present. In the Krita age, the state of things was one;\r\nand in the Treta, another; and in the Dwapara, still another. Diminution\r\nis going on this age; and I have not that form now. The ground, rivers,\r\nplants, and rocks, and siddhas, gods, and celestial sages conform to\r\nTime, in harmony with the state of things in the different yugas.\r\nTherefore, do not desire to see my former shape, O perpetuator of the\r\nKuru race. I am conforming to the tendency of the age. Verily, Time is\r\nirresistible' Bhimasena said, 'Tell me of the duration of the different\r\nyugas, and of the different manners and customs and of virtue, pleasure\r\nand profit, and of acts, and energy, and of life and death in the\r\ndifferent yugas.' Thereupon Hanuman said, 'O child, that yuga is called\r\nKrita when the one eternal religion was extant. And in that best of\r\nyugas, every one had religious perfection, and, therefore, there was no\r\nneed of religious acts. And then virtue knew no deterioration; nor did\r\npeople decrease. It is for this that this age is called Krita (perfect).\r\nBut in time the yuga had come to be considered as an inferior one. And, O\r\nchild, in the Krita age, there were neither gods, nor demons, nor\r\nGandharvas, nor Yakshas, nor Rakshasas, nor Nagas. And there was no\r\nbuying and selling. And the Sama, the Rich, and the Yajus did not exist.\r\nAnd there was no manual labour. And then the necessaries of life were\r\nobtained only by being thought of. And the only merit was in renouncing\r\nthe world. And during that yuga, there was neither disease, nor decay of\r\nthe senses. And there was neither malice, nor pride, nor hypocrisy, nor\r\ndiscord, nor ill-will, nor cunning, nor fear, nor misery, nor envy, nor\r\ncovetousness. And for this, that prime refuge of Yogis, even the Supreme\r\nBrahma, was attainable to all. And Narayana wearing a white hue was the\r\nsoul of all creatures. And in the Krita Yuga, the distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras were\r\nnatural and these ever stuck to their respective duties. And then Brahma\r\nwas the sole refuge, and their manners and customs were naturally adapted\r\nto the attainment of Brahma and the objects of their knowledge was the\r\nsole Brahma, and all their acts also had reference to Brahma. In this way\r\nall the orders attained merit. And one uniform Soul was the object of\r\ntheir meditation; and there was only one mantra (the Om), and there was\r\none ordinance. And although of different characteristics, all of them\r\nfollowed a single Veda; and they had one religion. And according to the\r\ndivisions of time, they led the four modes of life, without aiming at any\r\nobject, and so they attained emancipation. The religion consisting in the\r\nidentification of self with Brahma indicates the Krita Yuga. And in the\r\nKrita Yuga, the virtue of the four orders is throughout entire in\r\nfour-fold measure. Such is the Krita Yuga devoid of the three qualities.\r\nDo thou also hear from me of the character of the Treta Yuga. In this\r\nage, sacrifices are introduced, and virtue decreaseth by a quarter. And\r\nNarayana (who is the Soul of all creatures) assumeth a red colour. And\r\nmen practise truth, and devote themselves to religion and religious\r\nrites. And thence sacrifices and various religious observances come into\r\nexistence. And in the Treta Yuga people begin to devise means for the\r\nattainment of an object; and they attain it through acts and gifts. And\r\nthey never deviate from virtue. And they are devoted to asceticism and to\r\nthe bestowal of gifts. And the four orders adhere to their respective\r\nduties; and perform rites. Such are the men of the Treta Yuga. In the\r\nDwapara Yuga, religion decreaseth by one half. And Narayana weareth a\r\nyellow hue. And the Veda becometh divided into four parts. And then some\r\nmen retain (the knowledge of) the four Vedas, and some of three Vedas,\r\nand some of one Veda, while others do not know even the Richs. And on the\r\nShastras becoming thus divided, acts become multiplied. And largely\r\ninfluenced by passion, people engage in asceticism and gifts. And from\r\ntheir incapacity to study the entire Veda, it becomes divided into\r\nseveral parts. And in consequence of intellect having decreased, few are\r\nestablished in truth. And when people fall off from truth, they become\r\nsubject to various diseases; and then lust, and natural calamities ensue.\r\nAnd afflicted with these, people betake themselves to penances. And some\r\ncelebrate sacrifices, desiring to enjoy the good things of life, or\r\nattain heaven. On the coming of the Dwapara Yuga, men become degenerate,\r\nin consequence of impiety. O son of Kunti, in the Kali Yuga a quarter\r\nonly of virtue abideth. And in the beginning of this iron age, Narayana\r\nweareth a black hue. And the Vedas and the institutes, and virtue, and\r\nsacrifices, and religious observances, fall into disuse. And (then) reign\r\niti[41], and disease, and lassitude, and anger and other deformities, and\r\nnatural calamities, and anguish, and fear of scarcity. And as the yugas\r\nwane, virtue dwindles. And as virtue dwindles away, creatures degenerate.\r\nAnd as creatures degenerate, their natures undergo deterioration. And the\r\nreligious acts performed at the waning of the yugas, produce contrary\r\neffects. And even those that live for several yugas, conform to these\r\nchanges. O represser of foes, as regards thy curiosity to know me, I say\r\nthis,--Why should a wise person be eager to know a superfluous matter?\r\n(Thus), O long-armed one, have I narrated in full what thou hadst asked\r\nme regarding the characteristics of the different yugas. Good happen to\r\nthee! Do thou return.'\""

Depending on the strength of\r\nthy arms, thou wert capable of instantly destroying Lanka, with its\r\nwarriors, and horses, elephants and chariots. Surely, O son of the\r\nwind-god, there is nothing that is incapable of being achieved by thee;\r\nand in fight, Ravana together with his followers was no match for thee\r\nsingle-handed.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Bhima, Hanuman, the chief of\r\nmonkeys, answered in affectionate words uttered in solemn accents. \"O\r\nmighty-armed one, O Bharata, it is even as thou sayest. O Bhimasena, that\r\nworst of Rakshasas was no match for me. But if I had slain Ravana--that\r\nthorn of the worlds--the glory of Raghu's son would have been\r\nobscured;--and for this it is that I left him alone. By slaying that lord\r\nof the Rakshasas together with his followers, and bringing back Sita unto\r\nhis own city, that hero hath established his fame among men. Now, O\r\nhighly wise one, being intent on the welfare of thy brothers, and\r\nprotected by the wind-god, do thou go along a fortunate and auspicious\r\nway. O foremost of the Kurus, this way will lead thee to the Saugandhika\r\nwood. (Proceeding in this direction), thou wilt behold the gardens of\r\nKuvera, guarded by Yakshas and Rakshasas. Do thou not pluck the flowers\r\n(there) personally by thy own force; for the gods deserve regard\r\nspecially from mortals. O best of the Bharata race, the gods confer their\r\nfavour (upon men), (being propitiated) by offerings, and homas, and\r\nreverential salutations, and recitation of mantras, and veneration, O\r\nBharata. Do thou not, therefore, act with rashness, O child; and do thou\r\nnot deviate from the duties of thy order. Sticking to the duties of thy\r\norder, do thou understand and follow the highest morality. Without\r\nknowing duties and serving the old, even persons like unto Vrihaspati\r\ncannot understand profit and religion. One should ascertain with\r\ndiscrimination those cases in which vice goeth under the name of virtue,\r\nand virtue goeth under the name of vice,--(cases) in which people\r\ndestitute of intelligence become perplexed. From religious observances\r\nproceedeth merit; and in merit are established the Vedas; and from the\r\nVedas sacrifices come into existence; and by sacrifices are established\r\nthe gods. The gods are maintained by the (celebration of) sacrifices\r\nprescribed by the Vedas and the religious ordinances; while men maintain\r\nthemselves by (following) the ordinances of Vrihaspati and Usanas and\r\nalso by these avocations, by which the world is maintained,--serving for\r\nwages, (receiving) taxes, merchandise, agriculture and tending kine and\r\nsheep. The world subsisteth by profession. The (study of the) three Vedas\r\nand agriculture and trade and government constitutes, it is ordained by\r\nthe wise, the professions of the twice born ones; and each order\r\nmaintaineth itself by following the profession prescribed for it. And\r\nwhen these callings are properly pursued, the world is maintained with\r\nease. If, however, people do not righteously lead their lives, the world\r\nbecometh lawless, in consequence of the want of Vedic merit and\r\ngovernment. And if people do not resort to (their) prescribed vocations,\r\nthey perish, but by regularly following the three professions, they bring\r\nabout religion. The religion of the Brahmanas consisteth in the knowledge\r\nof the soul and the hue of that order alone is universally the same. The\r\ncelebration of sacrifices, and study and bestowal of gifts are well-known\r\nto be the three duties common (to all these orders). Officiating at\r\nsacrifices, teaching and the acceptance of gifts are the duties of a\r\nBrahmana. To rule (the subjects) is the duty of the Kshatriya; and to\r\ntend (cattle), that of the Vaisya, while to serve the twice-born orders\r\nis said to be the duty of the Sudra. The Sudras cannot beg alms, or\r\nperform homas, or observe vows; and they must dwell in the habitation of\r\ntheir masters. Thy vocation, O son of Kunti, is that of the Kshatriya,\r\nwhich is to protect (the subjects). Do thou carry out thy own duties, in\r\nan humble spirit, restraining thy senses. That king alone can govern, who\r\ntaketh counsel of experienced men, and is helped by honest, intelligent\r\nand learned ministers; but a king who is addicted to vices, meeteth with\r\ndefeat. Then only is the order of the world secured, when the king duly\r\npunisheth and conferreth favours. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain\r\nthrough spies the nature of the hostile country, its fortified places and\r\nthe allied force of the enemy and their prosperity and decay and the way\r\nin which they retain the adhesion of the powers they have drawn to their\r\nside. Spies are among the important auxiliaries of the king; and tact,\r\ndiplomacy, prowess, chastisement, favour and cleverness lead to success.\r\nAnd success is to be attained through these, either in separation, or\r\ncombined--namely, conciliation, gift, sowing dissensions, chastisement,\r\nand sight. And, O chief of the Bharatas, polity hath for its root\r\ndiplomacy; and diplomacy also is the main qualification of spies. And\r\npolity, if well judged conferreth success. Therefore, in matters of\r\npolity the counsels of Brahmanas should be resorted to. And in secret\r\naffairs, these should not be consulted,--namely, a woman, a sot, a boy, a\r\ncovetous person a mean-minded individual, and he that betrayeth signs of\r\ninsanity. Wise men only should be consulted, and affairs are to be\r\ndespatched through officers that are able. And polity must be executed\r\nthrough persons that are friendly; but dunces should in all affairs be\r\nexcluded. In matters religious, pious men; and in matters of gain, wise\r\nmen; and in guarding families, eunuchs; and in all crooked affairs,\r\ncrooked men, must be employed. And the propriety or impropriety of the\r\nresolution of the enemy, as also their strength or weakness, must be\r\nascertained through one's own as well as hostile spies. Favour should be\r\nshown to honest persons that have prudently sought protection; but\r\nlawless and disobedient individuals should be punished. And when the king\r\njustly punisheth and showeth favour, the dignity of the law is well\r\nmaintained, O son of Pritha, thus have I expounded, unto thee the hard\r\nduties of kings difficult to comprehend. Do thou with equanimity observe\r\nthese as prescribed for thy order. The Brahmanas attain heaven through\r\nmerit, mortification of the senses, and sacrifice. The Vaisyas attain\r\nexcellent state through gifts, hospitality, and religious acts. The\r\nKshatriyas attain the celestial regions by protecting and chastising the\r\nsubjects, uninfluenced by lust, malice, avarice and anger. If kings\r\njustly punish (their subjects), they go to the place whither repair\r\nmeritorious persons.'"

And this\r\nunearthly lake was filled with golden lotuses, and swarmed with diverse\r\nspecies of birds. And its banks were beautiful and devoid of mud. And\r\nsituated on the rocky elevation this expanse of excellent water was\r\nexceedingly fair. And it was the wonder of the world and healthful and of\r\nromantic sight. In that lake the son of Kunti saw, the water of ambrosial\r\ntaste and cool and light and clear and fresh; and the Pandava drank of it\r\nprofusely. And that unearthly receptacle of waters was covered with\r\ncelestial Saugandhika lotuses, and was also spread over with beautiful\r\nvariegated golden lotuses of excellent fragrance having graceful stalks\r\nof lapis lazulis. And swayed by swans and Karandavas, these lotuses were\r\nscattering fresh farina. And this lake was the sporting region of the\r\nhigh-souled Kuvera, the king of the Yakshas. And it was held in high\r\nregard by the Gandharvas the Apsaras and the celestials. And it was\r\nfrequented by the celestial sages and the Yakshas and the Kimpurushas and\r\nthe Rakshasas and the Kinnaras; and it was well-protected by Kuvera. And\r\nas soon as he beheld that river and that unearthly lake, Kunti's son,\r\nBhimasena of mighty strength became exceedingly delighted. And agreeably\r\nto the mandate of their king, hundreds and thousands of Rakshasas, named\r\nKrodhavasas, were guarding that lake, wearing uniforms and armed with\r\nvarious weapons. And as that repressor of foes, Kunti's son, the heroic\r\nBhima of dreadful prowess, clad in deer-skins and wearing golden armlets\r\nand equipped with weapons and girding his sword on, was fearlessly\r\nproceeding, with the view of gathering the lotus, those (Rakshasas) saw\r\nhim and immediately began to address each other, shouting forth, 'It\r\nbehoveth you to enquire for the errand on which this foremost of men,\r\nclad in deer skins, and equipped with arms, hath come.' Then they all\r\napproached the effulgent Vrikodara of mighty arms and asked, 'Who art\r\nthou? Thou shouldst answer our questions.

We shall cook\r\nBhimasena, and eat him up!' Thereupon that one of great force, taking his\r\nponderous and mighty mace inlaid with golden plates, like unto the mace\r\nof Yama himself, turned towards those, and then said, 'Stay!' At this,\r\nthey darted at him with vehemence, brandishing lances, and axes, and\r\nother weapons. And wishing to destroy Bhima, the dreadful and fierce\r\nKrodhavasas surrounded Bhima on all sides. But that one, being endued\r\nwith strength, had been begotten by Vayu in the womb of Kunti; and he was\r\nheroic and energetic, and the slayer of foes, and ever devoted to virtue\r\nand truth, and incapable of being vanquished by enemies through prowess.\r\nAccordingly this high-souled Bhima defeating all the manoeuveres of the\r\nfoes, and breaking their arms, killed on the banks of the lake more than\r\na hundred, commencing with the foremost.

Hearing their\r\nwords, the god (Kuvera) smiled and then said, 'Let Bhima take for Krishna\r\nas many lotuses as he likes. This is already known to me.'

And frightful\r\nmeteors began to shoot, with thundering sounds. And being enveloped by\r\ndarkness, the sun became pale, his rays being obscured.

And the\r\npoints of the heavens became reddened. And beasts and birds began to cry\r\nin shrill tones. And every thing became enveloped in darkness; and\r\nnothing could be distinguished. And other evil omens besides these\r\nappeared there. Witnessing these strange phenomena, Dharma's son\r\nYudhishthira, the foremost of speakers, said, 'Who is it that will\r\novercome us?

      "content": "Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus dwelling with the Brahmanas in that best of\r\nmountains, in expectation of Arjuna's return, when the Pandavas had grown\r\nconfident and when all those Rakshasas together with Bhima's son had\r\ndeparted, one day while Bhimasena was away, a Rakshasa all of a sudden\r\ncarried off Yudhishthira the just and the twins and Krishna. That\r\nRakshasa (in the guise of a Brahmana) had constantly remained in the\r\ncompany of the Pandavas, alleging that he was a high-class Brahmana,\r\nskilled in counsel, and versed in all the Sastras. His object was to\r\npossess himself of the bows, the quivers and the other material\r\nimplements belonging to the Pandavas; and he had been watching for an\r\nopportunity of ravishing Draupadi. And that wicked and sinful one was\r\nnamed Jatasura. And, O king of kings, Pandu's son (Yudhishthira) had been\r\nsupporting him, but knew not that wretch like unto a fire covered with\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n\"And once on a day while that represser of foes, Bhimasena, was out a\r\nhunting, he (the Rakshasa), seeing Ghatotkacha and his followers scatter\r\nin different directions and seeing those vow-observing great rishis, of\r\nascetic wealth, viz.; Lomasa and the rest, away for bathing and\r\ncollecting flowers, assumed a different form, gigantic and monstrous and\r\nfrightful; and having secured all the arms (of the Pandavas) as also\r\nDraupadi, that wicked one fled away taking the three Pandavas. Thereupon\r\nthat son of Pandu, Sahadeva, extricated himself with exertion, and by\r\nforce snatched the sword named Kausika from the grasp of the enemy and\r\nbegan to call Bhimasena, taking the direction in which that mighty one\r\nhad gone. And on being carried off Yudhishthira the just, addressed him\r\n(that Rakshasa), saying, 'O stupid one, thy merit decreaseth (even by\r\nthis act of thine). Dost thou not pay heed unto the established order of\r\nnature? Whether belonging to the human race, or to the lower orders, all\r\npay regard to virtue,--more specially the Rakshasas. In the first\r\ninstance, they knew virtue better than others. Having considered all\r\nthese, thou ought to adhere to virtue. O Rakshasa, the gods, the pitris,\r\nthe Siddhas, the rishis, the Gandharvas, the brutes and even the worms\r\nand ants depend for their lives on men; and thou too liveth through that\r\nagency. If prosperity attendeth the human race, thy race also prospereth;\r\nand if calamities befall the former, even the celestials suffer grief.\r\nBeing gratified by offerings, do the gods thrive. O Rakshasa, we are the\r\nguardians, governors and preceptors of kingdoms. If kingdoms become\r\nunprotected, whence can proceed prosperity and happiness? Unless there be\r\noffence, a Rakshasa should not violate a king. O man-eating one, we have\r\ncommitted no wrong, ever so little. Living on vighasa, we serve the gods\r\nand others to the best of our power. And we are never intent upon bowing\r\ndown to our superiors and Brahmanas. A friend, and one confiding, and he\r\nwhose food hath been partaken of, and he that hath afforded shelter,\r\nshould never be injured. Thou hast lived in our place happily, being duly\r\nhonoured. And, O evil-minded one, having partaken of our food, how canst\r\nthou carry us off? And as thy acts are so improper and as thou hast grown\r\nin age without deriving any benefit and as thy propensities are evil, so\r\nthou deservest to die for nothing, and for nothing wilt thou die to-day.\r\nAnd if thou beest really evil-disposed and devoid of all virtue, do thou\r\nrender us back our weapons and ravish Draupadi after fight. But if\r\nthrough stupidity thou must do this deed, then in the world thou wilt\r\nonly reap demerit and infamy O Rakshasa, by doing violence to this female\r\nof the human race, thou hast drunk poison, after having shaken the\r\nvessel.' Thereupon, Yudhishthira made himself ponderous to the Rakshasa.\r\nAnd being oppressed with the weight, he could not proceed rapidly as\r\nbefore. Then addressing Draupadi, Nakula and Sahadeva, Yudhishthira said,\r\n'Do ye not entertain any fear of this wretched Rakshasa, I have checked\r\nhis speed. The mighty-armed son of the Wind-god may not be far away; and\r\non Bhima coming up at the next moment, the Rakshasa will not live.' O\r\nking, staring at the Rakshasa bereft of sense, Sahadeva addressed\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, saying, 'What can be more meritorious for\r\na Kshatriya than to fall in fight, or defeat a foe? O repressor of foes,\r\nwe will fight and either this one will slay us, or we shall slay him, O\r\nmighty-armed one. Verily this is the place and time. O king. And, O thou\r\nof unfailing prowess, the time hath come for the display of our Kshatriya\r\nvirtue. It behoveth us to attain heaven either by gaining victory or\r\nbeing slain. If the sun sets to-day, the Rakshasa living yet, O Bharata,\r\nI will not any more say that I am a Kshatriya. Ho! Ho! Rakshasa. say! I\r\nam Pandu's son, Sahadeva. Either, after having killed me, carry off this\r\nlady, or being slain, lie senseless here.'\r\n\r\n\"Madri's son, Sahadeva, was speaking thus, when Bhimasena made his\r\nappearance, with a mace in his hand, like unto Vasava himself wielding\r\nthe thunder-bolt. And here he saw his two brothers and the noble-minded\r\nDraupadi (on the shoulders of the demon), and Sahadeva on the ground\r\nrebuking the Rakshasa and also that stupid Rakshasa himself deprived of\r\nsense by Fate, going round in different directions through bewilderment\r\ncaused by Destiny. And finding his brothers and Draupadi being carried\r\noff, Bhima of mighty strength was fired with wrath, and addressed the\r\nRakshasa, saying, 'I had ere this found thee out for a wicked wight from\r\nthy scrutiny of our weapons; but as I had no apprehension of thee, so I\r\nhad not slain thee at that time. Thou wert in the disguise of a\r\nBrahmana--nor didst thou say anything harsh unto us. And thou didst take\r\ndelight in pleasing us. And thou also didst not do us wrong. And,\r\nfurthermore, thou wert our guest. How could I, therefore, slay thee, who\r\nwert thus innocent of offence, and who wert in the disguise of a\r\nBrahmana? He that knowing such a one to be even a Rakshasa, slayeth him,\r\ngoes to hell. Further, thou canst not be killed before the time cometh.\r\nSurely to-day thou hast reached the fullness of thy time in as much as\r\nthy mind hath been thus turned by the wonder-performing Fate towards\r\ncarrying off Krishna. By committing thyself to this deed, thou hast\r\nswallowed up the hook fastened to the line of Fate. So like unto a fish\r\nin water, whose mouth hath been hooked, how canst thou live to-day? Thou\r\nshall not have to go whither thou intendest to, or whither thou hadst\r\nalready gone mentally; but thou shall go whither have repaired Vaka and\r\nHidimva.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed by Bhima, the Rakshasa in alarm put them down; and being\r\nforced by Fate, approached for fight. And with his lips trembling in\r\nanger he spake unto Bhima, saying, 'Wretch! I have not been bewildered; I\r\nhad been delaying for thee. To day will I offer oblations of thy blood to\r\nthose Rakshasas who, I had heard, have been slain by thee in fight' Thus\r\naddressed, Bhima, as if bursting with wrath, like unto Yama himself at\r\nthe time of the universal dissolution, rushed towards the Rakshasa,\r\nlicking the corners of his mouth and staring at him as he struck his own\r\narms with the hands. And seeing Bhima waiting in expectation of fight,\r\nthe Rakshasa also darted towards him in anger, like unto Vali towards the\r\nwielder of the thunderbolt, repeatedly gaping and licking the corners of\r\nhis mouth. And when a dreadful wrestling ensued between those two, both\r\nthe sons of Madri, waxing exceeding wroth rushed forward; but Kunti's\r\nson, Vrikodara, forbade them with a smile and said, 'Witness ye! I am\r\nmore than a match for this Rakshasa. By my own self and by my brothers,\r\nand by my merit, and by my good deeds, and by my sacrifices, do I swear\r\nthat I shall slay this Rakshasa.' And after this was said, those two\r\nheroes, the Rakshasa and Vrikodara challenging each other, caught each\r\nother by the arms. And they not forgiving each other, then there ensued a\r\nconflict between the infuriated Bhima and the Rakshasa, like unto that\r\nbetween a god and a demon. And repeatedly uprooting trees, those two of\r\nmighty strength struck each other, shouting and roaring like two masses\r\nof clouds. And those foremost of athletes, each wishing to kill the\r\nother, and rushing at the other with vehemence, broke down many a\r\ngigantic tree by their thighs. Thus that encounter with trees,\r\ndestructive of plants, went on like unto that between the two brothers\r\nVali and Sugriva--desirous of the possession of a single woman.\r\nBrandishing trees for a moment, they struck each other with them,\r\nshouting incessantly. And when all the trees of the spot had been pulled\r\ndown and crushed into fibres by them endeavouring to kill each other,\r\nthen, O Bharata, those two of mighty strength, taking up rocks, began to\r\nfight for a while, like unto a mountain and a mighty mass of clouds. And\r\nnot suffering each other, they fell to striking each other with hard and\r\nlarge crags, resembling vehement thunder-bolts. Then from strength\r\ndefying each other, they again darted at each other, and grasping each\r\nother by their arms, began to wrestle like unto two elephants. And next\r\nthey dealt each other fierce blows. And then those two mighty ones began\r\nto make chattering sounds by gnashing their teeth. And at length, having\r\nclenched his fist like a five-headed snake, Bhima with force dealt a blow\r\non the neck of the Rakshasa. And when struck by that fist of Bhima, the\r\nRakshasa became faint, Bhimasena stood, catching hold of that exhausted\r\none. And then the god-like mighty-armed Bhima lifted him with his two\r\narms, and dashing him with force on the ground, the son of Pandu smashed\r\nall his limbs. And striking him with his elbow, he severed from his body\r\nthe head with bitten lips and rolling eyes, like unto a fruit from its\r\nstem. And Jatasura's head being severed by Bhimasena's might, he fell\r\nbesmeared with gore, and having bitten lips. Having slain Jatasura, Bhima\r\npresented himself before Yudhishthira, and the foremost Brahmanas began\r\nto eulogise him (Bhima) even as the Marutas (eulogise) Vasava.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana continued, \"On that Rakshasa having been slain, that lord,\r\nthe royal son of Kunti, returned to the hermitage of Narayana and began\r\nto dwell there. And once on a time, remembering his brother Jaya\r\n(Arjuna), Yudhishthira summoned all his brothers, together with Draupadi\r\nand said these words, 'We have passed these four years peacefully ranging\r\nthe woods. It hath been appointed by Vibhatsu that about the fifth year\r\nhe will come to that monarch of mountains, the excellent cliff Sweta,\r\never graced with festivities held by blooming plants and maddened Kokilas\r\nand black bees, and peacocks, and chatakas and inhabited by tigers, and\r\nboars and buffaloes, and gavayas, and deer, and ferocious beasts; and\r\nsacred; and lovely with blown lotuses of a hundred and a thousand petals,\r\nand blooming lilies and blue lilies and frequented by the celestials and\r\nthe Asuras. And we also, eagerly anxious of meeting him on his arrival\r\nhave made up our minds to repair thither. Partha of unrivalled prowess\r\nhath appointed with me, saying, 'I shall remain abroad for five years,\r\nwith the object of learning military science.' In the place like unto the\r\nregion of the gods, shall we behold the wielder of Gandiva, arrive after\r\nhaving obtained the weapons.' Having said this, the Pandava summoned the\r\nBrahmanas, and the sons of Pritha having gone round the ascetics of rigid\r\nausterities and thereby pleased them, informed them of the matter\r\nmentioned above. Thereupon the Brahmanas gave their assent, saying, 'This\r\nshall be attended by prosperity and welfare. O foremost of the Bharatas,\r\nthese troubles shall result in happiness. O pious one, gaining the earth\r\nby the Kshatriya virtue, thou shall govern it.' Then in obedience to\r\nthese words of the ascetics, that represser of foes, Yudhishthira, set\r\nout with his brothers and those Brahmanas, followed by the Rakshasa and\r\nprotected by Lomasa. And that one of mighty energy, and of staunch vows,\r\nwith his brothers, at places went on foot and at others were carried by\r\nthe Rakshasas. Then king Yudhishthira, apprehending many troubles,\r\nproceeded towards the north abounding in lions and tigers and elephants.\r\nAnd beholding on the way the mountain Mainaka and the base of the\r\nGandhamadana and that rocky mass Sweta and many a crystal rivulet higher\r\nand higher up the mountain, he reached on the seventeenth day the sacred\r\nslopes of the Himalayas. And, O king, not far from the Gandhamadana,\r\nPandu's son beheld on the sacred slopes of the Himavan covered with\r\nvarious trees and creepers the holy hermitage of Vrishaparva surrounded\r\nby blossoming trees growing near the cascades. And when those repressers\r\nof foes, the sons of Pandu, had recovered from fatigue, they went to the\r\nroyal sage, the pious Vrishaparva and greeted him. And that royal sage\r\nreceived with affection those foremost of Bharatas, even as his own sons.\r\nAnd those repressers of foes passed there seven nights, duly regarded.\r\nAnd when the eighth day came, taking the permission of that sage\r\ncelebrated over the worlds, they prepared to start on their journey. And\r\nhaving one by one introduced unto Vrishaparva those Brahmanas, who, duly\r\nhonoured, remained in his charge as friends; and having also entrusted\r\nthe highsouled Vrishaparva with their remaining robes, the sons of Pandu,\r\nO king, left in the hermitage of Vrishaparva their sacrificial vessels\r\ntogether with their ornaments and jewels. And wise and pious and versed\r\nin every duty and having a knowledge of the past as well as the future,\r\nthat one gave instructions unto those best of the Bharatas, as unto his\r\nown sons. Then taking his permission those high-souled ones set out\r\ntowards the north. And as they set out the magnanimous Vrishaparva\r\nfollowed them to a certain distance. Then having entrusted the Pandavas\r\nunto the care of the Brahmanas and instructed and blessed them and given\r\ndirections concerning their course, Vrishaparva of mighty energy retraced\r\nhis steps.\r\n\r\n\"Then Kunti's son, Yudhishthira of unfailing prowess, together with his\r\nbrothers, began to proceed on foot along the mountain path, inhabited by\r\nvarious kinds of beasts. And having dwelt at the mountain slopes, densely\r\novergrown with trees, Pandu's son on the fourth day reached the Sweta\r\nmountain, like unto a mighty mass of clouds, abounding in streams and\r\nconsisting of a mass of gold and gems. And taking the way directed by\r\nVrishaparva, they reached one by one the intended places, beholding\r\nvarious mountains. And over and over they passed with ease many\r\ninaccessible rocks and exceedingly impassable caves of the mountain. And\r\nDhaumya and Krishna and the Parthas and the mighty sage Lomasa went on in\r\na body and none grew tired. And those highly fortunate ones arrived at\r\nthe sacred and mighty mountain resounding with the cries of birds and\r\nbeasts and covered with various trees and creepers and inhabited by\r\nmonkeys, and romantic and furnished with many lotus-lakes and having\r\nmarshes and extensive forests. And then with their down standing erect,\r\nthey saw the mountain Gandhamadana, the abode of Kimpurushas, frequented\r\nby Siddhas and Charanas and ranged by Vidyadharis and Kinnaris and\r\ninhabited by herds of elephants and thronged with lions and tigers and\r\nresounding with the roars of Sarabhas and attended by various beasts. And\r\nthe war-like sons of Pandu gradually entered into the forest of the\r\nGandhamadana, like unto the Nandana gardens, delightful to the mind and\r\nheart and worthy of being inhabited and having beautiful groves. And as\r\nthose heroes entered with Draupadi and the high-souled Brahmanas, they\r\nheard notes uttered by the mouths of birds, exceedingly sweet and\r\ngraceful to the ear and causing delight and dulcet and broken by reason\r\nof excess of animal spirits. And they saw various trees bending under the\r\nweight of fruits in all seasons, and ever bright with flowers--such as\r\nmangoes and hog-plums and bhavyas and pomegranates, citrons and jacks and\r\nlakuchas and plantains and aquatic reeds and parvatas and champakas and\r\nlovely kadamvas and vilwas, wood-apples and rose-apples and kasmaris and\r\njujbes and figs and glomerous figs and banians and aswatthas and khirikas\r\nand bhall atakas and amalkas and bibhitakas and ingudas and karamardas\r\nand tindukas of large fruits--these and many others on the slopes of the\r\nGandhamadana, clustered with sweet and nectarine fruits. And besides\r\nthese, they beheld champakas and asokas and ketakas and vakulas and\r\npunnagas and saptaparnas and karnikaras, and patals, and beautiful\r\nkutajas and mandaras, and lotuses, and parijatas, and kovidaras and\r\ndevadarus, and salas, and palmyra palms, and tamalas, and pippalas, and\r\nsalmalis and kinsukas, and singsapas, and saralas and these were\r\ninhabited by Chakoras, and wood-peckers and chatakas, and various other\r\nbirds, singing in sweet tones pleasing to the ear. And they saw lakes\r\nbeautiful on all sides with aquatic birds, and covered all around with\r\nkumudas, and pundarikas, and kokanadas, and utpalas, and kalharas, and\r\nkamalas and thronged on all sides with drakes and ruddy geese, and\r\nospreys, and gulls and karandavas, and plavas, and swans, and cranes, and\r\nshags, and other aquatic birds. And those foremost of men saw those\r\nlotus-lakes beautified with assemblages of lotuses, and ringing with the\r\nsweet hum of bees, glad, and drowsy on account of having drunk the\r\nintoxicating honey of lotuses, and reddened with the farina falling from\r\nthe lotuscups. And in the groves they beheld with their hens peacocks\r\nmaddened with desire caused by the notes of cloud-trumpets; and those\r\nwoods-loving glad peacocks drowsy with desire, were dancing, spreading in\r\ndalliance their gorgeous tails, and were crying in melodious notes. And\r\nsome of the peacocks were sporting with their mates on kutaja trees\r\ncovered with creepers. And some sat on the boughs of the kutajas,\r\nspreading their gorgeous tails, and looking like crowns worn by the\r\ntrees. And in the glades they beheld the graceful sindhuvaras like unto\r\nthe darts of Cupid. And on the summits of the mountain, they saw blooming\r\nkarnikaras bearing blossoms of a golden hue, appearing like ear-rings of\r\nexcellent make. And in the forest they saw blossoming kuruvakas, like\r\nunto the shafts of Cupid, which smiteth one with desire and maketh him\r\nuneasy. And they saw tilakas appearing like unto beauty-spots painted on\r\nthe forehead of the forest. And they saw mango trees graced with blossoms\r\nhummed over by black bees, and serving the purpose of Cupid's shafts. And\r\non the slopes of the mountain there were diverse blossoming trees,\r\nlooking lovely, some bearing flowers of a golden hue, and some, of the\r\nhue of the forest-conflagration, and some, red and some sable, and some\r\ngreen like unto lapises. And besides these, there were ranges of salas\r\nand tamalas and patalas and vakula trees, like unto garlands put on by\r\nthe summits of mountain. Thus gradually beholding on the slopes of the\r\nmountain many lakes, looking transparent like crystal, and having swans\r\nof white plumage and resounding with cries of cranes, and filled with\r\nlotuses and lilies, and furnished with waters of delicious feel; and also\r\nbeholding fragrant flowers, and luscious fruits, and romantic lakes, and\r\ncaptivating trees, the Pandavas penetrated into the forest with eyes\r\nexpanded with wonder. And (as they proceeded) they were fanned by the\r\nbreeze of balmy feel, and perfumed by kamalas and utpalas and kalharas\r\nand pundarikas. Then Yudhishthira pleasantly spake unto Bhima saying,\r\n'Ah! O Bhima, beautiful is this forest of the Gandhamadana. In this\r\nromantic forest there are various heavenly blossoming wild trees and\r\ncreepers, bedecked with foliage and fruit, nor are there any trees that\r\ndo not flower. On these slopes of the Gandhamadana, all the trees are of\r\nsleek foliage and fruit. And behold how these lotus-lakes with fullblown\r\nlotuses, and ringing with the hum of black bees, are being agitated by\r\nelephants with their mates. Behold another lotus-lake girt with lines of\r\nlotuses, like unto a second Sree in an embodied form wearing garlands.\r\nAnd in this excellent forest there are beautiful ranges of woods, rich\r\nwith the aroma of various blossoms, and hummed over by the black bees.\r\nAnd, O Bhima, behold on all sides the excellent sporting ground of the\r\ncelestials. By coming here, we have attained extra-human state, and been\r\nblessed. O Partha, on these slopes of the Gandhamadana, yon beautiful\r\nblossoming trees, being embraced by creepers with blossoms at their tops,\r\nlook lovely. And, O Bhima, hark unto the notes of the peacocks crying\r\nwith their hens on the mountain slopes. And birds such as chakoras, and\r\nsatapatras, and maddened kokilas, and parrots, are alighting on these\r\nexcellent flowering trees. And sitting on the twigs, myriads of\r\njivajivakas of scarlet, yellow and red hues, are looking at one another.\r\nAnd the cranes are seen near the spots covered with green and reddish\r\ngrass, and also by the side of the cascades. And those birds,\r\nbhringarajas, and upachakras, and herons are pouring forth their notes\r\ncharming to all creatures. And, lo! with their mates, these elephants\r\nfurnished with four tusks, and white as lotuses, are agitating that large\r\nlake of the hue of lapises. And from many cascades, torrents high as\r\nseveral palmyra palms (placed one upon another) are rushing down from the\r\ncliffs. And many argent minerals splendid, and of the effulgence of the\r\nsun, and like unto autumnal clouds, are beautifying this mighty mountain.\r\nAnd in some places there are minerals of the hue of the collyrium, and in\r\nsome those like unto gold, in some, yellow orpiment and in some,\r\nvermilion, and in some, caves of red arsenic like unto the evening clouds\r\nand in some, red chalk of the hue of the rabit, and in some, minerals\r\nlike unto white and sable clouds; and in some, those effulgent as the\r\nrising sun, these minerals of great lustre beautify the mountain. O\r\nPartha, as was said by Vrishaparva, the Gandharvas and the Kimpurushas,\r\nin company with their loves, are visible on the summits of the mountain.\r\nAnd, O Bhima, there are heard various songs of appropriate measures, and\r\nalso Vedic hymns, charming to all creatures. Do thou behold the sacred\r\nand graceful celestial river Mahaganga, with swans, resorted to by sages\r\nand Kinnaras. And, O represser of foes, see this mountain having\r\nminerals, rivulets, and beautiful woods and beasts, and snakes of diverse\r\nshapes and a hundred heads and Kinnaras, Gandharvas and Apsaras.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"Having attained excellent state, those valiant and\r\nwarlike repressers of foes with Draupadi and the high-souled Brahmanas\r\nwere exceedingly delighted at heart, and they were not satiated by\r\nbeholding that monarch of mountains. Thereafter they saw the hermitage of\r\nthe royal sage Arshtishena, furnished with flowers and trees bearing\r\nfruits. Then they went to Arshtishena versed in all duties of rigid\r\nausterities, skeleton-like, and having muscles bare.\""

And then Krishna, and Bhima, and the\r\ndevout twins, having bowed down their heads unto the royal sage, stood\r\n(there) surrounding him. And that priest of the Pandavas, the virtuous\r\nDhaumya, also duly approached that vow-observing sage. And by his\r\nprophetic eye that virtuous Muni had already known (the identity of)\r\nthose foremost of the Kurus, the sons of Pandu. And he said unto them.\r\n'Be ye seated.' And that one of rigid austerities, after having duly\r\nreceived that chief of the Kurus, when the latter with his brothers had\r\nseated himself enquired after his welfare saying, 'Dost thou not turn thy\r\ninclination upon untruth? And art thou intent upon virtue? And. O Partha,\r\nhath not thy attention to thy father and thy mother diminished? Are all\r\nthy superiors, and the aged, and those versed in the Vedas, honoured by\r\nthee? And O Pritha's son, dost thou not turn thy inclination unto sinful\r\nacts? And dost thou, O best of the Kurus, properly know how to perform\r\nmeritorious acts, and to eschew wicked deeds? Dost thou not exalt\r\nthyself? And are pious men gratified, being honoured by thee? And even\r\ndwelling in the woods, dost thou follow virtue alone? And, O Partha, doth\r\nnot Dhaumya grieve at thy conduct? Dost thou follow the customs of thy\r\nancestors, by charity, and religious observances, and asceticism, and\r\npurity, and candour, and forgiveness? And dost thou go along the way\r\ntaken by the royal sages? On the birth of a son in their (respective)\r\nlines, the Pitris in their regions, both laugh and grieve, thinking--Will\r\nthe sinful acts of this son of ours harm us, or will meritorious deeds\r\nconduce to our welfare? He conquereth both the worlds that payeth homage\r\nunto his father, and mother, and preceptor, and Agni, and fifthly, the\r\nsoul.' Yudhishthira said, 'O worshipful one, those duties have been\r\nmentioned by thee as excellent. To the best of my power I duly and\r\nproperly discharge them.'\r\n\r\nArshtishena said, 'During the Parvas sages subsisting on air and water\r\ncome unto this best of the mountains ranging through the air. And on the\r\nsummits of the mountain are seen amorous Kimpurushas with their\r\nparamours, mutually attached unto each other; as also, O Partha, many\r\nGandharvas and Apsaras clad in white silk vestments; and lovely-looking\r\nVidyadharas, wearing garlands; and mighty Nagas, and Suparnas, and\r\nUragas, and others. And on the summits of the mountain are heard, during\r\nthe Parvas, sounds of kettle-drums, and tabors, shells and mridangas. O\r\nforemost of the Bharatas, even by staying here, ye shall hear those\r\nsounds; do ye by no means feel inclined to repair thither. Further, O\r\nbest of the Bharata race, it is impossible, to proceed beyond this. That\r\nplace is the sporting-region of the celestials. There is no access\r\nthither for mortals. O Bharata, at this place all creatures bear ill-will\r\nto, and the Rakshasas chastise, that man who committeth aggression, be it\r\never so little. Beyond the summit of this Kailasa cliff, is seen the path\r\nof the celestial sages. If any one through impudence goeth beyond this,\r\nthe Rakshasas slay him with iron darts and other weapons. There, O child,\r\nduring the Parvas, he that goeth about on the shoulders of men, even\r\nVaisravana is seen in pomp and grandeur surrounded by the Apsaras. And\r\nwhen that lord of all the Rakshasas is seated on the summit, all\r\ncreatures behold him like unto the sun arisen, O best of Bharatas, that\r\nsummit is the sporting-garden of the celestials, and the Danavas, and the\r\nSiddhas, and Vaisravana. And during the Parvas, as Tumburu entertaineth\r\nthe Lord of treasures, the sweet notes of his song are heard all over the\r\nGandhamadana. O child, O Yudhishthira, here during the Parvas, all\r\ncreatures see and hear marvels like this. O Pandavas, till ye meet with\r\nArjuna, do ye stay here, partaking of luscious fruits, and the food of\r\nthe Munis. O child as thou hast come hither, do thou not betray any\r\nimpertinence. And, O child, after living here at thy will and diverting\r\nthyself as thou listest, thou wilt at length rule the earth, having\r\nconquered it by the force of thy arms.'\""

And\r\nwhat did those exceedingly powerful ones, gifted with manliness, do? And\r\nwhat was the food of those high-souled ones, when those heroes of the\r\nworlds dwelt (there)? O excellent one, do thou relate all about this. Do\r\nthou describe the prowess of Bhimasena, and what that mighty-armed one\r\ndid in the mountain Himalayan. Surely, O best of Brahmanas, he did not\r\nfight again with the Yakshas. And did they meet with Vaisravana? Surely,\r\nas Arshtishena said, the lord of wealth cometh thither. All this, O thou\r\nof ascetic wealth, I desire to hear in detail. Surely, I have not yet\r\nbeen fully satisfied by hearing about their acts.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having heard from that one of incomparable\r\nenergy, (Arshtishena), that advice conducive to their welfare, those\r\nforemost of the Bharatas, began to behave always accordingly. Those best\r\nof men, the Pandavas, dwelt upon the Himavan, partaking of the food eaten\r\nby the Munis, and luscious fruit, and the flesh of deer killed with\r\nunpoisoned shafts and various kinds of pure honey. Living thus, they\r\npassed the fifth year, hearing to various stories told by Lomasa. O lord,\r\nsaying, 'I shall be present when occasion ariseth,' Ghatotkacha, together\r\nwith all the Rakshasas, had ere this already gone away. Those magnanimous\r\nones passed many months in the hermitage of Arshtishena, witnessing many\r\nmarvels. And as the Pandavas were sporting there pleasantly, there came\r\nto see them some complacent vow-observing Munis and Charanas of high\r\nfortune, and pure souls. And those foremost of the Bharata race conversed\r\nwith them on earthly topics. And it came to pass that when several days\r\nhas passed, Suparna all of a sudden carried off an exceedingly powerful\r\nand mighty Naga, living in the large lake. And thereupon that mighty\r\nmountain began to tremble, and the gigantic trees, break. And all the\r\ncreatures and the Pandavas witnessed the wonder. Then from the brow of\r\nthat excellent mountain, the wind brought before the Pandavas various\r\nfragrant and fair blossoms. And the Pandavas, and the illustrious\r\nKrishna, together with their friends, saw those unearthly blossoms of\r\nfive hues. And as the mighty-armed Bhimasena was seated at ease upon the\r\nmountain, Krishna addressed him, saying, 'O best of the Bharata race, in\r\nthe presence of all the creatures, these flowers of five hues, carried by\r\nthe force of the wind raised by Suparna, are falling in amain on the\r\nriver Aswaratha. In Khandava thy high-souled brother, firm in promise,\r\nhad baffled Gandharvas and Nagas and Vasava himself, and slain fierce\r\nRakshasas, and also obtained the bow Gandiva. Thou also art of exceeding\r\nprowess and the might of thy arms is great, and irrepressible, and\r\nunbearable like unto the might of Sakra. O Bhimasena, terrified with the\r\nforce of thy arms, let all the Rakshasas betake themselves to the ten\r\ncardinal points, leaving the mountain. Then will thy friends be freed\r\nfrom fear and affliction, and behold the auspicious summit of this\r\nexcellent mountain furnished with variegated flowers. O Bhima, I have for\r\nlong cherished this thought in my mind,--that protected by the might of\r\nthy arms, I shall see that summit.'\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon, like a high-mettled bull that hath been struck, Bhimasena,\r\nconsidering himself as censured by Draupadi, could not bear (that). And\r\nthat Pandava of the gait of a lion or a bull, and graceful, and generous,\r\nand having the splendour of gold, and intelligent, and strong, and proud,\r\nand sensitive, and heroic, and having red eyes, and broad shoulders, and\r\ngifted with the strength of mad elephants, and having leonine teeth and a\r\nbroad neck, and tall like a young sala tree, and highsouled, and graceful\r\nin every limb, and of neck having the whorls of a shell and mighty-armed,\r\ntook up his bow plaited at the back with gold, and also his sword. And\r\nhaughty like unto a lion, and resembling a maddened elephant, that strong\r\none rushed towards that cliff, free from fear or affliction. And all the\r\ncreatures saw him equipped with bows and arrows, approaching like a lion\r\nor a maddened elephant. And free from fear or affliction, the Pandava\r\ntaking his mace, proceeded to that monarch of mountains causing the\r\ndelight of Draupadi. And neither exhaustion, nor fatigue, nor lassitude,\r\nnor the malice (of others), affected that son of Pritha and the Wind-god.\r\nAnd having arrived at a rugged path affording passage to one individual\r\nonly, that one of great strength ascended that terrible summit high as\r\nseveral palmyra palms (placed one upon another). And having ascended that\r\nsummit, and thereby gladdened Kinnaras, and great Nagas, and Munis, and\r\nGandharvas, and Rakshasas, that foremost of the Bharata line, gifted with\r\nexceeding strength described the abode of Vaisravana, adorned with golden\r\ncrystal palaces surrounded on all sides by golden walls having the\r\nsplendour of all gems, furnished with gardens all around, higher than a\r\nmountain peak, beautiful with ramparts and towers, and adorned with\r\ndoor-ways and gates and rows of pennons. And the abode was graced with\r\ndallying damsels dancing around, and also with pennons waved by the\r\nbreeze. And with bent arms, supporting himself on the end of his bow, he\r\nstood beholding with eagerness the city of the lord of treasures. And\r\ngladdening all creatures, there was blowing a breeze, carrying all\r\nperfumes, and of a balmy feel. And there were various beautiful and\r\nwonderful trees of diverse hues resounding with diverse dulcet notes. And\r\nat that place the foremost of the Bharatas surveyed the palace of the\r\nLord of the Rakshasas scattered with heaps of gems, and adorned with\r\nvariegated garlands. And renouncing all care of life the mighty-armed\r\nBhimasena stood motionless like a rock, with his mace and sword and bow\r\nin his hands. Then he blew his shell making the down of his adversaries\r\nstand erect; and twanging his bow-string, and striking his arms with the\r\nhands he unnerved all the creatures. Thereat with their hairs standing\r\nerect, the Yakshas and Rakshasas began to rush towards the Pandavas, in\r\nthe direction of those sounds. And taken by the arms of the Yakshas and\r\nRakshasas the flamed maces and clubs and swords and spears and javelins\r\nand axes, and when, O Bharata, the fight ensued between the Rakshasas and\r\nBhima, the latter by arrows cut off the darts, javelins and axes of those\r\npossessing great powers of illusion, and he of exceeding strength with\r\narrows pierced the bodies of the roaring Rakshasas, both of those that\r\nwere in the sky, and of those that remained on the earth. And Bhima of\r\nexceeding strength was deluged with the mighty sanguine rain sprung from\r\nthe bodies of the Rakshasas with maces and clubs in their hands and\r\nflowing on all sides from their persons. And the bodies and hands of the\r\nYakshas and Rakshasas were seen to be struck off by the weapon discharged\r\nby the might of Bhima's arms. And then all the creatures saw the graceful\r\nPandava densely surrounded by the Rakshasas, like unto the Sun enveloped\r\nby clouds. And even as the Sun surrounds everything with his rays, that\r\nmighty-armed and strong one of unfailing prowess, covered all with arrows\r\ndestroying foes. And although menacing and uttering yells, the Rakshasas\r\ndid not see Bhima embarrassed. Thereupon, with their bodies mangled, the\r\nYakshas afflicted by fear, Bhimasena began to utter frightful sounds of\r\ndistress, throwing their mighty weapons. And terrified at the wielder of\r\na strong bow, they fled towards the southern quarter, forsaking their\r\nmaces and spears and swords and clubs and axes. And then there stood,\r\nholding in his hands darts and maces, the broad-chested and mighty-armed\r\nfriend of Vaisravana, the Rakshasa named Maniman. And that one of great\r\nstrength began to display his mastery and manliness. And seeing them\r\nforsake the fight, he addressed them with a smile, 'Going to Vaisravana's\r\nabode, how will ye say unto that lord of wealth, that numbers have been\r\ndefeated by a single mortal in battle?' Having said this unto them that\r\nRakshasa, taking in his hands clubs and javelins and maces, set out and\r\nrushed towards the Pandava. And he rushed in amain like a maddened\r\nelephant. Bhimasena pierced his sides with three choice arrows. And the\r\nmighty Maniman, on his part, in wrath taking and flourishing a tremendous\r\nmace hurled it at Bhimasena. Thereupon Bhimasena beset with innumerable\r\nshafts sharpened on stones, hurled that mighty mace in the sky, dreadful,\r\nand like unto the lightning flash. But on reaching the mace those shafts\r\nwere baffled; and although discharged with force by that adept at hurling\r\nthe mace, still they could not stay its career. Then the mighty Bhima of\r\ndreadful prowess, baffled his (the Rakshasa's) discharge by resorting to\r\nhis skill in mace-fighting. In the meanwhile, the intelligent Rakshasa\r\nhad discharged a terrible iron club, furnished with a golden shaft. And\r\nthat club, belching forth flames and emitting tremendous roars, all of a\r\nsudden pierced Bhima's right arm and then fell to the ground. On being\r\nseverely wounded by that club, that bowman, Kunti's son, of immeasurable\r\nprowess, with eyes rolling in ire, took up his mace. And having taken\r\nthat iron mace, inlaid with golden plates, which caused the fear of foes\r\nand brought on their defeat, he darted it with speed towards the mighty\r\nManiman, menacing (him) and uttering shouts. Then Maniman on his part,\r\ntaking his huge and blazing dart, with great force discharged it at\r\nBhima, uttering loud shouts. Thereat breaking the dart with the end of\r\nhis mace, that mighty-armed one skilled in mace-fighting, speedily rushed\r\nto slay him, as Garuda (rushed) to slay a serpent. Then all of a sudden,\r\nadvancing ahead in the field, that mighty-armed one sprang into the sky\r\nand brandishing his mace hurled it with shouts. And like unto the\r\nthunder-bolt hurled by Indra, that mace like a pest, with the speed of\r\nthe wind destroyed the Rakshasa and then fell to the ground. Then all the\r\ncreatures saw that Rakshasa of terrible strength slaughtered by Bhima,\r\neven like a bull slain by a lion. And the surviving Rakshasas seeing him\r\nslain on the ground went towards the east, uttering frightful sounds of\r\ndistress.'\""

Thereupon,\r\nentrusting Draupadi to the charge of Arshtishena and equipped in their\r\narms, those valiant and mighty charioteers together began to ascend the\r\nsummit of the mountain. And having reached the summit, as those\r\nrepressors of foes and mighty bowmen and powerful charioteers they were\r\nlooking about, saw Bhima and those huge Rakshasas of mighty strength and\r\ncourage weltering in a state of unconsciousness having been struck down\r\nby Bhima. And holding his mace and sword and bow, that mighty-armed one\r\nlooked like Maghavan, after he had slain the danava hosts. Then on seeing\r\ntheir brother, the Pandavas, who had attained excellent state, embraced\r\nhim and sat down there. And with those mighty bowmen, that summit looked\r\ngrand like heaven graced by those foremost of celestials, the highly\r\nfortunate Lokapalas. And seeing the abode of Kuvera and the Rakshasas,\r\nlying slain on the ground, the king addressed his brother who was seated,\r\nsaying, 'Either it be through rashness, or through ignorance, thou hast,\r\nO Bhima, committed a sinful act. O hero, as thou art leading the life of\r\nan anchorite, this slaughter without cause is unlike thee. Acts, it is\r\nasserted by those versed in duties, as are calculated to displease a\r\nmonarch, ought not to be committed. But thou hast, O Bhimasena, committed\r\na deed which will offend even the gods. He that disregarding profit and\r\nduty, turneth his thoughts to sin must, O Partha, reap the fruit of his\r\nsinful actions. However, if thou seekest my good, never again commit such\r\na deed.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having said this to his brother, Vrikodara the\r\nvirtuous, the highly energetic and firm-minded son of Kunti, Yudhishthira\r\nversed in the particulars of (the science of) profit, ceased, and began\r\nto reflect on that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the Rakshasas that had survived those slain by Bhima\r\nfled in a body towards the abode of Kuvera. And they of exceeding\r\nfleetness having speedily reached Vaisravana's abode, began to utter loud\r\ncries of distress, being afflicted with the fear of Bhima. And, O king\r\nbereft of their weapons and exhausted and with their mail besmeared with\r\ngore and with dishevelled hair they spake unto Kuvera, saying. 'O lord,\r\nall thy foremost Rakshasas fighting with maces and clubs and swords and\r\nlances and barbed darts, have been slain. O lord of treasures, a mortal,\r\ntrespassing into the mountain, hath, singlehanded, slaughtered all thy\r\nKrodhovasa Rakshasas assembled together. And, O lord of wealth, there lie\r\nthe foremost of the Yakshas and Rakshasas senseless and dead, having been\r\nstruck down; and we have been let off through his favour. And thy friend,\r\nManiman also hath been slain. All this hath been done by a mortal. Do\r\nthou what is proper, after this.' Having heard this, that lord of all the\r\nYaksha hosts waxing wroth, with eyes reddened in anger, exclaimed,\r\n'What!' And hearing of Bhima's second (act of) aggression, that lord of\r\ntreasures, the king of the Yakshas, was filled with wrath, and said.\r\n'Yoke' (the horses). Thereat unto a car of the hue of dark clouds, and\r\nhigh as a mountain summit, they yoked steeds having golden garments. And\r\non being yoked unto the car, those excellent horses of his, graced with\r\nevery noble quality and furnished with the ten auspicious curls of hair\r\nand having energy and strength, and adorned with various gems and looking\r\nsplendid, as if desirous of speeding like the wind, began to neigh at\r\neach other the neighing emitted at (the hour of) victory. And that divine\r\nand effulgent king of the Yakshas set out, being eulogised by the\r\ncelestials and Gandharvas. And a thousand foremost Yakshas of reddened\r\neyes and golden lustre and having huge bodies, and gifted with great\r\nstrength, equipped with weapons and girding on their swords, followed\r\nthat high-souled lord of treasures. And coursing through the firmament\r\nthey (the steeds) arrived at the Gandhamadana, as if drawing forward the\r\nsky with their fleetness. And with their down standing erect, the\r\nPandavas saw that large assemblage of horses maintained by the lord of\r\nwealth and also the highsouled and graceful Kuvera himself surrounded by\r\nthe Yaksha hosts. And seeing those mighty charioteers the son of Pandu,\r\npossessed of great strength, equipped with bows and swords, Kuvera also\r\nwas delighted; and he was pleased at heart, keeping in view the task of\r\nthe celestials. And like unto birds, they, (the Yakshas) gifted with\r\nextreme celerity, alighted on the summit of the mountain and stood before\r\nthem (the Pandavas), with the lord of treasures at their head. Then, O\r\nBharata, seeing him pleased with the Pandavas, the Yakshas and the\r\nGandharvas stood there, free from agitation. Then thinking themselves as\r\nhaving transgressed, those high-souled and mighty charioteers, the\r\nPandavas, having bowed down unto that lord, the giver of wealth stood\r\nsurrounding the lord of treasures with joined hands. And the lord of\r\ntreasures sat on that excellent seat, the elegant Pushpaka, constructed\r\nby Viswakarma, painted with diverse colours. And thousands of Yakshas and\r\nRakshasas, some having huge frames and some ears resembling pegs, and\r\nhundreds of Gandharvas and hosts of Apsaras sat in the presence of that\r\none seated, even as the celestials sit surrounding him of a hundred\r\nsacrifices and wearing a beautiful golden garland on his head and holding\r\nin his hands his noose and sword and bow, Bhima stood, gazing at the lord\r\nof wealth. And Bhimasena did not feel depress either on having been\r\nwounded by the Rakshasas, or even in that plight seeing Kuvera arrive.\r\n\r\n\"And that one going about on the shoulders of men, on seeing Bhima stand\r\ndesirous of fighting with sharpened shafts, said unto Dharma's son, 'O\r\nPartha, all the creatures know thee as engaged in their good. Do thou.\r\ntherefore, with thy brothers fearlessly dwell on this summit of the\r\nmountain. And, O Pandava, be thou not angry with Bhima. These Yakshas and\r\nRakshasas had already been slain by Destiny: thy brother hath been the\r\ninstrument merely. And it is not necessary to feel shame for the act of\r\nimpudence that hath been committed. This destruction of the Rakshasas had\r\nbeen foreseen by the gods. I entertain no anger towards Bhimasena.\r\nRather, O foremost of the Bharata a race, I am pleased with him;\r\nnay,--even before coming here, I had been gratified with this deed of\r\nBhima.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"Having spoken thus unto the king, (Kuvera) said unto\r\nBhimasena, 'O child, O best of the Kurus, I do not mind this, O Bhima, as\r\nin order to please Krishna, thou hast, disregarding the gods and me also,\r\ncommitted this rash act, namely, the destruction of the Yakshas and the\r\nRakshasas, depending on the strength of thy arms, I am well-pleased with\r\nthee. O Vrikodara, to-day I have been freed from a terrible curse. For\r\nsome offence, that great Rishi, Agastya, had cursed me in anger. Thou\r\nhast delivered me by this act (of thine). O Pandu's son, my disgrace had\r\nere this been fated. No offence, therefore, in any way, attaches unto\r\nthee, O Pandava.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O divine one, why wast thou cursed by the\r\nhigh-souled Agastya? O god, I am curious to hear about the occasion of\r\nthat imprecation. I wonder that at that very moment, thou together with\r\nthy forces and attendants wast not consumed by the ire of that\r\nintelligent one.'\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon the lord of treasures said, 'At Kusasthali, O king, once there\r\nwas held a conclave of the gods. And surrounded by grimvisaged Yakshas,\r\nnumbering three hundred maha-padmas, carrying various weapons, I was\r\ngoing to that place. And on the way, I saw that foremost of sages,\r\nAgastya, engaged in the practice of severe austerities on the bank of the\r\nYamuna, abounding in various birds and graced with blossoming trees. And,\r\nO king, immediately on seeing that mass of energy, flaming and brilliant\r\nas fire, seated with upraised arms, facing the sun, my friend, the\r\ngraceful lord of the Rakshasas, Maniman, from stupidity, foolishness,\r\nhauteur and ignorance discharged his excrement on the crown of that\r\nMaharshi. Thereupon, as if burning all the cardinal points by his wrath,\r\nhe said unto me, 'Since, O lord of treasures, in thy very presence,\r\ndisregarding me, this thy friend hath thus affronted me, he, together\r\nwith thy forces, shall meet with destruction at the hands of a mortal.\r\nAnd, O wicked-minded one, thou also, being distressed on account of thy\r\nfallen soldiers, shalt be freed from thy sin, on beholding that mortal.\r\nBut if they follow thy behests, their (the soldier's) powerful sons shall\r\nnot incur by this dreadful curse. This curse I received formerly from\r\nthat foremost of Rishis. Now, O mighty king, have I been delivered by thy\r\nbrother Bhima.'\""

That one next by birth to Bhimasena,\r\nPhalguna, versed in the science of profit and all mortal regulations, is\r\nwell in heaven.

And self-restraint, and charity, and strength, and\r\nintelligence, and modesty, and fortitude, and excellent energy--even all\r\nthese are established in that majestic one of magnificent soul. And, O\r\nPandava, Jishnu never committed any shameful act through poverty of\r\nspirit. And in the world, none ever say that Partha hath uttered an\r\nuntruth. And, O Bharata, honoured by the gods, pitris, and the\r\nGandharvas, that enhancer of the glory of the Kurus is learning the\r\nscience of weapons in Sakra's abode.

Behold\r\nthat excellent and bright summit of the Meru, where sitteth the great\r\nsire (Brahma) with the celestials happy in self-knowledge. And next to\r\nthe abode of Brahma is visible the region of him who is said to be the\r\nreally primal Cause or the origin of all creatures, even that prime lord,\r\ngod Narayana, having neither beginning nor end. And, O king, that\r\nauspicious place composed of all energies even the celestials, cannot\r\nbehold. And the region of the high-souled Vishnu, by its native\r\nsplendour, exceeding in effulgence the sun or fire, cannot be beheld by\r\nthe gods, or the Danavas. And the region of Narayana lieth resplendent to\r\nthe east of the Meru, where, O child, that lord of all creatures, the\r\nself-create primal Cause of the universe, having manifested all beings,\r\nlooketh splendid of his excellent grace. O child, not to speak of the\r\nMaharshis--even Brahmarshis have no access to that place. And, O best of\r\nthe Kurus, it is the Yatis only who have access to it. And, O Pandu's\r\nson, (at that place) luminaries cannot shine by him; there that lord of\r\ninconceivable soul alone shineth transcendental. There by reverence, and\r\nsevere austerities, Yatis inspired by virtue of pious practices, attain\r\nNarayana Hari. And, O Bharata, repairing thither, and attaining that\r\nuniversal Soul--the self-create and eternal God of gods, high-souled\r\nones, of Yoga success, and free from ignorance and pride have not to\r\nreturn to this world. O highly fortunate Yudhishthira, this region is\r\nwithout beginning, or deterioration, or end for it is the very essence of\r\nthat God. And, O son of the Kurus, the Sun and the Moon every day go\r\nround this Meru, coursing in an opposite direction. And, O sinless one. O\r\nmighty monarch, the other luminaries also go round this king of mountains\r\nin the self-same way. Thus the worshipful Sun who dispelleth darkness,\r\ngoeth round this (mountain) obscuring other luminaries. Then having set,\r\nand passed the evening, that Maker of day, the Sun, taketh a northerly\r\ncourse. Then again nearing the Meru, the divine Sun (ever) intent on the\r\ngood of all beings, again courseth, facing the east. And in this way, the\r\ndivine Moon also together with the stars goeth round this mountain,\r\ndividing the month unto several sections, by his arrival at the Parvas.\r\nHaving thus unerringly coursed round the mighty Meru, and, nourished all\r\ncreatures, the Moon again repaireth unto the Mandar. In the same way,\r\nthat destroyer of darkness--the divine Sun--also moveth on this\r\nunobstructed path, animating the universe. When, desirous of causing dew,\r\nhe repaireth to the south, then there ensueth winter to all creatures.\r\nThen the Sun, turning back from the south, by his rays draweth up the\r\nenergy from all creatures both mobile and immobile. Thereupon, men become\r\nsubject to perspiration, fatigue, drowsiness and lassitude; and living\r\nbeings always feel disposed to slumber. Thence, returning through unknown\r\nregions, that divine effulgent one causeth shower, and thereby reviveth\r\nbeings. And having, by the comfort caused by the shower, wind, and\r\nwarmth, cherished the mobile and the immobile, the powerful Sun resumeth\r\nhis former course. O Partha, ranging thus, the Sun unerringly turneth on\r\nthe wheel of Time, influencing created things. His course is unceasing;\r\nhe never resteth, O Pandava. Withdrawing the energy of all beings, he\r\nagain rendereth it back. O Bharata, dividing time into day and night, and\r\nKala, and Kashtha, that lord, the Sun, dealeth life and motion to all\r\ncreated things.'\""

And\r\nmultitudes of Gandharvas and Maharshis gladly visited those energetic\r\nones, possessing prowess, of chaste desires and being the foremost of\r\nthose endued with truth and fortitude. And having arrived at that\r\nexcellent mountain furnished with trees bearing blossoms, those mighty\r\ncharioteers were exceedingly delighted, even as the Marutas, on arriving\r\nat the celestial regions. And experiencing great exhilaration, they lived\r\n(there), seeing the slopes and summits of that mighty mountain, filled\r\nwith flowers, and resonant with the cries of peacocks and cranes. And on\r\nthat beautiful mountain they beheld lakes filled with lotuses, and having\r\ntheir shores covered with trees, and frequented by darkness, and\r\nkarandavas and swans. And the flourishing sporting-regions, graceful on\r\naccount of the various flowers, and abounding in gems, was capable of\r\ncaptivating that king, the dispenser of wealth (Kuvera). And always\r\nranging (there), those foremost of ascetics (the Pandavas) were incapable\r\nof conceiving (the significance of) that Summit, furnished with mighty\r\ntrees, and masses of wide-spreading clouds. And, O great hero, owing to\r\nits native splendour, and also on account of the brilliance of the annual\r\nplants, there was no difference there between night and day. And staying\r\nin the mountain, remaining in which the Sun of unrivalled energy\r\ncherisheth the mobile and immobile things, those heroes and foremost of\r\nmen beheld the rising and the setting of the Sun. And having seen the\r\nrising and the setting points of the Sun and the rising and the setting\r\nmountain, and all the cardinal points, as well as the intervening spaces\r\never blazing with the rays of the Dispeller of darkness, those heroes, in\r\nexpectation of the arrival of that mighty charioteer firm in truth,\r\nbecame engaged in reciting the Vedas, practising the daily rituals,\r\nchiefly discharging the religious duties, exercising sacred vows, and\r\nabiding by the truth. And saying, 'Let us even here experience delight by\r\njoining without delay Arjuna accomplished in arms,' those highly blessed\r\nParthas became engaged in the practice of Yoga. And beholding romantic\r\nwoods on that mountain, as they always thought of Kiriti, every day and\r\nnight appeared unto them even as a year. From that very moment joy had\r\ntaken leave of them when, with Dhaumya's permission, the high-souled\r\nJishnu, matting his hair, departed (for the woods). So, how could they,\r\nabsorbed in his contemplation, experience happiness there? They had\r\nbecome overwhelmed with grief ever since the moment when at the command\r\nof his brother, Yudhishthira, Jishnu of the tread of a mad elephant had\r\ndeparted from the Kamyaka forest. O Bharata, in this way, on that\r\nmountain those descendants of Bharata passed a month with difficulty,\r\nthinking of him of the white steeds, who had gone to Vasava's abode for\r\nlearning arms. And Arjuna, having dwelt for five years in the abode of\r\nhim of a thousand eyes, and having from that lord of celestials obtained\r\nall the celestial weapons,--such as those of Agni, of Varuna, of Soma, of\r\nVayu, of Vishnu, of Indra, of Pasupati, of Brahma, of Parameshthi, of\r\nPrajapati, of Yama, of Dhata, of Savita, of Tvashta, and of Vaisravana;\r\nand having bowed down to and gone round him of a hundred sacrifices, and\r\ntaken his (Indra's) permission, cheerfully came to the Gandhamadana.\""

And on meeting with that matchless one, they were\r\nexceedingly delighted. And he also meeting with them rejoiced\r\nexceedingly, and began to eulogise the king. And seeing before them that\r\ncar driving in which the slayer of Namuchi had annihilated seven\r\nphalanxes of Diti's offspring, the magnanimous Parthas went round it.

O grinder of foes, O king,\r\nhaving acquired that science which thou hadst directed me (to learn), I\r\nat thy command went to the forest, for practising penances. From Kamyaka\r\nrepairing to the Bhrigutunga, I spent there one night, being engaged in\r\nausterities And it came to pass that on the next I saw a certain\r\nBrahmana. And he asked me, saying, 'O son of Kunti, whither wilt thou\r\ngo?' Thereupon, O descendant of the Kurus, I truly related unto him\r\neverything. And, O best of kings, having heard the true account, the\r\nBrahmana became well-pleased with me, and, O king, praised me. Then the\r\nBrahmana, pleased with me, said, 'O Bharata, be thou engaged in\r\nausterities. By performing penances, thou wilt in a short time behold the\r\nlord of the celestials.' And according to his advice I ascended the\r\nHimavan, and, O mighty king, began to practise penances, (the first)\r\nmonth subsisting on fruit and roots. I spent the second month, subsisting\r\non water. And, O Pandava, in the third month I totally abstained from\r\nfood. And in the fourth month I remained with upraised arms. And a wonder\r\nit is that I did not lose any strength. And it came to pass that when the\r\nfirst day of the fifth month had been spent, there appeared before me a\r\nbeing wearing the form of a boar, turning up the earth with his mouth,\r\nstamping the ground with his feet, rubbing the earth with his breast, and\r\nmomentarily going about in a frightful manner. And him followed a great\r\nbeing in the guise of a hunter furnished with the bow, arrows, and the\r\nsword, and surrounded by females. Thereupon, taking my bow and the two\r\ninexhaustible quivers, I pierced with shafts that terrible and frightful\r\ncreature. And simultaneously (with me) that hunter also drawing a strong\r\nbow, more severely struck at (the animal), as if shaking my mind. And, O\r\nking, he also said unto me, 'Why hast thou, transgressing the rules of\r\nhunting, hit the animal first hit at by me? With these sharpened shafts\r\nwill I destroy thy pride. Stay!' Then that mighty-bodied one holding the\r\nbow rushed at me. And with volleys of mighty shafts, he covered me\r\nentirely, even as a cloud covereth a mountain with showers. Then, on my\r\npart, I covered him with a mighty discharge of arrows. Thereupon, with\r\nsteady arrows having their points aflame, and inspired with mantras, I\r\npierced him even as (Indra) riveth a mountain with a thunderbolt. Then\r\nhis person began to be multiplied a hundredfold and a thousandfold. At\r\nthis, I pierced all this bodies with shafts. Then again all those forms\r\nbecame one, O Bharata. Thereat I struck at it. Next, he now assumed a\r\nsmall body with a huge head, and now a huge body with a small head. And,\r\nO king, he then assumed his former person and approached me for fight.\r\nAnd, O foremost of the Bharata race, when in the encounter I failed to\r\noverwhelm him with arrows, I fixed the mighty weapon of the Wind-god. But\r\nI failed to discharge it at him, and this was a wonder. And when that\r\nweapon thus failed of effect, I was struck with amazement. However, O\r\nking, exerting myself more vigorously, I again covered that being with a\r\nmighty multitude of shafts. Then taking Sthunakarna, and Varuna and\r\nSalava, and Asmavarsha weapons, I assailed him, profusely showering\r\nshafts. But, O king, he instantly swallowed up even all these weapons of\r\nmine. And when all those (weapons) had been swallowed up, I discharged\r\nthe weapon presided over by Brahma. And when the blazing arrows issuing\r\nfrom that weapon were heaped upon him all around, and being thus heaped\r\nover by that mighty weapon discharged by me, he increased (in bulk). Then\r\nall the world became oppressed with the energy begotten of the weapon\r\nhurled by me, and the firmament and all the points of the sky became\r\nillumined. But that one of mighty energy instantly baffled even that\r\nweapon. And, O monarch, when that weapon presided over by Brahma had been\r\nbaffled I was possessed with terrible fear. Thereupon immediately holding\r\neven my bow and the two inexhaustible quivers, I shot at that being, but\r\nhe swallowed up all those weapons. And when all the weapons had been\r\nbaffled and swallowed up, there ensued a wrestling between him and\r\nmyself. And we encountered each other first with blows and then with\r\nslaps. But incapable of overcoming that being, I fell down stupefied on\r\nthe ground. Thereupon, O mighty king, with a laugh, that wonderful being\r\nat my sight vanished at that spot together with the woman. Having\r\naccomplished this, O illustrious monarch, that divine one assumed another\r\nand unearthly form (clad in) wonderful raiment. And renouncing the form\r\nof a hunter, that divine lord of the gods, resumed his own unearthly\r\nappearance and that mighty god stood (there). Then appeared before me\r\nwith Uma that manifest divine one, having the bull for his mark, wielding\r\nthe Pinaka, bearing serpents and cable of assuming many forms. And, O\r\nrepressor of foes, advancing towards me, standing even then in the field\r\nready for conflict, that wielder of the trident addressed me saying, I am\r\nwell-pleased with thee. Then that divine one held up my bows and the\r\ncouple of quivers furnished with inexhaustible shafts and returned them\r\nunto me saying, 'Do thou ask some boon, O Kunti's son. I am well-pleased\r\nwith thee. Tell me, what I shall do for thee. And, O hero, express the\r\ndesire that dwelleth in thy heart. I will grant it. Except immortality\r\nalone, tell me as to the desire that is in thy heart. Thereat with my\r\nmind intent on the acquisition of arms, I only bowed down unto Siva and\r\nsaid, 'O divine one, if thou beest favourably disposed towards me, then I\r\nwish to have this boon,--I wish to learn all the weapons that are with\r\nthy god-head.' Then the god Tryamvaka said unto me, 'I will give. O\r\nPandava, my own weapon Raudra shall attend upon thee.' Thereupon\r\nMahadeva, well-pleased, granted to me the mighty weapon, Pasupata. And,\r\nhaving granted that eternal weapon, he also said unto me, This must never\r\nbe hurled at mortals. If discharged at any person of small energy, it\r\nwould consume the universe. Shouldst thou (at any time) be hard pressed,\r\nthou mayst discharge it. And when all thy weapons have been completely\r\nbaffled, thou mayst hurl it.' Then when he having the bull for his mark,\r\nhad been thus gratified, there stood manifest by my side that celestial\r\nweapon, of resistless force capable of baffling all weapons and\r\ndestructive of foes and the hewer of hostile forces and unrivalled and\r\ndifficult to be borne even by the celestials, the demons and the\r\nRakshasas. Then at the command of that god, I sat me down there. And in\r\nmy very sight the god vanished from the spot.'\""

And having passed the\r\nnight, when I had finished the morning rituals, I saw that foremost of\r\nthe Brahmanas whom I had seen before. And unto him I told all as it had\r\nhappened, O Bharata, namely, that I had met the divine Mahadeva.\r\nThereupon, O king of kings, well-pleased, he said unto me, 'Since thou\r\nhast beheld the great god, incapable of being beheld by any one else,\r\nsoon wilt thou mix with Vaivaswata and the other Lokapalas and the lord\r\nof the celestials; and Indra too will grant thee weapons.' O king, having\r\nsaid this unto me and having embraced me again and again, that Bhrahmana\r\nresembling the Sun, went away whither he listed. And, O slayer of foes,\r\nit came to pass that on the evening of that day refreshing the whole\r\nworld, there began to blow a pure breeze. And in my vicinity on the base\r\nof the Himalaya mountain fresh, fragrant and fair flowers began to bloom.\r\nAnd on all sides there were heard charming symphony and captivating hymns\r\nrelating to Indra. And before the lord of the celestial hosts of Apsaras\r\nand Gandharvas chanted various songs. And ascending celestial cars, there\r\napproached the Marutas and the followers of Mahendra and the dwellers of\r\nheaven. And afterwards, Marutvan together with Sachi and all the\r\ncelestials appeared on the scene in cars yoked with horses elegantly\r\nadorned. And at this very moment, O king, he that goeth about on the\r\nshoulders of men manifested himself unto me in excellent grace. And I saw\r\nYama seated on the south and Varuna and the lord of the celestials at\r\ntheir respective regions. And, O foremost of men, O mighty monarch, they\r\nafter having cheered me said, 'O Savyasachin, behold us--the\r\nLokapalas--seated. For the performance of the task of the gods thou hast\r\nobtained the sight of Sankara. Do thou now receive weapons from us seated\r\naround.' Thereupon, O lord, having bowed down unto those foremost of the\r\ncelestials with regard, I duly accepted those mighty weapons. And then\r\nthey recognised me as one of their own. Afterwards the gods repaired to\r\nthe quarter from whence they had come. And that lord of the celestials,\r\nthe divine Maghavan too having ascended his glorious chariot, said, 'O\r\nPhalguna, thou shalt have to repair unto the celestial region. O\r\nDhananjaya, even before this thy arrival I knew that thou wouldst come\r\nhither. Then I, have O best of the Bharatas, manifested myself unto thee.\r\nAs formerly thou hadst performed thy ablution in the various tirthas and\r\nnow hast performed severe austerities, so thou wilt be able to repair\r\nunto the celestial regions, O Pandava. Thou wilt, however, again have to\r\npractise extreme penance, for thou shouldst at any rate journey to\r\nheaven. And at my command, Matali shall take thee to the celestial\r\nregions. Thou hast already been recognised by the celestials and the\r\ncelestial sages of high soul.' Thereupon I said unto Sakra, 'O divine\r\none, be thou favourable unto me. With the view of learning arms do I\r\nbeseech thee that thou mayst 'be my preceptor.' At this Indra said, 'O\r\nchild, having learnt weapons thou wouldst perform terrible deeds and with\r\nthis object thou desirest to obtain the weapons. However, obtain thou the\r\narms, as thou desirest.' Then I said, 'O slayer of foes, I never would\r\ndischarge these celestial weapons at mortals except when all my other\r\narms should have been baffled. Do thou, O lord of the celestials, grant\r\nme the celestial weapons (so that) I may hereafter, obtain the regions\r\nattainable by warriors.' Indra said, 'O Dhananjaya it is to try thee that\r\nI have said such words unto thee. Having been begotten of me this speech\r\nof thine well becometh thee. Do thou, O Bharata, repairing unto my abode\r\nlearn all the weapons of Vayu, of Agni, of the Vasus, of Varuna, of the\r\nMarutas, of the Siddhas, of Brahma, of the Gandharvas of the Uragas, of\r\nthe Rakshasas, of Vishnu and of the Nairitas; and also all the weapons\r\nthat are with me, O perpetuator of the Kuru race.' Having said this unto\r\nme Sakra vanished at the very spot. Then, O king, I saw the wonderful and\r\nsacred celestial car yoked with steeds arrive conducted by Matali. And\r\nwhen the Lokapalas went away Matali said unto me. 'O thou of mighty\r\nsplendour, the lord of the celestials is desirous of seeing thee. And O\r\nmighty-armed one, do thou acquire competence and then perform thy task.\r\nCome and behold the regions, attainable by merit and come unto heaven\r\neven in this frame. O Bharata, the thousand-eyed lord of the celestials\r\nwisheth to see thee.' Thus addressed by Matali, I, taking leave of the\r\nmountain Himalaya and having gone round it ascended that excellent car.\r\nAnd then the exceedingly generous Matali, versed in equine lore, drove\r\nthe steeds, gifted with the speed of thought or the wind. And when the\r\nchariot began to move that charioteer looking at my face as I was seated\r\nsteadily, wondered and said these words, 'Today this appeareth unto me\r\nstrange and unprecedented that being seated in this celestial car, thou\r\nhast not been jerked ever so little. O foremost of Bharata race, I have\r\never remarked that at the first pull by the steeds even the lord of the\r\ncelestials himself getteth jerked. But all the while that the car had\r\nmoved, thou hast been sitting unshaken. This appeareth unto me as\r\ntranscending even the power of Sakra.'\r\n\r\n\"Having said this, O Bharata, Matali soared in the sky and showed me the\r\nabodes of the celestials and their palaces. Then the chariot yoked with\r\nsteeds coursed upwards. And the celestials and the sages began to worship\r\n(that car), O prime of men. And I saw the regions, moving anywhere at\r\nwill, and the splendour also of the highly energetic Gandharvas, Apsaras,\r\nand the celestial sages. And Sakra's charioteer, Matali, at once showed\r\nme Nandana and other gardens and groves belonging to the celestials. Next\r\nI beheld Indra's abode, Amaravati, adorned with jewels and trees yielding\r\nany sort of fruit that is desired. There the Sun doth not shed heat; nor\r\ndoth heat or cold or fatigue there affect (one), O king. And, O great\r\nmonarch, the celestials feel neither sorrow nor poverty of spirit, nor\r\nweakness, nor lassitude, O grinder of foes. And, O ruler of men, the\r\ncelestials and the others have neither anger nor covetousness. And, O\r\nking, in the abodes of the celestials, the beings are ever contented. And\r\nthere the trees ever bear verdant foliage, and fruits, and flowers; and\r\nthe various lakes are embalmed with the fragrance of lotuses. And there\r\nthe breeze is cool, and delicious, and fragrant, and pure, and inspiring.\r\nAnd the ground is variegated with all kinds of gems, and adorned with\r\nblossoms. And there were seen innumerable beautiful beasts and in the air\r\ninnumerable rangers of the sky. Then I saw the Vasus, and the Rudras, and\r\nthe Sadhyas with the Marutas, and the Adityas, and the two Aswins and\r\nworshipped them. And they conferred their benison on me, granting me\r\nstrength and prowess, and energy, and celebrity, and (skill in) arms, and\r\nvictory in battle. Then, entering that romantic city adored by the\r\nGandharvas and the celestials, with joined hands, I stood before the\r\nthousand-eyed lord of the celestials. Thereupon, that best of bestowers\r\ngladly offered unto me half of his seat; and Vasava also with regard\r\ntouched my person. And, O Bharata, with the view of acquiring arms and\r\nlearning weapons, I began to dwell in heaven, together with the gods and\r\nthe Gandharvas of generous souls. And Viswavana's son, Chitrasena became\r\nmy friend. And he, O king, imparted unto me the entire Gandharva\r\n(science). And, O monarch, I happily lived in Sakra's abode, well cared\r\nfor having all my desires gratified, learning weapons, listening to the\r\nnotes of songs, and the clear sounds of musical instruments, and\r\nbeholding the foremost of Apsaras dance. And without neglecting to study\r\nthe arts, which I learnt properly, my attention was specially fixed on\r\nthe acquisition of arms. And that lord of a thousand eyes was pleased\r\nwith that purpose of mine. Living thus in heaven, O king, I passed this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\"And when I had acquired proficiency in weapons, and gained his\r\nconfidence that one having for his vehicle the horse (Uchchaisrava),\r\n(Indra), patting me on the head with his hand, said these words, 'Now\r\neven the celestials themselves cannot conquer thee,--what shall I say of\r\nimperfect mortals residing on earth? Thou hast become invulnerable in\r\nstrength, irrepressible, and incomparable in fight.' Then with the hair\r\nof his body standing on end, he again accosted me saying, 'O hero, in\r\nfighting with weapons none is equal unto thee. And, O perpetuator of the\r\nKuru race, thou art even watchful, and dexterous, and truthful, and of\r\nsubdued senses, and the protector of the Brahmanas and adept in weapons,\r\nand warlike. And, O Partha, together with (a knowledge of) the five\r\nmodes, using (them), thou hast obtained five and ten weapons and,\r\ntherefore, there existeth none, who is thy peer. And thou hast perfectly\r\nlearnt the discharge (of those weapons) and (their) withdrawal, and\r\n(their) re-discharge and re-withdrawal, and the Prayaschitta connected\r\n(with them), and also their revival, in case of their being baffled. Now,\r\nO represser of foes, the time hath arrived for thy paying the preceptor's\r\nfee. Do thou promise to pay the fee; then I shall unfold unto thee what\r\nthou wilt have to perform.' Thereat, O king, I said unto the ruler of the\r\ncelestials, 'If it be in my power to do the work, do thou consider it as\r\nalready accomplished by me.' O king, when I had said these words, Indra\r\nwith a smile said unto me 'Nothing is there in the three worlds that is\r\nnot in thy power (to achieve) My enemies, those Danavas, named,\r\nNivata-Kavachas dwell in the womb of the ocean. And they number thirty\r\nmillion and are notorious, and all of equal forms and strength and\r\nsplendour. Do thou slay them there, O Kunti's son; and that will be thy\r\npreceptor's fee.'\r\n\r\n\"Saying this he gave unto me the highly resplendent celestial car,\r\nconducted by Matali, furnished with hair resembling the down of peacocks.\r\nAnd on my head he set this excellent diadem. And he gave me ornaments for\r\nmy body, like unto his own. And he granted unto me the impenetrable\r\nmail--the best of its kind, and easy to the touch; and fastened unto the\r\nGandiva this durable string. Then I set out, ascending that splendid\r\nchariot riding on which in days of yore, the lord of the celestials and\r\nvanquished Vali--that son of Virochana. And, O ruler of men, startled by\r\nthe rattling of the car, all the celestials, approached (there), taking\r\nme to be the king of the celestials. And seeing me, they asked, 'O\r\nPhalguna, what art thou going to do?' And I told them as it had fallen\r\nout,--and said, 'I shall even do this in battle. Ye that are highly\r\nfortunate, know that I have set out desirous of slaying the\r\nNivata-Kavachas. O sinless ones, do ye bless me.' Thereupon, they began\r\nto eulogise me even as they (eulogise) the god, Purandara. And they said,\r\n'Riding on this car, Maghavan conquered in battle Samvara, and Namuchi,\r\nand Vala, and Vritra, and Prahrada, and Naraka. And mounted on this car\r\nalso Maghavan, had conquered in battle many thousands and millions and\r\nhundreds of millions of Daityas. And, O Kaunteya, thou also, riding on\r\nthis car, by thy prowess shalt conquer the Nivatha-Kavachas in conflict,\r\neven as did the self-possessed Maghavan in days of yore. And here is the\r\nbest of shells; by this also thou shalt defeat the Danavas And by this it\r\nis that the high souled Sakra conquered the words.' Saying this, the gods\r\noffered (unto me) this shell, Devadatta, sprung in the deep; and I\r\naccepted it for the sake of victory. And at this moment, the gods fell\r\nextolling me. And in order to be engaged in action, I proceeded to the\r\ndreadful abode of the Danavas, furnished with the shell, the mail, and\r\narrows, and taking my bow.\""

And like unto flowing cliffs were seen on it heaving billows, now\r\nmeeting together and now rolling away. And there (were seen) all around\r\nbarks by thousands filled with gems. And there were seen timingilas and\r\ntortoises and makaras like unto rock submerged in water. And on all sides\r\nround thousands of shells sunk in water appeared like star in the night\r\ncovered by light clouds. And thousands upon thousands of gem were\r\nfloating in heaps and a violent wind was blowing about in whirls--and\r\nthis was wonderful to behold. And having beheld that excellent lord of\r\nall waters with powerful tides, I saw at a short distance the city of the\r\ndemons filled with the Danavas. And even there, eftsoons entering\r\nunderneath the earth, Matali skilled in guiding the car, sitting fast on\r\nthe chariot drove it with force; and he dashed on, frightening that city\r\nwith the rattling of his chariot. And hearing that rattling of the\r\nchariot like unto the rumbling of the clouds in the sky, the Danavas,\r\nthinking me to be the lord of the celestials, became agitated. And\r\nthereupon they all, frightened at heart, stood holding in their hands\r\nbows and arrows and swords and javelins and axes and maces and clubs.\r\nThen having made arrangements for the defence of the city, the Danavas,\r\nwith minds alarmed, shut the gates, so that nothing could be discovered.\r\nThereupon taking my shell, Devadatta, of tremendous roars, I again and\r\nagain winded it with exceeding cheerfulness. And filling all the\r\nfirmament, those sounds produced echoes. Thereat mighty beings were\r\nterrified and they hid (themselves). And then, O Bharata, all of them\r\nadorned with ornaments, those offsprings of Diti--the\r\nNivata-Kavachas--made their appearance by thousands, donning diverse mail\r\nand taking in their hands various weapons and equipped with mighty iron\r\njavelins and maces and clubs and hatchets and sabres and discs and\r\nsataghnis and bhusundis and variegated and ornamented swords. Then, after\r\ndeliberating much as to the course of the car, Matali began to guide the\r\nsteeds on a (piece of) level ground, O foremost of the Bharatas. And\r\nowing to the swiftness of those fleet coursers conducted by him, I could\r\nsee nothing--and this was strange. Then the Danavas there began to sound\r\nthousands of musical instruments, dissonant and of odd shapes. And at\r\nthose sounds, fishes by hundreds and by thousands, like unto hills,\r\nhaving their senses bewildered by that noise, fled suddenly. And mighty\r\nforce flew at me, the demons discharging sharpened shafts by hundreds and\r\nby thousands. And then, O Bharata, there ensued a dreadful conflict\r\nbetween me and the demons, calculated to extinguish the Nivata-Kavachas.\r\nAnd there came to the mighty battle the Devarshis and the Danavarshis and\r\nthe Brahmarshis and the Siddhas. And desirous of victory, the Munis\r\neulogised me with the same sweet-speeches that (they had eulogised) Indra\r\nwith, at the war, (which took place) for the sake of Tara.'\""

And obstructing the\r\ncourse of the car, and shouting loudly, those mighty charioteers, hemming\r\nme in on all sides, covered me with showers of shafts. Then other demons\r\nof mighty prowess, with darts and hatchets in their hands, began to throw\r\nat me spears and axes. And that mighty discharge of darts, with numerous\r\nmaces and clubs incessantly hurled fell upon my car. And other dreadful\r\nand grim-visaged smiters among the Nivata-Kavachas, furnished with bows\r\nand sharpened weapons, ran at me in fight. And in the conflict, shooting\r\nfrom the Gandiva sundry swift arrows coursing straight, I pierced each of\r\nthem with ten. And they were driven back by those stone-whetted shafts of\r\nmine. Then on my steeds being swiftly driven by Matali, they began to\r\ndisplay various movements with the speed of the wind. And being skilfully\r\nguided by Matali, they began to trample upon the sons of Diti. And\r\nalthough the steeds yoked unto that mighty chariot numbered hundreds upon\r\nhundreds, yet being deftly conducted by Matali, they began to move, as if\r\nthey were only a few. And by their tread, and by the rattling of the\r\nchariot wheels and by the vollies of my shafts, the Danavas began to fall\r\nby hundreds. And others accoutred in bows, being deprived of life, and\r\nhaving their charioteers slain, were carried about by the horses. Then,\r\ncovering all sides and directions, all (the Danavas) skilled in striking\r\nentered into the contest with various weapons, and thereat my mind became\r\nafflicted. And I witnessed (this instance of) the marvellous prowess of\r\nMatali, viz., that he guided those fiery steeds with ease. Then, O king,\r\nin the conflict, with diverse fleet weapons I pierced by hundreds and by\r\nthousands (demons) bearing arms. And, O slayer of foes, seeing me thus\r\nrange the field putting forth every exertion, the heroic charioteer of\r\nSakra was well-pleased. And oppressed by those steeds and that car, some\r\n(of them) met with annihilation; and others desisted from fight; while\r\n(other) Nivata-Kavachas, challenged by us in battle and being harassed\r\nwith shafts offered opposition unto me, by (discharging) mighty showers\r\nof arrows. Thereupon, with hundreds and thousands of sundry fleet weapons\r\ninspired with the mantras relating to Brahma's weapons, I swiftly began\r\nto burn them. And being sore pressed by me, those mighty asuras waxing\r\nwroth afflicted me together, by pouring torrents of clubs and darts and\r\nswords. Then, O Bharata, I took up that favourite weapon of the lord of\r\nthe celestials, Maghavan by name, prime and of fiery energy and by the\r\nenergy of that weapon I cut into a thousand pieces the Tomaras, together\r\nwith the swords and the tridents hurled by them. And having cut off their\r\narms I in ire pierced them each with ten shafts. And in the field arrows\r\nwere shot from the Gandiva like unto rows of black-bees; and this Matali\r\nadmired. And their shafts also showered upon me; but those powerful\r\n(arrows) I cut off with my shafts. Then on being struck the\r\nNivata-Kavachas again covered me on all sides with a mighty shower of\r\narrows. And having neutralised the force of the arrows by excellent swift\r\nand flaming weapons capable of baffling arms, I pierced them by\r\nthousands. And blood began to flow from their torn frames, even as in the\r\nrainy season waters run down from the summits of mountains. And on being\r\nwounded by my fleet and straight-coursing shafts of the touch of Indra's\r\nthunder-bolt, they became greatly agitated. And their bodies were pierced\r\nat hundreds of places; and the force of their arms diminished. Then the\r\nNivata-Kavachas fought me by (the help of) illusion.'\""

And when the rocks had been reduced to powder, there\r\nwas generated fire; and the rocky dust fell like unto masses of flames.\r\nAnd when the showers of crags had been repelled, there happened near me a\r\nmightier shower of water, having currents of the proportions of an axle.\r\nAnd falling from the welkin, those thousands of powerful torrents covered\r\nthe entire firmament and the directions and the cardinal points. And on\r\naccount of the pouring of the shower, and of the blowing of the wind, and\r\nof roaring of the Daityas, nothing could be perceived. And touching\r\nheaven and the entire earth, and incessantly falling on the ground, the\r\nshowers bewildered me. Thereupon, I discharged that celestial weapon\r\nwhich I had learnt from Indra--even the dreadful and flaming Visoshana:\r\nand by that the water was dried up. And, O Bharata, when the rocky shower\r\nhad been destroyed, and the watery shower had been dried up, the Danavas\r\nbegan to spread illusions of fire and wind. Then by aqueous appliances I\r\nextinguished the flames; and by a mighty rock-issuing arm, resisted the\r\nfury of the winds. And when these had been repelled, the Danavas,\r\nirrepressible in battle, O foremost of the Bharata, simultaneously\r\ncreated various illusions. And there happened a tremendous horrifying\r\nshower of rocks and dreadful weapons of fire and wind. And that illusory\r\ndownpour afflicted me in fight. And then on all sides there appeared a\r\ndense and thick darkness. And when the world had been enveloped in deep\r\nand dense darkness, the steeds turned away, Matali fell off, and from his\r\nhand the golden lash fell to the earth. And, O foremost of the Bharatas,\r\nbeing frightened, he again and again cried, 'Where art thou?' And when he\r\nhad been stupefied, a terrible fear possessed me. And then in a hurry, he\r\nspake unto me, saying, 'O Partha, for the sake of nectar, there had taken\r\nplace a mighty conflict between the gods and the demons. I had seen that\r\n(encounter), O sinless one. And on the occasion of the destruction of\r\nSamvara, there had occurred a dreadful and mighty contest. Nevertheless I\r\nhad acted as charioteer to the lord of the celestials. In the same way,\r\non the occasion of the slaying of Vritra, the steeds had been conducted\r\nby me. And I had also beheld the high and terrific encounter with\r\nVirochana's son, and, O Pandava, with Vala, and with Prahrada and with\r\nothers also. In these exceedingly dreadful battles, I was present; but, O\r\nPandu's son, never (before) had I lost my senses. Surely the Great-father\r\nhath ordained the destruction of all creatures; for this battle cannot be\r\nfor any other purpose than destruction of the universe.' Having heard\r\nthese words of his, pacifying my perturbation by my own effort, I will\r\ndestroy the mighty energy of the illusion spread by the Danavas quoth I\r\nunto the terrified Matali. Behold the might of my arms, and the power of\r\nmy weapons and of the bow, Gandiva. To-day even by (the help of)\r\nillusion-creating arms, will I dispel this deep gloom and also this\r\nhorrible illusion of theirs. Do not fear, O charioteer. Pacify thyself.'\r\nHaving said this, O lord of men, I created for the good of the\r\ncelestials, an illusion of arms capable of bewildering all beings. And\r\nwhen (their) illusion had been dispelled, some of the foremost amongst\r\nthe Asuras, of unrivalled prowess, again spread diverse kinds of\r\nillusion. Thereupon, now (the world) displayed itself, and now it was\r\ndevoured by darkness; and now the world disappeared from view and now it\r\nwas submerged under water. And when it had brightened up. Matali, sitting\r\nin front of the car, with the wellconducted steeds, began to range that\r\nhair-erecting field. Then the fierce Nivata-Kavachas assailed me. And\r\nfinding my opportunity. I began to send them to the mansion of Yama.\r\nThereupon, in that conflict then raging, calculated to annihilate the\r\nNivata-Kavachas on a sudden, I could not see the Danavas concealed by\r\nillusion.\""

And the shafts duly discharged from the Gandiva,\r\nbegan to sever their heads at those different places where they were\r\nrespectively stationed. And thus assailed by me in the conflict, the\r\nNivata-Kavachas, all on a sudden withdrawing the illusion, entered into\r\ntheir own city. And when the Daityas had fled, and when all had become\r\nvisible, I there discovered hundreds and thousands of the slain. And\r\nthere I saw by hundreds their shivered weapons, ornaments, limbs, and\r\nmail. And the horses could not find room for moving from one place to\r\nanother; and on a sudden with a bound, they fell to coursing in the sky.\r\nThen remaining invisible, the Nivata-Kavachas covered the entire welkin\r\nwith masses of crags. And, O Bharata, other dreadful Danavas, entering\r\ninto the entrails of the earth, took up horses' legs and chariot-wheels.\r\nAnd as I was fighting, they, hard besetting my horses with rocks,\r\nattacked me together with (my) car. And with the crags that had fallen\r\nand with others that were falling, the place where I was, seemed to be a\r\nmountain cavern. And on myself being covered with crags and on the horses\r\nbeing hard pressed, I became sore distressed and this was marked by\r\nMatali. And on seeing me afraid, he said unto me, 'O Arjuna, Arjuna! be\r\nthou not afraid; send that weapon, the thunder-bolt, O lord of men.'\r\nHearing those words of his, I then discharged the favourite weapon of the\r\nking of the celestials--the dreadful thunderbolt. And inspiring the\r\nGandiva with mantras, I, aiming at the locality of the crags, shot\r\nsharpened iron shafts of the touch of the thunder-bolt. And sent by the\r\nthunder, those adamantine arrows entered into all those illusions and\r\ninto the midst of those Nivata-Kavachas. And slaughtered by the vehemence\r\nof the thunder, those Danavas resembling cliffs, fell to the earth\r\ntogether in masses. And entering amongst those Danavas that had carried\r\naway the steeds of the car into the interior of the earth, the shafts\r\nsent them into the mansion of Yama. And that quarter was completely\r\ncovered with the Nivata-Kavachas that had been killed or baffled,\r\ncomparable unto cliffs and lying scattered like crags. And then no injury\r\nappeared to have been sustained either by the horses, or by the car, or\r\nby Matali, or by me, and this seemed strange. Then, O king, Matali\r\naddressed me smiling, 'Not in the celestials themselves, O Arjuna, is\r\nseen the prowess that is seen in thee. And when the Danava hosts had been\r\ndestroyed, all their females began to bewail in that city, like unto\r\ncranes in autumn. Then with Matali I entered that city, terrifying with\r\nthe rattling of my car the wives of the Nivata-Kavachas. Thereupon,\r\nseeing those ten thousand horses like unto peacocks (in hue), and also\r\nthat chariot resembling the sun, the women fled in swarms. And like unto\r\n(the sounds of) rocks falling on a mountain, sounds arose of the\r\n(falling) ornaments of the terrified dames. (At length), the\r\npanic-stricken wives of the Daityas entered into their respective golden\r\nplaces variegated with innumerable jewels.\r\n\r\n'Beholding that excellent city, superior to the city of the celestials\r\nthemselves, I asked Matali, saying, 'Why do not the celestials reside in\r\nsuch (a place)? Surely, this appeareth superior to the city of\r\nPurandara.' Thereat, Matali said, 'In days of yore, O Partha, even this\r\nwas the city of our lord of the celestials. Afterwards the celestials\r\nwere driven from hence by the Nivata-Kavachas. Having performed the most\r\nrigid austerities, they had gratified the Grand-father and had asked (and\r\nobtained) the boons--namely, that they might reside here, and that they\r\nmight be free from danger in wars with the gods.' Then Sakra addressed\r\nthe self-create lord saying, 'Do thou, O lord, desirous of our own\r\nwelfare do what is proper.' Thereupon, O Bharata, in this matter the Lord\r\ncommanded (Indra), saying, 'O slayer of foes, in another body, even thou\r\nshalt be (the destroyer of the Danavas).' Then, in order to slaughter\r\nthem, Sakra rendered unto thee those weapons. The gods had been unable to\r\nslay these, who have been slain by thee. O Bharata, in the fullness of\r\ntime, hadst thou come hither, in order to destroy them and thou hast done\r\nso. O foremost of men, with the object that the demons might be killed,\r\nMahendra had conferred on thee the excellent prime energy of these\r\nweapons.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna continued, 'After having destroyed the Danavas, and also subdued\r\nthat city, with Matali I again went to that abode of the celestials.'\""

And that city contained various trees composed of gems, and\r\nsweet-voiced feathered ones. And furnished with four gates, and\r\ngate-ways, and towers, that impregnable (city) was inhabited by the\r\nPaulamas and Kalakanjas. And it was made of all sorts of jewels and was\r\nunearthly, and of wonderful appearance. And it was covered with trees of\r\nall kinds of gems, bearing fruits and flowers. And it contained\r\nexceedingly beautiful unearthly birds. And it always swarmed throughout\r\nwith cheerful Asuras, wearing garlands, and bearing in their hands darts,\r\ntwo edged swords, maces, bows, and clubs. And, O king, on seeing this\r\nwonderful city of the Daityas, I asked Matali saying, 'What is this that\r\nlooketh so wonderful?' Thereat, Matali replied, 'Once on a time a\r\nDaitya's daughter, named Pulama and a mighty female of the Asura order,\r\nKalaka by name, practised severe austerities for a thousand celestial\r\nyears. And at the end of their austerities, the self-create conferred on\r\nthem boons. And, O king of kings, they received these boons,--that their\r\noffspring might never suffer misfortune; that they might be incapable of\r\nbeing destroyed even by the gods, the Rakshasas and the Pannagas; and\r\nthat they might obtain a highly effulgent and surpassingly fair aerial\r\ncity, furnished with all manner of gems and invincible even by the\r\ncelestials, the Maharshis, the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, the Pannagas, the\r\nAsuras and the Rakshasas. O best of the Bharatas, this is that unearthly\r\naerial city devoid of the celestials, which is moving about, having been\r\ncreated for the Kalakeyas, by Brahma himself. And this city is furnished\r\nwith all desirable objects, and is unknown of grief or disease. And, O\r\nhero, celebrated under the name of Hiranyapura, this mighty city is\r\ninhabited by the Paulamas and the Kalakanjas; and it is also guarded by\r\nthose mighty Asuras. And, O king, unslayed by any of the gods, there they\r\ndwell cheerfully, free from anxiety and having all their desires\r\ngratified, O foremost of kings. Formerly, Brahma had destined destruction\r\nat the hands of mortals. Do thou, O Partha, in fight, compass with that\r\nweapon--the thunder-bolt--the destruction of the mighty and irrepressible\r\nKalakanjas.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna continued, 'O lord of men, learning that they were incapable of\r\nbeing destroyed by the celestials and the Asuras, I cheerfully said unto\r\nMatali, 'Do thou speedily repair into yonder city. With weapons will I\r\ncompass the annihilation of the haters of the lord of the celestials.\r\nSurely, there exist no wicked haters of the gods who ought not to be\r\nslain by me.' Thereupon Matali took me to the vicinity of Hiranyapura on\r\nthe celestial chariot yoked with steeds. And seeing me, those sons of\r\nDiti, wearing various kinds of attire and ornament and accoutred in mail,\r\nflew at me with a mighty rush. And those foremost of the Danavas, of\r\nexceeding prowess, in wrath attacked me with arrows and bhallas and clubs\r\nand two-edged swords, and tomaras. Thereat, O king, resorting to my\r\nstrength of lore, I resisted that great volley of weapons by a mighty\r\nshower of shafts; and also confounded them in conflict by ranging around\r\nin my car. And being bewildered, the Danavas began to push each other\r\ndown. And having been confounded, they rushed at one another. And with\r\nflaming arrows, I severed their heads by hundreds. And hard pressed by\r\nme, the offspring of Diti, taking shelter within (their) city, soared\r\nwith it to the firmament, resorting to the illusion proper to the\r\nDanavas. Thereupon, O son of the Kurus, covering the way of the Daityas,\r\nwith a mighty discharge of shafts I obstructed their course. Then by\r\nvirtue of the bestowal of the boon, the Daityas supported themselves\r\neasily on that sky-ranging unearthly aerial city, going anywhere at will\r\nand like unto the sun. And now (the city) entered unto the earth and now\r\nit rose upwards; and at one time it went in a crooked way and at another\r\ntime it submerged into water. At this, O represser of foes, I assailed\r\nthat mighty city, going anywhere at will, and resembling Amaravati. And,\r\nO best of the Bharatas, I attacked the city containing those sons of\r\nDiti, with multitudes of shafts, displaying celestial weapons. And\r\nbattered and broken by the straight-coursing iron shafts, shot by me, the\r\ncity of the Asuras, O king, fell to the earth. And they also, wounded by\r\nmy iron arrows having the speed of the thunder, began, O monarch, to go\r\nabout, being urged by destiny. Then ascending to the sky, Matali, as if\r\nfalling in front, swiftly descended to the earth, on that chariot of\r\nsolar resplendence. Then, O Bharata, environed me sixty thousand cars\r\nbelonging to those wrathful ones eager to battle with me. And with\r\nsharpened shafts graced with feathers of the vulture, I destroyed those\r\n(cars). At this, thinking, 'These our hosts are incapable of being\r\nvanquished by mortals, they became engaged in the conflict, like unto the\r\nsurges of the sea.' Thereupon I gradually began to fix (on the string)\r\nunearthly weapons. At this, thousands of weapons (shot) by those\r\nwonderfully warring charioteers, by degrees opposed my unearthly arms and\r\nin the field I saw hundreds and thousands of mighty (demons) ranging on\r\ntheir cars, in various manoeuvres. And being furnished with variegated\r\nmail and standards and diverse ornaments, they delighted my mind. And in\r\nthe conflict I could not afflict them by showers of shafts, but they did\r\nnot afflict me. And being afflicted by those innumerable ones, equipped\r\nin weapons and skilled in fight, I was pained in that mighty encounter\r\nand a terrible fear seized me. Thereupon collecting (my energies) in\r\nfight, I (bowed down) unto that god of gods, Raudra, and saying, 'May\r\nwelfare attend on all beings!' I fixed that mighty weapon which,\r\ncelebrated under the name of Raudra, is the destroyer of all foes. Then I\r\nbeheld a male person having three heads, nine eyes, three faces, and six\r\narms. And his hair was flaming like fire or the sun. And, O slayer of\r\nfoes, for his dress, he had mighty serpents, putting out their tongues.\r\nAnd saying, O best of the Bharatas, the dreadful and eternal Raudra, I\r\nbeing free from fear, set it on the Gandiva; and, bowing unto the\r\nthree-eyed Sarva of immeasurable energy, let go (the weapon), with the\r\nobject of vanquishing those foremost of the Danavas, O Bharata. And, O\r\nlord of men, as soon as it had been hurled, there appeared on the scene\r\nby thousands, forms of deer, and of lions, and of tigers, and of bears\r\nand of buffaloes, and of serpents, and of kine, and of sarabhas, and of\r\nelephants, and of apes in multitudes, and of bulls, and of boars, and of\r\ncats, and of dogs, and of spectres, and of all the Bhurundas, and of\r\nvultures, and of Garudas, of chamaras, and of all the leopards, and of\r\nmountains, and of seas, and of celestials, and of sages, and of all the\r\nGandharvas, and of ghosts with the Yakshas, and of the haters of the\r\ngods, (Asuras), and of the Guhyakas in the field, and of the Nairitas and\r\nof elephant-mouthed sharks, and of owls, and of beings having the forms\r\nof fishes and horses, and of beings bearing swords and various other\r\nweapons, and of Rakshasas wielding maces and clubs. And on that weapon\r\nbeing hurled all the universe became filled with these as well as many\r\nothers wearing various shapes. And again and again wounded by beings of\r\nvarious sights with (pieces of) flesh, fat, bones, and marrow on their\r\npersons,--some having three heads, and some four tusks, and some four\r\nmouths, and some four arms,--the Danavas met with destruction. And, then,\r\nO Bharata, in a moment I slew all those Danavas, with other swarms of\r\narrows composed of the quintessence of stone, flaming like fire or the\r\nsun, and possessed of the force of the thunder-bolt. And, seeing them\r\nhewn by the Gandiva, and deprived of life, and thrown from the sky, I\r\nagain bowed unto that god--the Destroyer of Tripura. And, seeing those\r\nadorned with unearthly ornaments, crushed by the weapon, the Raudra, the\r\ncharioteer of the celestials, experienced the greatest delight. And\r\nhaving witnessed the accomplishment of that unbearable feat incapable of\r\nbeing achieved even by the celestials themselves, Matali, the charioteer\r\nof Sakra, paid homage unto me; and well-pleased, with joint hands said\r\nthese words. 'The feat that hath been achieved by thee, is incapable of\r\nbeing borne even by the gods, nay,--in battle, the lord of the celestials\r\nhimself cannot perform this deed. The sky-coursing mighty city incapable\r\nof being destroyed by the gods and the Asuras hast thou, O hero, crushed\r\nby thy own prowess and by the energy of asceticism. And when that aerial\r\ncity had been destroyed, and when the Danavas also had been slain, their\r\nwives, uttering cries of distress, like unto Kurari birds, with hair\r\ndishevelled came out of the city. And bewailing for their sons and\r\nbrothers and fathers, they fell on the ground and cried with distressful\r\naccents. And on being deprived for their lords, they beat their breasts,\r\ntheir garlands and ornaments fallen off. And that city of Danavas, in\r\nappearance like unto the city of the Gandharvas filled with lamentations\r\nand stricken with dole and distress, and bereft of grace even like unto a\r\nlake deprived of (its) elephants, or like unto a forest deprived of trees\r\nand (deprived of its) masters, looked no longer beautiful--but it\r\nvanished, like a cloud-constructed city. And when I had accomplished the\r\ntask, eftsoons from the field Matali took me of delighted spirits, unto\r\nthe abode of the lord of the celestials. And having slain those mighty\r\nAsuras, and destroyed Hiranyapura, and having also killed the\r\nNivata-Kavachas, I came unto Indra. And, O exceedingly resplendent one,\r\nas it had fallen out, Matali related in detail unto Devendra that entire\r\nachievement of mine. And with the Marutas, hearing of the destruction of\r\nHiranyapura, of the neutralisation of the illusion, and of the slaughter\r\nof the highly powerful Nivatakavachas in fight, the prosperous\r\nthousand-eyed divine Purandara was well pleased, and exclaimed, 'Well\r\ndone; Well done!' And the king of the celestials together with the\r\ncelestials, cheering me again and again, said these sweet words, 'By thee\r\nhath been achieved a feat incapable of being achieved by the gods and the\r\nAsuras. And, O Partha, by slaying my mighty enemies, thou hast paid the\r\npreceptor's fee. And, O Dhananjaya, thus in battle shalt thou always\r\nremain calm, and discharge the weapons unerringly, and there shall not\r\nstand thee in fight celestials, and Danavas, and Rakshasas, and Yakshas,\r\nand Asuras, and Gandharvas and birds and serpents. And, O Kaunteya, by\r\nconquering it even by the might of thy arms, Kunti's son Yudhishthira,\r\nwill rule the earth.'\""

And, O Janamejaya, the\r\ncreatures peopling the interior of the earth, on being afflicted, rose\r\nand surrounded the Pandava, trembling with joined hands and contorted\r\ncountenances.

This that thou art\r\nreceiving from Kuvera, thou wilt, O foremost of men, be able to attain\r\nany time. Now, O Bharata, turn thy mind towards the punishment and\r\ndestruction of foes that committed wrongs. O king, the wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt himself is incapable of standing thy prowess. And intent upon\r\nthy welfare, he, having Suparna for his mark (Krishna), and also the\r\ngrandson of Sini (Satyaki) never experience pain, even when engaged in\r\nencounter with the gods, O Dharmaraja.

But afterwards on beholding Kuvera's favourite mountain,\r\nKailasa, appearing like clouds, the delight of those pre-eminent heroes\r\nof the race of Bharata, became very great. And those foremost of heroic\r\nmen, equipped with scimitars and bows, proceeded contentedly, beholding\r\nelevations and defiles, and dens of lions and craggy causeways and\r\ninnumerable water-falls and lowlands, in different places, as also other\r\ngreat forests inhabited by countless deer and birds and elephants. And\r\nthey came upon beautiful woodlands and rivers and lakes and caves and\r\nmountain caverns; and these frequently by day and night became the\r\ndwelling place of those great men.

Then all those warriors having in due course happily lived at\r\nBadari for one month, proceeded towards the realm of Suvahu, king of the\r\nKiratas, by following the same track by which they had come.

Then taking all the chariots and\r\nchariot-men and dismissing Ghatotkacha together with his followers, they\r\nnext repaired to the monarch of mountains in the vicinity of the Yamuna.\r\nIn the midst of the mountain abounding in waterfalls and having grey and\r\norange-coloured slopes and summits covered with a sheet of snow, those\r\nwarlike men having then found the great forest of Visakhayupa like unto\r\nthe forest of Chitraratha and inhabited by wild boars and various kinds\r\nof deer and birds, made it their home. Addicted to hunting as their chief\r\noccupation, the sons of Pritha peacefully dwelt in that forest for one\r\nyear.

In that\r\nforest the famous and mighty Bhimasena, possessing the strength of a\r\nhundred elephants, killed (many) large wild boars, with the force (of his\r\narms). And endowed with terrible prowess and mighty strength, and\r\npowerful as the lion or the tiger, and capable of resisting a hundred\r\nmen, and having long arms, and possessing the strength of a hundred\r\nelephants, he killed many antelopes and wild boars and buffaloes. And\r\nhere and there, in that forest he pulled out trees by the roots, with\r\ngreat violence and broke them too, causing the earth and the woods and\r\nthe (surrounding) places to resound. And then shouting and trampling on\r\nthe tops of mountains, and causing the earth to resound with his roars,\r\nand striking his arms, and uttering his war-cry, and slapping and\r\nclapping his hands, Bhimasena, exempt from decay, and ever-proud and\r\nwithout fear, again and again leaped about in those woods. And on hearing\r\nthe shouts of Bhimasena, powerful lions and elephants of huge strength,\r\nleft their lairs in fright. And in that same forest, he fearlessly\r\nstrolled about in search of game; and like the denizens of the woods,\r\nthat most valiant of men, the mighty Bhimasena, wandered on foot in that\r\nforest. And he penetrated the vast forest, shouting strange whoopos, and\r\nterrifying all creatures, endowed with strength and prowess. And then\r\nbeing terrified, the snakes hid (themselves) in caves, but he, overtaking\r\nthem with promptitude, pursued them slowly. Then the mighty Bhimasena,\r\nlike unto the Lord of the Celestials, saw a serpent of colossal\r\nproportions, living in one of the mountain fastnesses and covering the\r\n(entire) cave with its body and causing one's hair to stand on end (from\r\nfright). It had its huge body stretched like a hillock, and it possessed\r\ngigantic strength, and its body was speckled with spots and it had a\r\nturmeric-like (yellow) colour and a deep copper-coloured mouth of the\r\nform of a cave supplied with four teeth; and with glaring eyes, it was\r\nconstantly licking the corners of its mouth. And it was the terror of all\r\nanimated beings and it looked like the very image of the Destroyer Yama;\r\nand with the hissing noise of its breath it lay as if rebuking (an\r\nin-comer). And seeing Bhima draw so near to him, the serpent, all on a\r\nsudden, became greatly enraged, and that goat-devouring snake violently\r\nseized Bhimasena in his grip. Then by virtue of the boon that had been\r\nreceived by the serpent, Bhimasena with his body in the serpent's grip,\r\ninstantly lost all consciousness. Unrivalled by that of others, the might\r\nof Bhimasena's arms equalled the might of ten thousand elephants\r\ncombined. But Bhima, of great prowess, being thus vanquished by the\r\nsnake, trembled slowly, and was unable to exert himself. And that one of\r\nmighty arms and of leonine shoulders, though possessed of strength often\r\nthousand elephants, yet seized by the snake, and overpowered by virtue of\r\nthe boon, lost all strength.

Hear, O best of the\r\npious, I have fallen into this plight on account of the wrath of the\r\nMaharhis. Now desirous of getting rid of the curse, I will narrate unto\r\nthee all about it. Thou hast, no doubt, heard of the royal sage, Nahusha.\r\nHe was the son of Ayu, and the perpetuator of the line of thy ancestors.\r\nEven I am that one. For having affronted the Brahmanas I, by (virtue of)\r\nAgastya's malediction, have come by this condition. Thou art my agnate,\r\nand lovely to behold,--so thou shouldst not be slain by me,--yet I shall\r\nto-day devour thee! Do thou behold the dispensation of Destiny! And be it\r\na buffalo, or an elephant, none coming within my reach at the sixth\r\ndivision of the day, can, O best of men, escape. And, O best of the\r\nKurus, thou hast not been taken by an animal of the lower order, having\r\nstrength alone,--but this (hath been so) by reason only of the boon I\r\nhave received. As I was falling rapidly from Sakra's throne placed on the\r\nfront of his palace, I spake unto that worshipful sage (Agastya), 'Do\r\nthou free me from this curse.' Thereat filled with compassion, that\r\nenergetic one said unto me, 'O king, thou shall be freed after the lapse\r\nof some time.' Then I fell to the earth (as a snake); but my recollection\r\n(of former life) did not renounce me. And although it be so ancient, I\r\nstill recollect all that was said. And the sage said unto me, That person\r\nwho conversant with the relation subsisting between the soul and the\r\nSupreme Being, shall be able to answer the questions put by thee, shall\r\ndeliver thee. And, O king, taken by thee, strong beings superior to thee,\r\nshall immediately lose their strength, I heard these words of those\r\ncompassionate ones, who felt attached unto me. And then the Brahmanas\r\nvanished. Thus, O highly effulgent one, having become a serpent, I, doing\r\nexceedingly sinful acts, live in unclean hell, in expectation of the\r\n(appointed) time.' The mighty-armed Bhimasena addressed the serpent,\r\nsaying, 'I am not angry, O mighty snake,--nor do I blame myself. Since in\r\nregard to happiness and misery, men sometimes possess the power of\r\nbringing and dismissing them, and sometimes do not. Therefore one should\r\nnot fret one's mind. Who can baffle destiny by self-exertion? I deem\r\ndestiny to be supreme, and self-exertion to be of no avail. Smitten with\r\nthe stroke of destiny, the prowess of my arms lost, behold me to-day\r\nfallen unto this condition without palpable cause. But to-day I do not so\r\nmuch grieve for my own self being slain, as I do for my brothers deprived\r\nof their kingdom, and exiled into the forest. This Himalaya is\r\ninaccessible, and abounds with Yakshas and the Rakshasas, And searching\r\nabout for me, they will be distracted. And hearing that I have been\r\nkilled, (my brothers) will forego all exertion, for, firm in promise,\r\nthey have hitherto been controlled by my harsh speech, I being desirous\r\nof gaining the kingdom. Or the intelligent Arjuna (alone), being versed\r\nin every lore, and incapable of being overcome by gods and Rakshasas and\r\nGandharvas, will not be afflicted with grief. That mighty-armed and\r\nexceedingly powerful one is able single-handed to speedily pull down from\r\nhis place even the celestials. What shall I say of the deceitfully\r\ngambling son of Dhritarashtra, detested of all men, and filled with\r\nhaughtiness and ignorance! And I also grieve for my poor mother,\r\naffectionate to her sons, who is ever solicitous for our greatness in a\r\nlarge measure than is attained by our enemies. O serpent, the desire that\r\nforlorn one had in me will all be fruitless in consequence of my\r\ndestruction. And gifted with manliness, the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva,\r\nfollowing their elder brother (me), and always protected by the strength\r\nof my arms, will, owing to my destruction, be depressed and deprived of\r\ntheir prowess, and stricken with grief. This is what I think.' In this\r\nway Vrikodara lamented profusely. And being bound by the body of the\r\nsnake, he could not exert himself.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, (seeing) and reflecting on\r\ndreadful ill omens, became alarmed. Terrified by the blaze of the points\r\nof the horizon, jackals stationing themselves on the right of that\r\nhermitage, set up frightful and inauspicious yells. And ugly Vartikas as\r\nof dreadful sight, having one wing, one eye, and one leg, were seen to\r\nvomit blood, facing the sun. And the wind began to blow dryly, and\r\nviolently, attracting grits. And to the right all the beasts and birds\r\nbegan to cry. And in the rear the black crows cried, 'Go!' 'Go!' And\r\nmomentarily his (Yudhishthira's) right arm began to twitch, and his chest\r\nand left leg shook (of themselves). And indicating evil his left eye\r\ncontracted spasmodically. Thereupon, O Bharata, the intelligent\r\nYudhishthira the just, inferring some great calamity (to be imminent),\r\nasked Draupadi, saying, 'Where is Bhima?' Thereat Panchali said that\r\nVrikodara had long gone out. Hearing this, that mighty-armed king set out\r\nwith Dhaumya, after having said unto Dhananjaya, \"Thou shouldst protect\r\nDraupadi.' And he also directed Nakula and Sahadeva to protect the\r\nBrahmanas. And issuing from the hermitage that lord, Kunti's son,\r\nfollowing the footprints of Bhimasena, began to search for him in that\r\nmighty forest. And on coming to the east, he found mighty leaders of\r\nelephant-herds (slain) and saw the earth marked with Bhima's\r\n(foot-prints). Then seeing thousands of deer and hundreds of lions lying\r\nin the forest, the king ascertained his course. And on the way were\r\nscattered trees pulled down by the wind caused by the thighs of that hero\r\nendued with the speed of the wind as he rushed after the deer. And\r\nproceeding, guided by those marks, to a spot filled with dry winds and\r\nabounding in leafless vegetables, brackish and devoid of water, covered\r\nwith thorny plants and scattered over with gravel, stumps and shrubs and\r\ndifficult of access and uneven and dangerous, he saw in a mountain cavern\r\nhis younger brother motionless, caught in the folds of that foremost of\r\nsnakes.\""

And who is this best of serpents having a\r\nbody like unto a mountain mass?' Bhimasena said, 'O worshipful one, this\r\nmighty being hath caught me for food. He is the royal sage Nahusha living\r\nin the form of a serpent.' Yudhishthira said, 'O longlived one, do thou\r\nfree my brother of immeasurable prowess; we will give thee some other\r\nfood which will appease thy hunger.' The serpent said, 'I have got for\r\ndiet even this son of a king, come to my mouth of himself. Do thou go\r\naway. Thou shouldst not stay here. (If thou remainest here) thou too\r\nshall be my fare to-morrow. O mighty-armed one, this is ordained in\r\nrespect of me, that he that cometh unto my place, becometh my food and\r\nthou too art in my quarter. After a long time have I got thy younger\r\nbrother as my food; I will not let him off; neither do I like to have any\r\nother food.' Thereat Yudhishthira said, 'O serpent, whether thou art a\r\ngod, or a demon, or an Uraga, do thou tell me truly, it is Yudhishthira\r\nthat asketh thee, wherefore, O snake, hast thou taken Bhimasena? By\r\nobtaining which, or by knowing what wilt thou receive satisfaction, O\r\nsnake, and what food shall I give thee? And how mayst thou free him.' The\r\nserpent said, 'O sinless one, I was thy ancestor, the son of Ayu and\r\nfifth in descent from the Moon. And I was a king celebrated under the\r\nname of Nahusha. And by sacrifices and asceticism and study of the Vedas\r\nand self-restraint and prowess I had acquired a permanent dominion over\r\nthe three worlds. And when I had obtained such dominion, haughtiness\r\npossessed me. And thousands of Brahmanas were engaged in carrying my\r\nchair. And intoxicated by supremacy, I insulted those Brahmanas. And, O\r\nlord of the earth, by Agastya have I been reduced to this pass! Yet, O\r\nPandava, to this day the memory (of my former birth) hath not forsaken\r\nme! And, O king, even by the favour of that high-souled Agastya, during\r\nthe sixth division of the day have I got for meal thy younger brother.\r\nNeither will I set him free, nor do I wish for any other food. But if\r\nto-day thou answerest the questions put by me, then, I shall deliver\r\nVrikodara!\" At this Yudhishthira said, 'O serpent, ask whatever thou\r\nlistest! I shall, if I can, answer thy questions with the view of\r\ngratifying thee, O snake! Thou knowest fully what should be known by\r\nBrahmanas. Therefore, O king of snakes, hearing (thee) I shall answer thy\r\nqueries!'\r\n\r\nThe serpent said, 'O Yudhishthira, say--Who is a Brahmana and what should\r\nbe known? By thy speech I infer thee to be highly intelligent.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost of serpents, he, it is asserted by the\r\nwise, in whom are seen truth, charity, forgiveness, good conduct,\r\nbenevolence, observance of the rites of his order and mercy is a\r\nBrahmana. And, O serpent, that which should be known is even the supreme\r\nBrahma, in which is neither happiness nor misery--and attaining which\r\nbeings are not affected with misery; what is thy opinion?'\r\n\r\n\"The serpent said, 'O Yudhishthira, truth, charity, forgiveness,\r\nbenevolence, benignity, kindness and the Veda[42] which worketh the\r\nbenefit of the four orders, which is the authority in matters of religion\r\nand which is true, are seen even in the Sudra. As regards the object to\r\nbe known and which thou allegest is without both happiness and misery, I\r\ndo not see any such that is devoid of these.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, Those characteristics that are present in a Sudra, do\r\nnot exist in a Brahmana; nor do those that are in a Brahmana exist in a\r\nSudra. And a Sudra is not a Sudra by birth alone--nor a Brahmana is\r\nBrahmana by birth alone. He, it is said by the wise, in whom are seen\r\nthose virtues is a Brahmana. And people term him a Sudra in whom those\r\nqualities do not exist, even though he be a Brahmana by birth. And again,\r\nas for thy assertion that the object to be known (as asserted by me) doth\r\nnot exist, because nothing exists that is devoid of both (happiness and\r\nmisery), such indeed is the opinion, O serpent, that nothing exists that\r\nis without (them) both. But as in cold, heat doth not exist, nor in heat,\r\ncold, so there cannot exist an object in which both (happiness and\r\nmisery) cannot exist?\"\r\n\r\n\"The serpent said, 'O king, if thou recognise him as a Brahmana by\r\ncharacteristics, then, O long-lived one, the distinction of caste\r\nbecometh futile as long as conduct doth not come into play.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'In human society, O mighty and highly intelligent\r\nserpent, it is difficult to ascertain one's caste, because of promiscuous\r\nintercourse among the four orders. This is my opinion. Men belonging to\r\nall orders (promiscuously) beget offspring upon women of all the orders.\r\nAnd of men, speech, sexual intercourse, birth and death are common. And\r\nto this the Rishis have borne testimony by using as the beginning of a\r\nsacrifice such expressions as--of what caste so ever we may be, we\r\ncelebrate the sacrifice. Therefore, those that are wise have asserted\r\nthat character is the chief essential requisite. The natal ceremony of a\r\nperson is performed before division of the umbilical cord. His mother\r\nthen acts as its Savitri and his father officiates as priest. He is\r\nconsidered as a Sudra as long as he is not initiated in the Vedas. Doubts\r\nhaving arisen on this point, O prince; of serpents, Swayambhuba Manu has\r\ndeclared, that the mixed castes are to be regarded as better than the\r\n(other) classes, if having gone through the ceremonies of purification,\r\nthe latter do not conform to the rules of good conduct, O excellent\r\nsnake! Whosoever now conforms to the rules of pure and virtuous conduct,\r\nhim have I, ere now, designated as a Brahmana.' The serpent replied, 'O\r\nYudhishthira, thou art acquainted with all that is fit to be known and\r\nhaving listened to thy words, how can I (now) eat up thy brother\r\nVrikodara!\""

      "content": "\"Yudhishthira said, 'In this world, you are so learned in the Vedas and\r\nVedangas; tell me (then), what one should do to attain salvation?'\r\n\r\n\"The serpent replied, 'O scion of the Bharata's race, my belief is that\r\nthe man who bestows alms on proper objects, speaks kind words and tells\r\nthe truth and abstains from doing injury to any creature goes to heaven.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira enquired, 'Which, O snake, is the higher of the two, truth\r\nor alms-giving? Tell me also the greater or less importance of kind\r\nbehaviour and of doing injury to no creature.'\r\n\r\n\"The snake replied, 'The relative merits of these virtues, truth and\r\nalms-giving, kind speech and abstention from injury to any creature, are\r\nknown (measured) by their objective gravity (utility). Truth is\r\n(sometimes) more praiseworthy than some acts of charity; some of the\r\nlatter again are more commendable than true speech. Similarly, O mighty\r\nking, and lord of the earth, abstention from doing injury to any creature\r\nis seen to be important than good speech and vice-versa. Even so it is, O\r\nking, depending on effects. And now, if thou hast anything else to ask,\r\nsay it all, I shall enlighten thee!' Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O\r\nsnake, how the incorporal being's translation to heaven, its perception\r\nby the senses and its enjoyment of the immutable fruits of its actions\r\n(here below), can be comprehended.' The snake replied, 'By his own acts,\r\nman is seen to attain to one of the three conditions of human existence,\r\nof heavenly life, or of birth in the lower animal kingdom. Among these,\r\nthe man who is not slothful, who injures no one and who is endowed with\r\ncharity and other virtues, goes to heaven, after leaving this world of\r\nmen. By doing the very contrary, O king, people are again born as men or\r\nas lower animals. O my son, it is particularly said in this connection,\r\nthat the man who is swayed by anger and lust and who is given to avarice\r\nand malice falls away from his human state and is born again as a lower\r\nanimal, and the lower animals too are ordained to be transformed into the\r\nhuman state; and the cow, the horse and other animals are observed to\r\nattain to even the divine state.'[43] O my son, the sentient being,\r\nreaping the fruits of his actions, thus transmigrates through these\r\nconditions; but the regenerate and wise man reposes his soul in the\r\neverlasting Supreme Spirit. The embodied spirit, enchained by destiny and\r\nreaping the fruits of its own actions, thus undergoes birth after birth\r\nbut he that has lost touch of his actions, is conscious of the immutable\r\ndestiny of all born beings.[44]\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira asked, 'O snake, tell me truly and without confusion how\r\nthat dissociated spirit becomes cognisant of sound, touch, form, flavour,\r\nand taste. O great-minded one, dost thou not perceive them,\r\nsimultaneously by the senses? Do thou, O best of snakes, answer all these\r\nqueries!' The snake replied, 'O long-lived one, the thing called Atman\r\n(spirit), betaking itself to corporeal tenement and manifesting itself\r\nthrough the organs of sense, becomes duly cognisant of perceptible\r\nobjects. O prince of Bharata's race, know that the senses, the mind, and\r\nthe intellect, assisting the soul in its perception of objects, are\r\ncalled Karanas. O my son, the eternal spirit, going out of its sphere,\r\nand aided by the mind, acting through the senses, the receptacles of all\r\nperceptions, successively perceives these things (sound, form, flavour,\r\n&c). O most valiant of men, the mind of living creatures is the cause of\r\nall perception, and, therefore, it cannot be cognisant of more than one\r\nthing at a time. That spirit, O foremost of men, betaking itself to the\r\nspace between the eyebrows, sends the high and low intellect to different\r\nobjects. What the Yogins perceive after the action of the intelligent\r\nprinciple by that is manifested the action of the soul.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me the distinguishing characteristics of the\r\nmind and the intellect. The knowledge of it is ordained as the chief duty\r\nof persons meditating on the Supreme Spirit.'\r\n\r\n\"The snake replied, 'Through illusion, the soul becomes subservient to\r\nthe intellect. The intellect, though known to be subservient to the soul,\r\nbecomes (then) the director of the latter. The intellect is brought into\r\nplay by acts of perception; the mind is self-existent. The Intellect does\r\nnot cause the sensation (as of pain, pleasure, &c), but the mind does.\r\nThis, my son, is the difference between the mind and the intellect. You\r\ntoo are learned in this matter, what is your opinion?'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O most intelligent one, you have fine intelligence\r\nand you know all that is fit to be known. Why do you ask me that\r\nquestion? You knew all and you performed such wonderful deeds and you\r\nlived in heaven. How could then illusion overpower you? Great is my doubt\r\non this point.' The snake replied, 'Prosperity intoxicates even the wise\r\nand valiant men. Those who live in luxury, (soon) lose their reason. So,\r\nI too, O Yudhishthira, overpowered by the infatuation of prosperity, have\r\nfallen from my high state and having recovered my self-consciousness, am\r\nenlightening thee thus! O victorious king, thou hast done me a good turn.\r\nBy conversing with thy pious self, my painful curse has been expiated. In\r\ndays of yore, while I used to sojourn in heaven in a celestial chariot,\r\nrevelling in my pride, I did not think of anything else, I used to exact\r\ntribute from Brahmarshis, Devas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Pannagas\r\nand all other dwellers of the three worlds. O lord of earth, such was the\r\nspell of my eyes, that on whatever creature, I fixed them, I instantly\r\ndestroyed his power. Thousands of Brahmarshis used to draw my chariot.\r\nThe delinquency, O king, was the cause of my fall from my high\r\nprosperity. Among them, Agastya was one day drawing my conveyance, and my\r\nfeet came in contact with his body; Agastya then pronounced (this curse)\r\non me, in anger, 'Ruin seize thee, do thou become a snake.' So, losing my\r\nglory, I fell down from that excellent car and while falling, I beheld\r\nmyself turned into a snake, with head downwards. I thus implored that\r\nBrahmana, 'May this curse be extinguished, O adorable one! You ought to\r\nforgive one who has been so foolish from infatuation.' Then he kindly\r\ntold me this, as I was being hurled down (from heaven), \"The virtuous\r\nking Yudhishthira will save thee from this curse, and when, O king,\r\nhorrible sin of pride will be extinguished in thee; thou shalt attain\r\nsalvation.' And I was struck with wonder on seeing (this) power of his\r\naustere virtues; and therefore, have I questioned thee about the\r\nattributes of the Supreme Spirit and of Brahmanas. Truth, charity,\r\nself-restraint, penance, abstention from doing injury to any creature,\r\nand constancy in virtue, these, O king, and not his race of family\r\nconnections, are the means, by which a man must always secure salvation.\r\nMay this brother of thine, the mighty Bhimasena, meet with good luck and\r\nmay happiness abide with thee! I must go to Heaven again.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"So saying, that king, Nahusha, quitted his\r\nserpentine form, and assuming his celestial shape he went back to Heaven.\r\nThe glorious and pious Yudhishthira, too, returned to his hermitage with\r\nDhaumya and his brother Bhima. Then the virtuous Yudhishthira narrated\r\nall that, in detail, to the Brahmanas who had assembled (there). On\r\nhearing that, his three brothers and all the Brahmanas and the renowned\r\nDraupadi too were covered with shame. And all those excellent Brahmanas\r\ndesiring the welfare of the Pandavas, admonished Bhima for his\r\nfoolhardiness, telling him not to attempt such things again, and the\r\nPandavas too were greatly pleased at seeing the mighty Bhima out of\r\ndanger, and continued to live there pleasantly.\""

Then the black clouds, rumbling\r\nloudly, and covering the heavens and the cardinal points, ceaselessly\r\nrained during day and night. These clouds, counted by hundreds and by\r\nthousands, looked like domes in the rainy season. From the earth\r\ndisappeared the effulgence of the sun; its place was taken by the\r\nstainless lustre of the lightning; the earth became delightful to all,\r\nbeing overgrown with grass, with gnats and reptiles in their joy; it was\r\nbathed with rain and possessed with calm. When the waters had covered\r\nall, it could not be known whether the ground was at all even or\r\nuneven;--whether there were rivers or trees or hills. At the end of the\r\nhot season, the rivers added beauty to the woods being themselves full of\r\nagitated waters, flowing with great force and resembling serpents in the\r\nhissing sound they made. The boars, the stags and the birds, while the\r\nrain was falling upon them began to utter sounds of various kinds which\r\ncould be heard within the forest tracts. The chatakas, the peacocks and\r\nthe host of male Kohilas and the excited frogs, all ran about in joy.\r\nThus while the Pandavas were roaming about in the deserts and sandy\r\ntracts, the happy season of rain, so various in aspect and resounding\r\nwith clouds passed away. Then set in the season of autumn, thronged with\r\nganders and cranes and full of joy; then the forest tracts were overrun\r\nwith grass; the river turned limpid; the firmament and stars shone\r\nbrightly., And the autumn, thronged with beasts and birds, was joyous and\r\npleasant for the magnanimous sons of Pandu. Then were seen nights, that\r\nwere free from dust and cool with clouds and beautified by myriads of\r\nplanets and stars and the moon. And they beheld rivers and ponds, adorned\r\nwith lilies and white lotuses, full of cool and pleasant water. And while\r\nroving by the river Saraswati whose banks resembled the firmament itself\r\nand were overgrown with canes, and as such abounded in sacred baths,\r\ntheir joy was great. And those heroes who wielded powerful bows, were\r\nspecially glad to see the pleasant river Saraswati, with its limpid\r\nwaters full to the brim. And, O Janamejaya, the holiest night, that of\r\nthe full moon in the month of Kartika in the season of autumn, was spent\r\nby them while dwelling there! And the sons of Pandu, the best of the\r\ndescendants of Bharata, spent that auspicious juncture with righteous and\r\nmagnanimous saints devoted to penance.

And while the sons of Pandu\r\nwere dwelling in security in that place, many Brahmanas came to wait upon\r\nthem. And a certain Brahmana said, 'He the beloved friend of Arjuna, of\r\npowerful arms and possessed of self control, descendant of Sura, of a\r\nlofty intellect, will come, for, O ye foremost of the descendants of\r\nKuru, Hari knows that ye have arrived here. For, Hari has always a\r\nlonging for your sight and always seeks your welfare. And Markandeya, who\r\nlived very many years devoted to great austerities, given to study and\r\npenance, will erelong come and meet you.' And the very moment that he was\r\nuttering these words, there was beheld Krishna, coming thitherward upon a\r\ncar unto which were yoked the horses Saivya and Sugriva,--he the best of\r\nthose that ride on cars, accompanied by Satyabhama, is like Indra by\r\nSachi, the daughter of Pulaman. And the son of Devaki came, desirous to\r\nsee those most righteous of the descendants of Kuru. And the sagacious\r\nKrishna, having alighted from the car, prostrated himself, with pleasure\r\nin his heart, before the virtuous king, in the prescribed way, and also\r\nbefore Bhima, that foremost of powerful men. And he paid his respects to\r\nDhaumya, while the twin brothers prostrated themselves to him. And he\r\nembraced Arjuna of the curly hair; and spoke words of solace to the\r\ndaughter of Drupada. And the descendant of the chief of the Dasaraha\r\ntribe, that chastiser of foes, when he saw the beloved Arjuna come near\r\nhim, having seen him after a length of time, clasped him again and again.\r\nAnd so too Satyabhama also, the beloved consort of Krishna, embraced the\r\ndaughter of Drupada, the beloved wife of the sons of Pandu. Then these\r\nsons of Pandu, accompanied by their wife and priests, paid their respects\r\nto Krishna, whose eyes resembled the white lotus and surrounded him on\r\nall sides. And Krishna, when united with Arjuna, the son of Pritha, the\r\nwinner of riches and the terror of the demons assumed a beauty comparable\r\nto that of Siva, the magnanimous lord of all created beings, when he, the\r\nmighty lord, is united with Kartikeya (his son). And Arjuna, who bore a\r\ncirclet of crowns on his head, gave an account of what had happened to\r\nhim in the forest to Krishna, the elder brother of Gada. And Arjuna\r\nasked, saying, 'How is Subhadra, and her son Abhimanyu?' And Krishna, the\r\nslayer of Madhu, having paid his respects in the prescribed form to the\r\nson of Pritha, and to the priest, and seating himself with them there,\r\nspoke to king Yudhishthira, in words of praise. And he said, 'O king,\r\nVirtue is preferable to the winning of kingdoms; it is, in fact, practice\r\nof austerities! By you who have obeyed with truth and candour what your\r\nduty prescribed, have been won both this world and that to come! First\r\nyou have studied, while performing religious duties; having acquired in a\r\nsuitable way the whole science of arms, having won wealth by pursuing the\r\nmethods prescribed for the military caste, you have celebrated all the\r\ntime-honoured sacrificial rites. You take no delight in sensual\r\npleasures; you do not act, O lord of men, from motives of enjoyment, nor\r\ndo you swerve from virtue from greed of riches; it is for this, you have\r\nbeen named the Virtuous King, O son of Pritha! Having won kingdoms and\r\nriches and means of enjoyment, your best delight has been charity and\r\ntruth and practice of austerities, O King, and faith and meditation and\r\nforbearance and patience! When the population of Kuru-jangala beheld\r\nKrishna outraged in the assembly hall, who but yourself could brook that\r\nconduct, O Pandu's son, which was so repugnant both to virtue and usage?\r\nNo doubt, you will, before long, rule over men in a praiseworthy way, all\r\nyour desires being fulfilled. Here are we prepared to chastise the Kurus,\r\nas soon as the stipulation made by you is fully performed! And Krishna,\r\nthe foremost of the Dasarha tribe, then said to Dhaumya and Bhima and\r\nYudhishthira, and the twins and Krishna, 'How fortunate that by your\r\nblessing Arjuna the bearer of the coronet, has arrived after having\r\nacquired the science of arms!\" And Krishna, the leader of the Dasarha\r\ntribe, accompanied by friends, likewise spoke to Krishna, the daughter of\r\nYajnasena, saying, 'How fortunate that you are united, safe and secure,\r\nwith Arjuna, the winner of riches!' And Krishna also said, 'O Krishna, O\r\ndaughter of Yajnasena, those sons of yours, are devoted to the study of\r\nthe science of arms, are well-behaved and conduct themselves on the\r\npattern, O Krishna, of their righteous friends. Your father and your\r\nuterine brothers proffer them a kingdom and territories; but the boys\r\nfind no joy in the house of Drupada, or in that of their maternal uncles.\r\nSafely proceeding to the land of the Anartas, they take the greatest\r\ndelight in the study of the science of arms. Your sons enter the town of\r\nthe Vrishnis and take an immediate liking to the people there. And as you\r\nwould direct them to conduct themselves, or as the respected Kunti would\r\ndo, so does Subhadra direct them in a watchful way. Perhaps, she is still\r\nmore careful of them. And, O Krishna, as Rukmini's son is the preceptor\r\nof Aniruddha, of Abhimanyu, of Sunitha, and of Bhanu; so he is the\r\npreceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good preceptor, would\r\nunceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and swords and\r\nbucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding\r\nhorses, being valiant. And he, the son of Rukmini, having bestowed a very\r\ngood training upon them, and having taught them the art of using various\r\nweapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of your\r\nsons, and of Abhimanyu. O daughter of Drupada! And when your son goes\r\nout, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one of them is followed\r\nthither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.' And Krishna said\r\nto the virtuous king, Yudhishthira, The fighting men of the Dasarha\r\ntribe, and the Kukuras, and the Andhakas--let these, O king, place\r\nthemselves at thy command--let them perform what thou desirest them. O\r\nlord of men, let the army of the tribe of Madhus, (resistless) like the\r\nwind, with their bows and led by Balarama whose weapon is the plough--let\r\nthat army, equipped (for war), consisting of horsemen and foot soldiers\r\nand horses and cars and elephants, prepare to do your bidding. O son of\r\nPandu! Drive Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, the vilest of sinful\r\nmen, together with his followers and his hosts of friends to the path\r\nbetaken by the lord of Saubha, the son of the Earth! You, O ruler of men,\r\nare welcome to stick to that stipulation which was made in the\r\nassembly-hall--but let the city of Hastina be made ready for you, when\r\nthe hostile force has been slain by the soldiers of the Dasarha tribe!\r\nHaving roamed at your pleasure in all those places where you may desire\r\nto go, having got rid of your grief and freed from all your sins--you\r\nwill reach the city of Hastina--the well-known city situated in the midst\r\nof a fine territory!--Then the magnanimous king having been acquainted\r\nwith the view, thus clearly set forth by Krishna that best of men, and,\r\nhaving applauded the same, and having deliberated, thus spoke with joined\r\npalms unto Kesava, 'O Kesava, no doubt, thou art the refuge of the sons\r\nof Pandu; for the sons of Pandu have their protector in thee! When the\r\ntime will come, there is no doubt that thou wilt do all the work just\r\nmentioned by thee; and even more than the same! As promised by us, we\r\nhave spent all the twelve years in lonely forests. O Kesava, having in\r\nthe prescribed way completed the period for living unrecognised, the sons\r\nof Pandu will take refuge in thee. This should be the intention of those\r\nthat associate with thee, O Krishna! The sons of Pandu swerve not from\r\nthe path of truth, for the sons of Pritha with their charity and their\r\npiety with their people and their wives and with their relations have\r\ntheir protector in thee!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, 'O descendant of Bharata, while Krishna, the\r\ndescendant of the Vrishnis and the virtuous king, were thus talking,\r\nthere appeared then the saint Markandeya, grown grey in the practise of\r\npenances. And he had seen many thousand years of life, was of a pious\r\nsoul, and devoted to great austerities. Signs of old age he had none; and\r\ndeathless he was, and endued with beauty and generous and many good\r\nqualities. And he looked like one only twenty-five years old. And when\r\nthe aged saint, who had seen many thousand years of life, came, all the\r\nBrahamanas paid their respects to him and so did Krishna together with\r\nPandu's son. And when that wisest saint, thus honoured, took his seat in\r\na friendly way, Krishna addressed him, in accordance with the views of\r\nthe Brahmanas and of Pandu's sons, thus,--\r\n\r\n\"The sons of Pandu, and the Brahmanas assembled here, and the daughter of\r\nDrupada, and Satyabhama, likewise myself, are all anxious to hear your\r\nmost excellent words, O Markandeya! Propound to us the holy stories of\r\nevents of bygone times, and the eternal rules of righteous conduct by\r\nwhich are guided kings and women and saints!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"When they had all taken their seats, Narada\r\nalso, the divine saint, of purified soul, came on a visit to Pandu's\r\nsons. Him also, then, of great soul, all those foremost men of superior\r\nintellect, honoured in the prescribed form, by offering water to wash his\r\nfeet, and the well-known oblation called the Arghya. Then the godlike\r\nsaint, Narada, learning that they were about to hear the speech of\r\nMarkandeya, expressed his assent to the arrangement. And he, the\r\ndeathless, knowing what would be opportune, said smilingly, 'O saint of\r\nthe Brahmana caste, speak what you were about to say unto the sons of\r\nPandu!' Thus addressed, Markandeya, devoted to great austerities,\r\nreplied, 'Wait a moment. A great deal will be narrated.' Thus addressed,\r\nthe sons of Pandu, together with those twice-born ones, waited a moment,\r\nlooking at that great saint, (bright) as the mid-day sun.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Pandu's son, the king of the Kuru tribe, having\r\nobserved that the great saint as willing to speak, questioned him with a\r\nview to suggesting topics to speak upon, saying, 'You who are ancient (in\r\nyears), know the deeds of gods and demons, and illustrious saints, and of\r\nall the royal ones. We consider you as worthy of being worshipped and\r\nhonoured; and we have long yearned after your company. And here is this\r\nson of Devaki, Krishna, who has come to us on a visit. Verily, when I\r\nlook at myself, fallen away from happiness, and when I contemplate the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra, of evil life, flourishing in every way, the idea\r\narises in me that it is man who does all acts, good or bad, and that it\r\nis he that enjoys the fruit the acts bring forth. How then is god the\r\nagent? And, O best of those that are proficient in the knowledge of God,\r\nhow is it that men's actions follow them? Is it in this world? Or is it\r\nin some subsequent existence? And, O best of righteous men among the\r\ntwice-born, in what way is an embodied animated being joined by his good\r\nand evil deeds that seek him out? Is it after death? Or is it in this\r\nworld? And, O descendant of Bhrigu, is what we experience in this world\r\nthe result of the acts of this very life? Or will the acts of this life\r\nbear fruit in the world to come? And where do the actions of an animated\r\nbeing who is dead find their resting place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'O best of those that can speak, this question befits\r\nthee, and is just what it should be? Thou knowest all that there is to\r\nknow. But thou art asking this question, simply for the sake of form.\r\nHere I shall answer thee: listen to me with an attentive mind, as to how\r\nin this world and in that to come, a man experienceth happiness and\r\nmisery. The lord of born beings, himself sprung first of all, created,\r\nfor all embodied beings, bodies which were stainless, pure, and obedient\r\nto virtuous impulses, O wisest of the descendants of Kuru! The ancient\r\nmen had all their desires fulfilled, were given to praiseworthy courses\r\nof life, were speakers of truth, godly and pure. All were equal to the\r\ngods, could ascend to the sky at their pleasure, and could come back\r\nagain; and all went about at their pleasure. And they had their death and\r\ntheir life also under their own control; and they had few sufferings; had\r\nno fear; and had their wishes fulfilled; and they were free from trouble;\r\ncould visit the gods and the magnanimous saints; knew by heart all\r\nrighteous rules; were self-controlled and free from envy. And they lived\r\nmany thousand years; and had many thousand sons. Then in course of time\r\nthey came to be restricted to walking solely on the surface of the earth,\r\noverpowered by lust and wrath, dependent for subsistence upon falsehood\r\nand trick, overwhelmed by greed and senselessness. Then those wicked men,\r\nwhen disembodied, on account of their unrighteous and unblessed deeds,\r\nwent to hell in a crooked way. Again and again, they were grilled, and,\r\nagain and again they began to drag their miserable existence in this\r\nwonderful world. And their desires were unfulfilled, the objects\r\nunaccomplished, and their knowledge became unavailing. And their senses\r\nwere paralysed and they became apprehensive of everything and the cause\r\nof other people's sufferings. And they were generally marked by wicked\r\ndeeds, and born in low families; they became wicked and afflicted with\r\ndiseases, and the terror of others. And they became short-lived and\r\nsinful and they reaped the fruit of their terrible deeds. And coveting\r\neverything, they became godless and indifferent in mind, O son of Kunti!\r\nThe destiny of every creature after death is determined by his acts in\r\nthis world. Thou hast asked me where this treasure of acts of the sage\r\nand the ignorant remain, and where they enjoy the fruit of their good and\r\nevil deeds! Do thou listen to the regulations on this subject! Man with\r\nhis subtle original body created by God lays up a great store of virtue\r\nand vice. After death he quits his frail (outer) body and is immediately\r\nborn again in another order of beings. He never remains non-existent for\r\na single moment. In his new life his actions follow him invariably as\r\nshadow and, fructifying, makes his destiny happy or miserable. The wise\r\nman, by his spiritual insight, knows all creatures to be bound to an\r\nimmutable destiny by the destroyer and incapable of resisting the\r\nfruition of his actions in good or evil fortune. This, O Yudhishthira, is\r\nthe doom of all creatures steeped in spiritual ignorance. Do thou now\r\nhear of the perfect way attained by men of high spiritual perception!\r\nSuch men are of high ascetic virtue and are versed in all profane and\r\nholy writ, diligent in performing their religious obligations and devoted\r\nto truth. And they pay due homage to their preceptors and superiors and\r\npractise Yoga, are forgiving, continent and energetic and pious and are\r\ngenerally endowed with every virtue. By the conquest of the passions,\r\nthey are subdued in mind; by practising yoga they become free from\r\ndisease, fear and sorrow; they are not troubled (in mind). In course of\r\nbirth, mature or immature, or while ensconced in the womb, in every\r\ncondition, they with spiritual eyes recognize the relation of their soul\r\nto the supreme Spirit. Those great-minded Rishis of positive and\r\nintuitive knowledge passing through this arena of actions, return again\r\nto the abode of the celestials. Men, O king, attain what they have in\r\nconsequence of the grace of the gods of Destiny or of their own actions.\r\nDo thou not think otherwise. O Yudhishthira, I regard that as the highest\r\ngood which is regarded so in this world. Some attain happiness in this\r\nworld, but not in the next; others do so in the next, but not in this.\r\nSome, again, attain happiness in this as well as in the next world; and\r\nothers neither here nor in the next world. Those that have immense\r\nwealth, shine every day with well-decorated persons. O slayer of mighty\r\nfoes, being addicted to carnal pleasures, they enjoy happiness only in\r\nthis world, but not in the next. But those who are engaged in spiritual\r\nmeditations and the study of the Vedas, who are diligent in asceticism,\r\nand who impair the vigour of their bodies by performing their duties, who\r\nhave subdued their passions, and who refrain from killing any animated\r\nbeing, those men, O slayer of thy enemies, attain happiness in the next\r\nworld, but not in this! Those who first live a pious life, and virtuously\r\nacquire wealth in due time and then marry and perform sacrifices, attain\r\nbliss both in this and the next world. Those foolish men again who do not\r\nacquire knowledge, nor are engaged in asceticism or charity or increasing\r\ntheir species; or in encompassing the pleasures and enjoyments of this\r\nworld, attain bliss neither in this nor in the next world. But all of you\r\nare proficient in knowledge and possessed of great power and strength and\r\ncelestial vigour. For the extermination (of the wicked) and for serving\r\nthe purposes of the gods, ye have come from the other world and have\r\ntaken your birth in this! Ye, who are so valiant, and engaged in\r\nasceticism, self-restraining exercises, and religious ordinances, and\r\nfond of exertion, after having performed great deeds and gratified the\r\ngods and Rishis and the Pitris, ye will at last in due course attain by\r\nyour own acts the supreme region--the abode of all virtuous men! O\r\nornament of Kuru's race, may no doubts cross thy mind on account of these\r\nthy sufferings, for this affliction is for thy good!\""

Thus asked, the revered Markandeya, of austere virtue and\r\nhigh spiritual energy, and proficient in all departments of knowledge,\r\nreplied, 'A strong-limbed, handsome young prince of the race of the\r\nHaihayas, a conqueror of hostile cities, (once) went out hunting. And\r\n(while) roaming in the wilderness of big trees and thickets of grass, he\r\nsaw, at no great distance from him, a Muni with the skin of a black\r\nantelope for his upper garment, and killed him for a deer. Pained at what\r\nhe had done, and his senses paralysed with grief, he repaired to the\r\npresence of the more distinguished of the Haihaya chiefs. The louts-eyed\r\nprince related to them the particulars. On hearing the account, O my son,\r\nand beholding the body of the Muni who had subsisted on fruits and roots,\r\nthey were sorely afflicted in mind. And they all set out enquiring here\r\nand there as they proceeded, as to whose son the Muni might be. And they\r\nsoon after reached the hermitage of Arishtanemi, son of Kasyapa. And\r\nsaluting that great Muni, so constant in austerity, they all remained\r\nstanding, while the Muni, on his part, busied himself about their\r\nreception. And they said unto the illustrious Muni, 'By a freak of\r\ndestiny, we have ceased to merit thy welcome: indeed, we have killed a\r\nBrahmana!' And the regenerate Rishi said to them, 'How hath a Brahmana\r\ncome to be killed by you, and say where may be he? Do ye all witness the\r\npower of my ascetic practices!' And they, having related everything to\r\nhim as it had happened went back, but found not the body of the dead\r\nRishi on the spot (where they had left it). And having searched for him,\r\nthey returned, ashamed and bereft of all perception, as in a dream. And\r\nthen, O thou conqueror of hostile cities, the Muni Tarkshya, addressed\r\nthem, saying, 'Ye princes, can this be the Brahmana of your killing? This\r\nBrahmana, endowed with occult gifts from spiritual exercises, is, indeed,\r\nmy son!' Seeing that Rishi, O lord of the earth, they were struck with\r\nbewilderment. And they said, 'What a marvel! How hath the dead come to\r\nlife again? Is it the power of his austere virtue by which he hath\r\nrevived again? We long to hear this, O Brahmana, if, indeed, it can be\r\ndivulged?' To them, he replied, 'Death, O lords of men, hath no power\r\nover us! I shall tell ye the reason briefly and intelligibly. We perform\r\nour own sacred duties; therefore, have we no fear of death; we speak well\r\nof Brahmanas but never think any ill of them; therefore hath death no\r\nterror for us. Entertaining our guests with food and drink, and our\r\ndependants with plenty of food, we ourselves (then) partake of what is\r\nleft; therefore we are not afraid of death. We are peaceful and austere\r\nand charitable and forbearing and fond of visiting sacred shrines, and we\r\nlive in sacred places; therefore we have no fear of death. And we live in\r\nplaces inhabited by men who have great spiritual power; therefore hath\r\ndeath no terror for us. I have briefly told ye all! Return ye now all\r\ntogether, cured of all worldly vanity. Ye have no fear of sin!' Saying\r\namen, O foremost scion of Bharata's race, and saluting the great Muni,\r\nall those princes joyously returned to their country.\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya continued, 'Do ye again hear from me the glory of the\r\nBrahmanas! It is said that a royal sage of the name of Vainya was once\r\nengaged in performing the horse-sacrifice and that Atri desired to go to\r\nhim for alms. But Atri subsequently gave up his desire of wealth, from\r\nreligious scruples. After much thought he, of great power, became\r\ndesirous of living in the woods, and, calling his wife and sons together,\r\naddressed them thus, 'Let us attain the highly tranquil and complete\r\nfruition of our desires. May it, therefore, be agreeable to you to repair\r\nquickly to the forest for a life of great merit.' His wife, arguing from\r\nmotives of virtue also then said to him, 'Hie thee to the illustrious\r\nprince Vainya, and beg of him vast riches! Asked by thee, that royal\r\nsage, engaged in sacrifice will give thee wealth. Having gone there, O\r\nregenerate Rishi, and received from him vast wealth, thou canst\r\ndistribute it among thy sons and servants and then thou canst go\r\nwhithersoever thou pleasest. This, indeed, is the higher virtue as\r\ninstanced by men conversant with religion.' Atri replied, 'I am informed,\r\nO virtuous one, by the high-souled Gautama, that Vainya is a pious\r\nprince, devoted to the cause of truth; but there are Brahmanas (about his\r\npersons) who are jealous of me; and as Gautama hath told me this, I do\r\nnot venture to go there, for (while) there, if I were to advise what is\r\ngood and calculated to secure piety and the fulfilment of one's desires,\r\nthey would contradict me with words unproductive of any good. But I\r\napprove of any counsel and will go there; Vainya will give me kine and\r\nhoards of riches.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'So saying, he, of great ascetic merit, hastened\r\nto Vainya's sacrifice and reaching the sacrificial altar and making his\r\nobeisance to the king and praising him with well-meaning speeches, he\r\nspoke these words, 'Blessed art thou, O king! Ruling over the earth, thou\r\nart the foremost of sovereigns! The Munis praise thee, and besides thee\r\nthere is none so versed in religious lore'! To him the Rishi Gautama, of\r\ngreat ascetic merit, then indignantly replied saying, 'Atri, do not\r\nrepeat this nonsense. (It seems) thou art not in thy proper senses. In\r\nthis world of ours, Mahendra the lord of all created beings (alone) is\r\nthe foremost of all sovereigns!' Then, O, great prince, Atri said to\r\nGautama, 'As Indra, the lord of all creatures, ruleth over our destinies,\r\nso doth this king! Thou art mistaken. It is thou who hast lost thine\r\nsenses from want of spiritual perception!' Gautama replied, 'I know I am\r\nnot mistaken; it is thou who art labouring under a misconception in this\r\nmatter. To secure the king's countenance, thou art flattering him in\r\n(this) assembly of the people. Thou dost not know what the highest\r\nvirtue, is nor dost thou feel the need for it. Thou art like a child\r\nsteeped in ignorance, for what then hast thou become (so) old in years?'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'While those two men were thus disputing in the\r\npresence of the Munis, who were engaged in Vainya's sacrifice the latter\r\nenquired, 'What is the matter with them, that maketh them talk so\r\nvociferously?' Then the very pious Kasyapa learned in all religious lore,\r\napproaching the disputants asked them what was the matter. And then\r\nGautama, addressing that assembly of great Munis said, 'Listen, O great\r\nBrahmanas, to the point in dispute between us. Atri hath said that Vainya\r\nis the ruler of our destinies; great is our doubt on this point.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'On hearing this, the great-mind Munis went\r\ninstantly to Sanatkumara who was well versed in religion to clear their\r\ndoubt. And then he of great ascetic merit, having heard the particulars\r\nfrom them addressed them these words full of religious meaning. And\r\nSanatkumara said, 'As fire assisted by the wind burneth down forests, so\r\na Brahmana's energy in union with a Kshatriya's or a Kshatriya's joined\r\nwith a Brahmana's destroyeth all enemies. The sovereign is the\r\ndistinguished giver of laws and the protector of his subjects. He is (a\r\nprotector of created beings) like Indra, (a propounder of morals) like\r\nSukra, (a counsellor) like Vrihaspati and (hence he is also called) the\r\nruler of men's destinies. Who does not think it proper to worship the\r\nindividual of whom such terms as 'preserver of created beings,' 'royal,'\r\n'emperor,' 'Kshatriya' (or saviour of the earth), 'lord of earth', 'ruler\r\nof men', are applied in praise? The king is (also) styled the prime cause\r\n(of social order, as being the promulgator of laws), 'the virtuous in\r\nwars,' (and therefore, preserver after peace), 'the watchman,' 'the\r\ncontented,' 'the lord,' 'the guide to salvation,' 'the easily\r\nvictorious,' 'the Vishnu like,' 'of effective wrath,' 'the winner of\r\nbattles' and 'the cherisher of the true religion.' The Rishis, fearful of\r\nsin, entrusted (the temporal) power to the Kshatriyas. As among the gods\r\nin heaven the Sun dispelleth darkness by his effulgence, so doth the king\r\ncompletely root out sin from this earth. Therefore is the king's\r\ngreatness reduced from the evidences of the sacred books, and we are\r\nbound to pronounce for that side which hath spoken in favour of the king.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Then that illustrious prince, highly pleased with\r\nthe victorious party, joyfully said to Atri, who had praised him\r\nerewhile. 'O regenerate Rishi, thou hast made and styled me the greatest\r\nand most excellent of men here, and compared me to the gods; therefore,\r\nshall I give thee vast and various sorts of wealth. My impression is that\r\nthou art omniscient. I give thee, O well-dressed and well-adorned one, a\r\nhundred millions of gold coins and also ten bharas of gold. Then Atri, of\r\nhigh austere virtues and great spiritual powers, thus welcomed (by the\r\nking), accepted all the gifts without any breach of propriety, and\r\nreturned home. And then giving his wealth to his sons and subduing his\r\nself, he cheerfully repaired to the forest with the object of performing\r\npenances.\""

Tarkshya had\r\nasked, saying, 'Excellent lady, what is the best thing for a man to do\r\nhere below, and how must he act so that he may not deviate from (the path\r\nof) virtue. Tell me all this, O beautiful lady, so that instructed by\r\nthee, I may not fall away from the path of virtue!

Tell me all this, O excellent lady, so\r\nthat I may live without any passions, craving, or desire, in this world.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Thus questioned by that cheerful Muni and seeing\r\nhim eager to learn and endued with high intelligence, Saraswati addressed\r\nthese pious and beneficial words to the Brahmana, Tarkshya.'\r\n\r\n\"Saraswati said, 'He who is engaged in the study of the Vedas, and with\r\nsanctity and equanimity perceives the supreme Godhead in his proper\r\nsphere, ascends the celestial regions and attains supreme beatitude with\r\nthe Immortals. Many large, beautiful, pellucid and sacred lakes are\r\nthere, abounding with fish, flowers, and golden lilies. They are like\r\nshrines and their very sight is calculated to assuage grief. Pious men,\r\ndistinctively worshipped by virtuous well-adorned golden-complexioned\r\nApsaras, dwell in contentment on the shores of those lakes. He who giveth\r\ncows (to Brahmanas) attaineth the highest regions; by giving bullocks he\r\nreacheth the solar regions, by giving clothes he getteth to the lunar\r\nworld, and by giving gold he attaineth to the state of the Immortals. He\r\nwho giveth a beautiful cow with a fine calf, and which is easily milked\r\nand which doth not run away, is (destined) to live for as many years in\r\nthe celestial regions as there are hairs on the body of that animal. He\r\nwho giveth a fine, strong, powerful, young bullock, capable of drawing\r\nthe plough and bearing burdens, reacheth the regions attained by men who\r\ngive ten cows. When a man bestoweth a well-caparisoned kapila cow with a\r\nbrazen milk-pail and with money given afterwards, that cow becoming, by\r\nits own distinguished qualities, a giver of everything reacheth the side\r\nof the man who gave her away. He who giveth away cows, reapeth\r\ninnumerable fruits of his action, measured by the hairs on the body of\r\nthat animal. He also saveth (from perdition) in the next world his sons\r\nand grandsons and ancestors to the seventh generation. He who presenteth\r\nto a Brahmana, sesamum made up in the form of a cow, having horns made of\r\ngold, with money besides, and a brazen milk-pail, subsequently attaineth\r\neasily to the regions of the Vasus. By his own acts man descends into the\r\ndarksome lower regions, infested by evil spirits (of his own passions)\r\nlike a ship tossed by the storm in the high seas; but the gift of kine to\r\nBrahmanas saves him in the next world. He who giveth his daughter in\r\nmarriage, in the Brahma form, who bestoweth gifts of land on Brahmanas\r\nand who duly maketh other presents, attaineth to the regions of\r\nPurandara. O Tarkshya, the virtuous man who is constant in presenting\r\noblations to the sacred fire for seven years, sanctifieth by his own\r\naction seven generations up and down.'\r\n\r\n\"Tarkshya said, 'O beautiful lady, explain to me who ask thee, the rules\r\nfor the maintenance of the sacred fire as inculcated in the Vedas. I\r\nshall now learn from thee the time-honoured rules for perpetually keeping\r\nup the sacred fire.'\""

      "content": "Then Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, said to the Brahmana, Markandeya,\r\n'Do thou now narrate the history of Vaivaswata Manu?\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya replied, 'O king, O foremost of men, there was a powerful and\r\ngreat Rishi of the name of Manu. He was the son of Vivaswan and was equal\r\nunto Brahma in glory. And he far excelled his father and grandfather in\r\nstrength, in power, in fortune, as also in religious austerities. And\r\nstanding on one leg and with uplifted hand, that lord of men did severe\r\npenance in the jujube forest called Visala. And there with head downwards\r\nand with steadfast eyes he practised the rigid and severe penance for ten\r\nthousand years. And one day, whilst he was practising austerities there\r\nwith wet clothes on and matted hair on head, a fish approaching the banks\r\nof the Chirini, addressed him thus, 'Worshipful sir, I am a helpless\r\nlittle fish, I am afraid of the large ones; therefore, do thou, O great\r\ndevotee, think it worth thy while to protect me from them; especially as\r\nthis fixed custom is well established amongst us that the strong fish\r\nalways preys upon the weak ones. Therefore do thou think it fit to save\r\nme from being drowned in this sea of terrors! I shall requite thee for\r\nthy good offices.' On hearing these words from the fish, Vaivaswata Manu\r\nwas overpowered with pity and he took out the fish from the water with\r\nhis own hands. And the fish which had a body glistening like the rays of\r\nthe moon when taken out of the water was put back in an earthen\r\nwater-vessel. And thus reared that fish O king, grew up in size and Manu\r\ntended it carefully like a child. And after a long while, it became so\r\nlarge in size, that there was no room for it in that vessel. And then\r\nseeing Manu (one day), it again addressed these words to him, 'Worshipful\r\nsir, do thou appoint some better habitation for me.' And then the\r\nadorable Manu, the conqueror of hostile cities, took it out of that\r\nvessel and carried it to a large tank and placed it there. And there\r\nagain the fish grew for many a long year. And although the tank was two\r\nyojanas in length and one yojana in width, even there, O lotus-eyed son\r\nof Kunti and ruler of men, was no room for the fish to play about! And\r\nbeholding Manu it said again, 'O pious and adorable father, take me to\r\nthe Ganga, the favourite spouse of the Ocean so that I may live there; or\r\ndo as thou listest. O sinless one, as I have grown to this great bulk by\r\nthy favour I shall do thy bidding cheerfully.' Thus asked the upright and\r\ncontinent and worshipful Manu took the fish to the river Ganga and he put\r\nit into the river with his own hands. And there, O conqueror of thy\r\nenemies, the fish again grew for some little time and then beholding\r\nManu, it said again, 'O lord, I am unable to move about in the Ganga on\r\naccount of my great body; therefore, worshipful sir, do thou please take\r\nme quickly to the sea!' O son of Pritha, Manu then taking it out of the\r\nGanga, carried it to the sea and consigned it there. And despite its\r\ngreat bulk, Manu transported it easily and its touch and smell were also\r\npleasant to him. And when it was thrown into the sea by Manu, it said\r\nthese words to him with a smile, 'O adorable being, thou hast protected\r\nme with special care; do thou now listen to me as to what thou shouldst\r\ndo in the fulness of time! O fortunate and worshipful sir, the\r\ndissolution of all this mobile and immobile world is nigh at hand. The\r\ntime for the purging of this world is now ripe. Therefore do I now\r\nexplain what is good for thee! The mobile and immobile divisions of the\r\ncreation, those that have the power of locomotion, and those that have it\r\nnot, of all these the terrible doom hath now approached. Thou shall build\r\na strong massive ark and have it furnished with a long rope. On that must\r\nthou ascend, O great Muni, with the seven Rishis and take with thee all\r\nthe different seeds which were enumerated by regenerate Brahmanas in days\r\nof yore, and separately and carefully must thou preserve them therein.\r\nAnd whilst there, O beloved of the Munis, thou shall wait for me, and I\r\nshall appear to thee like a horned animal, and thus, O ascetic, shall\r\nthou recognise me! And I shall now depart, and thou shall act according\r\nto my instructions, for, without my assistance, thou canst not save\r\nthyself from that fearful flood.' Then Manu said unto the fish, 'I do not\r\ndoubt all that thou hast said, O great one! Even so shall I act!' And\r\ngiving instructions to each other, they both went away. And Manu then, O\r\ngreat and powerful king and conqueror of thy enemies, procured all the\r\ndifferent seeds as directed by the fish, and set sail in an excellent\r\nvessel on the surging sea. And then, O lord of the earth, he bethought\r\nhimself of that fish. And the fish too, O conqueror of thy enemies and\r\nforemost scion of Bharata's race, knowing his mind, appeared there with\r\nhorns on his head. And then, O tiger among men, beholding in the ocean\r\nthat horned fish emerging like a rock in the form of which he had been\r\nbefore appraised, he lowered the ropy noose on its head. And fastened by\r\nthe noose, the fish, O king and conqueror of hostile cities, towed the\r\nark with great force through the salt waters. And it conveyed them in\r\nthat vessel on the roaring and billow beaten sea. And, O conqueror of thy\r\nenemies and hostile cities, tossed by the tempest on the great ocean, the\r\nvessel reeled about like a drunken harlot. And neither land nor the four\r\ncardinal points of the compass, could be distinguished.\r\n\r\nAnd there was water everywhere and the waters covered the heaven and the\r\nfirmament also. And, O bull of Bharata's race, when the world was thus\r\nflooded, none but Manu, the seven Rishis and the fish could be seen. And,\r\nO king, the fish diligently dragged the boat through the flood for many a\r\nlong year and then, O descendant of Kuru and ornament of Bharata's race,\r\nit towed the vessel towards the highest peak of the Himavat. And, O\r\nBharata, the fish then told those on the vessel to tie it to the peak of\r\nthe Himavat. And hearing the words of the fish they immediately tied the\r\nboat on that peak of the mountain and, O son of Kunti and ornament of\r\nBharata's race, know that that high peak of the Himavat is still called\r\nby the name of Naubandhana (the harbour). Then the fish addressing the\r\nassociated Rishis told them these words, 'I am Brahma, the Lord of all\r\ncreatures; there is none greater than myself. Assuming the shape of a\r\nfish, I have saved you from this cataclysm. Manu will create (again) all\r\nbeings--gods, Asuras and men, all those divisions of creation which have\r\nthe power of locomotion and which have it not. By practicing severe\r\nausterities he will acquire this power, and with my blessing, illusion\r\nwill have no power over him.'\r\n\r\n\"So saying the fish vanished instantly. And Vaivaswata Manu himself\r\nbecame desirous of creating the world. In this work of creation illusion\r\novertook him and he, therefore, practised great asceticism. And endowed\r\nwith ascetic merit, Manu, O ornament of Bharata's race, again set about\r\nhis work of creating all beings in proper and exact order. This story\r\nwhich I have narrated to thee and the hearing of which destroyeth all\r\nsin, is celebrated as the Legend of the Fish. And the man who listeneth\r\nevery day to this primeval history of Manu, attaineth happiness and all\r\nother objects of desire and goeth to heaven.\""

      "content": "\"Then the virtuous king Yudhishthira in all humility again enquired of\r\nthe illustrious Markandeya, saying, 'O great Muni, thou hast seen many\r\nthousands of ages pass away. In this world there is none so longlived as\r\nthou! O best of those that have attained the knowledge of Supreme Spirit,\r\nthere is none equal to thee in years except the great-minded Brahma\r\nliving in the most exalted place. Thou, O Brahmana, worshippest Brahma at\r\nthe time of the great dissolution of the universe, when this world is\r\nwithout sky and without the gods and Danavas. And when that cataclysm\r\nceaseth and the Grandsire awaketh, thou alone, O regenerate Rishi,\r\nbeholdest Brahma duly re-create the four orders of beings after having\r\nfilled the cardinal points with air and consigned the waters to their\r\nproper place. Thou, O great Brahmana, hast worshipped in his presence the\r\ngreat Lord and Grandsire of all creatures with soul rapt in meditation\r\nand entirely swallowed up in Him! And, O Brahmana, thou hast many a time\r\nwitnessed with thy eyes, the primeval acts of creation, and, plunged in\r\nsevere ascetic austerities, thou hast also surpassed the Prajapatis\r\nthemselves! Thou art esteemed as one who is nearest to Narayana, in the\r\nnext world. Many a time in days of yore hast thou beheld the Supreme\r\nCreator of the universe with eyes of spiritual abstraction and\r\nrenunciation, having first opened thy pure and lotus-like heart--the only\r\nplace where the multiform Vishnu of universal knowledge may be seen! It\r\nis for this, O learned Rishi, by the grace of God neither all-destroying\r\nDeath, nor dotage that causeth the decay of the body, hath any power over\r\nthee! When neither the sun, nor the moon, nor fire, nor earth, nor air,\r\nnor sky remains, when all the world being destroyed looketh like one vast\r\nocean, when the Gods and Asuras and the great Uragas are annihilated, and\r\nwhen the great-minded Brahma, the Lord of all creatures, taking his seat\r\non a lotus flower, sleepeth there, then thou alone remainest to worship\r\nhim! And, O best of Brahman as thou hast seen all this that occurred\r\nbefore, with thy own eyes. And thou alone hast witnessed many things by\r\nthe senses, and never in all the worlds hath there been any thing unknown\r\nto thee! Therefore do I long to hear any discourse explaining the causes\r\nof things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya replied, 'Indeed, I shall explain all, after having bowed\r\ndown to that Self-existent, Primordial Being, who is eternal and\r\nundeteriorating and inconceivable, and who is at once vested with and\r\ndivested of attributes. O tiger among men, this Janardana attired in\r\nyellow robes is the grand Mover and Creator of all, the Soul and Framer\r\nof all things, and the lord of all! He is also called the Great, the\r\nIncomprehensible, the Wonderful and the Immaculate. He is without\r\nbeginning and without end, pervades all the world, is Unchangeable and\r\nUndeteriorating. He is the Creator of all, but is himself uncreate and is\r\nthe Cause of all power. His knowledge is greater than that of all the\r\ngods together. O best of kings and pre-eminent of men, after the\r\ndissolution of the universe, all this wonderful creation again comes into\r\nlife. Four thousand years have been said to constitute the Krita Yuga.\r\nIts dawn also, as well as its eve, hath been said to comprise four\r\nhundred years. The Treta-Yuga is said to comprise three thousand years,\r\nand its dawn, as well as its eve, is said to comprise three hundred\r\nyears. The Yuga that comes next is called Dwapara, and it hath been\r\ncomputed to consist of two thousand years. Its dawn, as well as its eve,\r\nis said to comprise two hundred years. The next Yuga, called Kali, is\r\nsaid to comprise one thousand years and its dawn, as well as eve, is said\r\nto comprise one hundred years. Know, O king, that the duration of the\r\ndawn is the same as that of the eve of a Yuga. And after the Kali Yuga is\r\nover, the Krita Yuga comes again. A cycle of the Yugas thus comprised a\r\nperiod of twelve thousand years. A full thousand of such cycles would\r\nconstitute a day of Brahma. O tiger among men, when all this universe is\r\nwithdrawn and ensconced within its home--the Creator himself--that\r\ndisappearance of all things is called by the learned to be Universal\r\nDestruction. O bull of the Bharata race, towards the end of the last\r\nmentioned period of one thousand years, i.e., when the period wanted to\r\ncomplete a cycle is short, men generally become addicted to falsehood in\r\nspeech. O son of Pritha, then sacrifices and gifts and vows, instead of\r\nbeing performed by principals are suffered to be performed by\r\nrepresentatives! Brahmanas then perform acts that are reserved for the\r\nSudras, and the Sudras betake themselves to the acquisition of wealth.\r\nThen Kshatriyas also betake themselves to the practice of religious acts.\r\nIn the Kali age, the Brahmanas also abstain from sacrifices and the study\r\nof the Vedas, are divested of their staff and deer-skin, and in respect\r\nof food become omnivorous. And, O son, the Brahmanas in that age also\r\nabstain from prayers and meditation while the Sudras betake themselves to\r\nthese! The course of the world looketh contrary, and indeed, these are\r\nthe signs that foreshadow the Universal Destruction. And, O lord of men,\r\nnumerous Mleccha kings then rule over the earth! And those sinful\r\nmonarchs, addicted to false speech, govern their subjects on principles\r\nthat are false. The Andhhas, the Sakas, the Pulindas, the Yavanas, the\r\nKamvojas, the Valhikas and the Abhiras, then become, O best of men,\r\npossessed of bravery and the sovereignty of the earth. This, O tiger\r\namong men, becometh the state of the world during the eve, O Bharata, of\r\nthe Kali age! Not a single Brahmana then adhereth to the duties of his\r\norder. And the Kshatriyas and the Vaisyas also, O monarch, follow\r\npractices contrary to those that are proper for their own orders. And men\r\nbecome short-lived, weak in strength, energy, and prowess; and endued\r\nwith small might and diminutive bodies, they become scarcely truthful in\r\nspeech. And the human population dwindles away over large tracts of\r\ncountry, and the regions of the earth, North and South, and East and\r\nWest, become crowded with animals and beasts of prey. And during this\r\nperiod, they also that utter Brahma, do so in vain. The Sudras address\r\nBrahmanas, saying, Bho, while the Brahmanas address Sudras, saying\r\nRespected Sir. And, O tiger among men, at the end of the Yuga, animals\r\nincrease enormously. And, O king, odours and perfumes do not then become\r\nso agreeable to our sense of scent, and, O tiger among men, the very\r\ntastes of things do not then so well accord with our organs of taste as\r\nat other periods! And, O king, women then become mothers of numerous\r\nprogeny, endued with low statures, and destitute of good behaviour and\r\ngood manners. And they also make their very mouths serve the purposes of\r\nthe organ of procreation. And famine ravages the habitations of men, and\r\nthe highways are infested by women of ill fame, while females in general,\r\nO king, become at such periods hostile to their lords and destitute of\r\nmodesty! And, O king, the very kine at such periods yield little milk,\r\nwhile the trees, sat over with swarms of crows, do not produce many\r\nflowers and fruits. And, O lord of the earth, regenerate classes, tainted\r\nwith the sin of slaying Brahmanas, accept gifts from monarchs that are\r\naddicted to falsehood in speech. And filled with covetousness and\r\nignorance, and bearing on their persons the outward symbols of religion,\r\nthey set out on eleemosynary rounds, afflicting the people of the Earth.\r\nAnd people leading domestic lives, afraid of the burden of taxes, become\r\ndeceivers, while Brahmanas, falsely assuming the garb of ascetics, earn\r\nwealth by trade, with nails and hair unpared and uncut. And, O tiger\r\namong men, many of the twice-born classes become, from avarice of wealth,\r\nreligious mendicants of the Brahmacharin order. And, O monarch, men at\r\nsuch periods behave contrary to the modes of life to which they betake\r\nthemselves, and addicted to intoxicating drinks and capable of violating\r\nthe beds of their preceptors, their desires are all of this world,\r\npursuing matters ministering to the flesh and the blood. And O tiger\r\namong men, at such period the asylums of ascetics become full of sinful\r\nand audacious wretches ever applauding lives of dependence. And the\r\nillustrious chastiser of Paka never showers rain according to the seasons\r\nand the seeds also that are scattered on earth, do not, O Bharata, all\r\nsprout forth. And men, unholy in deed and thought, take pleasure in envy\r\nand malice. And, O sinless one, the earth then becometh full of sin and\r\nimmorality. And, O lord of the earth, he that becometh virtuous at such\r\nperiods doth not live long. Indeed, the earth becometh reft of virtue in\r\nevery shape. And, O tiger among men, the merchants and traders then full\r\nof guile, sell large quantities of articles with false weights and\r\nmeasures. And they that are virtuous do not prosper; while they that are\r\nsinful proper exceedingly. And virtue loseth her strength while sin\r\nbecometh all powerful. And men that are devoted to virtue become poor and\r\nshort-lived; while they that are sinful become long-lived and win\r\nprosperity. And in such times, people behave sinfully even in places of\r\npublic amusements in cities and towns. And men always seek the\r\naccomplishment of their ends by means that are sinful. And having earned\r\nfortunes that are really small they become intoxicated with the pride of\r\nwealth. And O monarch, many men at such periods strive to rob the wealth\r\nthat hath from trust been deposited with them in secrecy. And wedded to\r\nsinful practices, they shamelessly declare--there is nothing in deposit.\r\nAnd beasts of prey and other animals and fowl may be seen to lie down in\r\nplaces of public amusement in cities and towns, as well as in sacred\r\nedifices. And, O king girls of seven or eight years of age do then\r\nconceive, while boys of ten or twelve years beget offspring. An in their\r\nsixteenth year, men are overtaken with decrepitude and decay and the\r\nperiod of life itself is soon outrun. And O king, when men become so\r\nshort-lived, more youths act like the aged; while all that is observable\r\nin youth may be noticed in the old. And women given to impropriety of\r\nconduct and marked by evil manners, deceive even the best of husbands and\r\nforget themselves with menials and slaves and even with animals. And O\r\nking, even women that are wives of heroes seek the companionship of other\r\nmen and forget themselves with these during the life-time of their\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\n\"O king, towards the end of those thousands of years constituting the\r\nfour Yugas and when the lives of men become so short, a drought occurs\r\nextending for many years. And then, O lord of the earth, men and\r\ncreatures endued with small strength and vitality, becoming hungry die by\r\nthousands. And then, O lord of men, seven blazing Suns, appearing in the\r\nfirmament, drink up all the waters of the Earth that are in rivers or\r\nseas. And, O bull of the Bharata race, then also everything of the nature\r\nof wood and grass that is wet to dry, is consumed and reduced to ashes.\r\nAnd then, O Bharata, the fire called Samvartaka impelled by the winds\r\nappeareth on the earth that hath already been dried to cinders by the\r\nseven Suns. And then that fire, penetrating through the Earth and making\r\nits appearance, in the nether regions also, begetteth great terror in the\r\nhearts of the gods, the Danavas and the Yakshas. And, O lord of the\r\nearth, consuming the nether regions as also everything upon this Earth\r\nthat fire destroyeth all things in a moment. And that fire called\r\nSamvartaka aided by that inauspicious wind, consumeth this world\r\nextending for hundreds and thousands of yojanas. And that lord of all\r\nthings, that fire, blazing forth in effulgence consumeth this universe\r\nwith gods and Asuras and Gandharvas and Yakshas and Snakes and Rakshasas.\r\nAnd there rise in the sky deep masses of clouds, looking like herds of\r\nelephants and decked with wreaths of lightning that are wonderful to\r\nbehold. And some of those clouds are of the hue of the blue lotus; and\r\nsome are of the hue of the water-lily; and some resemble in tint the\r\nfilaments of the lotus and some are purple and some are yellow as\r\nturmeric and some of the hue of the crows' egg. And some are bright as\r\nthe petals of the lotus and some red as vermillion. And some resemble\r\npalatial cities in shape and some herds of elephants. And some are of the\r\nform of lizards and some of crocodiles and sharks. And, O king, the\r\nclouds that gather in the sky on the occasion are terrible to behold and\r\nwreathed with lightnings, roar frightfully. And those vapoury masses,\r\ncharged with rain, soon cover the entire welkin. And, O king, those\r\nmasses of vapour then flood with water the whole earth with her mountains\r\nand forests and mines. And, O bull among men, urged by the Supreme Lord\r\nthose clouds roaring frightfully, soon flood over the entire surface of\r\nthe earth. And pouring in a great quantity of water and filling the whole\r\nearth, they quench that terrible inauspicious fire (of which I have\r\nalready spoken to thee). And urged by the illustrious Lord those clouds\r\nfilling the earth with their downpour shower incessantly for twelve\r\nyears. And then, O Bharata, the Ocean oversteps his continents, the\r\nmountains sunder in fragments, and the Earth sinks under the increasing\r\nflood. And then moved on a sudden by the impetus of the wind, those\r\nclouds wander along the entire expanse of the firmament and disappear\r\nfrom the view. And then, O ruler of men, the Self-create Lord--the first\r\nCause of everything--having his abode in the lotus, drinketh those\r\nterrible winds and goeth to sleep, O Bharata!\r\n\r\n\"And then when the universe become one dead expanse of water, when all\r\nmobile and immobile creatures have been destroyed, when the gods and the\r\nAsuras cease to be, when the Yakshas and the Rakshasas are no more, when\r\nman is not, when trees and beasts of prey have disappeared, when the\r\nfirmament itself has ceased to exist, I alone, O lord of the earth,\r\nwander in affliction. And, O best of kings, wandering over that dreadful\r\nexpanse of water, my heart becometh afflicted in consequence of my not\r\nbeholding any creature! And, O king, wandering without cessation, through\r\nthat flood, I become fatigued, but I obtain no resting place! And some\r\ntime after I behold in that expanse of accumulated waters a vast and\r\nwide-extending banian tree, O lord of earth! And I then behold, O\r\nBharata, seated on a conch, O king, overlaid with a celestial bed and\r\nattached to a far-extended bough of that banian, a boy, O great king, of\r\nface fair as the lotus or the moon, and of eyes, O ruler of men, large as\r\npetals of a full blown lotus! And at this sight, O lord of earth, wonder\r\nfilled my heart. And I asked myself, 'How doth this boy alone sit here\r\nwhen the world itself hath been destroyed?' And, O king, although I have\r\nfull knowledge of the Past, the Present, and the Future, still I failed\r\nto learn anything of this by means of even ascetic meditation. Endued\r\nwith the lustre of the Atasi flower, and decked with the mark of\r\nSreevatsa, he seemed to me to be like the abode of Lakshmi, herself. And\r\nthat boy, of eyes like the petals of the lotus, having the mark of\r\nSreevatsa, and possessed of blazing effulgence, then addressed me in\r\nwords highly pleasant to the ear, saying, 'O sire, I know thee to be\r\nfatigued and desirous of rest. O Markandeya of Bhrigu's race, rest thou\r\nhere as long as thou wishest. O best of Munis, entering within my body,\r\nrest thou there. That hath been the abode assigned to thee by me. I have\r\nbeen pleased with thee.' Thus addressed by that boy, a sense of total\r\ndisregard possessed me in respect both of my long life and state of\r\nmanhood. Then that boy suddenly opened his mouth, and as fate would have\r\nit, I entered his mouth deprived of the power of motion. But O king,\r\nhaving suddenly entered into the stomach of that boy, I behold there the\r\nwhole earth teeming with cities and kingdoms. And, O best of men, while\r\nwandering through the stomach of that illustrious one, I behold the\r\nGanga, the Satudru, the Sita, the Yamuna, and the Kausiki; the\r\nCharmanwati, the Vetravati; the Chandrabhaga, the Saraswati, the Sindhu,\r\nthe Vipasa, and the Godavari; the Vaswokasara, the Nalini and the\r\nNarmada; the Tamra, and the Venna also of delightful current and sacred\r\nwaters; the Suvenna, the Krishna-venna, the Irama, and the Mahanadi; the\r\nVitasti, O great king, and that large river, the Cavery; the one also, O\r\ntiger among men, the Visalya, and the Kimpuna also. I beheld all these\r\nand many other rivers that are on the earth! And, O slayer of foes, I\r\nalso beheld there the ocean inhabited by alligators and sharks, that mine\r\nof gems, that excellent abode of waters. And I beheld there the firmament\r\nalso, decked with the Sun and the Moon, blazing with effulgence, and\r\npossessed of lustre of fire of the Sun. And I beheld there, O king, the\r\nearth also, graced with woods and forests. And, O monarch, I beheld there\r\nmany Brahmanas also, engaged in various sacrifices; and the Kshatriyas\r\nengaged in doing good to all the orders; and the Vaisyas employed in\r\npursuits in agriculture; and the Sudras devoted to the service of the\r\nregenerate classes. And, O king, while wandering through the stomach of\r\nthat high-souled one, I also beheld the Himavat and the mountains of\r\nHemakuta. And I also saw Nishada, and the mountains of Sweta abounding in\r\nsilver. And, O king, I saw there the mountain Gandhamadana, and, O tiger\r\namong men, also Mandara and the huge mountains of Nila. And, O great\r\nking, I saw there the golden mountains of Meru and also Mahendra and\r\nthose excellent mountains called the Vindhyas. And I beheld there the\r\nmountains of Malaya and of Paripatra also. These and many other mountains\r\nthat are on earth were all seen by me in his stomach. And all these were\r\ndecked with jewels and gems. And, O monarch, while wandering through his\r\nstomach, I also beheld lions and tigers and boars and, indeed, all other\r\nanimals that are on earth, O great king! O tiger among men, having\r\nentered his stomach, as I wandered around, I also beheld the whole tribe\r\nof the gods with their chief Sakra, the Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas,\r\nthe Guhyakas, the Pitris, the Snakes and the Nagas, the feathery tribes,\r\nthe Vasus, the Aswins, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas, the\r\nRishis, the hordes of the Daityas and the Danavas, and the Nagas also. O\r\nking, and the sons of Singhika and all the other enemies of the gods;\r\nindeed what else of mobile and immobile creatures may be seen on earth,\r\nwere all seen by me, O monarch, within the stomach of that high-souled\r\none. And, O lord, living upon fruits I dwelt within his body for many\r\ncenturies wandering over the entire universe that is there. Never did I\r\nyet, O king, behold the limits of his body. And when, O lord of earth, I\r\nfailed to measure the limits of that high-souled one's body, even though\r\nI wandered within him continuously in great anxiety of mind. I then, in\r\nthought and deed sought the protection of that boon-giving and\r\npre-eminent Deity, duly acknowledging his superiority. And when I had\r\ndone this, O king, I was suddenly projected (from within his body)\r\nthrough that high-souled one's open mouth by means, O chief of men, of a\r\ngust of wind. And, O king, I then beheld seated on the branch of that\r\nvery banian that same Being of immeasurable energy, in the form of a boy\r\nwith the mark of Sreevatsa (on his breast) having, O tiger among men,\r\nswallowed up the whole universe. And that boy of blazing effulgence and\r\nbearing the mark of Sreevatsa and attired in yellow robes, gratified with\r\nme, smilingly addressed me, saying, 'O Markandeya, O best of Munis,\r\nhaving dwelt for some time within my body, thou hast been fatigued! I\r\nshall however speak unto thee.' And as he said this to me, at that very\r\nmoment I acquired a new sight, so to speak, in consequence of which I\r\nbeheld myself to be possessed of true knowledge and emancipated from the\r\nillusions of the world. And, O child, having witnessed the inexhaustible\r\npower of that Being of immeasurable energy, I then worshipped his revered\r\nand well-shaped feet with soles bright as burnished copper and\r\nwell-decked with toes of mild red hue, having placed them carefully on my\r\nhead and joining my palms in humility and approaching him with reverence.\r\nI beheld that Divine Being who is the soul of all things and whose eyes\r\nare like the petals of the lotus. And having bowed unto him with joined\r\nhands I addressed him saying, 'I wish to know thee, O Divine Being, as\r\nalso this high and wonderful illusion of thine! O illustrious one, having\r\nentered into thy body through thy mouth, I have beheld the entire\r\nuniverse in thy stomach! O Divine Being, the gods, the Danavas and the\r\nRakshasas, the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, and the Nagas, indeed, the whole\r\nuniverse mobile and immobile, are all within thy body! And though I have\r\nceaselessly wandered through thy body at a quick pace, through thy grace,\r\nO God, my memory faileth me not. And, O great lord, I have come out of\r\nthy body at thy desire but not of mine! O thou of eyes like lotus leaves,\r\nI desire to know thee who art free from all faults! Why dost thou stay\r\nhere in the form of a boy having swallowed up the entire universe? It\r\nbehoveth thee to explain all this to me. Why, O sinless one, is the\r\nentire universe within thy body? How long also, O chastiser of foes, wilt\r\nthou stay here? Urged by a curiosity that is not improper for Brahmanas,\r\nI desire, O Lord of all the gods, to hear all this from thee, O thou of\r\neyes like lotus leaves, with every detail and exactly as it all happens,\r\nfor all I have seen, O Lord, is wonderful and inconceivable!' And thus\r\naddressed by me, that deity of deities, of blazing effulgence and great\r\nbeauty, that foremost of all speakers consoling me properly, spoke unto\r\nme these words.\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya continued, 'The Deity then said, 'O Brahmana, the gods even\r\ndo not know me truly! As however, I have been gratified with thee, I will\r\ntell thee how I created the universe! O regenerate Rishi, thou art\r\ndevoted to thy ancestors and hast also sought my protection! Thou hast\r\nalso beheld me with thy eyes, and thy ascetic merit also is great! In\r\nancient times I called the waters by the name of Nara; and because the\r\nwaters have ever been my ayana or home, therefore have I been called\r\nNarayana (the water-homed). O best of regenerate ones, I am Narayana, the\r\nSource of all things, the Eternal, the Unchangeable. I am the Creator of\r\nall things, and the Destroyer also of all. I am Vishnu, I am Brahma and I\r\nam Sakra, the chief of the gods. I am king Vaisravana, and I am Yama, the\r\nlord of the deceased spirits. I am Siva, I am Soma, and I am Kasyapa the\r\nlord of the created things. And, O best of regenerate ones, I am he\r\ncalled Dhatri, and he also that is called Vidhatri, and I am Sacrifice\r\nembodied. Fire is my mouth, the earth my feet, and the Sun and the Moon\r\nare my eyes; the Heaven is the crown of my head, the firmament and the\r\ncardinal points are my ears; the waters are born of my sweat. Space with\r\nthe cardinal points are my body, and the Air is my mind. I have performed\r\nmany hundreds of sacrifices with gifts in profusion. I am always present\r\nin the sacrifices of the gods; and they that are cognisant of the Vedas\r\nand officiate therein, make their offerings to me. On earth the Kshatriya\r\nchiefs that rule over men, in performing their sacrifices from desire of\r\nobtaining heaven, and the Vaisyas also in performing theirs from desire\r\nof winning those happy regions, all worship me at such times and by those\r\nceremonials. It is I who, assuming the form of Sesha support (on my head)\r\nthis earth bounded by the four seas and decked by Meru and Mandara. And O\r\nregenerate one, it is I who, assuming the form of a boar, had raised in\r\ndays of yore this earth sunk in water. And, O best of Brahmanas, it is I\r\nwho, becoming the fire that issues out of the Equine mouth, drink up the\r\nwaters (of the ocean) and create them again. In consequence of my energy\r\nfrom my mouth, my arms, my thighs, and my feet gradually sprang Brahmanas\r\nand Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras. It is from me that the Rik, the\r\nSama, the Yajus, and the Atharvan Vedas spring, and it is in me that they\r\nall enter when the time cometh. Brahmanas devoted to asceticism, they\r\nthat value Peace as the highest attribute, they that have their souls\r\nunder complete control, they that are desirous of knowledge, they that\r\nare freed from lust and wrath and envy, they that are unwedded to things\r\nof the earth, they that have their sins completely washed away, they that\r\nare possessed of gentleness and virtue, and are divested of pride, they\r\nthat have a full knowledge of the Soul, all worship me with profound\r\nmeditation. I am the flame known as Samvartaka, I am the Wind called by\r\nthat name, I am the Sun wearing that appellation, and I am the fire that\r\nhath that designation. And, O best of Brahmanas, those things that are\r\nseen in the firmament as stars, know them to be the pores of my skin. The\r\nocean--those mines of gems and the four cardinal points, know, O\r\nBrahmana, are my robes, my bed, and my home. By me have they been\r\ndistributed for serving the purposes of the gods. And, O best of men,\r\nknow also that lust, wrath, joy, fear, and the over-clouding of the\r\nintellect, are all different forms of myself. And, O Brahmana, whatever\r\nis obtained by men by the practice of truth, charity, ascetic\r\nausterities, and peace and harmlessness towards all creatures, and such\r\nother handsome deeds, is obtained because of my arrangements. Governed by\r\nmy ordinance, men wander within my body, their senses overwhelmed by me.\r\nThey move not according to their will but as they are moved by me.\r\nRegenerate Brahmanas that have thoroughly studied the Vedas, that have\r\ntranquillity in their souls, they that have subdued their wrath, obtain a\r\nhigh reward by means of their numerous sacrifices. That reward, however,\r\nis unattainable by men that are wicked in their deeds, overwhelmed by\r\ncovetousness, mean and disreputable with souls unblessed and impure.\r\nTherefore, must thou know, O Brahmana that this reward which is obtained\r\nby persons having their souls under control and which is unobtainable by\r\nthe ignorant and the foolish,--this which is attainable by asceticism\r\nalone,--is productive of high merit. And, O best of men, at those times\r\nwhen virtue and morality decrease and sin and immorality increase, I\r\ncreate myself in new forms. And, O Muni, when fierce and malicious\r\nDaityas and Rakshasas that are incapable of being slain by even the\r\nforemost of the gods, are born on earth, I then take my birth in the\r\nfamilies of virtuous men, and assuming human body restore tranquillity by\r\nexterminating all evils. Moved by my own maya, I create gods and men, and\r\nGandharvas and Rakshasas, and all immobile things and then destroy them\r\nall myself (when the time cometh). For the preservation of rectitude and\r\nmorality I assume a human form, and when the season for action cometh, I\r\nagain assume forms that are inconceivable. In the Krita age I become\r\nwhite, in the Treta age I become yellow, in the Dwapara I have become red\r\nand in the Kali age I become dark in hue, I the Kali age, the proportion\r\nof immorality becometh three-fourths, (a fourth only being that of\r\nmorality). And when the end of the Yuga cometh, assuming the fierce form\r\nof Death, alone I destroy all the three worlds with their mobile and\r\nimmobile existences. With three steps, I cover the whole Universe; I am\r\nthe Soul of the universe; I am the source of all happiness; I am the\r\nhumbler of all pride; I am omnipresent; I am infinite; I am the Lord of\r\nthe senses; and my prowess is great. O Brahmana, alone do I set a-going\r\nthe wheel of Time; I am formless; I am the Destroyer of all creatures;\r\nand I am the cause of all efforts of all my creatures. O best of Munis,\r\nmy soul completely pervadeth all my creatures, but, O foremost of all\r\nregenerate ones, no one knoweth me. It is me that the pious and the\r\ndevoted worship in all the worlds. O regenerate one, whatever of pain\r\nthou hast felt within my stomach, know, O sinless one, that all that is\r\nfor thy happiness and good fortune. And whatever of mobile and immobile\r\nobjects thou hast seen in the world, everything hath been ordained by my\r\nSoul which is the Spring of all existence. The grandsire of all creatures\r\nis half my body; I am called Narayana, and I am bearer of the\r\nconch-shell, the discus and the mace. O regenerate Rishi, for a period\r\nmeasured by a thousand times the length of the Yugas, I who am the\r\nUniversal Soul sleep overwhelming all creatures in insensibility. And, O\r\nbest of regenerate Rishis, I stay here thus for all time, in the form of\r\na boy though I am old, until Brahma waketh up. O foremost of Brahmanas,\r\ngratified with thee, I who am Brahma have repeatedly granted thee boons,\r\nO thou who art worshipped by regenerate Rishis! Beholding one vast\r\nexpanse of water and seeing that all mobile and immobile creatures have\r\nbeen destroyed, thou wert afflicted with melancholy. I know this, and it\r\nis for this that I showed thee the universe (within my stomach). And\r\nwhile thou wert within my body, beholding the entire universe, thou wert\r\nfilled with wonder and deprived of thy senses. O regenerate Rishi, it is\r\nfor this that thou wert speedily brought out by me through my mouth. I\r\nhave (now) told thee of that Soul which is incapable of being\r\ncomprehended by the gods and the Asuras. And as long as that great\r\nascetic, the holy Brahma, doth not awake, thou, O regenerate Rishi, canst\r\nhappily and trustfully dwell here. And when that Grandsire of all\r\ncreatures awaketh up, I will then, O best of Brahmanas, alone create all\r\ncreatures endued with bodies, the firmament, the earth, light, the\r\natmosphere, water, and indeed all else of mobile and immobile creatures\r\n(that thou mayst have seen) on the earth!'\r\n\r\n'Markandeya continued, 'Having said so unto me that wonderful Deity\r\nvanished, O son, from my sight! I then beheld this varied and wondrous\r\ncreation start into life. O king, O thou foremost of the Bharata race, I\r\nwitnessed all this, so wonderful, O thou foremost of all virtuous men, at\r\nthe end of the Yuga! And the Deity, of eyes large as lotus leaves, seen\r\nby me, in days of yore is this tiger among men, this Janardana who hath\r\nbecome thy relative! It is in consequence of the boon granted to me by\r\nthis one that memory doth not fail me, that the period of my life, O son\r\nof Kunti, is so long and death itself is under my control. This is that\r\nancient and supreme Lord Hari of inconceivable soul who hath taken his\r\nbirth as Krishna of the Vrishni race, and who endued with mighty arms,\r\nseemeth to sport in this world! This one is Dhatri and Vidhatri, the\r\nDestroyer of all the Eternal, the bearer of the Sreevatsa mark on his\r\nbreast, the Lord of the lord of all creatures, the highest of the high,\r\ncalled also Govinda! Beholding this foremost of all gods, this\r\never-victorious Being, attired in yellow robes, this chief of the Vrishni\r\nrace, my recollection cometh back to me! This Madhava is the father and\r\nmother of all creatures! Ye bulls of the Kuru race, seek ye the refuge of\r\nthis Protector!'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, the sons of Pritha and those\r\nbulls among men--the twins, along with Draupadi, all bowed down unto\r\nJanardana. And that tiger among men deserving of every respect thus\r\nrevered by the sons of Pandu, then consoled them all with words of great\r\nsweetness.\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, once more asked the\r\ngreat Muni Markandeya about the future course of the government of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\"And Yudhishthira said, 'O thou foremost of all speakers, O Muni of\r\nBhrigu's race, that which we have heard from thee about the destruction\r\nand re-birth of all things at the end of the Yuga, is, indeed, full of\r\nwonder! I am filled with curiosity, however, in respect of what may\r\nhappen in the Kali age. When morality and virtue will be at an end, what\r\nwill remain there! What will be the prowess of men in that age, what\r\ntheir food, and what their amusements? What will be the period of life at\r\nthe end of the Yuga? What also is the limit, having attained which the\r\nKrita age will begin anew? Tell me all in detail, O Muni, for all that\r\nthou narratest is varied and delightful.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed, that foremost of Munis began his discourse again,\r\ndelighting that tiger of the Vrishni race and the sons of Pandu as well.\r\nAnd Markandeya said, 'Listen, O monarch, to all that hath been seen and\r\nheard by me, and to all, O king of kings, that hath been known to me by\r\nintuition from the grace of the God of gods! O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nlisten to me as I narrate the future history of the world during the\r\nsinful age. O bull of the Bharata race, in the Krita age, everything was\r\nfree from deceit and guile and avarice and covetousness; and morality\r\nlike a bull was among men, with all the four legs complete. In the Treta\r\nage sin took away one of these legs and morality had three legs. In the\r\nDwapara, sin and morality are mixed half and half; and accordingly\r\nmorality is said to have two legs only. In the dark age (of Kali), O thou\r\nbest of the Bharata race, morality mixed with three parts of sin liveth\r\nby the side of men. Accordingly morality then is said to wait on men,\r\nwith only a fourth part of itself remaining. Know, O Yudhishthira, that\r\nthe period of life, the energy, intellect and the physical strength of\r\nmen decrease in every Yuga! O Pandava, the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and\r\nVaisyas and Sudras, (in the Kali age) will practise morality and virtue\r\ndeceitfully and men in general will deceive their fellows by spreading\r\nthe net of virtue. And men with false reputation of learning will, by\r\ntheir acts, cause Truth to be contracted and concealed. And in\r\nconsequence of the shortness of their lives they will not be able to\r\nacquire much knowledge. And in consequence of the littleness of their\r\nknowledge, they will have no wisdom. And for this, covetousness and\r\navarice will overwhelm them all. And wedded to avarice and wrath and\r\nignorance and lust men will entertain animosities towards one another,\r\ndesiring to take one another's lives. And Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and\r\nVaisyas with their virtue contracted and divested of asceticism and truth\r\nwill all be reduced to an equality with the Sudras. And the lowest orders\r\nof men will rise to the position of the intermediate ones, and those in\r\nintermediate stations will, without doubt, descend to the level of the\r\nlowest ones. Even such, O Yudhishthira, will become the state of the\r\nworld at the end of the Yuga. Of robes those will be regarded the best\r\nthat are made of flax and of grain the Paspalum frumentacea[45] will be\r\nregarded the best. Towards this period men will regard their wives as\r\ntheir (only) friends. And men will live on fish and milk, goats and\r\nsheep, for cows will be extinct. And towards that period, even they that\r\nare always observant of vows, will become covetous. And opposed to one\r\nanother, men will, at such a time, seek one another's lives; and divested\r\nof Yuga, people will become atheists and thieves. And they will even dig\r\nthe banks of streams with their spades and sow grains thereon. And even\r\nthose places will prove barren for them at such a time. And those men who\r\nare devoted to ceremonial rites in honour of the deceased and of the\r\ngods, will be avaricious and will also appropriate and enjoy what belongs\r\nto others. The father will enjoy what belongs to the son; and the son,\r\nwhat belongs to the father. And those things will also be enjoyed by men\r\nin such times, the enjoyment of which hath been forbidden in the\r\nscriptures. And the Brahmanas, speaking disrespectfully of the Vedas,\r\nwill not practise vows, and their understanding clouded by the science of\r\ndisputation, they will no longer perform sacrifices and the Homa. And\r\ndeceived by the false science of reasons, they will direct their hearts\r\ntowards everything mean and low. And men will till low lands for\r\ncultivation and employ cows and calves that are one year old, in drawing\r\nthe plough and carrying burthens. And sons having slain their sires, and\r\nsires having slain their sons will incur no opprobrium. And they will\r\nfrequently save themselves from anxiety by such deeds, and even glory in\r\nthem. And the whole world will be filled with mleccha behaviour and\r\nnotions and ceremonies, and sacrifices will cease and joy will be nowhere\r\nand general rejoicing will disappear. And men will rob the possession of\r\nhelpless persons of those that are friendless and of wisdoms also. And,\r\npossessed of small energy and strength, without knowledge and given to\r\navarice and folly and sinful practices men will accept with joy the gifts\r\nmade by wicked people with words of contempt. And, O son of Kunti, the\r\nkings of the earth, with hearts wedded to sin without knowledge and\r\nalways boastful of their wisdom, will challenge one another from desire\r\nof taking one another's life. And the Kshatriyas also towards the end of\r\nsuch a period will become the thorns of the earth. And filled with\r\navarice and swelling with pride and vanity and, unable and unwilling to\r\nprotect (their subjects), they will take pleasure in inflicting\r\npunishments only. And attacking and repeating their attacks upon the good\r\nand the honest, and feeling no pity for the latter, even when they will\r\ncry in grief, the Kshatriyas will, O Bharata, rob these of their wives\r\nand wealth. And no one will ask for a girl (for purposes of marriage) and\r\nno one will give away a girl (for such purposes), but the girls will\r\nthemselves choose their lords, when the end of the Yuga comes. And the\r\nkings of the earth with souls steeped in ignorance, and discontented with\r\nwhat they have, will at such a time, rob their subjects by every means in\r\ntheir power. And without doubt the whole world will be mlecchified.[46]\r\nAnd when the end of the Yuga comes, the right hand will deceive the left;\r\nand the left, the right. And men with false reputation of learning will\r\ncontract Truth and the old will betray the senselessness of the young,\r\nand the young will betray the dotage of the old. And cowards will have\r\nthe reputation of bravery and the brave will be cheerless like cowards.\r\nAnd towards the end of the Yuga men will cease to trust one another. And\r\nfull of avarice and folly the whole world will have but one kind of food.\r\nAnd sin will increase and prosper, while virtue will fade and cease to\r\nflourish. And Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas will disappear,\r\nleaving, O king, no remnants of their orders. And all men towards the end\r\nof the Yuga will become members of one common order, without distinction\r\nof any kind. And sires will not forgive sons, and sons will not forgive\r\nsires. And when the end approaches, wives will not wait upon and serve\r\ntheir husbands. And at such a time men will seek those countries where\r\nwheat and barley form the staple food. And, O monarch, both men and women\r\nwill become perfectly free in their behaviour and will not tolerate one\r\nanother's acts. And, O Yudhishthira, the whole world will be mlecchified.\r\nAnd men will cease to gratify the gods by offerings of Sraddhas. And no\r\none will listen to the words of others and no one will be regarded as a\r\npreceptor by another. And, O ruler of men, intellectual darkness will\r\nenvelop the whole earth, and the life of man will then be measured by\r\nsixteen years, on attaining to which age death will ensue. And girls of\r\nfive or six years of age will bring forth children and boys of seven or\r\neight years of age will become fathers. And, O tiger among kings, when\r\nthe end of the Yuga will come, the wife will never be content with her\r\nhusband, nor the husband with his wife. And the possessions of men will\r\nnever be much, and people will falsely bear the marks of religion, and\r\njealousy and malice will fill the world. And no one will, at that time,\r\nbe a giver (of wealth or anything else) in respect to any one else. And\r\nthe inhabited regions of the earth will be afflicted with dearth and\r\nfamine, and the highways will be filled with lustful men and women of\r\nevil repute. And, at such a time, the women will also entertain an\r\naversion towards their husbands. And without doubt all men will adopt the\r\nbehaviour of the mlecchas, become omnivorous without distinction, and\r\ncruel in all their acts, when the end of the Yuga will come. And, O thou\r\nforemost of the Bharatas, urged by avarice, men will, at that time,\r\ndeceive one another when they sell and purchase. And without a knowledge\r\nof the ordinance, men will perform ceremonies and rites, and, indeed,\r\nbehave as listeth them, when the end of the Yuga comes. And when the end\r\nof the Yuga comes, urged by their very dispositions, men will act\r\ncruelly, and speak ill of one another. And people will, without\r\ncompunction, destroy trees and gardens. And men will be filled with\r\nanxiety as regards the means of living. And, O king, overwhelmed with\r\ncovetousness, men will kill Brahmanas and appropriate and enjoy the\r\npossessions of their victims. And the regenerate ones, oppressed by\r\nSudras, and afflicted with fear, and crying Oh and Alas, will wander over\r\nthe earth without anybody to protect them. And when men will begin to\r\nslay one another, and become wicked and fierce and without any respect\r\nfor animal life, then will the Yuga come to an end. And, O king, even the\r\nforemost of the regenerate ones, afflicted by robbers, will, like crows,\r\nfly in terror and with speed, and seek refuge, O perpetuator of the Kuru\r\nrace, in rivers and mountains and inaccessible regions. And always\r\noppressed by bad rulers with burthens of taxes, the foremost of the\r\nregenerate classes, O lord of the earth, will, in those terrible times,\r\ntake leave of all patience and do improper acts by becoming even the\r\nservants of the Sudras. And Sudras will expound the scriptures, and\r\nBrahmanas will wait upon and listen to them, and settle their course of\r\nduty accepting such interpretations as their guides. And the low will\r\nbecome the high, and the course of things will look contrary. And\r\nrenouncing the gods, men will worship bones and other relics deposited\r\nwithin walls. And, at the end of the Yuga, the Sudras will cease to wait\r\nupon and serve the Brahmanas. And in the asylums of great Rishis, and the\r\nteaching institutions of Brahmanas, and in places sacred to the gods and\r\nsacrificial compounds, and in sacred tanks, the earth will be disfigured\r\nwith tombs and pillars containing bony relics and not graced with temples\r\ndedicated to the gods. All this will take place at the end of the Yuga,\r\nand know that these are the signs of the end of the Yuga. And when men\r\nbecome fierce and destitute of virtue and carnivorous and addicted to\r\nintoxicating drinks, then doth the Yuga come to an end. And, O monarch,\r\nwhen flowers will be begot within flowers, and fruits within fruits, then\r\nwill the Yuga come to an end. And the clouds will pour rain unseasonably\r\nwhen the end of the Yuga approaches. And, at that time, ceremonial rites\r\nof men will not follow one another in due order, and the Sudras will\r\nquarrel with the Brahmanas. And the earth will soon be full of mlecchas,\r\nand the Brahmanas will fly in all directions for fear of the burthen of\r\ntaxes. And all distinctions between men will cease as regards conduct and\r\nbehaviour, and afflicted with honorary tasks and offices, people will fly\r\nto woody retreats, subsisting on fruits and roots. And the world will be\r\nso afflicted, that rectitude of conduct will cease to be exhibited\r\nanywhere. And disciples will set at naught the instructions of\r\npreceptors, and seek even to injure them. And preceptors impoverished\r\nwill be disregarded by men. And friends and relatives and kinsmen will\r\nperform friendly offices for the sake of the wealth only that is\r\npossessed by a person. And when the end of the Yuga comes, everybody will\r\nbe in want. And all the points of the horizon will be ablaze, and the\r\nstars and stellar groups will be destitute of brilliancy, and the planets\r\nand planetary conjunctions will be inauspicious. And the course of the\r\nwinds will be confused and agitated, and innumerable meteors will flash\r\nthrough the sky, foreboding evil. And the Sun will appear with six others\r\nof the same kind. And all around there will be din and uproar, and\r\neverywhere there will be conflagrations. And the Sun, from the hour of\r\nhis rising to that of setting, will be enveloped by Rahu. And the deity\r\nof a thousand eyes will shower rain unseasonably. And when the end of the\r\nYuga comes, crops will not grow in abundance. And the women will always\r\nbe sharp in speech and pitiless and fond of weeping. And they will never\r\nabide by the commands of their husbands. And when the end of the Yuga\r\ncomes, sons will slay fathers and mothers. And women, living\r\nuncontrolled, will slay their husbands and sons. And, O king, when the\r\nend of the Yuga comes, Rahu will swallow the Sun unseasonably. And fires\r\nwill blaze up on all sides. And travellers unable to obtain food and\r\ndrink and shelter even when they ask for these, will lie down on the\r\nwayside refraining from urging their solicitations. And when the end of\r\nthe Yuga comes, crows and snakes and vultures and kites and other animals\r\nand birds will utter frightful and dissonant cries. And when the end of\r\nthe Yuga comes, men will cast away and neglect their friends and\r\nrelatives and attendants. And, O monarch, when the end of the Yuga comes,\r\nmen abandoning the countries and directions and towns and cities of their\r\noccupation, will seek for new ones, one after another. And people will\r\nwander over the earth, uttering, 'O father, O son', and such other\r\nfrightful and rending cries.\r\n\r\n\"And when those terrible times will be over, the creation will begin\r\nanew. And men will again be created and distributed into the four orders\r\nbeginning with Brahmanas. And about that time, in order that men may\r\nincrease, Providence, according to its pleasure, will once more become\r\npropitious. And then when the Sun, the Moon, and Vrihaspati will, with\r\nthe constellation Pushya[47], enter the same sign, the Krita age will\r\nbegin again. And the clouds will commence to shower seasonably, and the\r\nstars and stellar conjunctions will become auspicious. And the planets,\r\nduly revolving in their orbits, will become exceedingly propitious. And\r\nall around, there will be prosperity and abundance and health and peace.\r\nAnd commissioned by Time, a Brahmana of the name of Kalki will take his\r\nbirth. And he will glorify Vishnu and possess great energy, great\r\nintelligence, and great prowess. And he will take his birth in a town of\r\nthe name of Sambhala in an auspicious Brahmana family. And vehicles and\r\nweapons, and warriors and arms, and coats of mail will be at his disposal\r\nas soon as he will think of them. And he will be the king of kings, and\r\never victorious with the strength of virtue. And he will restore order\r\nand peace in this world crowded with creatures and contradictory in its\r\ncourse. And that blazing Brahmana of mighty intellect, having appeared,\r\nwill destroy all things. And he will be the Destroyer of all, and will\r\ninaugurate a new Yuga.

And as the\r\ncountries of the earth will one after another be subjugated, that tiger\r\namong Brahmanas, Kalki, having placed deer skins and lances and tridents\r\nthere, will roam over the earth, adored by foremost Brahmanas and showing\r\nhis regard for them and engaged all the while in slaughtering thieves and\r\nrobbers. And he will exterminate the thieves and robbers amid\r\nheart-rending cries of 'Oh, father--' 'Oh, mother!--'O son!' and the\r\nlike, and O Bharata, when sin will thus have been rooted out and virtue\r\nwill flourish on arrival of the Krita age, men will once more betake\r\nthemselves to the practice of religious rites. And in the age that will\r\nset in, viz., the Krita, well-planted gardens and sacrificial compounds\r\nand large tanks and educational centres for the cultivation of Brahmanic\r\nlore and ponds and temples will re-appear everywhere. And the ceremonies\r\nand rites of sacrifices will also begin to be performed. And the\r\nBrahmanas will become good and honest, and the regenerate ones, devoted\r\nto ascetic austerities, will become Munis and the asylums of ascetics,\r\nwhich had before been filled with wretches will once more be homes of men\r\ndevoted to truth, and men in general will begin to honour and practise\r\ntruth. And all seeds, sown on earth, will grow, and, O monarch, every\r\nkind of crop will grow in every season. And men will devotedly practise\r\ncharity and vows and observances, and the Brahmanas devoted to meditation\r\nand sacrifices will be of virtuous soul and always cheerful, and the\r\nrulers of the earth will govern their kingdoms virtuously, and in the\r\nKrita age, the Vaisyas will be devoted to the practices of their order.\r\nAnd the Brahmanas will be devoted to their six-fold duties (of study,\r\nteaching, performance of sacrifices on their own account, officiating at\r\nsacrifices performed by others, charity and acceptance of gifts), and the\r\nKshatriyas will be devoted to feats of prowess. And Sudras will be\r\ndevoted to service of the three (high) orders,\r\n\r\n\"These, O Yudhishthira, are the courses of the Krita, the Treta, the\r\nDwapara and the succeeding age. I have now narrated to thee everything. I\r\nhave also told thee, O son of Pandu, the periods embraced by the several\r\nYugas as generally known. I have now told thee everything appertaining to\r\nboth the past and the future as narrated by Vayu in the Purana (which\r\ngoes by his name and) which is adored by the Rishis. Being immortal I\r\nhave many a time beheld and otherwise ascertained the courses of the\r\nworld. Indeed, all I have seen and felt I have now told thee. And, O thou\r\nof unfading glory, listen now with thy brothers to something else I will\r\npresently tell thee for clearing thy doubts about religion! O thou\r\nforemost of virtuous men, thou shouldst always fix thy soul on virtue,\r\nfor, O monarch, a person of virtuous soul obtaineth bliss both here and\r\nhereafter. And, O sinless one, listen to the auspicious words that I will\r\nnow speak to thee. Never do thou humiliate a Brahmana, for a Brahmana, if\r\nangry, may by his vow destroy the three worlds.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of Markandeya, the royal\r\nhead of the Kurus, endued with intelligence and possessed of great\r\nlustre, spoke these words of great wisdom, 'O muni, if I am to protect my\r\nsubjects, to what course of conduct should I adhere? And how should I\r\nbehave so that I may not fall away from the duties of my order?'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya, hearing this, answered, 'Be merciful to all creatures, and\r\ndevoted to their good. Love all creatures, scorning none. Be truthful in\r\nspeech, humble, with passions under complete control, and always devoted\r\nto the protection of thy people. Practise virtue and renounce sin, and\r\nworship thou the manes and the god and whatever thou mayst have done from\r\nignorance or carelessness, wash them off and expiate them by charity.\r\nRenouncing pride and vanity, be thou possessed to humility and good\r\nbehaviour. And subjugating the whole earth, rejoice thou and let\r\nhappiness be thine. This is the course of conduct that accords with\r\nvirtue. I have recited to thee all that was and all that will be regarded\r\nas virtuous. There is nothing appertaining to the past or the future that\r\nis unknown to thee. Therefore, O son, take not to heart this present\r\ncalamity of thine. They that are wise are never overwhelmed when they are\r\npersecuted by Time. O thou of mighty arms, the very dwellers of heaven\r\ncannot rise superior to Time. Time afflicts all creatures. O sinless one,\r\nlet not doubt cross thy mind regarding the truth of what I have told\r\nthee, for, if thou sufferest doubt to enter thy heart, thy virtue will\r\nsuffer diminution! O bull of the Bharata race, thou art born in the\r\ncelebrated family of the Kurus. Thou shouldst practise that which I have\r\ntold thee, in thought, word and deed.'\r\n\r\nYudhishthira answered, \"O thou foremost of the regenerate ones, at thy\r\ncommand I will certainly act according to all the instructions thou hast\r\ngiven me, and which, O lord, are all so sweet to the ear. O foremost of\r\nBrahmanas, avarice and lust I have none, and neither fear nor pride nor\r\nvanity. I shall, therefore, O lord, follow all that thou hast told me.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having listened to the words of the intelligent\r\nMarkandeya, the sons of Pandu, O king, along with the wielder of the bow\r\ncalled Saranga, and all those bulls among Brahmanas, and all others that\r\nwere there, became filled with joy.

And once upon a time\r\nParikshit went a-hunting. And as he was riding alone on a horse chasing\r\ndeer, the animal led him to a great distance (from the habitations of\r\nmen). And fatigued by the distance he had ridden and afflicted with\r\nhunger and thirst he beheld in that part of the country whither he had\r\nbeen led, a dark and dense forest, and the king, beholding that forest,\r\nentered it and seeing a delightful tank within the forest, both the rider\r\nand the horse bathed in it, and refreshed by the bath and placing before\r\nhis horse some stalks and fibres of the lotus, the king sat by the side\r\nof the tank. And while he was lying by the side of the tank, he heard\r\ncertain sweet strains of music, and hearing those strains, he reflected,\r\n'I do not see here the foot-prints of men. Whose and whence then these\r\nstrains?' And the king soon beheld a maiden of great beauty gathering\r\nflowers singing all the while, and the maiden soon came before the king,\r\nand the king thereupon asked her, 'Blessed one, who art thou and whose?'\r\nAnd she replied, 'I am a maiden.' And the king said, 'I ask thee to be\r\nmine.' And the maiden answered, 'Give me a pledge, for then only I can be\r\nthine, else not.' And the king then asked about the pledge and the girl\r\nanswered. 'Thou wilt never make me cast my eyes on water', and the king\r\nsaying, 'So be it,' married her, and king Parikshit having married her\r\nsported (with her) in great joy, and sat with her in silence, and while\r\nthe king was staying there, his troops reached the spot, and those troops\r\nbeholding the monarch stood surrounding him, and cheered by the presence\r\nof troops, the king entered a handsome vehicle accompanied by his (newly)\r\nwedded wife. And having arrived at his capital he began to live with her\r\nin privacy. And persons that were even near enough to the king could not\r\nobtain any interview with him and the minister-in-chief enquired of those\r\nfemales that waited upon the king, asking, 'What do ye do here?' And\r\nthose women replied, 'We behold here a female of unrivalled beauty. And\r\nthe king sporteth with her, having married her with a pledge that he\r\nwould never show her water.' And hearing those words, the\r\nminister-in-chief caused an artificial forest to be created, consisting\r\nof many trees with abundant flowers and fruits, and he caused to be\r\nexcavated within that forest and towards one of its sides a large tank,\r\nplaced in a secluded spot and full of water that was sweet as Amrita. The\r\ntank was well covered with a net of pearls. Approaching the king one day\r\nin private, he addressed the king saying, 'This is a fine forest without\r\nwater. Sport thou here joyfully!' And the king at those words of his\r\nminister entered that forest with that adorable wife of his, and the king\r\nsported with her in that delightful forest, and afflicted with hunger and\r\nthirst and fatigued and spent, the king beheld a bower of Madhavi\r\ncreepers[48] and entering that bower with his dear one, the king beheld a\r\ntank full of water that was transparent and bright as nectar, and\r\nbeholding that tank, the king sat on its bank with her and the king told\r\nhis adorable wife, 'Cheerfully do thou plunge into this water!' And she,\r\nhearing those words plunged into the tank. But having plunged into the\r\nwater she appeared not above the surface, and as the king searched, he\r\nfailed to discover any trace of her. And the king ordered the waters of\r\nthe tank to be baled out, and thereupon he beheld a frog sitting at the\r\nmouth of a hole, and the king was enraged at this and promulgated an\r\norder saying, 'Let frogs be slaughtered everywhere in my dominions!\r\nWhoever wishes to have an interview with me must come before me with a\r\ntribute of dead frogs.' And accordingly when frogs began to be terribly\r\nslaughtered, the affrighted frogs represented all that had happened unto\r\ntheir king, and the king of the frogs assuming the garb of an ascetic\r\ncame before the king Parikshit, and having approached the monarch, he\r\nsaid, 'O king, give not thyself up to wrath! Be inclined to grace. It\r\nbehoveth thee not to slay the innocent frogs.' Here occurs a couple of\r\nSlokas. (They are these):--'O thou of unfading glory, slay not the frogs!\r\nPacify thy wrath! The prosperity and ascetic merits of those that have\r\ntheir souls steeped in ignorance suffer diminution! Pledge thyself not to\r\nbe angry with the frogs! What need hast thou to commit such sin! What\r\npurpose will be served by slaying the frogs!' Then king Parikshit whose\r\nsoul was filled with woe on account of the death of her that was dear to\r\nhim, answered the chief of the frogs who had spoken to him thus, 'I will\r\nnot forgive the frogs. On the other hand, I will slay them. By these\r\nwicked wretches hath my dear one been swallowed up. The frogs, therefore,\r\nalways deserve to be killed by me. It behoveth thee not, O learned one,\r\nto intercede on their behalf.' And hearing these words of Parikshit, the\r\nking of the frogs with his senses and mind much pained said, 'Be inclined\r\nto grace, O king! I am the king of the frogs by name Ayu. She who was thy\r\nwife is my daughter of the name of Susobhana. This, indeed, is an\r\ninstance of her bad conduct. Before this, many kings were deceived by\r\nher.' The king thereupon said to him, 'I desire to have her. Let her be\r\ngranted to me by thee!' The king of the frogs thereupon bestowed his\r\ndaughter upon Parikshit, and addressing her said, 'Wait upon and serve\r\nthe king.' And having spoken these words to his daughter, he also\r\naddressed her in wrath saying, 'Since thou hast deceived many Kings for\r\nthis untruthful behaviour of thine, thy offspring will prove\r\ndisrespectful to Brahmanas!' But having obtained her, the king became\r\ndeeply enamoured of her in consequence of her companionable virtues, and\r\nfeeling that he had, as it were, obtained the sovereignty of the three\r\nworlds, he bowed down to the king of the frogs and reverenced him in due\r\nform and then with utterance choked in joy and tears said, 'I have been\r\nfavoured indeed!' And the king of the frogs obtaining the leave of his\r\ndaughter, returned to the place from which he had come and some time\r\nafter the king begot three sons upon her and those sons were named Sala\r\nand Dala and Vala, and some time after, their father, installing the\r\neldest of them of all on the throne and setting his heart on asceticism,\r\nretired into the forest. One day Sala while out a-hunting, beheld a deer\r\nand pursued it, on his car, and the prince said to his charioteer, 'Drive\r\nthou fast.' And the charioteer, thus addressed, replied unto the king,\r\nsaying, 'Do not entertain such a purpose. This deer is incapable of being\r\ncaught by thee. If indeed Vami horses had been yoked to thy car, then\r\ncouldst thou have taken it.' Thereupon the king addressed his charioteer,\r\nsaying, 'Tell me all about Vami horses, otherwise I will slay thee,' Thus\r\naddressed the charioteer became dreadfully alarmed and he was afraid of\r\nthe king and also of Vamadeva's curse and told not the king anything and\r\nthe king then lifting up his scimitar said to him, 'Tell me soon, else I\r\nwill slay thee.' At last afraid of the king, the charioteer said, 'The\r\nVami horses are those belonging to Vamadeva; they are fleet as the mind.'\r\nAnd unto his charioteer who had said so, the king said, 'Repair thou to\r\nthe asylum of Vamadeva.' And reaching the asylum of Vamadeva the king\r\nsaid unto that Rishi, 'O holy one, a deer struck by me is flying away. It\r\nbehoveth thee to make it capable of being seized by me by granting me thy\r\npair of Vami horses.' The Rishi then answered him saying, 'I give thee my\r\npair of Vami horses. But after accomplishing thy object, my Vami pair you\r\nshould soon return.' The king then taking those steeds and obtaining the\r\nleave of the Rishi pursued the deer, having yoked the Vami pair unto his\r\ncar, and after he had left the asylum he spoke unto his charioteer\r\nsaying, 'These jewels of steeds the Brahmanas do not deserve to possess.\r\nThese should not be returned to Vamadeva.' Having said this and seized\r\nthe deer he returned to his capital and placed those steeds within the\r\ninner apartments of the palace.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the Rishi reflected, 'The prince is young. Having obtained an\r\nexcellent pair of animals, he is sporting with it in joy without\r\nreturning it to me. Alas, what a pity it is!' And reflecting in this\r\nstrain, the Rishi said unto a disciple of his, after the expiration of a\r\nmonth, 'Go, O Atreya, and say to the king that if he has done with the\r\nVami steeds, he should return them unto thy preceptor.' And the disciple\r\nAtreya, thereupon, repairing to the king, spoke unto him as instructed,\r\nand the king replied saying, 'This pair of steeds deserves to be owned by\r\nkings. The Brahmanas do not deserve to possess jewels of such value. What\r\nbusiness have Brahmanas with horses? Return thou contentedly!' And\r\nAtreya, thus addressed by the king, returned and told his preceptor all\r\nthat had happened, and hearing this sad intelligence, Vamadeva's heart\r\nwas filled with wrath, and repairing in person to the king he asked him\r\nfor his steeds, and the king refused to give the Rishi what the latter\r\nasked, and Vamadeva said, 'O lord of earth, give me thou my Vami horses.\r\nBy them hast thou accomplished a task which was almost incapable of being\r\naccomplished by thee. By transgressing the practices of Brahmanas and\r\nKshatriyas, subject not thyself, O king, to death by means of the\r\nterrible noose of Varuna.' And hearing this, the king answered, 'O\r\nVamadeva, this couple of excellent well-trained, and docile bulls are fit\r\nanimals for Brahmanas. O great Rishi, (take them and) go with them\r\nwherever thou likest. Indeed, the very Vedas carry persons like thee.'\r\nThen Vamadeva said, 'O king, the Vedas do, indeed, carry persons like us.\r\nBut that is in the world hereafter. In this world, however, O king,\r\nanimals like these carry me and persons like me as also all others.' At\r\nthis the king answered, 'Let four assess carry thee, or four mules of the\r\nbest kind, or even four steeds endued with the speed of the wind. Go thou\r\nwith these. This pair of Vami horses, however, deserves to be owned by\r\nKshatriyas. Know thou, therefore, that these are not thine.' At this,\r\nVamadeva said, 'O king, terrible vows have been ordained for the\r\nBrahmanas. If I have lived in their observance, let four fierce and\r\nmighty Rakshasas of terrible mien and iron bodies, commanded by me,\r\npursue thee with desire of slaying, and carry thee on their sharp lances,\r\nhaving cut up thy body into four parts.' Hearing this, the king said,\r\n'Let those, O Vamadeva, that know thee as a Brahmana that in thought,\r\nword, and deed, is desirous of taking life, at my command, armed with\r\nbright lances and swords prostrate thee with thy disciples before me.'\r\nThen Vamadeva answered, 'O king, having obtained these my Vami steeds,\r\nthou hadst said, 'I will return them.' Therefore, give me back my Vami\r\nsteeds, so thou mayst be able to protect thy life.' Hearing this, the\r\nking said, 'Pursuit of deer hath not been ordained for the Brahmanas. I\r\ndo punish thee, however, for thy untruthfulness. From this day, too,\r\nobeying all thy commands I will, O Brahmana, attain to regions of bliss.'\r\nVamadeva then said, 'A Brahmana cannot be punished in thought, word or\r\ndeed. That learned person who by ascetic austerities succeedeth in\r\nknowing a Brahmana to be so, faileth not to attain to prominence in this\r\nworld.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'After Vamadeva had said this, there arose, O\r\nking, (four) Rakshasas of terrible mien, and as they, with lances in\r\ntheir hands, approached the king for slaying him, the latter cried aloud,\r\nsaying, 'If, O Brahmana, all the descendants of Ikshvaku's race, if (my\r\nbrother) Dala, if all these Vaisyas acknowledge my sway, then I will not\r\nyield up the Vami steeds to Vamadeva, for these men can never be\r\nvirtuous.' And while he was uttering those words, those Rakshasas slew\r\nhim, and the lord of earth was soon prostrated on the ground. And the\r\nIkshvakus, learning that their king had been slain, installed Dala on the\r\nthrone, and the Brahmana Vamadeva thereupon going to the kingdom (of the\r\nIkshvakus), addressed the new monarch, saying, 'O king, it hath been\r\ndeclared in all the sacred books that persons should give away unto\r\nBrahmanas. If thou fearest sin, O king, give me now the Vami steeds\r\nwithout delay.' And hearing these words of Vamadeva, the king in anger\r\nspoke unto his charioteer, saying, 'Bring me an arrow from those I have\r\nkept, which is handsome to behold and tempered with poison, so that\r\npierced by it Vamadeva may lie prostrate in pain, torn by the dogs.'\r\nHearing this, Vamadeva answered, 'I know, O king, that thou hast a son of\r\nten years of age, called Senajita, begotten upon thy queen. Urged by my\r\nword, slay thou that dear boy of thine without delay by means of thy\r\nfrightful arrows!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'At these words of Vamadeva, O king, that arrow of\r\nfierce energy, shot by the monarch, slew the prince in the inner\r\napartments, and hearing this, Dala said there and then, 'Ye people of\r\nIkshvaku's race, I will do ye good. I shall slay this Brahmana today,\r\ngrinding him with force. Bring me another arrow of fierce energy. Ye\r\nlords of earth, behold my prowess now.' And at these words of Dala,\r\nVamadeva said, 'This arrow of terrible mien and tempered with poison,\r\nthat thou aimest at me, thou shall not, O ruler of men, be able to aim\r\nnor even to shoot.' And thereupon the king said, 'Ye men of Ikshvaku's\r\nrace, behold me incapable of shooting the arrow that hath been taken up\r\nby me. I fail to compass the death of this Brahmana. Let Vamadeva who is\r\nblessed with a long life live.' Then Vamadeva said, 'Touching thy queen\r\nwith this arrow, thou mayst purge thyself of the sin (of attempting to\r\ntake the life of a Brahmana).' And king Dala did as he was directed and\r\nthe queen then addressed the Muni, and said, 'O Vamadeva, let me be able\r\nto duly instruct this wretched husband of mine from day to day, imparting\r\nunto him words of happy import; and let me always wait upon and serve the\r\nBrahmanas, and by this acquire, O Brahmana, the sacred regions\r\nhereafter.' And hearing these words of the queen, Vamadeva said, 'O thou\r\nof beautiful eyes, thou hast saved this royal race. Beg thou an\r\nincomparable boon. I will grant thee whatever thou mayst ask. And, O thou\r\nfaultless one, rule thou, O princess, these thy kinsmen and this great\r\nkingdom of the Ikshvakus!' And hearing these words of Vamadeva the\r\nprincess said, 'This, O holy one, is the boon I seek, viz., that my\r\nhusband may now be freed from his sin, and that thou mayst be employed in\r\nthinking of the weal of his son and kinsmen. This is the boon that I ask,\r\nO thou foremost of Brahmanas!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Hearing these words of the queen, that Muni, O\r\nthou foremost of the Kuru race, said, 'So be it.' And thereupon king Dala\r\nbecame highly glad and gave unto the Muni his Vami steeds, having bowed\r\ndown unto him with reverence!'\""

Ye need not enquire into the reason\r\nof this.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing this, O Bharata, the son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nalong with his brothers, then asked Markandeya saying, 'It hath been\r\nheard by us that both Vaka and Dalvya are of great souls and endowed with\r\nimmortality and that those Rishis, held in universal reverence, are the\r\nfriends of the chief of the gods. O Holy One, I desire to listen lo the\r\n(history of the) meeting of Vaka and Indra that is full of both joy and\r\nwoe. Narrate thou that history unto us succinctly.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'When that horrible conflict between the gods and the\r\nAsuras was over, Indra became the ruler of the three worlds. The clouds\r\nshowered rain copiously. And the dwellers of the world had abundance of\r\nharvests, and were excellent in disposition. And devoted to virtue, they\r\nalways practised morality and enjoyed peace. And all persons, devoted to\r\nthe duties of their respective orders, were perfectly happy and cheerful,\r\nand the slayer of Vala, beholding all the creatures of the world happy\r\nand cheerful, became himself filled with joy. And he of a hundred\r\nsacrifices, the chief of the gods seated on the back of his elephant\r\nAiravata, surveyed his happy subjects, and he cast his eyes on delightful\r\nasylums of Rishis, on various auspicious rivers, towns full of\r\nprosperity, and villages and rural regions in the enjoyment of plenty.\r\nAnd he also cast his eyes upon kings devoted to the practice of virtue\r\nand well-skilled in ruling their subjects. And he also looked upon tanks\r\nand reservoirs and wells and lakes and smaller lakes all full of water\r\nand adored by best of Brahmanas in the observance, besides, of various\r\nexcellent vows, and then descending on the delightful earth, O king, the\r\ngod of a hundred sacrifices, proceeded towards a blessed asylum teeming\r\nwith animals and birds, situated by the side of the sea, in the\r\ndelightful and auspicious regions of the East on a spot overgrown with\r\nabundance of vegetation. And the chief of the gods beheld Vaka in that\r\nasylum, and Vaka also, beholding the ruler of the Immortals, became\r\nhighly glad, and he worshipped Indra by presenting him with water to wash\r\nhis feet, a carpet to sit upon, the usual offering of the Arghya, and\r\nfruit and roots. And the boon-giving slayer of Vala, the divine ruler of\r\nthose that know not old age, being seated at his ease, asked Vaka the\r\nfollowing question, 'O sinless Muni, thou hast lived for a hundred years!\r\nTell me, O Brahmana, what the sorrows are of those that are immortal!'\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, \"Hearing this, Vaka answered, saying, 'Life with\r\npersons that are disagreeable, separation from those that are agreeable\r\nand beloved, companionship with the wicked, these are the evils which\r\nthey that are immortal have to bear. The death of sons and wives, of\r\nkinsmen and friends, and the pain of dependence on others, are some of\r\nthe greatest of evils. (These may all be noticed in a deathless life).\r\nThere is no more pitiable sight in the world, as I conceive, than that of\r\nmen destitute of wealth being insulted by others. The acquisition of\r\nfamily dignity by those that have it not, the loss of family dignity by\r\nthose that have it, unions and disunions,--these all are noticeable by\r\nthose that lead deathless lives. How they that have no family dignity but\r\nhave prosperity, win what they have not--all this, O god of a hundred\r\nsacrifices, is before thy very eyes! What can be more pitiable than the\r\ncalamities and reverses sustained by the gods, the Asuras, the\r\nGandharvas, men, the snakes, and the Rakshasas! They that have been of\r\ngood families suffer afflictions in consequence of their subjection to\r\npersons that are ill-born and the poor are insulted by the rich. What can\r\nbe more pitiable than these? Innumerable examples of such contradictory\r\ndispensations are seen in the world. The foolish and the ignorant are\r\ncheerful and happy while the learned and the wise suffer misery!\r\nPlentiful instances of misery and woe are seen among men in this world!\r\n(They that lead deathless lives are destined to behold all these and\r\nsuffer on that account.)'\r\n\r\n\"Indra then said, 'O thou of great good fortune, tell me again, what the\r\njoys are of those persons that lead deathless lives,--joys that are\r\nadored by gods and Rishis!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaka answered, 'If without having to associate with a wicked friend, a\r\nman cooks scanty vegetables in his own house at the eight or the twelfth\r\npart of the day, there can be nothing happier than that.[49] He in whose\r\ncase the day is not counted is not called voracious. And, O Maghavan,\r\nhappiness is even his own whose scanty vegetables are cooked. Earned by\r\nhis own efforts, without having to depend upon any one, he that eateth\r\neven fruits and vegetables in his own house is entitled to respect. He\r\nthat eateth in another's house the food given to him in contempt, even if\r\nthat food be rich and sweet, doth what is despicable. This, therefore, is\r\nthe opinion of the wise that fie on the food of that mean wretch who like\r\na dog or a Rakshasa eateth at another's house. If after treating guests\r\nand servants and offering food to the manes a good Brahmana eateth what\r\nremains, there can be nothing happier than that. There is nothing sweeter\r\nor more sacred, O thou of a hundred sacrifices, than that food which such\r\na person takes after serving the guest with the first portion thereof.\r\nEach mouthful (of rice) that the Brahmana eats after having served the\r\nguest, produces merit equal to what attaches to the gift of a thousand\r\nkine. And whatever sins such a one may have committed in his youth are\r\nall washed away of a certainty. The water in the hands of the Brahmana\r\nthat hath been fed and honoured with a pecuniary gift (after the feeding\r\nis over) when touched with water (sprinkled by him that feeds), instantly\r\npurges off all the sins of the latter!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of these and various other things with Vaka, the chief of the\r\ngods went away to heaven.'\"[50]"

A certain king of the name of Suhotra belonging to the\r\nKuru race went on a visit to the great Rishis. And as he was returning\r\nfrom that visit, he beheld king Sivi the son of Usinara, seated on his\r\ncar, and as each came before the other, each saluted the other as best\r\nbefitted his age and each regarding himself as the equal of the other in\r\nrespect of qualities, refused to give the way to the other. And at this\r\njuncture Narada appeared there, and beholding what had happened, the\r\ncelestial Rishi asked, 'Why is it that ye both stand here blocking each\r\nother's way?' And thus questioned both of them spoke to Narada saying, 'O\r\nholy one, do not speak so. The sages of old have declared that the way\r\nshould be given to one who is superior or to him that is abler. We,\r\nhowever, that stand blocking each other's way are equal to each other in\r\nevery respect. Judged properly there is no superiority amongst us.' Thus\r\naddressed by them, Narada recited three slokas. (They are these), 'O thou\r\nof the Kuru race, he that is wicked behaveth wickedly even unto him that\r\nis humble; he also that is humble behaveth with humility and honestly\r\nunto him that is wicked! He that is honest behaveth honestly even towards\r\nthe dishonest. Why should he not behave honestly towards him that is\r\nhonest? He that is honest regardeth the service that is done to him, as\r\nif it were a hundred times greater than it is. Is this not current\r\namongst the gods themselves? Certainly it is the royal son of Usinara who\r\nis possessed of goodness that is greater than thine. One should conquer\r\nthe mean by charity; the untruthful by truth, the man of wicked deeds by\r\nforgiveness; and the dishonest by honesty. Both of you are large-hearted.\r\nLet one amongst you stand aside, according to the indication of the above\r\nslokas.' And having said so Narada became silent, and hearing what Narada\r\nhad said the king of the Kuru race walking round Sivi, and praising his\r\nnumerous achievements, gave him the way and went on in his course.

And addressing each other,--'Well'--Agni and Indra came\r\nto the earth. And Agni took the form of a pigeon flying away from Indra\r\nwho pursued him in the form of a hawk, and that pigeon fell upon the lap\r\nof king Sivi who was seated on an excellent seat. And the priest\r\nthereupon addressing the king said, 'Afraid of the hawk and desirous of\r\nsaving its life, this pigeon hath come to thee for safety. The learned\r\nhave said that the falling of a pigeon upon one's body forebodeth a great\r\ndanger. Let the king that understands omens give away wealth for saving\r\nhimself from the danger indicated.' And the pigeon also addressed the\r\nking and said, 'Afraid of the hawk and desirous of saving my life I have\r\ncome to thee for protection. I am a Muni. Having assumed the form of a\r\npigeon, I come to thee as a seeker of thy protection. Indeed, I seek thee\r\nas my life. Know me as one possessed of Vedic lore, as one leading the\r\nBrahmacharya mode of life, as one possessed also of self-control and\r\nascetic virtues. And know me further as one that has never spoken\r\ndisagreeably unto his preceptor, as one possessed of every virtue indeed,\r\nas one that is sinless. I repeat the Vedas, I know their prosody; indeed,\r\nI have studied all the Vedas letter by letter. I am not a pigeon. Oh, do\r\nnot yield me up to the hawk. The giving up of a learned and pure Brahmana\r\ncan never be a good gift.' And after the pigeon said so, the hawk\r\naddressed the king, and said, 'Creatures do not come into the world in\r\nthe same particular order. In the order of creation, thou mayst, in a\r\nformer birth, have been begotten by this pigeon. It is not proper for\r\nthee, O king, to interfere with my food by protecting this pigeon (even\r\nthough he might have been thy father).' And thus addressed, the king\r\nsaid, 'Hath any one, before this, seen birds thus speak the pure speech\r\nof man? Knowing what this pigeon sayeth, and this hawk also, how can we\r\nact to-day according to virtue? He that giveth up an affrighted creature\r\nseeking protection, unto its foe, doth not obtain protection when he is\r\nin need of it himself. Indeed, the very clouds do not shower rain\r\nseasonably for him, and the seeds though scattered do not grow for him.\r\nHe that giveth up an afflicted creature seeking protection unto its foe,\r\nhath to see his offspring die in childhood. The ancestor of such a person\r\ncan never dwell in heaven; indeed, the very gods decline to accept the\r\nlibations of clarified butter poured by him into the fire. He that giveth\r\nup an affrighted creature seeking protection, unto its foe, is struck\r\nwith the thunder-bolt by the gods with Indra at their head. The food that\r\nhe eateth is unsanctified, and he, of a narrow soul, falleth from heaven\r\nvery soon. O hawk, let the people of the Sivi tribe place before thee a\r\nbull cooked with rice instead of this pigeon. And let them also carry to\r\nthe place where thou livest in joy, meat in abundance.' And hearing this,\r\nthe hawk said, 'O king, I do not ask for a bull, nor, indeed, any other\r\nmeat, nor meat more in quantity than that of this pigeon. It hath been\r\ngiven to me by the gods. The creature, therefore, is my food today in\r\nconsequence of its death that hath been ordained. Therefore, O monarch,\r\ngive it up to me.' Thus addressed by the hawk, the king said, 'Let my men\r\nsee and carefully carry the bull to thee with every limb entire. Let that\r\nbull be the ransom of this creature afflicted with fright and let it be\r\ncarried to thee before my eyes. Oh, slay not this pigeon! I will yield up\r\nmy very life, yet I would not give up this pigeon. Dost thou not know, O\r\nhawk, that this creature looketh like a sacrifice with the Soma juice? O\r\nblessed one, cease to take so much trouble for it. I cannot, by any\r\nmeans, yield up the pigeon to thee. Or, O hawk, if it pleases thee,\r\ncommand me to do some such thing which I may do for thee, which may be\r\nagreeable to thee, and upon doing which the men of the Sivi tribe may yet\r\nin joy bless me in terms of applause. I promise thee that I will do what\r\nthou mayst did me do.' And at this appeal of the king, the hawk said, 'O\r\nking, if thou givest me as much flesh as would be equal to the weight of\r\nthe pigeon, cutting it off thy right thigh; then can the pigeon be\r\nproperly saved by thee; then wouldst thou do what would be agreeable to\r\nme and what the men of the Sivi tribe would speak of in terms of praise.'\r\nAnd the king agreed to this and he cut off a piece of flesh from his\r\nright thigh and weighed it against the pigeon. But the pigeon weighed\r\nheavier. And thereupon the king cut off another piece of his flesh, but\r\nthe pigeon still weighed heavier, and then the king cut off pieces of\r\nflesh from all parts of his body and placed them on the scale. But the\r\npigeon still weighed heavier, and then the king himself ascended the\r\nscale and he felt no grief at this and beholding this, the hawk\r\ndisappeared there saying--(The pigeon hath been) Saved,--And the king\r\nasked the pigeon saying, 'O pigeon, let the Sivis know who the hawk is.\r\nNone but the lord of the universe could do as he did. O Holy One, answer\r\nthou this question of mine!' And the pigeon then said, 'I am the\r\nsmoke-bannered Agni called also Vaiswanara. The hawk is none other than\r\nSachi's lord armed with the thunder-bolt. O son of Suratha, thou art a\r\nbull among men. We came to try thee. These pieces of flesh, O king, that\r\nthou hast cut off with thy sword from thy body for saving me have caused\r\ngashes in thy body.

And Narada, saying, So be it, mounted on\r\nthe car, and one among those kings having gratified the holy and\r\ncelestial Rishi Narada, said, O Holy One, I desire, to ask thee\r\nsomething.' And the Rishi said, 'Ask.' And the person, thus permitted,\r\nsaid, 'All four of us are blessed with long lives and have indeed every\r\nvirtue. We shall, therefore, be permitted to go to a certain heaven and\r\ndwell there for a long period. Who amongst us, however, O king, shall\r\nfall down first?' Thus questioned the Rishi said, 'This Ashtaka shall\r\nfirst come down.' And thereupon the enquirer asked, 'For what cause?' And\r\nthe Rishi answered, 'I lived for a few days in the abode of Ashtaka. He\r\ncarried me (one day) on his car out of the town and there I beheld\r\nthousands of kine distinguished from one another by difference of hue.\r\nAnd beholding those kine I asked Ashtaka whose they were and Ashtaka\r\nanswered me, saying, 'I have given away these kine. By this answer he\r\ngave expression to his own praise. It is for this answer of his that\r\nAshtaka shall have to come down.' And after Narada had said so, one of\r\nthem again enquired, saying, 'Three of us then will stay in heaven.\r\nAmongst us three, who shall fall down first?' And the Rishi answered,\r\nPratardana.' And the enquirer asked, 'For what cause?' And the Rishi\r\nanswered, 'I lived for some days in the abode of Pratardana also. And he\r\ncarried me on his car one day. And while doing so, a Brahmana asked him\r\nsaying, 'Give me a horse!' And Pratardana replied, 'After returning, I\r\nwill give thee one!' And thereupon the Brahmana said, 'Let it be given to\r\nme soon.' And as the Brahmana spoke those words, the king gave unto him\r\nthe steed that had been yoked on the right-hand wheel of the car. And\r\nthere came unto him another Brahmana desirous of obtaining a steed. And\r\nthe king having spoken to him in the same way, gave him the steed that\r\nhad been yoked on the left wheel of his car. And having given away the\r\nhorse unto him, the king proceeded on his journey. And then there came\r\nunto the king another Brahmana desirous of obtaining a horse. And the\r\nking soon gave him the horse on the left front of his car, unyoking the\r\nanimal. And having done so, the king proceeded on his journey. And then\r\nthere came unto the king another Brahmana desirous of obtaining a horse.\r\nAnd the king said unto him, 'Returning, I will give thee a horse.' But\r\nthe Brahmana said, 'Let the steed be given to me soon.' And the king gave\r\nhim the only horse he had. And seizing the yoke of the car himself, the\r\nking began to draw it. And as he did so, he said, 'There is now nothing\r\nfor the Brahmanas.' The king had given away, it is true, but he had done\r\nso with detraction. And for that speech of his, he shall have to fall\r\ndown from heaven. And after the Rishi had said so, of the two that\r\nremained, one asked, 'Who amongst us two shall fall down?' And the Rishi\r\nanswered, 'Vasumanas.' And the enquirer asked, 'For what reason?' And\r\nNarada said, 'In course of my wanderings I arrived at the abode of\r\nVasumanas. And at that time the Brahmanas were performing the ceremony of\r\nSwastivachana for the sake of a flowery car.[51] And I approached the\r\nking's presence. And after the Brahmanas had completed the ceremony, the\r\nflowery car became visible to them. And I praised that car, and thereupon\r\nthe king told me, 'Holy one, by thee hath this car been praised. Let this\r\ncar, therefore, be thine.' And after this I went to Vasumanas another\r\ntime when I was in need of a (flowery) car. And I admired the car, and\r\nthe king said, 'It is thine.' And I went to the king a third time and\r\nadmired the car again. And even then the king exhibiting the flowery car\r\nto the Brahmanas, cast his eyes on me, and said, 'O holy one, thou hast\r\npraised the flowery car sufficiently.\" And the king only said these\r\nwords, without making me a gift of that car. And for this he will fall\r\ndown from heaven.'\r\n\r\n\"And one among them said, 'Of the one who is to go with thee, who will go\r\nand who will fall down?' And Narada answered, saying, 'Sivi will go, but\r\nI will fall down.' 'For what reason?' asked the enquirer. And Narada\r\nsaid, 'I am not the equal of Sivi. For one day a Brahmana came unto Sivi\r\nand addressing him, said, 'O Sivi, I came to thee for food.' And Sivi\r\nreplied unto him, saying. 'What shall I do? Let me have thy orders.' And\r\nthe Brahmana answered, 'This thy son known by the name of Vrihadgarbha\r\nshould be killed. And, O king, cook him for my food.' And hearing this, I\r\nwaited to see what would follow. And Sivi then killed his son and cooking\r\nhim duly and placing that food in a vessel and taking it upon his head,\r\nhe went out in search of the Brahmana and while Sivi was thus seeking,\r\nfor the Brahmana, some one told him, The Brahmana thou seekest, having\r\nentered thy city, is setting fire to thy abode and he is also setting\r\nfire, in wrath, to thy treasury, thy arsenal, the apartments of the\r\nfemales and thy stables for horses and elephants.' And Sivi heard all\r\nthis, without change of colour, and entering his city spoke unto the\r\nBrahmana, 'O holy one, the food has been cooked.' And the Brahmana\r\nhearing this spoke not a word and from surprise he stood with downcast\r\nlooks. And Sivi with a view to gratifying the Brahmana said, 'O holy one,\r\neat thou this.' And the Brahmana looking at Sivi for a moment said, 'Eat\r\nit thyself.' And thereupon Sivi said, 'Let it be so.' And Sivi cheerfully\r\ntaking the vessel from his head desired to eat it and thereupon the\r\nBrahmana caught hold of Sivi's hand and addressing him said, 'Thou hast\r\nconquered wrath. There is nothing that thou canst not give unto the\r\nBrahmanas.' And saying this, that Brahmana adored Sivi, and then as Sivi\r\ncast his eyes before him, he beheld his son standing like a child of the\r\ngods, decked in ornaments and yielding a fragrance from his body and the\r\nBrahmana, having accomplished all this, made himself visible and it was\r\nVidhatri himself who had thus come in that guise to try that royal sage,\r\nand after Vidhatri had disappeared, the counsellors addressed the king,\r\nsaying, 'Thou knowest everything. For what didst thou do all this?' And\r\nSivi answered, 'It was not for fame, nor for wealth, nor from desire of\r\nacquiring objects of enjoyment that I did all this. This course is not\r\nsinful. It is for this that I do all this. The path which is trodden by\r\nthe virtuous is laudable. My heart always inclineth towards such a\r\ncourse.

O, tell me about the\r\nrespective merits reaped from the practice of charity in these different\r\nstages of life?'\r\n\r\nMarkandeya said, 'Life that is futile is of four kinds. Charity also that\r\nis futile is of sixteen kinds. His life is vain who hath no son; and his\r\nalso who is out of pale of virtue: and his too who liveth on the food of\r\nother; and, lastly, his who cooketh for himself without giving therefrom\r\nunto the Pitris, the gods, and the guests, and who eateth of it before\r\nthese all. The gift to one that has fallen away from the practice of\r\nvirtuous vows, as also the gift of wealth that has been earned wrongly,\r\nare both in vain. The gift to a fallen Brahmana, that to a thief, that\r\nalso to a preceptor that is false, is in vain. The gift to an untruthful\r\nman, to a person that is sinful, to one that is ungrateful, to one that\r\nofficiates at sacrifices performed by all classes of people residing in a\r\nvillage, to one that sells the Vedas,[52] to a Brahmana that cooks for\r\nSudra, to one that too by birth is a Brahmana but who is destitute of the\r\noccupations of his order, is in vain. The gift to one that has married a\r\ngirl after the accession of puberty, to females, to one that sports with\r\nsnakes, and to one that is employed in menial offices, is also in vain.\r\nThese sixteen kinds of gifts are productive of no merits. That man who\r\nwith mind clouded with darkness giveth away from fear or anger, enjoyeth\r\nthe merit of such gift while he is in the womb of his mother. The man who\r\n(under other circumstances) maketh gifts unto the Brahmanas, enjoyeth the\r\nfruit thereof while he is in old age. Therefore, O king, the man who\r\nwishes to win the way of heaven, should under all conditions, make gifts\r\nunto Brahmanas of everything that he wishes to give away.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'By what means do Brahmanas, who accept gifts from\r\nall the four orders, save others as well as themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'By Japa,[53] and Mantras,[54] and Homa[55] and the\r\nstudy of the Vedas, the Brahmanas construct a Vedic boat[56] wherewith\r\nthey save both others and themselves. The gods themselves are pleased\r\nwith that man who gratifieth the Brahmanas. Indeed, a man may attain\r\nheaven at the command of a Brahmana. Thou wilt, O king, without doubt\r\nascend to regions of everlasting bliss, in consequence of thy worship of\r\nthe Pitris and the gods, and thy reverence for the Brahmanas, even though\r\nthy body is filled with phlegmatic humours and withal so dull and inert!\r\nHe that desires virtue and heaven should adore the Brahmanas. One should\r\nfeed Brahmanas with care on occasions of Sraddhas, although those among\r\nthem that are cursed or fallen should be excluded. They also should be\r\ncarefully excluded that are either excessively fair or excessively black,\r\nthat have diseased nails, that are lepers, that are deceitful, that are\r\nborn in bastardy of widows or of women having husbands alive; and they\r\nalso that support themselves by the profession of arms. That Sraddha\r\nwhich is censurable, consumeth the performer thereof like fire consuming\r\nfuel. If they that are to be employed in Sraddhas happen to be dumb,\r\nblind, or deaf, care should be taken to employ them along with Brahmanas\r\nconversant with the Vedas. O Yudhishthira, listen now unto whom thou\r\nshouldst give. He that knoweth all the Vedas should give only to that\r\nable Brahmana who is competent to rescue both the giver and himself, for\r\nhe, indeed, is to be regarded as able who can rescue both the giver and\r\nhimself. O son of Pritha, the sacred fires do not receive such\r\ngratification from libations of clarified butter, from offerings of\r\nflowers and sandal and other perfumed pastes as from the entertainment of\r\nguests. Therefore, do thou strive to entertain guests, O son of Pandu! O\r\nking, they that give unto guests water to wash their feet, butter to rub\r\nover their (tired) legs, light during the hours of darkness, food, and\r\nshelter, have not to go before Yama. The removal (after worship) of the\r\nflowery offerings unto the gods, the removal of the remnants of a\r\nBrahmana's feast, waiting (upon a Brahmana) with perfumed pastes, and the\r\nmassaging of a Brahmana's limbs, are, each of them, O foremost of kings,\r\nproductive of greater merit than the gift of kine. A person, without\r\ndoubt, rescueth himself by the gift of a Kapila cow. Therefore, should\r\none give away a Kapila cow decked with ornaments unto Brahmanas. O thou\r\nof the Bharata race, one should give unto a person of good lineage and\r\nconversant with the Vedas; unto a person that is poor; unto one leading a\r\ndomestic mode of life but burdened with wife and children; unto one that\r\ndaily adoreth the sacred fire; and unto one that hath done thee no\r\nservice. Thou shouldst always give unto such persons but not to them that\r\nare in affluence. What merit is there, O thou foremost of the Bharata\r\nrace, by giving unto one that is affluent? One cow must be given unto one\r\nBrahmana. A single cow must not be given unto many. For if the cow so\r\ngiven away (unto many) be sold, the giver's family is lost for three\r\ngenerations. Such a gift would not assuredly rescue the giver nor the\r\nBrahmana that takes it. He who giveth eighty Ratis of pure gold, earneth\r\nthe merit of giving away a hundred pieces of gold for ever. He that\r\ngiveth away a strong bull capable also of drawing the plough, is\r\ncertainly rescued from all difficulties and finally goeth to heaven. He\r\nthat giveth away land unto a learned Brahmana, hath all his desires\r\nfulfilled. The tired traveller, with weakened limbs and feet besmeared\r\nwith dust, asks for the name of him that may give him food. There are men\r\nwho answer him by telling him the name. That wise man who informs these\r\ntoil-worn ones of the name of the person who may give them food, is,\r\nwithout doubt, regarded as equal in merit unto the giver himself of food.\r\nTherefore, abstaining from other kinds of gift, give thou food. There is\r\nno merit (arising out of gifts) that is so great as that of giving food.\r\nThe man that according to the measure of his might gives well-cooked and\r\npure food unto the Brahmanas, acquires, by that act of his, the\r\ncompanionship of Prajapati (Brahma). There is nothing superior to food.\r\nTherefore, food is regarded as the first and foremost of all things (to\r\nbe given away). It hath been said that food itself is Prajapati. And\r\nPrajapati is regarded as the Year. And the Year is sacrifice. And\r\neverything is established in sacrifice, for it is from sacrifice that all\r\ncreatures, mobile and immobile, take their origin. For this reason, it\r\nhath been heard by us, food is the foremost of all things. They that give\r\naway lakes and large pieces of water, and tanks and wells, and shelter\r\nand food and they that have sweet words for all, have not to hear the\r\nadmonitions of Yama. With him who gives rice, and wealth earned by his\r\nlabour, unto Brahmana of good behaviour, the earth is satisfied. And she\r\npoureth upon him showers of wealth. The giver of food walketh first,\r\nafter him the speaker of truth and he that giveth unto persons that do\r\nnot solicit. But the three go to the same place.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'Hearing all this, Yudhishthira, along with his\r\nyounger brothers, impelled by curiosity, again addressed the high-souled\r\nMarkandeya, saying, 'O great Muni, what is the distance of Yama's region\r\nfrom that of men? What is its measurement? How also do men pass it over?\r\nAnd by what means? O, tell me all this!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'O king, O them foremost of virtuous men, this question\r\nof thine appertains to a great mystery. It is sacred and much applauded\r\nby the Rishis. Appertaining as it also does to virtue, I will speak of it\r\nto thee. The distance of Yama's region from the abode of men is, O king,\r\neighty-six thousand Yojanas! The way is over space, without water, and\r\nvery terrible to behold; Nowhere on that road is the shade of a tree,\r\nnowhere any water, and nowhere any resting place in which the traveller,\r\nwhen fatigued, may rest for some moments. And men and women and all on\r\nearth that have life, are forcibly led along this way by the messengers\r\nof Yama. Those creatures that obey the mandates of the grim king, and\r\nthey, O king, that have given horses and other good conveyances unto\r\nBrahmanas, proceed along this way on those animals and vehicles. And they\r\nthat have given umbrellas proceed along this way with umbrellas warding\r\noff the sun's rays. And they that have given food, proceed without\r\nhunger, while they that have not given food proceed afflicted with\r\nhunger. And they that have given robes, proceed along this way attired in\r\nrobes while they that have given none, proceed naked. And they that have\r\ngiven gold, proceed in happiness, themselves decked in ornaments. And\r\nthey that have given land, proceed with every desire completely\r\ngratified. And they that have given grain, proceed without being\r\nafflicted with any want. And they that have given houses, proceed happily\r\non cars. And those men that have given something to drink, proceed with\r\ncheerful hearts unafflicted with thirst. And they that have given lights,\r\nproceed happily lighting the way before them. And they that have given\r\nkine, proceed along the way happily, freed from all their sins. And they\r\nthat have fasted for a month, proceed on cars drawn by swans. And they\r\nwho have fasted for six nights, proceed on cars drawn by peacocks. And, O\r\nson of Pandu, he that fasteth three nights upon only one meal without a\r\nsecond during this period goeth into a region free from disease and\r\nanxiety. And water hath this excellent property that it produceth\r\nhappiness in the region of Yama. And they that give water find for\r\nthemselves a river there of the name of Pushpodaka. And the givers of\r\nwater on the earth drink cool and ambrosial draughts from that stream.\r\nAnd they that are of evil deeds have pus ordained for them. Thus, O great\r\nking, that river serveth all purposes. Therefore, O king, adore thou duly\r\nthese Brahmanas (that are with thee). Weak in limbs owing to the way he\r\nhas walked, and besmeared with the dust of the high-road, the traveller\r\nenquireth for the name of him who giveth food, and cometh in hope to his\r\nhouse. Adore thou him with reverent attention, for he indeed is a guest,\r\nand he is a Brahmana. The gods with Indra at their head follow him as he\r\nproceedeth. And if he is adored, the gods with Indra become gratified,\r\nand if he is not adored, the celestials with their chief become\r\ncheerless. Therefore, O thou foremost of kings, worship thou these\r\nBrahmanas duly. I have thus spoken to thee upon a hundred subjects. What\r\ndost thou desire to hear from me again?'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O master, conversant thou art with virtue and\r\nmorality, and so I desire to repeatedly listen to thee as thou speakest\r\non sacred subjects appertaining to virtue and morals.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'O king, I will now speak on another sacred subject\r\nappertaining to eternal interests and capable of washing off all sins.\r\nListen thou with rapt attention. O thou foremost of the Bharatas, the\r\nmerit equal to that of giving away a Kapila cow in (the tirtha called)\r\nJyeshtha-Pushkara arises from washing the feet of Brahmanas. As long as\r\nthe earth remains wet with water which a Brahmana hath touched with his\r\nfeet, so long do Pitris drink water of cups made of lotus-leaves. If the\r\nguest is welcomed (with enquiries about his welfare), the deities of fire\r\nbecome glad; and if he is offered a seat, it is the god of a hundred\r\nsacrifices, who is gratified. If his feet are washed, it is the Pitris\r\nwho are delighted; and if he is fed it is Prajapati that is pleased. One\r\nshould with collected soul, give a cow when (during her throes) the feet\r\nand head of her calf are visible, before her delivery is complete. A cow\r\nwith her calf in the air in course of falling from the uterus to the\r\nearth, is to be regarded as equal to the earth herself. He, therefore,\r\nthat giveth away such a cow, reapeth the merit of giving away the earth.\r\nAnd he that giveth away such a cow, is adored in heaven for as many\r\nthousands of Yugas as there are bristles on the bodies of the animal and\r\nher young one together. And, O Bharata, he that having accepted a thing\r\nin gift giveth it away immediately unto a person that is virtuous and\r\nhonest, reapeth very great merit. Without doubt, he reapeth the fruit of\r\ngiving away the whole earth to her utmost limits and with her oceans and\r\nseas and caves, her mountains and forests and woods. That Brahmana who\r\neateth in silence from a plate, keeping his hands between his knees,\r\nsucceedeth in rescuing others. And those Brahmanas that abstain from\r\ndrink and who are never spoken of by others as having any faults and who\r\ndaily read the Samhitas, are capable of rescuing others. Libations of\r\nbutter and edible offerings should all be presented to a Brahmana who is\r\nlearned in the Vedas. And as libations of clarified butter poured into\r\nfire never go in vain, so gift to virtuous Brahmanas learned in the Vedas\r\ncan never go in vain. The Brahmanas have anger for their weapon; they\r\nnever fight with arms of iron and steel. Indeed the Brahmanas slay with\r\nanger like Indra slaying the Asuras with his thunder-bolt.\r\n\r\nThus prelection appertaining to virtue and morality is now over. Hearing\r\nthis, the Munis of the forest of Naimisha were filled with delight. And\r\nthose ascetics were also freed from grief and anger by listening to it.\r\nAnd they were also purged of all their sins in consequence of this. And,\r\nO king, those human beings that listen to it become freed from the\r\nobligation of rebirth.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great wisdom, what purification is there\r\nby which a Brahmana may always keep himself pure? I desire to hear of it\r\nfrom thee, O thou foremost of all virtuous men!\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya answered, 'There are three kinds of purity, viz., purity in\r\nspeech, purity in deed, and purity achieved by use of water. He that has\r\nrecourse to these three different kinds of purity, attains, without\r\ndoubt, to heaven. That Brahmana who adoreth the goddess Sandhya in the\r\nmorning and the evening, and who recites meditatively the sacred goddess\r\nGayatri who is the mother of the Vedas, sanctified by the latter, is\r\nfreed from all his sins. Even if he accepts in gift the entire earth with\r\nher oceans, he doth not, on that account, suffer the least unhappiness.\r\nAnd those heavenly bodies in the sky including the sun that may be\r\ninauspicious and hostile towards him soon become auspicious and\r\nfavourable towards him in consequence of these acts of his, while those\r\nstars that are auspicious and favourable become more auspicious and more\r\nfavourable in consequence of such conduct of his. And terrible Rakshasas\r\nsubsisting on animal food, or gigantic and fierce mien, all become unable\r\nto prevail over a Brahmana who practiseth these purifications. The\r\nBrahmanas are even like blazing fires. They incur no fault in consequence\r\nof teaching, of officiating at sacrifices, and of accepting gifts from\r\nothers. Whether the Brahmana be cognisant of the Vedas or ignorant of\r\nthem, whether they be pure or impure, they should never be insulted, for\r\nBrahmanas are like fires. As the fire that blazeth up in the place set\r\napart for the cremation of the dead is never regarded impure on that\r\naccount, so the Brahmana, be he learned or ignorant, is always pure. He\r\nis great and a very god! Cities that are adorned with walls and gates and\r\npalaces one after another, lose their beauty if they are bereft of\r\nBrahmanas. That, indeed, O king, is a city where Brahmanas accomplished\r\nin the Vedas, duly observing the duties of their order and possessed of\r\nlearning and ascetic merit, reside. O son of Pritha, that spot, be it a\r\nwood or pasture land, where learned Brahmanas reside, hath been called a\r\ncity. And that place, O king, becometh a tirtha also. By approaching a\r\nking that offereth protection, as also a Brahmana possessed of ascetic\r\nmerit, and by offering worship unto both, a man may purge off his sins\r\nimmediately. The learned have said that ablutions in the sacred tirthas,\r\nrecitation of the names of holy ones, and converse with the good and\r\nvirtuous, are all acts worthy of applause. They that are virtuous and\r\nhonest always regard themselves as sanctified by the holy companionship\r\nof persons like themselves and by the water of pure and sacred converse.\r\nThe carrying of three staffs, the vow of silence, matted hair on head,\r\nthe shaving of the crown, covering one's person with barks and deerskins,\r\nthe practice of vows, ablutions, the worship of fire, abode in the woods,\r\nemaciating the body, all these are useless if the heart be not pure. The\r\nindulgence of the six senses is easy, if purity be not sought in the\r\nobject of enjoyment. Abstinence, however, which of itself is difficult,\r\nis scarcely easy without purity of the objects of enjoyment. O king of\r\nkings, among the six senses, the mind alone that is easily moved is the\r\nmost dangerous! Those high-souled persons that do not commit sins in\r\nword, deed, heart and soul, are said to undergo ascetic austerities, and\r\nnot they that suffer their bodies to be wasted by fasts and penances. He\r\nthat hath no feeling of kindness for relatives cannot be free from sin\r\neven if his body be pure. That hard-heartedness of his is the enemy of\r\nhis asceticism. Asceticism, again, is not mere abstinence from the\r\npleasures of the world. He that is always pure and decked with virtue, he\r\nthat practises kindness all his life, is a Muni even though he may lead a\r\ndomestic life. Such a man is purged of all his sins. Fasts and other\r\npenances cannot destroy sins, however much they may weaken and dry up the\r\nbody that is made of flesh and blood. The man whose heart is without\r\nholiness, suffers torture only by undergoing penances in ignorance of\r\ntheir meaning. He is never freed from sins of such acts. The fire he\r\nworshippeth doth not consume his sins. It is in consequence of holiness\r\nand virtue alone that men attain to regions of blessedness, and fasts and\r\nvows become efficacious. Subsistence on fruits and roots, the vow of\r\nsilence, living upon air, the shaving of the crown, abandonment of a\r\nfixed home, the wearing of matted locks on the head, lying under the\r\ncanopy of heaven, daily fasts, the worship of fire, immersion in water,\r\nand lying on the bare ground,--these alone cannot produce such a result.\r\nThey only that are possessed of holiness succeed, by knowledge and deeds,\r\nto conquer disease, decrepitude and death, and acquire a high status. As\r\nseeds that have been scorched by fire do not sprout forth, so the pains\r\nthat have been burnt by knowledge cannot effect the soul. This inert body\r\nthat is only like a block of wood when destitute of souls, is, without\r\ndoubt, short lived like froth in the ocean. He that obtaineth a view of\r\nhis soul, the soul that resideth in every body, by help of one or half of\r\na rhythmic line (of the Vedas), hath no more need for anything. Some\r\nobtaining a knowledge of identity with the Supreme Soul from but two\r\nletters (of the Vedas) and some from hundreds and thousands of rhythmic\r\nlines, acquire salvation, for the knowledge of one's identity with the\r\nSupreme Soul is the sure indication of salvation. The men of old,\r\ndistinguished for their knowledge, have said, neither this world nor that\r\nhereafter nor bliss can be his who is disturbed by doubts. And belief of\r\none's identity with the Supreme Soul is the indication of salvation. He\r\nthat knoweth the true meaning of the Vedas, understandeth their true use.\r\nSuch a man is affrighted at the Vedic ritual like a man at sight of a\r\nforest conflagration. Giving up dry disputation, have recourse to Sruti\r\nand Smriti, and seek thou, with the aid of thy reason, the knowledge of\r\nthe Undecaying One that is without a second. One's search (after this\r\nknowledge) becometh futile from defect of means. Therefore, should one\r\ncarefully strive to obtain that knowledge by aid of the Vedas. The Vedas\r\nare the Supreme Soul; they are His body; they are the Truth. The soul\r\nthat is bounded by the animal organism is incompetent to know Him in whom\r\nall the Vedas merge. That Supreme Soul, however, is capable of being\r\nknown by the pure intellect. The existence of the gods as stated in the\r\nVedas, the efficacy of acts, and the capacity for action of being\r\nfurnished with bodies, are noticeable in every Yuga. Independence of\r\nthese and annihilation are to be sought from purity of the senses.\r\nTherefore, the suspension of the function of the senses is the true\r\nfasting. One may attain to heaven by asceticism, one may obtain objects\r\nof enjoyment by the practice of charity and may have his sins purged off\r\nby ablutions in tirthas. But complete emancipation cannot be had except\r\nby knowledge.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, O great king, by the Rishi,\r\nYudhishthira of great fame then said, 'O holy one, I desire to listen to\r\nthe rules about that charity which is meritorious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'O great king, O Yudhishthira, the rules about charity\r\nwhich thou wishest to hear from me are always highly regarded by me.\r\nListen now to the mysteries of charity as expounded in the sruti and the\r\nsmritis! A man that performs a sraddha in the conjunction called\r\nGajacchaya at a place that is fanned by the leaves of the Aswattha tree\r\nenjoys the fruits thereof, O Yudhishthira, for a hundred thousand kalpas.\r\nO king, he that foundeth a dharmasala and established there a person to\r\nlook after all comers, is crowned with the merits of all the sacrifices.\r\nHe that giveth away a horse at a tirtha where the current of the river\r\nrunneth in a direction opposite to its general course, reapeth merit that\r\nis inexhaustible. The guest that comes to one's house for food is none\r\nother than Indra himself. If he is entertained with food, Indra himself\r\nconferreth on the best merit that is inexhaustible. As men cross seas by\r\nvessels, so are the givers mentioned above are saved from all their sins.\r\nSo what is given unto Brahmanas produceth, like gift of curds,\r\ninexhaustible merits. A gift on particular lunations produceth merit that\r\nis twice as much as a gift on other days. That in a particular season\r\nproduceth merit ten times greater that in other seasons. That in a\r\nparticular year produceth merit a hundred times greater than in other\r\nyears. And lastly, a gift on the last day of the last month of the year\r\nproduceth merit that is inexhaustible. A gift also that is made while the\r\nSun is on the solstitial points, one again that is made on the last day\r\nof the Sun's path through Libra, Aries, Gemini, Virgo, and Pisces, a gift\r\nagain during eclipses of the Moon and the Sun, produce merit that is\r\ninexhaustible. The learned have also said that gifts made during the\r\nseasons produce merit that is ten times, those made during the change of\r\nseasons, a hundred times--and those made during the days when Rahu is\r\nvisible, a thousand times--greater than what is produced by gifts at\r\nother time; while a gift made on the last day of the Sun's course through\r\nLibra and Aries produces merit that knows no diminution. O king, no one\r\ncan enjoy landed possessions unless he giveth away land, and no one can\r\ngo on cars and vehicles unless he giveth away these. Indeed a person on\r\nrebirth obtaineth the fruition of whatever objects he hath in view at the\r\ntime of making a gift to a Brahmana. Gold hath sprung from Fire; the\r\nEarth from Vishnu; and the cows from the Sun. He, therefore, that giveth\r\naway gold, land, and kine attaineth all the regions of Agni, Vishnu, and\r\nthe Sun. There is nothing so eternal as a gift. Where, therefore, in the\r\nthree worlds is anything that is more auspicious? It is for this, O king,\r\nthat they who have great intelligence say that there is nothing higher\r\nand greater in the three worlds than gift!'\""

Thou art acquainted also with various royal\r\ngenealogies and many eternal lines of Rishis! O best of Brahmanas, there\r\nis nothing in this world that thou dost not know! Thou knowest also, O\r\nMuni, many delightful stories about men, Snakes and Rakshasas; about\r\ngods, Gandharvas, and Yakshas, and about Kinnaras and Apsaras! I desire\r\nnow to hear from thee, O best of Brahmanas, as to why Kuvalaswa--that\r\nunvanquished king of Ikshavaku's race changed his name, assuming another,\r\nviz., Dhundhumara. O thou best of Bhrigu's line, I desire to know in\r\ndetail why the name of Kuvalaswa of great intelligence underwent such a\r\nchange!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the great Muni\r\nMarkandeya, O Bharata, then began the history of Dhundhumara!\"\r\n\r\nMarkandeya said, 'O royal Yudhishthira, listen to me, I will tell thee\r\nall! The story of Dhundhumara is a moral one. Listen to it then! Listen\r\nnow, O king, to the story of how the royal Kuvalaswa of Ikshvaku's race\r\ncame to be known as Dhundhumara. O son, O Bharata, there was a celebrated\r\nRishi of the name of Utanka and, O thou of the Kuru race, Utanka had his\r\nhermitage in a delightful wilderness. And, O great king, the Rishi Utanka\r\nunderwent ascetic austerities of the severest kind and the lord Utanka\r\nunderwent those penances for numberless years with the object of\r\nobtaining the favours of Vishnu, and gratified with his penances that\r\nillustrious Lord presented himself before Utanka. And beholding the\r\nDeity, the Rishi in all humility began to gratify him with many hymns,\r\nand Utanka said, 'O thou of great effulgence all creatures with the gods,\r\nAsuras and human beings, all things that are mobile or immobile, even\r\nBrahma himself, the Vedas, and all things that are capable of being\r\nknown, have, O lord, been created by thee! The firmament is thy head, O\r\ngod, and the sun and the moon are thy eyes! And, O Unfading One, the\r\nwinds are thy breath and fire thy energy! The directions of the horizon\r\nconstitute thy arms and the great ocean thy stomach! And, O god, the\r\nhills and mountains constitute thy thigh and the sky thy hips, O slayer\r\nof Madhu! The earth constitutes thy feet, and the plants the bristles on\r\nthy body. And, O lord, Indra and Soma and Agni and Varuna, indeed all the\r\ngods, the Asuras and the great Snakes all wait upon thee with humility,\r\nadoring thee with various hymns! O Lord of the Universe, created things\r\nare pervaded by thee. The great Rishis of high energy and ever plunged in\r\nascetic meditation, always adore thee. When thou art gratified, the\r\nuniverse is in peace. And when thou art angry, terror pervadeth every\r\nsoul. Thou art, O Lord, the great dispeller of all terrors and thou art\r\nthe One Supreme Male Being! Thou art the cause of happiness of both gods\r\nand human beings! And, O Lord, by three steps of thine thou didst cover\r\nthe three worlds! And it was by thee that the Asuras in the height of\r\ntheir power were destroyed! It is owing to thy prowess, O God, that the\r\ncelestials obtained peace and happiness and, O thou of great effulgence,\r\nit was the anger that destroyed hundred great Daitya chiefs. Thou art the\r\nCreator and destroyer of all creatures in the world. It is by adoring\r\nthee that the gods have obtained happiness. It was thus, O Yudhishthira,\r\nthat the high-souled Utanka praised the Lord of the senses. And Vishnu,\r\ntherefore, said unto Utanka, 'I am gratified with thee. Ask thou the boon\r\nthat thou desirest.' And Utanka said, 'This indeed hath, been a great\r\nboon to me, in that I have been able to behold Hari, that eternal Being,\r\nthat divine Creator, that Lord of the universe!\" Thus addressed Vishnu\r\nsaid, 'I am gratified with this absence of all desires on thy pail and\r\nwith thy devotion, O thou best of men! But, O Brahmanas, O regenerate\r\none, thou shouldst of a certainty accept some boon from me! Thus\r\nrequested by Hari to accept a boon Utanka then, O thou best of Bharatas,\r\nwith joined hands begged a boon saying, 'O illustrious one, O thou of\r\neyes like lotus leaves, if thou hast been gratified with me, then let my\r\nheart always rest on virtue, truth, and self-content. And, O Lord, let my\r\nheart always turn to thee in devotion.' And hearing these words of\r\nUtanka, the holy one said, 'O regenerate one, all this shall happen to\r\nthee through my grace. And there will also appear in thee a yoga power\r\nendued with which thou shalt achieve a great thing for the dwellers of\r\nHeaven, as also for the triple world. Even now a great Asura of the name\r\nof Dhundhu is undergoing ascetic penances of fierce austerity with the\r\nobject of destroying the triple world. Hear now as to who will slay that\r\nAsura. O son, there will appear a king of invincible energy and great\r\nprowess and he will be born in the race of Ikshvaku and will be known by\r\nthe name of Vrihadaswa who will have a son of the name of Kuvalaswa\r\nendued with great holiness and self-control and celebrity. And that best\r\nof kings will be furnished with yoga power springing from me and urged\r\nand commended by thee, O regenerate Rishi, that king will be the slayer\r\nof the Asura Dhundhu.' And having said these words unto that Brahmana,\r\nVishnu disappeared there and then.\""

And from Sasada was descended Kakutstha of great energy. And\r\nKakutshta had a son of name Anenas. And Anenas had a son named Prithu and\r\nPrithu had a son named Viswagaswa and from Viswagaswa sprang Adri and\r\nfrom Adri sprang Yuvanaswa and from Yuvanaswa sprang Sravastha and it was\r\nby this Sravastha that the city called Sravasthi was built and from\r\nSravastha was descended Vrihadaswa and from Vrihadaswa sprang Kuvalaswa\r\nand Kuvalaswa had twentyone thousand sons and all these sons were fierce\r\nand powerful and skilled in learning. And Kuvalaswa excelled his father\r\nin every quality. And when the time came, his father Vrihadaswa installed\r\nhim--the brave and highly virtuous Kuvalaswa--on the throne. And having\r\nthus made over the royal dignity to his son, that slayer of foes--king\r\nVrihadaswa of great intelligence--retired into the woods for asceticism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'O king, when the royal sage Vrihadaswa was about\r\nto retire into the woods, that best of Brahmanas, Utanka heard of it. And\r\nUtanka who was possessed of great energy and immeasurable soul,\r\napproached that foremost of all wielders of weapons and best of men. And\r\napproaching him, the Rishis began to persuade him to give up asceticism.\r\nAnd Utanka said, 'O king, to protect (the people) is thy duty. It\r\nbehoveth thee to do that duty of thine. Let us be free from all anxiety\r\nthrough thy grace. Possessed as thou art of a great soul, protected by\r\nthee, the earth will be freed from all dangers. Therefore, it behoveth\r\nthee, not to retire into the woods. Great merit attaches to the act of\r\nprotecting people in this world. Such merit can never be acquired in the\r\nwoods. Let not thy heart, therefore, turn to this course. The merit,\r\ngreat king, that was acquired in days of old by great royal sages by\r\nprotecting their subjects was so great that nothing equal to it could be\r\nseen. The king should always protect his subjects. It behoveth thee,\r\ntherefore, to protect thy people. O lord of the earth, I cannot (at\r\npresent) perform my ascetic devotions peacefully. Close to my asylum\r\nthere is a sea of sands known by the name of Ujjalaka. And it occupies a\r\nlevel country and is without any water. And it extends many yojanas in\r\nlength and breadth and in that desert dwells a chief of the Danavas\r\ncalled Dhundhu by name. And Dhundhu is the son of Madhu and Kaitabha, and\r\nis fierce and terrible and possessed of great prowess. And endued with\r\nimmeasurable energy, that Danava, O king, dwelleth under the ground, and,\r\nO king, it behoveth thee to retire into the woods, having first slain\r\nthat Asura. That Asura is now lying still in the observance of an ascetic\r\npenance of great austerity and, O king, the object he hath in view is\r\nsovereignty over the celestials as also of the three worlds. And, O king,\r\nhaving, obtained a boon from the Grandsire of all creatures, that Asura\r\nhath become incapable of being slain by the gods and Daityas and\r\nRakshasas and Gandharvas. Slay though him, O king, and blessed be thou\r\nand let not thy heart turn to any other course. By slaying him thou wilt\r\nwithout doubt, achieve a great thing and thou wilt also obtain eternal\r\nand undying fame. And O king, when at the end of every year that wicked\r\nAsura lying covered with sands, wakes up and begins to breathe, then the\r\nwhole earth with her mountains, forests and woods begins to tremble. And\r\nhis breath raiseth up clouds of sands, and shroudeth the very sun, and\r\nfor seven days continually the earth tremble all over, and sparks and\r\nflames of fire mixed with smoke spread far around and for all this, O\r\nking, I cannot rest in peace in my asylum. Slay thou him, O king, for the\r\ngood of the world. Indeed, when that Asura is slain the triple world will\r\nbe in peace and happiness. That thou art competent, O king, to slay that\r\nAsura, I fully believe. Thy energy will be enhanced by Vishnu with the\r\naddition of his own. In days of old, O king, Vishnu gave this boon that\r\nthe king who should slay this fierce and great Asura would be pervaded by\r\nthe invincible energy of Vishnu himself. Bearing that invincible\r\nVaishnava energy in thyself, slay thou, O great king, that Daitya of\r\nfierce prowess. Possessed as Dhundhu is of mighty energy, no one, O king,\r\nthat is endued with small energy himself will be capable of consuming\r\nhim, even if he were to strive for a hundred years.'\""

He who is the Source and Creator of the Universe, viz.,\r\nthe Eternal and unfading Vishnu, He who is called by Munis crowned with\r\nascetic success as the Supreme Lord of the Universe, that Being of great\r\nholiness, then lay in Yoga sleep on the wide hood of the Snake Sesha of\r\nimmeasurable energy, and the Creator of the Universe, that highly-blessed\r\nand holy Hari, knowing no deterioration, lay on the hood of that Snake\r\nencircling the whole Earth and as the Deity lay asleep on that bed, a\r\nlotus, endued with great beauty and effulgence equal unto that of the\r\nSun, sprang from his navel. And from that lotus possessed of effulgence\r\nlike unto the Sun's, sprang the Grandsire Brahma, that lord of the worlds\r\nwho is the four Vedas, who hath four forms and four faces, who is\r\ninvincible in consequence of his own energy and who is endued with mighty\r\nstrength and great prowess and as the Lord Hari of wondrous frame,\r\npossessed of great lustre and decked with a crown and the Kaustubha gem\r\nand attired in purple silk, lay stretched for many a yojana on that\r\nexcellent bed furnished by the hood of the snake itself extending far and\r\nwide, blazing, O king, in his beauty and the lustre of his own body like\r\na thousand Suns concentrated in one mass. He was beheld some time after\r\nby two Danavas of great prowess named Madhu and Kaitabha and beholding\r\nHari (in that posture) and the Grandsire with eyes like lotus-leaves\r\nseated on that lotus, both Madhu and Kaitabha wandered much and they\r\nbegan to terrify and alarm Brahma of immeasurable prowess, and the\r\nillustrious Brahma alarmed by their continued exertions trembled on his\r\nseat, and at his trembling the stalk of the lotus on which he was seated\r\nbegan to tremble and when the lotus-stalk trembled, Kesava awoke. And\r\nawakened from his slumber, Govinda beheld those Danavas of mighty energy,\r\nand beholding them the Deity said unto them, 'Welcome, ye mighty ones! I\r\nam gratified with you! Therefore, I will grant you excellent boons!' And\r\nthereupon both those proud and mighty Danavas, O king, laughingly replied\r\nunto Hrishikesa, saying, 'Ask boons of us, O Divine one! O thou that art\r\nthe Supreme Deity, we are disposed to grant thee a boon. Indeed, we will\r\ngrant thee a boon! Therefore, ask thou of us anything that cometh to thy\r\nmind.'

O\r\nthou foremost of male Beings, know that we have ever been firm in truth\r\nand morality.

And the boon he had asked of the\r\nlord Prajapati was in these words, 'Let no one among the gods, the\r\nDanavas, the Rakshas, the Snakes, the Gandharvas and the Rakshasas be\r\ncapable of slaying me. Even this is the boon that I ask of thee.' And the\r\nGrandsire replied unto him saying, 'Let it be as thou wishest. Go thy\r\nway.' And thus addressed by the Grandsire, the Danava placed the feet of\r\nthe Deity on his head and having thus touched with reverence the Deity's\r\nfeet he went away and possessed of mighty energy and prowess. Dhundhu,\r\nhaving obtained the boon hastily approached Vishnu remembering the death\r\nof his father at the hands of that Deity, and the wrathful Dhundhu having\r\nvanquished the gods with the Gandharvas began to distress all the\r\ncelestials with Vishnu at their head. And at last O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, that wicked souled Asura arriving at a sea of sands known by the\r\nname of Ujjalaka, began to distress to the utmost of his might the asylum\r\nof Utanka. And endued with fierce energy, Dhundhu, the son of Madhu and\r\nKaitabha, lay in his subterranean cave underneath the sands in the\r\nobservance of fierce ascetic and severe austerities with the object of\r\ndestroying the triple world, and while the Asura lay breathing near the\r\nasylum of Utanka that Rishi possessed of the splendour of fire, king\r\nKualaswa with his troops, accompanied by the Brahmana Utanka, as also by\r\nall his sons set out for that region, O bull of the Bharata race! And\r\nafter that grinder of foes, the royal Kuvalaswa, had set out, accompanied\r\nby his twenty-one thousand sons all of whom were exceedingly powerful,\r\nthe illustrious Lord Vishnu filled him with his own energy at the command\r\nof Utanka and impelled by the desire of benefiting the triple world and\r\nwhile that invincible hero was proceeding on his way and loud voice was\r\nheard in the sky repeating the words, 'This fortunate and unslayable one\r\nwill become the destroyer of Dhundhu to-day.' And the gods began to\r\nshower upon him celestial flowers. And the celestial kettle drums began\r\nto sound their music although none played upon them. And during the march\r\nof that wise one, cool breezes began to blow and the chief of the\r\ncelestials poured gentle showers wetting the dust on the roads and, O\r\nYudhishthira, the cars of the celestials could be seen high over the spot\r\nwhere the mighty Asura Dhundhu was. The gods and Gandharvas and great\r\nRishis urged by curiosity, came there to behold the encounter between\r\nDhundhu and Kuvalaswa and, O thou of the Kuru race, filled by Narayana\r\nwith his own energy, king Kuvalaswa, aided by his sons, soon surrounded\r\nthat sea of sands and the king ordered that wilderness to be excavated\r\nand after the king's sons had excavated that sea of sands for seven days,\r\nthey could see the mighty Asura Dhundhu. And, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nthe huge body of that Asura lay within those sands, effulgent in its own\r\nenergy like the Sun himself. And Dhundhu, O king, was lying covering the\r\nwestern region of the desert and surrounded on all sides by the sons of\r\nKuvalaswa, the Danava was assaulted with sharp-pointed shafts and maces\r\nand heavy and short clubs and axes and clubs, with iron spikes and darts\r\nand bright and keen-edged swords, and thus assaulted, the mighty Danava\r\nrose from his recumbent posture in wrath. And enraged, the Asura began to\r\nswallow those various weapons that were hurled at him and he vomited from\r\nhis mouth fiery flames like unto those of the fire called Samvarta that\r\nappeareth at the end of the Yuga and by those flames of his, the Asura\r\nconsumed all the sons of the king and, O tiger among men, like the Lord\r\nKapila of old consuming the sons of king Sagara, the infuriated Asura\r\noverwhelming the triple world with the flames vomited from his mouth,\r\nachieved that wonderful feat in a moment. And, O thou best of the\r\nBharatas, when all those sons of king Kuvalaswa were consumed by the fire\r\nemitted by the Asura in wrath, the monarch, possessed as he was of mighty\r\nenergy, then approached the Danava who, like unto a second Kumbhakarna of\r\nmighty energy, had come to the encounter after waking from his slumbers.\r\nFrom the body of the king, O monarch, then began to flow a mighty and\r\ncopious stream of water and that stream soon extinguished, O king, the\r\nfiery flames emitted by the Asura. And, O great king, the royal\r\nKuvalaswa, filled with Yoga force, having extinguished those flames by\r\nthe water that issued from his body, consumed that Daitya of wicked\r\nprowess with the celebrated weapon called Brahma for relieving the triple\r\nworld of its fears, and the royal sage Kuvalaswa, having consumed that\r\ngreat Asura, that foe of the celestials and slayer of all enemies, by\r\nmeans of that weapon became like unto a second chief of the triple world\r\nand the high-souled king Kuvalaswa having slain the the Asura Dhundhu,\r\nbecame from that time known by the name of Dhundhumara and from that time\r\nhe came to be regarded as invincible in battle, and the gods and the\r\ngreat Rishis who had come to witness that encounter were so far gratified\r\nwith him that they addressed him saying, 'Ask thou a boon of us!' And\r\nthus solicited by the gods, the king bowed to them and filled with joy,\r\nthe king said unto them, with joined hands these words, 'Let me be always\r\nable to give wealth unto superior Brahmanas! Let me be invincible as\r\nregards all foes! Let there be friendship between myself and Vishnu! Let\r\nme have no ill-feeling towards any creature! Let my heart always turn to\r\nvirtue! And let me (finally) dwell in heaven for ever!' And the gods and\r\nthe Rishis and Utanka, hearing this were exceedingly gratified and all of\r\nthem said, 'Let it be as thou wishest!' And, O king, having also blessed\r\nhim with many other speeches, the gods and the great Rishis then went\r\naway to their respective abodes. And, O Yudhishthira, after the slaughter\r\nof all his sons, king Kuvalaswa had still three sons left, and, O thou of\r\nthe Bharata race, they were called Dridaswa and Kapilaswa and Chandraswa.\r\nIt is from them, O king, that the illustrious line of kings belonging to\r\nIkshvaku's race, all possessed of immeasurable prowess, hath sprung.\r\n\r\n\"It was thus, O best of king, that that great Daitya of the name Dhundhu,\r\nthe son of Madhu and Kaitabha was slain by Kuvalaswa and it was for this\r\nalso that king came to be called by the name of Dhundhumara. And indeed,\r\nthe name he assumed was no empty one but was literally true.\r\n\r\n\"I have now told thee all that thou hadst asked me, viz., all about that\r\nperson in consequence of whose act the story of Dhundhu's death hath\r\nbecome famous.

I desire to hear from thee, O Brahmana,\r\ndiscourse about the subtle truths of morality. O regenerate Rishi, O best\r\nof men, the Sun, the Moon, the Wind, the Earth, the Fire, the father, the\r\nmother, the preceptor--these and other objects ordained by the gods,\r\nappear to us as Deities embodied! All these that are reverend ones are\r\nworthy of our best regard. So also is the woman who adoreth one lord. The\r\nworship that chaste wives offer unto their husbands appeareth to me to be\r\nfraught with great difficulty. O adorable one, it behoveth thee to\r\ndiscourse to us of the high and excellent virtue of chaste wives--of\r\nwives who restraining all their senses and keeping their hearts under\r\ncomplete control regard their husbands as veritable gods. O holy and\r\nadorable one, all this appears to me to be exceedingly difficult of\r\naccomplishment. O regenerate one, the worship that sons offer to their\r\nmothers and fathers and that wives offer to their husbands, both seem to\r\nme to be highly difficult. I do not behold anything that is more\r\ndifficult than the severe virtue of chaste women. O Brahmana, the duties\r\nthat women of good behaviour discharge with care and the conduct that is\r\npursued by good sons towards their fathers and mothers appear to me to be\r\nmost difficult of performance. Those women that are each devoted to but\r\none lord, they that always speak the truth, they that undergo a period of\r\ngestation for full ten months--there is nothing, O Brahmana, that is more\r\ndifficult than that is done by these. O worshipful one, women bring forth\r\ntheir offspring with great hazard to themselves and great pain and rear\r\ntheir children, O bull among Brahmanas, with great affection! Those\r\npersons also who being always engaged in acts of cruelty and there by\r\nincurring general hatred, succeed yet in doing their duties accomplish\r\nwhat, in my opinion, is exceedingly difficult. O regenerate one, tell me\r\nthe truths of the duties of the Kshatriya order. It is difficult, O\r\ntwice-born one, for those high-souled ones to acquire virtue who by the\r\nduties of their order are obliged to do what is cruel. O holy one, thou\r\nart capable of answering all questions; I desire to hear thee discourse\r\non all this.

Listen to me, therefore, as I speak unto thee. Some regard the mother\r\nas superior and some the father. The mother, however, that bringeth forth\r\nand some the father. The mother, however, that bringeth forth and reareth\r\nup offspring what is more difficult. Fathers also, by ascetic penances by\r\nworship of the gods, by adorations addressed to them, by bearing cold and\r\nheat, by incantations and other means desire to have children. And having\r\nby these painful expedients obtained children that are so difficult of\r\nacquisition, they then, O hero, are always anxious about the future of\r\ntheir sons and, O Bharata, both the father and the mother desire to see\r\nin their sons fame and achievements and prosperity and offspring and\r\nvirtue. That son is virtuous who realises these hopes of his parents.\r\nAnd, O great king, that son with whom the father and the mother are\r\ngratified, achieveth eternal fame and eternal virtue both here and\r\nthereafter. As regards women again, neither sacrifice nor sraddhas, nor\r\nfasts are of any efficacy. By serving their husbands only they can win\r\nheaven.

At these words of that\r\nBrahmana the woman answered, 'I am no she-crane, O regenerate Rishi! O\r\nthou that art endued with the wealth of asceticism, cast off this anger\r\nof thine. Engaged as thou are, what canst thou do to me with these angry\r\nglances of thine? I do not disregard Brahmanas. Endued with great energy\r\nof soul, they are like unto the gods themselves. But, O sinless one, this\r\nfault of mine it behoveth thee to forgive. I know the energy and high\r\ndignity of Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom. The waters of the\r\nocean have been made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the\r\nBrahmanas. I know also the energy of Munis of souls under complete\r\ncontrol and endued with blazing ascetic merit. The fire of their wrath to\r\nthis day hath not been extinguished in the forest of Dandaka. It was for\r\nhis having disregarded the Brahmanas that the great Asura--the wicked and\r\nevil-minded Vatapi was digested when he came in contact with Agastya. It\r\nhath been heard by us that the powers and merits of high-souled Brahmanas\r\nare great. But, O Brahmana, as regenerate ones of high souls are great in\r\nwrath, so are they equally great in forgiveness. Therefore, O sinless\r\none, it behoveth thee to forgive me in the matter of this my offence. O\r\nBrahmana, my heart inclineth to that merit which springeth from the\r\nservice of my husband, for I regard my husband as the highest among all\r\nthe gods. O best of Brahmanas, I practise that virtue which consists in\r\nserving my husband whom I regard as the highest Deity. Behold, O\r\nregenerate one, the merit that attaches to the service of one's husband!\r\nI know that thou hast burnt a she-crane with thy wrath! But, O best of\r\nregenerate ones, the anger that a person cherishes is the greatest of\r\nfoes which that person hath. The gods know him for a Brahmana who hath\r\ncast off anger and passion. The gods know him for a Brahmana who always\r\nspeaketh the truth here, who always gratifieth his preceptor, and who,\r\nthough injured himself, never returneth the injury. The gods know him for\r\na Brahmana who hath his senses under control, who is virtuous and pure\r\nand devoted to the study of the Vedas, and who hath mastery over anger\r\nand lust. The gods know him for a Brahmana who, cognisant of morals and\r\nendued with mental energy, is catholic in religion and looketh upon all\r\nequal unto himself. The gods know him for a Brahmana who studieth himself\r\nand teacheth others, who performeth sacrifices himself and officiateth at\r\nthe sacrifices of others, and who giveth away to the best of his means.\r\nThe gods know that bull among the regenerate ones for a Brahmana who,\r\nendued with liberality of soul, practiseth the Brahmacharya vow and is\r\ndevoted to study,--in fact who is vigilantly devoted to the study of the\r\nVedas. Whatever conduceth to the happiness of the Brahmanas is always\r\nrecited before these. Ever taking pleasure in truth, the hearts of such\r\nmen never find joy in untruth. O thou best of regenerate ones, it hath\r\nbeen said that the study of the Vedas, tranquillity of soul, simplicity\r\nof behaviour, and repression of the senses, constitute the eternal duties\r\nof the Brahmana. Those cognisant with virtue and morals have said that\r\ntruth and honesty are the highest virtue. Virtue that is eternal is\r\ndifficult of being understood. But whatever it is, it is based on truth.\r\nThe ancients have declared that virtue dependeth on sruti. But, O\r\nforemost of regenerate ones, virtue as exposed in sruti appears to be of\r\nvarious kinds. It is, therefore, too subtle of comprehension. Thou, O\r\nholy one, art cognisant of virtue, pure, and devoted to the study of the\r\nVedas. I think, however, O holy one, that thou dost not know what virtue\r\nin reality is. Repairing to the city of Mithila, enquire thou of a\r\nvirtuous fowler there, if indeed, O regenerate one, thou art not really\r\nacquainted with what constitutes the highest virtue. There liveth in\r\nMithila a fowler who is truthful and devoted to the service of his\r\nparents and who hath senses under complete control. Even he will\r\ndiscourse to thee on virtue. Blessed be thou, O best of regenerate ones,\r\nif thou likest, repair thither. O faultless one, it behoveth thee to\r\nforgive me, if what I have said be unpalatable, for they that are\r\ndesirous of acquiring virtue are incapable of injuring women!'\r\n\r\n\"At these words of the chaste woman, the Brahmana replied, saying, 'I am\r\ngratified with thee. Blessed be thou; my anger hath subsided, O beautiful\r\none! The reproofs uttered by thee will be of the highest advantage to me.\r\nBlessed be thou, I shall now go and accomplish what is so conducive, O\r\nhandsome one, to my benefit!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Dismissed by her, Kausika, that best of\r\nregenerate ones, left her house, and, reproaching himself, returned to\r\nhis own abode.'\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya said, 'Continually reflecting upon that wonderful discourse\r\nof the woman, Kausika began to reproach himself and looked very much like\r\na guilty person and meditating on the subtle ways of morality and virtue,\r\nhe said to himself, 'I should accept with reverence what the lady hath\r\nsaid and should, therefore, repair to Mithila. Without doubt there\r\ndwelleth in that city a fowler of soul under complete control and fully\r\nacquainted with the mysteries of virtue and morality. This very day will\r\nI repair unto that one endued with wealth of asceticism for enquiring of\r\nhim about virtue.' His faith in her was assured by her knowledge of the\r\ndeath of the she-crane and the excellent words of virtuous import she had\r\nuttered. Kausika thus reflecting with reverence upon all she had said,\r\nset out for Mithila, filled with curiosity. And he traversed many forests\r\nand villages and towns and at last reached Mithila that was ruled over by\r\nJanaka and he beheld the city to be adorned with the flags of various\r\ncreeds. And he beheld that beautiful town to be resounding with the noise\r\nof sacrifices and festivities and furnished with splendid gateways. It\r\nabounded with palatial residences and protected by walls on all sides; it\r\nhad many splendid buildings to boast of. And that delightful town was\r\nalso filled with innumerable cars. And its streets and roads were many\r\nand well-laid and many of them were lined with shops. And it was full of\r\nhorses and cars and elephants and warriors. And the citizens were all in\r\nhealth and joy and they were always engaged in festivities. And having\r\nentered that city, that Brahmana beheld there many other things.\r\n\r\nAnd there the Brahmana enquired about the virtuous fowler and was\r\nanswered by some twice-born persons. And repairing to the place indicated\r\nby those regenerate ones, the Brahmana beheld the fowler seated in a\r\nbutcher's yard and the ascetic fowler was then selling venison and\r\nbuffalo meat and in consequence of the large concourse of buyers gathered\r\nround that fowler, Kausika stood at a distance. But the fowler,\r\napprehending that the Brahmana had come to him, suddenly rose from his\r\nseat and went to that secluded spot where the Brahmana was staying and\r\nhaving approached him there, the fowler said, 'I salute thee, O holy one!\r\nWelcome art thou, O thou best of Brahmanas! I am the fowler. Blessed be\r\nthou! Command me as to what I may do for thee. The word that the chaste\r\nwoman said unto thee, viz., Repair thou to Mithila, are known to me. I\r\nalso know for what purpose thou hast come hither.' Hearing these words of\r\nthe fowler that Brahmana was filled with surprise. And he began to\r\nreflect inwardly, saying, 'This indeed, is the second marvel that I see!'\r\nThe fowler then said unto the Brahmana, saying, 'Thou art now standing in\r\nplace that is scarcely proper for thee, O sinless one. If it pleasest\r\nthee, let us go to my abode, O holy one!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'So be it,' said the Brahmana unto him, gladly.\r\nAnd thereupon, the fowler proceeded towards his home with the Brahmana\r\nwalking before him. And entering his abode that looked delightful, the\r\nfowler reverenced his guest by offering him a seat. And he also gave him\r\nwater to wash his feet and face. And accepting these, that best of\r\nBrahmanas sat at his ease And he then addressed the fowler, saying, 'It\r\nseems to me that this profession doth not befit thee. O fowler, I deeply\r\nregret that thou shouldst follow such a cruel trade.' At these words of\r\nthe Brahmana the fowler said, 'This profession is that of my family,\r\nmyself having inherited it from my sires and grandsires. O regenerate\r\none, grieve not for me owing to my adhering to the duties that belong to\r\nme by birth. Discharging the duties ordained for me beforehand by the\r\nCreator, I carefully serve my superiors and the old. O thou best of\r\nBrahmanas! I always speak the truth, never envy others; and give to the\r\nbest of my power. I live upon what remaineth after serving the gods,\r\nguests, and those that depend on me. I never speak ill of anything, small\r\nor great. O thou best of Brahmanas, the actions of a former life always\r\nfollow the doer. In this world there are three principal professions,\r\nviz., agriculture, rearing of cattle, and trade. As regards the other\r\nworld, the three Vedas, knowledge, and the science of morals are\r\nefficacious. Service (of the other three orders) hath been ordained to be\r\nthe duty of the Sudra. Agriculture hath been ordained for the Vaisyas,\r\nand fighting for the Kshatriyas, while the practice of the Brahmacharya\r\nvow, asceticism, recitation of mantras, and truthfulness have been\r\nordained for the Brahmanas. Over subjects adhering to their proper\r\nduties, the king should rule virtuously; while he should set those\r\nthereto that have fallen away from the duties of their order. Kings\r\nshould ever be feared, because they are the lords of their subjects. They\r\nrestrain those subjects of theirs that fall away from their duties as\r\nthey restrain the motions of the deer by means of their shafts. O\r\nregenerate Rishi, there existeth not in the kingdom of Janaka a single\r\nsubject that followeth not the duties of his birth. O thou best of the\r\nBrahmanas, all the four orders here rigidly adhere to their respective\r\nduties. King Janaka punisheth him that is wicked, even if he be his own\r\nson; but never doth he inflict pain on him that is virtuous. With good\r\nand able spies employed under him, he looketh upon all with impartial\r\neyes. Prosperity, and kingdom, and capacity to punish, belong, O thou\r\nbest of Brahmanas, to the Kshatriyas. Kings desire high prosperity\r\nthrough practice of the duties that belong to them. The king is the\r\nprotector of all the four orders. As regards myself, O Brahmana, I always\r\nsell pork and buffalo meat without slaying those animals myself. I sell\r\nmeat of animals, O regenerate Rishi, that have been slain by others. I\r\nnever eat meat myself; never go to my wife except in her season; I always\r\nfast during the day, and eat, O regenerate one, in the night. Even though\r\nthe behaviour of his order is bad, a person may yet be himself of good\r\nbehaviour. So also a person may become virtuous, although he may be\r\nslayer of animals by profession. It is in consequence of the sinful acts\r\nof kings that virtue decreaseth greatly, and sin beginneth to prosper.\r\nAnd when all this taketh place the subjects of the kingdom begin to\r\ndecay. And it is then, O Brahmana, that ill-looking monsters, and dwarfs,\r\nand hunch-backed and large-headed wights, and men that are blind or deaf\r\nor those that have paralysed eyes or are destitute of the power of\r\nprocreation, begin to take their birth. It is from the sinfulness of\r\nkings that their subjects suffer numerous mischiefs. But this our king\r\nJanaka casteth his eyes upon all his subjects virtuously, and he is\r\nalways kind unto them who, on their part, ever adhere to their respective\r\nduties. Regarding myself, I always with good deeds please those that\r\nspeak well, as also those that speak ill of me. Those kings that live in\r\nthe observance of their own proper duties, who are always engaged in the\r\npractice of acts that are good and honest, who are of souls under\r\ncomplete control and who are endued with readiness and alacrity, may not\r\ndepend upon anything else for supporting their power. Gift of food to the\r\nbest of one's power, endurance of heat and cold, firmness in virtue, and\r\na regard and tenderness for all creatures,--these attributes can never\r\nfind place in a person, without an innate desire being present in him of\r\nseparating himself from the world. One should avoid falsehood in speech,\r\nand should do good without solicitation. One should never cast off virtue\r\nfrom lust, from wrath, or from malice. One should never joy immoderately\r\nat a good turn or grieve immoderately at a bad one. One should never feel\r\ndepressed when overtaken by poverty, nor when so overtaken abandon the\r\npath of virtue. If at any time one doth what is wrong, he should never do\r\nits like again. One should always urge his soul to the doing of that\r\nwhich he regardeth as beneficial. One should never return wrong for\r\nwrong, but should act honestly by those that have wronged him. That\r\nwretched man who desireth to do what is sinful, slayeth himself. By doing\r\nwhat is sinful, one only imitates them that are wicked and sinful,\r\nDisbelieving in virtue they that mock the good and the pure saying,\r\n'There is no virtue' undoubtedly meet with destruction. A sinful man\r\nswelleth up like a leather bag puffed up with wind. The thoughts of these\r\nwretches filled with pride and folly are feeble and unprofitable. It is\r\nthe heart, the inner soul, that discovereth the fool like the sun that\r\ndiscovereth forms during the day. The food cannot always shine in the\r\nworld by means of self-praise. The learned man, however, even if he be\r\ndestitute of beauty, displayeth his lustre by refraining from speaking\r\nill of others and well of himself. No example, however, can be met with,\r\nin this world, of a person shining brilliantly on account of attributes\r\nto be found in him in their reputed measure. If one repenteth of a wrong\r\ndone by him, that repentance washeth off his sin. The resolution of never\r\ndoing it again saveth him from future sin, even as, O thou best of\r\nBrahmanas, he may save himself from sin by any of those expiations\r\nobtained in the scriptures. Even this, O regenerate one, is the sruti\r\nthat may be seen in respect of virtue. He that having before been\r\nvirtuous, committeth a sin, or committeth it unknowingly may destroy that\r\nsin. For virtue, O Brahmana, driveth off the sin that men commit from\r\nignorance. A man, after having committed a sin, should cease to regard\r\nhimself any longer as a man. No man can conceal his sins. The gods behold\r\nwhat one does, also the Being that is within every one. He that with\r\npiety and without detraction hideth the faults of the honest and the wise\r\nlike holes in his own attire, surely seeketh his salvation. If a man\r\nseeketh redemption after having committed a sin, without doubt he is\r\npurged of all his sins and looketh pure and resplendent like the moon\r\nemerged from the clouds. A man that seeketh redemption is washed of all\r\nhis sins, even as the sun, upon rising, dispelleth all darkness. O best\r\nof Brahmanas, it is temptation that constitutes the basis of sin. Men\r\nthat are ignorant commit sin, yielding to temptation alone. Sinful men\r\ngenerally cover themselves with a virtuous exterior, like wells whose\r\nmouths are covered by long grass. Outwardly they seem to possess\r\nself-control and holiness and indulge in preaching virtuous texts which,\r\nin their mouth are of little meaning. Indeed, everything may be noticed\r\nin them except conduct that is truly virtuous!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'At these words, O best of men, of the fowler,\r\nthat Brahmana endued with great wisdom, then asked the fowler, saying,\r\n'How shall I know what is virtuous conduct? Blessed be thou, I desire to\r\nhear this, O thou foremost of virtuous men, from thee. Therefore, O thou\r\nof exalted soul, tell me all about it truly.' Hearing these words, the\r\nfowler replied, saying, 'O best of Brahmanas, Sacrifices, Gift,\r\nAsceticism, the Vedas, and Truth--these five holy things are ever present\r\nin conduct that is called virtuous. Having subjugated lust and wrath\r\npride avarice, and crookedness, they that take pleasure in virtue because\r\nit is virtue, are regarded as really virtuous and worthy of the\r\napprobation of persons that are virtuous. These persons who are devoted\r\nto sacrifices; and study of the Vedas have no independent behaviour. They\r\nfollow only the practices of the honest and the good. This indeed, is the\r\nsecond attribute of the virtuous. Waiting upon superiors, Truth, Freedom\r\nfrom anger, and Gift, these four, O Brahmana, are inseparably connected\r\nwith behaviour that is virtuous. For the reputation that a person\r\nacquires by setting his heart on virtuous behaviour and adhering to it\r\nrigidly is incapable of acquisition except by practising the four virtues\r\nnamed above. The essence of the Vedas is Truth: the essence of Truth is\r\nself-control, and the essence of self-control is abstention from the\r\npleasures of the world. These all are to be noticed in behaviour that is\r\nvirtuous. They that follow those deluded fools that mock the forms of\r\nfaith prevailing among men, are dragged into destruction for walking in\r\nsuch a sinful path. They, however, that are virtuous and engaged in the\r\nobservance of vows, who are devoted to the srutis and the virtue of\r\nabstention from the pleasure of the world, they in fact who tread in\r\nvirtue's path and follow the true religion, they that are obedient to the\r\nmandates of their preceptors, and who reflect upon the sense of the\r\nscriptures with patience and carefulness,--is these that are said to be\r\npossessed of behaviour that is virtuous; it is these, O Brahmana, that\r\nare said to properly guide their higher intelligence. Forsaking those\r\nthat are atheists, those that transgress virtue's limits, those that are\r\nof wicked souls, those that live in sinfulness, betake thyself to\r\nknowledge reverencing those that are virtuous. Lust and temptation are\r\neven like sharks in the river of life; the waters are the five senses. Do\r\nthou cross over to the other side of this river in the boat of patience\r\nand resignation, avoiding the shoals of corporeal existence (repeated\r\nbirths in this world). The supreme virtue consisting in the exercise of\r\nthe intelligent principle and abstraction, when gradually super-added to\r\nvirtuous conduct, becomes beautiful like dye on white fabrics.\r\nTruthfulness and abstention from doing injury to any one, are virtues\r\nhighly beneficial to all creatures. Of these, that latter is a cardinal\r\nvirtue, and is based on truth. Our mental faculties have their proper\r\nplay when their foundation is laid in truth, and in the exercise of\r\nvirtue truth is of the highest value. Purity of conduct is the\r\ncharacteristic of all good men. Those that are distinguished for holy\r\nliving are good and virtuous. All creatures follow the principles of\r\nconduct which are innate in their nature. The sinful being who has no\r\ncontrol over self acquire lust, anger and other vices. It is the\r\nimmemorial rule that virtuous actions are those that are founded on\r\njustice, and it is also ordained by holy men that all iniquitous conduct\r\nis sin. Those who are not swayed by anger, pride, haughtiness and envy,\r\nand those who are quiet and straight-forward, are men of virtuous\r\nconduct. Those who are diligent in performing the rites enjoined in the\r\nthree Vedas, who are wise, and of pure and virtuous conduct, who exercise\r\nself-restraint and are full of attention to their superior, are men of\r\nvirtuous conduct. The actions and conduct of such men of great power, are\r\nvery difficult of attainment. They are sanctified by the purification of\r\ntheir own actions, and consequently sin in them dies out of itself. This\r\nvirtue of good conduct is wonderful, ancient, immutable and eternal; and\r\nwise men observing this virtue with holiness, attain to heaven. These men\r\nwho believe in the existence of the Deity, who are free from false pride,\r\nand versed in holy writ, and who respect regenerate (twice-born) men, go\r\nto heaven. Among holy men, virtue is differentiated in three ways--that\r\ngreat virtue which is inculcated in the Vedas, the other which is\r\ninculcated in the dharmashastras (the minor scriptures), and virtuous\r\nconduct. And virtuous conduct is indicated by acquisition of knowledge,\r\npilgrimage to sacred places, truthfulness, forbearance, purity and\r\nstraight-forwardness. Virtuous men are always kind to all creatures, and\r\nwell-disposed towards regenerate men. They abstain from doing injury to\r\nany creature, and are never rude in speech. Those good men who know well\r\nthe consequences of the fruition of their good and evil deeds, are\r\ncommended by virtuous men. Those who are just and good-natured, and\r\nendowed with virtue, who wish well of all creatures, who are steadfast in\r\nthe path of virtue, and have conquered heaven, who are charitable,\r\nunselfish and of unblemished character, who succour the afflicted, and\r\nare learned and respected by all, who practise austerities, and are kind\r\nto all creatures, are commended as such by the virtuous. Those who are\r\ncharitably disposed attain prosperity in this world, as also the regions\r\nof bliss (hereafter). The virtuous man when solicited for assistance by\r\ngood men bestow alms on them by straining to the utmost, even to the\r\ndeprivation of the comforts of his wife and servants. Good men having an\r\neye to their own welfare, as also virtue and the ways of the world, act\r\nin this way and thereby grow in virtue through endless ages. Good persons\r\npossessing the virtues of truthfulness, abstention from doing injury to\r\nany one, rectitude, abstention from evil towards any one, want of\r\nhaughtiness, modesty, resignation, self-restraint, absence of passion,\r\nwisdom, patience, and kindness towards all creatures, and freedom from\r\nmalice and lust, are the witnesses of the world. These three are said to\r\nconstitute the perfect way of the virtuous, viz., a man must not do wrong\r\nto any body, he must bestow alms, and must always be truthful. Those\r\nhigh-souled good men of virtuous conduct, and settled convictions, who\r\nare kind to all and are full of compassion, depart with contentment from\r\nthis world to the perfect way of virtue. Freedom from malice,\r\nforbearance, peace of mind, contentment, pleasant speech, renunciation of\r\ndesire and anger, virtuous conduct and actions regulated according to the\r\nordinances of holy writ, constitute the perfect way of the virtuous. And\r\nthose who are constant in virtue follow these rules of virtuous conduct,\r\nand having reached the pinnacle of knowledge, and discriminating between\r\nthe various phases of human conduct, which are either very virtuous or\r\nthe reverse, they escape from the great danger. Thus, O great Brahmana,\r\nhaving introduced the subject of virtuous conduct, have I described to\r\nthee all this, according to my own knowledge and to what I have heard on\r\nthe subject.\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya continued, 'The pious fowler, O Yudhishthira, then said to\r\nthat Brahmana, 'Undoubtedly my deeds are very cruel, but, O Brahmana,\r\nDestiny is all-powerful and it is difficult to evade the consequence of\r\nour past actions. And this is the karmic evil arising out of sin\r\ncommitted in a former life. But, O Brahmana, I am always assiduous in\r\neradicating the evil. The Deity takes away life, the executioner acts\r\nonly as a secondary agent. And we, O good Brahmana, are only such agents\r\nin regard to our karma. Those animals that are slain by me and whose meat\r\nI sell, also acquire karma, because (with their meat), gods and guests\r\nand servants are regaled with dainty food and the manes are propitiated.\r\nIt is said authoritatively that herbs and vegetables, deer, birds and\r\nwild animals constitute the food of all creatures. And, O Brahmana, king\r\nSivi, the son of Usinara, of great forbearance attained to heaven, which\r\nis hard to reach, giving away his own flesh. And in days of yore, O\r\nBrahmana, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen\r\nof king Rantideva; and in the same manner two thousand cows were killed\r\nevery day; and, O best of regenerate beings, king Rantideva acquired\r\nunrivalled reputation by distributing food with meat every day. For the\r\nperformance of the fourmonthly rites animals ought to be sacrificed\r\ndaily. 'The sacred fire is fond of animal food,' this saying has come\r\ndown to us. And at sacrifices animals are invariably killed by regenerate\r\nBrahmanas, and these animals being purged of sin, by incantation of\r\nhymns, go to heaven. If, O Brahmana, the sacred fire had not been so fond\r\nof animal food in ancient times, it could never have become the food of\r\nany one. And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down\r\nby Munis:--Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it\r\nduly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the\r\nact. And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal\r\nfood, even, as a Brahmacharin having intercoursed with his wife during\r\nthe menstrual period, is nevertheless considered to be a good Brahmana.\r\nAfter consideration of the propriety and impropriety of the matter, this\r\nrule has been laid down. King Saudasa, O Brahmana, when under a curse,\r\noften used to prey upon men; what is thy opinion of this matter? And, O\r\ngood Brahmana, knowing this to be the consequence of my own actions, I\r\nobtain my livelihood from this profession. The forsaking of one's own\r\noccupation is considered, O Brahmana, to be a sin, and the act of\r\nsticking to one's own profession is without doubt a meritorious act. The\r\nKarma of a former existence never forsakes any creature. And in\r\ndetermining the various consequences of one's Karma, this rule was not\r\nlost sight of by the Creator. A person having his being under the\r\ninfluence of evil Karma, must always consider how he can atone for his\r\nKarma, and extricate himself from an evil doom, and the evil Karma may be\r\nexpiated in various ways. Accordingly, O good Brahmana, I am charitable,\r\ntruthful, assiduous in attending on my superior, full of respect towards\r\nregenerate Brahmanas, devoted to and free from pride and (idle) excessive\r\ntalk. Agriculture is considered to be a praiseworthy occupation, but it\r\nis well-known that even there, great harm is done to animal life; and in\r\nthe operation of digging the earth with the plough, numberless creatures\r\nlurking in the ground as also various other forms of animal life are\r\ndestroyed. Dost thou not think so? O good Brahmana, Vrihi and other seeds\r\nof rice are all living organisms. What is thy opinion on this matter?\r\nMen, O Brahmana, hunt wild animals and kill them and partake of their\r\nmeat; they also cut up trees and herbs; but, O Brahmana, there are\r\nnumberless living organisms in trees, in fruits, as also in water; dost\r\nthou not think so? This whole creation, O Brahmana, is full of animal\r\nlife, sustaining itself with food derived from living organisms. Dost\r\nthou not mark that fish preys upon fish, and that various species of\r\nanimals prey upon other species, and there are species the members of\r\nwhich prey upon each other? Men, O Brahmana, while walking about hither\r\nand thither, kill numberless creatures lurking in the ground by trampling\r\non them, and even men of wisdom and enlightenment destroy animal life in\r\nvarious ways, even while sleeping or reposing themselves. What hast thou\r\nto say to this?--The earth and the air all swarm with living organisms,\r\nwhich are unconsciously destroyed by men from mere ignorance. Is not this\r\nso? The commandment that people should not do harm to any creature, was\r\nordained of old by men, who were ignorant of the true facts of the case.\r\nFor, O Brahmana, there is not a man on the face of this earth, who is\r\nfree from the sin of doing injury to creatures. After full consideration,\r\nthe conclusion is irresistible that there is not a single man who is free\r\nfrom the sin of doing injury to animal life. Even the sage, O good\r\nBrahmana, whose vow is to do harm to no creature, doth inflict injury to\r\nanimal life. Only, on account of greater needfulness, the harm is less.\r\nMen of noble birth and great qualities perpetrate wicked acts in defiance\r\nof all, of which they are not at all ashamed. Good men acting in an\r\nexemplary way are not commended by other good men; nor are bad men acting\r\nin a contrary way praised by their wicked compeers; and friends are not\r\nagreeable to friends, albeit endowed with high qualities; and foolish\r\npedantic men cry down the virtues of their preceptors. This reversal of\r\nthe natural order of things, O good Brahmana, is seen everywhere in this\r\nworld. What is thy opinion as to the virtuousness or otherwise of this\r\nstate of things? There is much that can be said of the goodness or\r\nbadness of our actions. But whoever is addicted to his own proper\r\noccupation surely acquires great reputation."

      "content": "Markandeya continued, \"O Yudhishthira, the virtuous fowler, eminent in\r\npity, then skilfully addressed himself again to that foremost of\r\nBrahmanas, saying, 'It is the dictum of the aged that the ways of\r\nrighteousness are subtle, diverse and infinite. When life is at stake and\r\nin the matter of marriage, it is proper to tell an untruth. Untruth\r\nsometimes leads to the triumph of truth, and the latter dwindles into\r\nuntruth. Whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is\r\nconsidered to be truth. Virtue is thus perverted; mark thou its subtle\r\nways. O best of virtuous men, man's actions are either good or bad, and\r\nhe undoubtedly reaps their fruits. The ignorant man having attained to an\r\nabject state, grossly abuses the gods, not knowing that it is the\r\nconsequence of his own evil karma. The foolish, the designing and the\r\nfickle, O good Brahmana, always attain the very reverse of happiness or\r\nmisery. Neither learning nor good morals, nor personal exertion can save\r\nthem. And if the fruits of our exertion were not dependent on anything\r\nelse, people would attain the object of their desire, by simply striving\r\nto attain it.\r\n\r\nIt is seen that able, intelligent and diligent persons are baffled in\r\ntheir efforts, and do not attain the fruits of their actions. On the\r\nother hand, persons who are always active in injuring others and in\r\npractising deception on the world, lead a happy life. There are some who\r\nattain prosperity without any exertion. And there are others, who with\r\nthe utmost exertion, are unable to achieve their dues. Miserly persons\r\nwith the object of having sons born to them worship the gods, and\r\npractise severe austerities, and those sons having remained in the womb\r\nfor ten months at length turn out to be very infamous issue of their\r\nrace; and others begotten under the same auspices, decently pass their\r\nlives in luxury with heaps of riches and grain accumulated by their\r\nancestors. The diseases from which man suffer, are undoubtedly the result\r\nof their own karma. They then behave like small deer at the hands of\r\nhunters, and they are racked with mental troubles. And, O Brahmana, as\r\nhunters intercept the flight of their game, the progress of those\r\ndiseases is checked by able and skilful physicians with their collections\r\nof drugs. And, the best of the cherishers of religion, thou hast observed\r\nthat those who have it in their power to enjoy (the good things of this\r\nearth), are prevented from doing so from the fact of their suffering from\r\nchronic bowel-complaints, and that many others that are strong and\r\npowerful, suffer from misery, and are enabled with great difficulty to\r\nobtain a livelihood; and that every man is thus helpless, overcome by\r\nmisery and illusion, and again and again tossed and overpowered by the\r\npowerful current of his own actions (karma). If there were absolute\r\nfreedom of action, no creature would die, none would be subject to decay,\r\nor await his evil doom, and everybody would attain the object of his\r\ndesire. All persons desire to out distance their neighbours (in the race\r\nof life), and they strive to do so to the utmost of their power; but the\r\nresult turns out otherwise. Many are the persons born under the influence\r\nof the same star and the same auspices of good luck; but a great\r\ndiversity is observable in the maturity of their actions. No person, O\r\ngood Brahmana, can be the dispenser of his own lot. The actions done in a\r\nprevious existence are seen to fructify in our present life. It is the\r\nimmemorial tradition that the soul is eternal and everlasting, but the\r\ncorporeal frame of all creatures is subject to destruction here (below).\r\nWhen therefore life is extinguished, the body only is destroyed, but the\r\nspirit, wedded to its actions, travels elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana replied, 'O best of those versed in the doctrine of karma,\r\nand in the delivery of discourses, I long to know accurately how the soul\r\nbecomes eternal.' The fowler replied, 'The spirit dies not, there being\r\nsimply a change of tenement. They are mistaken, who foolishly say that\r\nall creatures die. The soul betakes itself to another frame, and its\r\nchange of habitation is called its death. In the world of men, no man\r\nreaps the consequences of another man's karma. Whatever one does, he is\r\nsure to reap the consequences thereof; for the consequences of the karma\r\nthat is once done, can never be obviated. The virtuous become endowed\r\nwith great virtues, and sinful men become the perpetrators of wicked\r\ndeeds. Men's actions follow them; and influenced by these, they are born\r\nagain.' The Brahmana enquired, 'Why does the spirit take its birth, and\r\nwhy does its nativity become sinful or virtuous, and how, O good man,\r\ndoes it come to belong to a sinful or virtuous race?' The fowler replied,\r\nThis mystery seems to belong to the subject of procreation, but I shall\r\nbriefly describe to you, O good Brahmana, how the spirit is born again\r\nwith its accumulated load of karma, the righteous in a virtuous, and the\r\nwicked in a sinful nativity. By the performance of virtuous actions it\r\nattains to the state of the gods, and by a combination of good and evil,\r\nit acquires the human state; by indulgence in sensuality and similar\r\ndemoralising practices it is born in the lower species of animals, and by\r\nsinful acts, it goes to the infernal regions. Afflicted with the miseries\r\nof birth and dotage, man is fated to rot here below from the evil\r\nconsequences of his own actions. Passing through thousands of births as\r\nalso the infernal regions, our spirits wander about, secured by the\r\nfetters of their own karma. Animate beings become miserable in the next\r\nworld on account of these actions done by themselves and from the\r\nreaction of those miseries, they assume lower births and then they\r\naccumulate a new series of actions, and they consequently suffer misery\r\nover again, like sickly men partaking of unwholesome food; and although\r\nthey are thus afflicted, they consider themselves to be happy and at ease\r\nand consequently their fetters are not loosened and new karma arises; and\r\nsuffering from diverse miseries they turn about in this world like a\r\nwheel. If casting off their fetters they purify themselves by their\r\nactions and practise austerities and religious meditations, then, O best\r\nof Brahmanas, they attain the Elysian regions by these numerous acts and\r\nby casting off their fetters and by the purification of karma, men attain\r\nthose blissful regions where misery is unknown to those who go there. The\r\nsinful man who is addicted to vices, never comes to the end of his course\r\nof iniquities. Therefore must we strive to do what is virtuous and\r\nforbear from doing what is unrighteous. Whoever with a heart full of\r\ngratefulness and free from malice strives to do what is good, attains\r\nwealth, virtue, happiness and heaven (hereafter). Those who are purified\r\nof sins, wise, forbearing, constant in righteousness, and self-restrained\r\nenjoy continuous felicity in this as well as in the next world. Man must\r\nfollow the standard of virtue of the good and in his acts imitate the\r\nexample of the righteous. There are virtuous men, versed in holy writ and\r\nlearned in all departments of knowledge. Man's proper duty consists in\r\nfollowing his own proper avocation, and this being the case these latter\r\ndo not become confused and mixed up. The wise man delights in virtue and\r\nlives by righteousness. And, O good Brahmana, such a man with the wealth\r\nof righteousness which he hereby acquires, waters the root of the plant\r\nin which he finds most virtue. The virtuous man acts thus and his mind is\r\ncalmed. He is pleased with his friends in this world and he also attains\r\nhappiness hereafter. Virtuous people, O good man, acquire dominion over\r\nall and the pleasure of beauty, flavour, sound and touch according to\r\ntheir desire. These are known to be the rewards of virtue. But the man of\r\nenlightened vision, O great Brahmana, is not satisfied with reaping the\r\nfruits of righteousness. Not content with that, he with the light of\r\nspiritual wisdom that is in him, becomes indifferent to pain and pleasure\r\nand the vice of the world influenceth him not. Of his own free will he\r\nbecometh indifferent to worldly pursuits but he forsaketh not virtue.\r\nObserving that everything worldly is evanescent, he trieth to renounce\r\neverything and counting on more chance he deviseth means for the\r\nattainment of salvation. Thus doth he renounce the pursuits of the world,\r\nshuneth the ways of sin, becometh virtuous and at last attaineth\r\nsalvation. Spiritual wisdom is the prime requisite of men for salvation,\r\nresignation and forbearance are its roots. By this means he attaineth all\r\nthe objects of this desire. But subduing the senses and by means of\r\ntruthfulness and forbearance, he attaineth, O good Brahmana, the supreme\r\nasylum of Brahma.' The Brahmana again enquired, 'O thou most eminent in\r\nvirtue and constant in the performance of the religious obligations, you\r\ntalk of senses; what are they; how may they be subdued; and what is the\r\ngood of subduing them; and how doth a creature reap the fruits thereof? O\r\npious man, I beg to acquaint myself with the truth of this matter.\""

The\r\nfowler said, 'Men's minds are at first bent on the acquisition of\r\nknowledge. That acquired, O good Brahmana, they indulge in their passions\r\nand desires, and for that end, they labour and set about tasks of great\r\nmagnitude and indulge in much-desired pleasures of beauty, flavour, &c.\r\nThen follows fondness, then envy, then avarice and then extinction of all\r\nspiritual light. And when men are thus influenced by avarice, and\r\novercome by envy and fondness, their intellect ceases to be guided by\r\nrighteousness and they practise the very mockery of virtue. Practising\r\nvirtue with hypocrisy, they are content to acquire wealth by\r\ndishonourable means with the wealth thus acquired the intelligent\r\nprinciple in them becomes enamoured of those evil ways, and they are\r\nfilled with a desire to commit sins. And when, O good Brahmana, their\r\nfriends and men of wisdom remonstrate with them, they are ready with\r\nspecious answers, which are neither sound nor convincing. From their\r\nbeing addicted to evil ways, they are guilty of a threefold sin. They\r\ncommit sin in thought, in word, as also in action. They being addicted to\r\nwicked ways, all their good qualities die out, and these men of wicked\r\ndeeds cultivate the friendship of men of similar character, and\r\nconsequently they suffer misery in this world as well as in the next. The\r\nsinful man is of this nature, and now hear of the man of virtue. He\r\ndiscerns these evils by means of his spiritual insight, and is able to\r\ndiscriminate between happiness and misery, and is full of respectful\r\nattention to men of virtue, and from practising virtues, his mind becomes\r\ninclined to righteousness.' The Brahmana replied, 'Thou hast given a true\r\nexposition of religion which none else is able to expound. Thy spiritual\r\npower is great, and thou dost appear to me to be like a great Rishi.' The\r\nfowler replied, 'The great Brahmanas are worshipped with the same honours\r\nas our ancestors and they are always propitiated with offerings of food\r\nbefore others. Wise men in this world do what is pleasing to them, with\r\nall their heart. And I shall, O good Brahmana, describe to thee what is\r\npleasing to them, after having bowed down to Brahmanas as a class. Do\r\nthou learn from me the Brahmanic philosophy. This whole universe\r\nunconquerable everywhere and abounding in great elements, is Brahma, and\r\nthere is nothing higher than this. The earth, air, water, fire and sky\r\nare the great elements. And form, odour, sound, touch and taste are their\r\ncharacteristic properties. These latter too have their properties which\r\nare also correlated to each other. And of the three qualities, which are\r\ngradually characterised by each, in order of priority is consciousness\r\nwhich is called the mind. The seventh is intelligence and after that\r\ncomes egoism; and then the five senses, then the soul, then the moral\r\nqualities called sattwa, rajas and tamas. These seventeen are said to be\r\nthe unknown or incomprehensible qualities. I have described all this to\r\nthee, what else dost thou wish to know?'\""

The fowler replied, 'The earth,\r\nwater, fire, air and sky all have properties interlapping each other. I\r\nshall describe them to thee. The earth, O Brahmana, has five qualities,\r\nwater four, fire three and the air and sky together three also. Sound,\r\ntouch, form, odour and taste--these five qualities belong to earth, and\r\nsound, touch, form and taste, O austere Brahmana, have been described to\r\nthee as the properties of water, and sound, touch and form are the three\r\nproperties of fire and air has two properties sound and touch, and sound\r\nis the property of sky. And, O Brahmana, these fifteen properties\r\ninherent in five elements, exist in all substances of which this universe\r\nis composed. And they are not opposed to one another; they exist, O\r\nBrahmana, in proper combination. When this whole universe is thrown into\r\na state of confusion, then every corporeal being in the fulness of time,\r\nassumes another corpus. It arises and perishes in due order. And there\r\nare present the five elementary substances of which all the mobile and\r\nimmobile world is composed. Whatever is perceptible by the senses, is\r\ncalled vyakta (knowable or comprehensible) and whatever is beyond the\r\nreach of the senses and can only be perceived by guesses, is known to be\r\navyakta (not vyakta). When a per on engages in the discipline of\r\nself-examination, after having subdued the senses which have of their own\r\nproper objective play in the external conditions of sound, form, &c, then\r\nhe beholds his own spirit pervading the universe, and the universe\r\nreflected in itself. He who is wedded to his previous karma, although\r\nskilled in the highest spiritual wisdom, is cognisant only of his soul's\r\nobjective existence, but the person whose soul is never affected by the\r\nobjective conditions around, is never subject to ills, owing to its\r\nabsorption in the elementary spirit of Brahma. When a person has overcome\r\nthe domination of illusion, his manly virtues consisting of the essence\r\nof spiritual wisdom, turn to the spiritual enlightenment which illumines\r\nthe intelligence of sentient beings. Such a person is styled by the\r\nomnipotent, intelligent Spirit as one who is without beginning and\r\nwithout end, self-existent, immutable, incorporeal and incomparable.\r\nThis, O Brahmana, that thou hast enquired of me is only the result of\r\nself discipline. And this self-discipline can only be acquired by\r\nsubduing the senses. It cannot be otherwise, heaven and hell are both\r\ndependent on our senses. When subdued, they lead to heaven; when indulged\r\nin, they lead to perdition. This subjugation of the senses is the highest\r\nmeans of attaining spiritual light. Our senses are at the (cause) root of\r\nour spiritual advancement as also at the root of our spiritual\r\ndegradation. By indulging in them, a person undoubtedly contracts vices,\r\nand by subduing these, he attains salvation. The self-restrained person\r\nwho acquires mastery over the six senses inherent in our nature, is never\r\ntainted with sin, and consequently evil has no power over him. Man's\r\ncorporeal self has been compared to a chariot, his soul to a charioteer\r\nand his senses to horses. A dexterous man drives about without confusion,\r\nlike a quiet charioteer with well-broken horses. That man is an excellent\r\ndriver who knows how to patiently wield the reins of those wild\r\nhorses,--the six senses inherent in our nature. When our senses become\r\nungovernable like horses on the high road, we must patiently rein them\r\nin; for with patience, we are sure to get the better of them. When a\r\nman's mind is overpowered by any one of these senses running wild, he\r\nloses his reason, and becomes like a ship tossed by storms upon the high\r\nocean. Men are deceived by illusion in hoping to reap the fruits of those\r\nsix things, whose effects are studied by persons of spiritual insight,\r\nwho thereby reap the fruits of their clear perception.\""

The Brahmana said, 'Do thou truly describe to\r\nme, who now duly ask thee, the respective virtues of the qualities of\r\nsattwa, rajas, and tamas.' The fowler replied, 'Very well, I shall tell\r\nthee what thou hast asked. I shall describe separately their respective\r\nvirtues, do thou listen. Of them tamas is characterised by illusion\r\n(spiritual), rajas incites (men to action), sattwa is of great grandeur,\r\nand on that account, it is said to be the greatest of them. He who is\r\ngreatly under the influence of spiritual ignorance, who is foolish,\r\nsenseless and given to dreaming, who is idle, unenergetic and swayed by\r\nanger and haughtiness, is said to be under the influence of tamas. And, O\r\nBrahmana rishi, that excellent man who is agreeable in speech,\r\nthoughtful, free from envy, industrious in action from an eager desire to\r\nreap its fruits, and of warm temperament, is said to be under the\r\ninfluence of rajas. And he who is resolute, patient, not subject to\r\nanger, free from malice, and is not skilful in action from want of a\r\nselfish desire to reap its fruits, wise and forbearing, is said to be\r\nunder the influence of sattwa. When a man endowed with the sattwa\r\nquality, is influenced by worldliness, he suffers misery; but he hates\r\nworldliness, when he realises its full significance. And then a feeling\r\nof indifference to worldly affairs begins to influence him. And then his\r\npride decreases, and uprightness becomes more prominent, and his\r\nconflicting moral sentiments are reconciled. And then self-restraint in\r\nany matter becomes unnecessary. A man, O Brahmana, may be born in the\r\nSudra caste, but if he is possessed of good qualities, he may attain the\r\nstate of Vaisya and similarly that of a Kshatriya, and if he is steadfast\r\nin rectitude, he may even become a Brahmana.

Markandeya said, 'This question, O\r\nYudhishthira, having been put to the Brahmana by the fowler, the latter,\r\nin reply, said to that high-minded Brahmana. (The fowler said):--The\r\nvital spirit manifesting itself in the seat of consciousness, causes the\r\naction of the corporeal frame. And the soul being present in both of them\r\nacts (through them). The past, the present and the future are inseparably\r\nassociated with the soul. And it is the highest of a creature's\r\npossessions; it is of the essence of the Supreme Spirit and we adore it.\r\nIt is the animating principle of all creatures, and it is the eternal\r\npurusha (spirit). It is great and it is the intelligence and the ego, and\r\nit is the subjective seat of the various properties of elements. Thus\r\nwhile seated here (in a corporeal frame) it is sustained in all its\r\nrelations external or internal (to matter or mind) by the subtle ethereal\r\nair called prana, and thereafter, each creature goes its own way by the\r\naction of another subtle air called Samana. And this latter transforming\r\nitself into Apana air, and supported by the head of the stomach carries\r\nthe refuse matter of the body, urine &c, to the kidneys and intestines.\r\nThat same air is present in the three elements of effort, exertion and\r\npower, and in that condition it is called Udana air by persons learned in\r\nphysical science, and when manifesting itself by its presence at all the\r\njunctional points of the human system, it is known by the name Vyana. And\r\nthe internal heat is diffused over all the tissues of our system, and\r\nsupported by these kinds of air, it transforms our food and the tissues\r\nand the humours of our system. And by the coalition of Prana and other\r\nairs, a reaction (combination) ensues, and the heat generated thereby is\r\nknown as the internal heat of the human system which causes the digestion\r\nof our food. The Prana and the Apana air are interposed within the Samana\r\nand the Udana air. And the heat generated by their coalition causes the\r\ngrowth of the body (consisting of the seven substances, bones, muscles,\r\n&c). And that portion of its seat extending to as far as the rectum is\r\ncalled Apana; and from that arteries arise in the five airs Prana, &c.\r\nThe Prana air, acted on by the heat strikes against the extremity of the\r\nApana region and then recoiling, it reacts on the heat. Above the navel\r\nis the region of undigested food and below it the region of digestion.\r\nAnd the Prana and all other airs of the system are seated in the navel.\r\nThe arteries issuing from the heart run upwards and downwards, as also in\r\noblique directions; they carry the best essence of our food, and are\r\nacted upon by the ten Prana airs. This is the way by which patient Yogins\r\nwho have overcome all difficulties, and who view things with an impartial\r\nand equal eye, with their souls seated in the brain, find the Supreme\r\nSpirit, the Prana and the Apana airs are thus present in the body of all\r\ncreatures. Know that the spirit is embodied in corporeal disguise, in the\r\neleven allotropous conditions (of the animal system), and that though\r\neternal, its normal state is apparently modified by its\r\naccompaniments,--even like the fire purified in its pan,--eternal, yet\r\nwith its course altered by its surroundings; and that the divine thing\r\nwhich is kindred with the body is related to the latter in the same way\r\nas a drop of water to the sleek surface of a lotus-leaf on which it\r\nrolls. Know that sattwa, rajas and tamas, are the attributes of all life\r\nand that life is the attribute of spirit, and that the latter again is an\r\nattribute of the Supreme Spirit. Inert, insensible matter is the seat of\r\nthe living principle, which is active in itself and induces activity in\r\nothers. That thing by which the seven worlds are incited to action is\r\ncalled the most high by men of high spiritual insight. Thus in all these\r\nelements, the eternal spirit does not show itself, but is perceived by\r\nthe learned in spiritual science by reason of their high and keen\r\nperception. A pure-minded person, by purification of his heart, is able\r\nto destroy the good and evil effect of his actions and attains eternal\r\nbeatitude by the enlightenment of his inward spirit. That state of peace\r\nand purification of heart is likened to the state of a person who in a\r\ncheerful state of mind sleeps soundly, or the brilliance of a lamp\r\ntrimmed by a skillful hand. Such a pure-minded person living on spare\r\ndiet perceives the Supreme Spirit reflected in his own, and by practising\r\nconcentration of mind in the evening and small hours of the night, he\r\nbeholds the Supreme Spirit which has no attributes, in the light of his\r\nheart, shining like a dazzling lamp, and thus he attains salvation.\r\nAvarice and anger must be subdued by all means, for this act constitutes\r\nthe most sacred virtue that people can practise and is considered to be\r\nthe means by which men can cross over to the other side of this sea of\r\naffliction and trouble. A man must preserve his righteousness from being\r\novercome by the evil consequences of anger, his virtues from the effects\r\nof pride, his learning from the effects of vanity, and his own spirit\r\nfrom illusion. Leniency is the best of virtues, and forbearance is the\r\nbest of powers, the knowledge of our spiritual nature is the best of all\r\nknowledge, and truthfulness is the best of all religious obligations. The\r\ntelling of truth is good, and the knowledge of truth may also be good,\r\nbut what conduces to the greatest good of all creatures, is known as the\r\nhighest truth. He whose actions are performed not with the object of\r\nsecuring any reward or blessing, who has sacrificed all to the\r\nrequirements of his renunciation, is a real Sannyasin and is really wise.\r\nAnd as communion with Brahma cannot be taught to us, even by our\r\nspiritual preceptor,--he only giving us a clue to the\r\nmystery--renunciation of the material world is called Yoga. We must not\r\ndo harm to any creature and must live in terms of amity with all, and in\r\nthis our present existence, we must not avenge ourselves on any creature.\r\nSelf-abnegation, peace of mind, renunciation of hope, and\r\nequanimity,--these are the ways by which spiritual enlightenment can\r\nalways be secured; and the knowledge of self (one's own spiritual nature)\r\nis the best of all knowledge. In this world as well as hereafter,\r\nrenouncing all worldly desires and assuming a stoic indifference, wherein\r\nall suffering is at rest, people should fulfil their religious duties\r\nwith the aid of their intelligence. The muni who desires to obtain moksha\r\n(salvation), which is very difficult to attain, must be constant in\r\nausterities, forbearing, self-restrained, and must give up that longing\r\nfondness which binds him to the things of this earth. They call these the\r\nattributes of the Supreme Spirit. The gunas (qualities or attributes)\r\nthat we are conscious of, reduce themselves to agunas (non-gunas) in Him;\r\nHe is not bound by anything, and is perceptible only by the expansion and\r\ndevelopment of our spiritual vision; as soon as the illusion of ignorance\r\nis dispelled, this supreme unalloyed beatitude is attained. By foregoing\r\nthe objects of both pleasure and pain and by renouncing the feelings\r\nwhich bind him to the things of this earth, a man may attain Brahma\r\n(Supreme Spirit or salvation). O good Brahmana, I have now briefly\r\nexplained to thee all this, as I have heard. What else dost thou wish to\r\nknow?\""

Thou art a good and dutiful\r\nson, for, we are constantly and reasonably looked after by thee, and even\r\namongst the celestials thou hast not another divinity to worship. By\r\nconstantly subduing thyself, thou hast become endowed with the\r\nself-restraining power of Brahmanas and all thy grandsires and ancestors\r\nare constantly pleased with thee for thy self-restraining virtues and for\r\nthy piety towards us. In thought, word or deed thy attention to us never\r\nflags, and it seems that at present thou hast no other thought in thy\r\nmind (save as to how to please us). As Rama, the son of Jamadagni,\r\nlaboured to please his aged parents, so hast thou, O Son, done to please\r\nus, and even more. Then the fowler introduced the Brahmana to his parents\r\nand they received him with the usual salutation of welcome, and the\r\nBrahmana accepting their welcome, enquired if they, with their children\r\nand servants, were all right at home, and if they were always enjoying\r\ngood health at that time (of life). The aged couple replied, 'At home, O\r\nBrahmana, we are all right, with all our servants. Hast thou, adorable\r\nsir, reached this place without any difficulty?' Markandeya continued,\r\n\"The Brahmana replied, 'Yes, I have.' Then the fowler addressing himself\r\nto the Brahmana said to him, 'These my parents, worshipful sir, are the\r\nidols that I worship; whatever is due to the gods, I do unto them. As the\r\nthirty-three gods with Indra at their head are worshipped by men, so are\r\nthese aged parents of mine worshipped by me. As Brahmanas exert\r\nthemselves for the purpose of procuring offering for their gods, so do I\r\nact with diligence for these two (idols of mine). These my father and\r\nmother, O Brahmana, are my supreme gods, and I seek to please them always\r\nwith offering of flowers, fruits and gems. To me they are like the three\r\nsacred fires mentioned by the learned; and, O Brahmana, they seem to me\r\nto be as good as sacrifices or the four Vedas. My five life-giving airs,\r\nmy wife and children and friends are all for them (dedicated to their\r\nservice). And with my wife and children I always attend on them. O good\r\nBrahmana, with my own hands I assist them in bathing and also wash their\r\nfeet and give them food and I say to them only what is agreeable, leaving\r\nout what is unpleasant. I consider it to be my highest duty to do what is\r\nagreeable to them even though it be not strictly justifiable. And, O\r\nBrahmana, I am always diligent in attending on them. The two parents, the\r\nsacred fire, the soul and the spiritual preceptor, these five, O good\r\nBrahmana, are worthy of the highest reverence from a person who seeks\r\nprosperity. By serving them properly, one acquires the merit of\r\nperpetually keeping up the sacred fire. And it is the eternal and\r\ninvariable duty of all householders.\""

For this, thou wast told by that\r\nself-restrained, truthful lady, devoted to her husband, 'Hie thee to\r\nMithila; for there lives a fowler who will explain to thee, the mysteries\r\nof religion.' The Brahmana said, 'O pious man, so constant in fulfilling\r\nthy religious obligations, bethinking myself of what that truthful\r\ngood-natured lady so true to her husband, hath said, I am convinced that\r\nthou art really endowed with every high quality.' The fowler replied, 'I\r\nhave no doubt, my lord, that what that lady, so faithful to her husband,\r\nsaid to thee about me, was said with full knowledge of the facts. I have,\r\nO Brahmana, explained to thee all this as a matter of favour. And now,\r\ngood sir, listen to me. I shall explain what is good for thee. O good\r\nBrahmana, of irreproachable character, thou hast wronged thy father and\r\nthy mother, for thou hast left home without their permission, for the\r\npurpose of learning the Vedas. Thou hast not acted properly in this\r\nmatter, for thy ascetic and aged parents have become entirely blind from\r\ngrief at thy loss. Do thou return home to console them. May this virtue\r\nnever forsake thee Thou art high-minded, of ascetic merit, and always\r\ndevoted to thy religion but all these have become useless to thee. Do\r\nthou without delay return to console thy parents. Do have some regard for\r\nmy words and not act otherwise; I tell thee what is good for thee, O\r\nBrahmana Rishi, Do thou return home this very day.' The Brahmana replied,\r\n'This that thou hast said, is undoubtedly true; mayst thou, O pious man,\r\nattain prosperity; I am much pleased with thee.' The fowler said, 'O\r\nBrahmana, as thou practisest with assiduousness those divine, ancient,\r\nand eternal virtues which are so difficult of attainment even by\r\npure-minded persons, thou appearest (to me) like a divine being. Return\r\nto the side of thy father and mother and be quick and diligent in\r\nhonouring thy parents; for, I do not know if there is any virtue higher\r\nthan this.' The Brahmana replied, 'By a piece of singular good luck have\r\nI arrived here, and by a piece of similar good luck have I thus been\r\nassociated with thee. It is very difficult to find out, in our midst, a\r\nperson who can so well expound the mysteries of religion; there is\r\nscarcely one man among thousands, who is well versed in the science of\r\nreligion. I am very glad, O great man, to have secured thy friendship;\r\nmayst thou be prosperous. I was on the point of falling into hell, but\r\nwas extricated by thee. It was destined to be so, for thou didst\r\n(unexpectedly) come in my way. And, O great man, as the fallen King\r\nYayati was saved by his virtuous grandsons (daughter's sons), so, have I\r\nknow been saved by thee. According to thy advice, I shall honour my\r\nfather and my mother; for a man with an impure heart can never expound\r\nthe mysteries of sin and righteousness. As it is very difficult for a\r\nperson born in the Sudra class to learn the mysteries of the eternal\r\nreligion, I do not consider thee to be a Sudra. There must surely be some\r\nmystery in connection with this matter. Thou must have attained the\r\nSudra's estate by reason of the fruition of thine own past karma. O\r\nmagnanimous man, I long to know the truth about this matter. Do thou tell\r\nit to me with attention and according to thy own inclination.'\r\n\r\n\"The fowler replied, 'O good Brahmana, Brahmanas are worthy of all\r\nrespect from me. Listen, O sinless one, to this story of a previous\r\nexistence of mine. O son of an excellent Brahmana, I was formerly a\r\nBrahmana, well-read in the Vedas, and an accomplished student of the\r\nVedangas. Through my own fault I have been degraded to my present state.\r\nA certain king, accomplished in the science of dhanurveda (science of\r\narchery), was my friend; and from his companionship, O Brahmana, I, too\r\nbecame skilled in archery; and one day the king, in company with his\r\nministers and followed by his best warriors, went out on a hunting\r\nexpedition. He killed a large number of deer near a hermitage. I, too, O\r\ngood Brahmana, discharged a terrible arrow. And a rishi was wounded by\r\nthat arrow with its head bent out. He fell down upon the ground, and\r\nscreaming loudly said, 'I have harmed no one, what sinful man has done\r\nthis?' And, my lord, taking him for a deer, I went up to him and found\r\nthat he was pierced through the body by my arrow. On account of my wicked\r\ndeed I was sorely grieved (in mind). And then I said to that rishi of\r\nsevere ascetic merit, who was loudly crying, lying upon the ground, 'I\r\nhave done this unwittingly, O rishi.' And also this I said to the muni:\r\n'Do thou think it proper to pardon all this transgression.' But, O\r\nBrahmana, the rishi, lashing himself into a fury, said to me, 'Thou shalt\r\nbe born as a cruel fowler in the Sudra class.\""

It behooves thee to pardon all that. Do thou, worshipful\r\nsir, soothe yourself.' The rishi replied, 'The curse that I have\r\npronounced can never be falsified, this is certain. But from kindness\r\ntowards thee, I shall do thee a favour. Though born in the Sudra class\r\nthou shalt remain a pious man and thou shalt undoubtedly honour thy\r\nparents; and by honouring them thou shalt attain great spiritual\r\nperfection; thou shalt also remember the events of thy past life and\r\nshalt go to heaven; and on the expiation of this curse, thou shalt again\r\nbecome a Brahmana. O best of men, thus, of old was I cursed by that rishi\r\nof severe power, and thus was he propitiated by me. Then, O good\r\nBrahmana, I extricated the arrow from his body, and took him into the\r\nhermitage, but he was not deprived of his life (recovered). O good\r\nBrahmana, I have thus described to thee what happened to me of old, and\r\nalso how I can go to heaven hereafter.' The Brahmana said, 'O thou of\r\ngreat intelligence, all men are thus subject to happiness or misery, thou\r\nshouldst not therefore grieve for that. In obedience to the customs of\r\nthy (present) race, thou hast pursued these wicked ways, but thou art\r\nalways devoted to virtue and versed in the ways and mysteries of the\r\nworld. And, O learned man, these being the duties of thy profession, the\r\nstain of evil karma will not attach to thee. And after dwelling here for\r\nsome little time, thou shalt again become a Brahmana; and even now, I\r\nconsider thee to be a Brahmana, there is no doubt about this. For the\r\nBrahmana who is vain and haughty, who is addicted to vices and wedded to\r\nevil and degrading practices, is like a Sudra. On the other hand, I\r\nconsider a Sudra who is always adorned with these\r\nvirtues,--righteousness, self-restraint, and truthfulness,--as a\r\nBrahmana. A man becomes a Brahmana by his character; by his own evil\r\nkarma a man attains an evil and terrible doom. O good man. I believe that\r\nsin in thee has now died out. Thou must not grieve for this, for men,\r\nlike thee who art so virtuous and learned in the ways and mysteries of\r\nthe world, can have no cause for grief.'\r\n\r\n\"The fowler replied, 'The bodily afflictions should be cured with\r\nmedicines, and the mental ones with spiritual wisdom. This is the power\r\nof knowledge. Knowing this, the wise should not behave like boys. Man of\r\nlow intelligence are overpowered with grief at the occurrence of\r\nsomething which is not agreeable to them, or non-occurrence of something\r\nwhich is good or much desired. Indeed, all creatures are subject to this\r\ncharacteristic (of grief or happiness). It is not merely a single\r\ncreature or class that is subject to misery. Cognisant of this evil,\r\npeople quickly mend their ways, and if they perceive it at the very\r\noutset they succeed in curing it altogether. Whoever grieves for it, only\r\nmakes himself uneasy. Those wise men whose knowledge has made them happy\r\nand contented, and who are indifferent to happiness and misery alike, are\r\nreally happy. The wise are always contented and the foolish always\r\ndiscontented. There is no end to discontentment, and contentment is the\r\nhighest happiness. People who have reached the perfect way, do not\r\ngrieve, they are always conscious of the final destiny of all creatures.\r\nOne must not give way to discontent[57] for it is like a virulent poison.\r\nIt kills persons of undeveloped intelligence, just as child is killed by\r\nan enraged snake. That man has no manliness whose energies have left him\r\nand who is overpowered with perplexity when an occasion for the exercise\r\nof vigour presents itself. Our actions are surely followed by their\r\nconsequences. Whoever merely gives himself up to passive indifference (to\r\nworldly affairs) accomplishes no good. Instead of murmuring one must try\r\nto find out the way by which he can secure exemption from (spiritual)\r\nmisery; and the means of salvation found, he must then free himself from\r\nsensuality. The man who has attained a high state of spiritual knowledge\r\nis always conscious of the great deficiency (instability) of all matter.\r\nSuch a person keeping in view the final doom (of all), never grieves, I\r\ntoo, O learned man, do not grieve; I stay here (in this life) biding my\r\ntime. For this reason, O best of men, I am not perplexed (with doubts)'.\r\nThe Brahmana said, 'Thou art wise and high in spiritual knowledge and\r\nvast is thy intelligence. Thou who art versed in holy writ, art content\r\nwith thy spiritual wisdom. I have no cause to find fault with thee.\r\nAdieu, O best of pious men, mayst thou be prosperous, and may\r\nrighteousness shield thee, and mayst thou be assiduous in the practice of\r\nvirtue.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, The fowler said to him, 'Be it so'. And the good\r\nBrahmana walked round him[58] and then departed. And the Brahmana\r\nreturning home was duly assiduous in his attention to his old parents. I\r\nhave thus, O pious Yudhishthira, narrated in detail to thee this history\r\nfull of moral instruction, which thou, my good son, didst ask me to\r\nrecite,--the virtue of women's devotion to their husbands and that of\r\nfilial piety.' Yudhishthira replied, 'O most pious Brahmana and best of\r\nmunis, thou hast related to me this good and wonderful moral story; and\r\nlistening to thee, O learned man, my time has glided away like a moment;\r\nbut, O adorable sir, I am not as yet satiated with hearing this moral[59]\r\ndiscourse.'\""

There is\r\nbut one fire, but according to the nature of its action, it is seen to\r\ndivide itself into many. O worshipful sir, I long to be enlightened on\r\nall these points,--How the Kumara[61] was born, how he came to be known\r\nas the son of Agni (the fire-god) and how he was begotten by Rudra or\r\nGanga and Krittika. O noble scion of Bhrigu's race, I desire to learn all\r\nthis accurately as it happened. O great muni, I am filled with great\r\ncuriosity.' Markandeya replied, 'In this connection this old story is\r\ncited by the learned, as to how the carrier of oblations (the fire-god)\r\nin a fit of rage, sought the waters of the sea in order to perform a\r\npenance, and how the adorable Angiras transforming himself into the\r\nfire-god,[62] destroyed darkness and distressed the world with his\r\nscorching rays. In olden times, O long-armed hero, the great Angiras\r\nperformed a wonderful penance in his hermitage; he even excelled the\r\nfire-god, the carrier of oblations, in splendour and in that state he\r\nillumined the whole universe. At that time the fire-god was also\r\nperforming a penance and was greatly distressed by his (Angirasa's)\r\neffulgence. He was greatly depressed, but did not know what to do. Then\r\nthat adorable god thought within himself, 'Brahma has created another\r\nfire-god for this universe. As I have been practising austerities, my\r\nservices as the presiding deity of fire have been dispensed with; and\r\nthen he considered how he could re-establish himself as the god of fire.\r\nHe beheld the great muni giving heat to the whole universe like fire, and\r\napproached him slowly with fear. But Angiras said to him, 'Do thou\r\nquickly re-establish yourself as the fire animating the universe, thou\r\nart well-known in the three stable worlds and thou wast first created by\r\nBrahma to dispel darkness. Do thou, O destroyer of darkness, quickly\r\noccupy thine own proper place.' Agni replied, 'My reputation has been\r\ninjured now in this world. And thou art become the fire-god, and people\r\nwill know thee, and not me, as fire. I have relinquished my god-hood of\r\nfire, do thou become the primeval fire and I shall officiate as the\r\nsecond or Prajapatyaka fire.' Angiras replied, 'Do thou become the\r\nfire-god and the destroyer of darkness and do thou attend to thy sacred\r\nduty of clearing people's way to heaven, and do thou, O lord, make me\r\nspeedily thy first child.' Markandeya continued, 'Hearing these words of\r\nAngiras, the fire-god did as desired, and, O king, Angiras had a son\r\nnamed Vrihaspati. Knowing him to be the first son of Angiras by Agni, the\r\ngods, O Bharata, came and enquired about the mystery. And thus asked by\r\nthe gods he then enlightened them, and the gods then accepted the\r\nexplanation of Angiras. In this connection, I shall describe to thee\r\nreligious sorts of fire of great effulgence which are here variously\r\nknown in the Brahmanas[63] by their respective uses.\""

The fire in whose honour oblations of clarified butter\r\nare offered at the Paurnamasya and other sacrifices, was a son of\r\nVrishaspati called Sanju; he was of great ascetic merit. At the\r\nChaturmasya (four-monthly) and Aswamedha (horse) sacrifices, animals are\r\noffered first in his honour, and this powerful fire is indicated by\r\nnumerous flames. Sanju's wife was called Satya, she was of matchless\r\nbeauty and she sprang from Dharma (righteousness) for the sake of truth.\r\nThe blazing fire was his son, and he had three daughters of great\r\nreligious merit. The fire which is honoured with the first oblations at\r\nsacrifices is his first son called Bharadwaja. The second son of Sanju is\r\ncalled Bharata in whose honour oblations of clarified butter are offered\r\nwith the sacrificial ladle (called Sruk) at all the full moon\r\n(Paurnamasaya) sacrifices. Beside these, three sons of whom Bharata is\r\nthe senior, he had a son named Bharata and a daughter called Bharati. The\r\nBharata fire is the son of Prajapati Bharata Agni (fire). And, O ornament\r\nof Bharata's race, because he is greatly honoured, he is also called the\r\ngreat. Vira is Bharadwaja's wife; she gave birth to Vira. It is said by\r\nthe Brahmanas that he is worshipped like Soma (with the same hymns) with\r\nofferings of clarified butter. He is joined with Soma in the secondary\r\noblation of clarified butter and is also called Rathaprabhu, Rathadhwana\r\nand Kumbhareta. He begot a son named Siddhi by his wife Sarayu, and\r\nenveloped the sun with his splendour and from being the presiding genius\r\nof the fire sacrifice he is ever mentioned in the hymns in praise of\r\nfire. And the fire Nischyavana praises the earth only; he never suffers\r\nin reputation, splendour and prosperity. The sinless fire Satya blazing\r\nwith pure flame is his son. He is free from all taint and is not defiled\r\nby sin, and is the regulator of time. That fire has another name\r\nNishkriti, because he accomplished the Nishkriti (relief) of all blatant\r\ncreatures here. When properly worshipped he vouchsafes good fortune. His\r\nson is called Swana, who is the generator of all diseases; he inflicts\r\nsevere sufferings on people for which they cry aloud, and moves in the\r\nintelligence of the whole universe. And the other fire (Vrihaspati's\r\nthird son) is called Viswajit by men of spiritual wisdom. The fire, which\r\nis known as the internal heat by which the food of all creatures is\r\ndigested, is the fourth son of Vrihaspati known through all the worlds, O\r\nBharata, by the name of Viswabhuk. He is self-restrained, of great\r\nreligious merit, and is a Brahmacharin and he is worshipped by Brahmanas\r\nat the Paka-sacrifices. The sacred river Gomati was his wife and by her\r\nall religious-minded men perform their rites. And that terrible\r\nwater-drinking sea fire called Vadava is the fifth son of Vrihaspati.\r\nThis Brahmic fire has a tendency to move upwards and hence it is called\r\nUrdhvabhag, and is seated in the vital air called Prana. The sixth son is\r\ncalled the great Swishtakrit; for by him oblations became swishta (su,\r\nexcellently, and ishta, offered) and the udagdhara oblation is always\r\nmade in his honour. And when all creatures are claimed, the fire called\r\nManyauti becomes filled with fury. This inexorably terrible and highly\r\nirascible fire is the daughter of Vrihaspati, and is known as Swaha and\r\nis present in all matter. (By the respective influence of the three\r\nqualities of sattwa, rajas and tamas, Swaha had three sons). By reason of\r\nthe first she had a son who was equalled by none in heaven in personal\r\nbeauty, and from this fact he was surnamed by the gods as the\r\nKama-fire.[65] (By reason of the second) she had a son called the Amogha\r\nor invincible fire, the destroyer of his enemies in battle. Assured of\r\nsuccess he curbs his anger and is armed with a bow and seated on a\r\nchariot and adorned with wreaths of flowers. (From the action of the\r\nthird quality) she had a son, the great Uktha (the means of salvation)\r\npraised by (akin to) three Ukthas.[66] He is the originator of the great\r\nword[67] and is therefore known as the Samaswasa or the means of rest\r\n(salvation).'\""

He also produced the mind, and the five senses, and other\r\ncreatures. Having created these, he produced the five sons of the Pitris.\r\nOf these Pranidhi was the son of Vrihadratha. Vrihadratha was the son of\r\nKasyapa. Bhanu was the godson of Chyavana, Saurabha, the son of\r\nSuvarchaka, and Anudatta, the son of Prana.

These gods are divided into three classes of five each.\r\nLocated here in this world, they destroy the sacrifices of the gods in\r\nheaven; they frustrate their objects and spoil their oblations of\r\nclarified butter. They do this only to spite the sacred fires carrying\r\noblations to the gods. If the officiating priests are careful, they place\r\nthe oblations in their honour outside of the sacrificial altar. To that\r\nparticular place where the sacred fire may be placed, they cannot go.\r\nThey carry the oblation of their votaries by means of wings. When\r\nappeased by hymns, they do not frustrate the sacrificial rites.\r\nVrihaduktha, another son of Tapa, belongs to the Earth. He is worshipped\r\nhere in this world by pious men performing Agnihotra sacrifices. Of the\r\nson of Tapa who is known as Rathantara, it is said by officiating priests\r\nthat the sacrificial oblation offered in his honour is offered to\r\nMitravinda.

The Brahmanas who are learned in the Vedas, then speak of the\r\nexploits of the fire Sambhu. And after that the bright Avasathya fire of\r\ngreat refulgence is spoken of by the Brahmanas. Tapa thus created the\r\nfive Urjaskara fires, all bright as gold. These all share the Soma drink\r\nin sacrifices. The great sun-god when fatigued (after his day's labours)\r\nis known as the Prasanta fire. He created the terrible Asuras and various\r\nother creatures of the earth. Angiras, too created the Prajapati Bhanu,\r\nthe son of Tapa. He is also called Vrihadbhanu (the great Bhanu) by\r\nBrahmanas learned in the Vedas. Bhanu married Supraja, and Brihadbhanu\r\nthe daughter of Surya (the sun-god). They gave birth to six sons; do thou\r\nhear of their progeny. The fire who gives strength to the weak is called\r\nValada (or the giver of strength). He is the first son of Bhanu, and that\r\nother fire who looks terrible when all the elements are in a tranquil\r\nstate is called the Manjuman fire; he is the second son of Bhanu. And the\r\nfire in whose honour oblations of clarified butter are enjoined to be\r\nmade here at the Darsa and Paurnamasya sacrifices and who is known as\r\nVishnu in this world, is (the third son of Bhanu) called Angiras, or\r\nDhritiman. And the fire to whom with Indra, the Agrayana oblation is\r\nenjoined to be made is called the Agrayana fire. He is the (fourth) son\r\nof Bhanu. The fifth son of Bhanu is Agraha who is the source of the\r\noblations which are daily made for the performance of the Chaturmasya\r\n(four-monthly) rites. And Stuva is the sixth son of Bhanu. Nisa was the\r\nname of another wife of that Manu who is known by the name of Bhanu. She\r\ngave birth to one daughter, the two Agnishomas, and also five other\r\nfire-gods. The resplendent fire-god who is honoured with the first\r\noblations in company with the presiding deity of the clouds is called\r\nVaiswanara. And that other fire who is called the lord of all the worlds\r\nis Viswapati, the second son of Manu. And the daughter of Manu is called\r\nSwistakrit, because by oblations unto her one acquires great merit.\r\nThough she was the daughter of Hiranyakasipu, she yet became his wife for\r\nher evil deeds. She is, however, one of the Prajapatis. And that other\r\nfire which has its seats in the vital airs of all creatures and animates\r\ntheir bodies, is called Sannihita. It is the cause of our perceptions of\r\nsound and form. That divine spirit whose course is marked with black and\r\nwhite stains, who is the supporter of fire, and who, though free from\r\nsin, is the accomplisher of desired karma, whom the wise regard as a\r\ngreat Rishi, is the fire Kapila, the propounder of the Yoga system called\r\nSankhya. The fire through whom the elementary spirits always receive the\r\nofferings called Agra made by other creatures at the performance of all\r\nthe peculiar rites in this world is called Agrani. And these other bright\r\nfires famous in the world, were created for the rectification of the\r\nAgnihotra rites when marred by any defects. If the fires interlap each\r\nother by the action of the wind, then the rectification must be made with\r\nthe Ashtakapala rites in honour of the fire Suchi. And if the southern\r\nfire comes in contact with the two other fires, then rectification must\r\nbe made by the performance of the Ashtakapala rites in honour of the fire\r\nViti. If the fires in their place called Nivesa come in contact with the\r\nfire called Devagni, then the Ashtakapala rites must be performed in\r\nhonour of the fire Suchi for rectification. And if the perpetual fire is\r\ntouched by a woman in her monthly course, then for rectification the\r\nAshtakapala rites must be performed in honour of the fire called\r\nDasyuman. If at the time of the performance of this Agnihotra rites the\r\ndeath of any creature is spoken of, or if animals die, then rectification\r\nmust be made with the performance of the Ashtakapala rites in honour of\r\nthe Suraman fire. The Brahmana, who while suffering from a disease is\r\nunable to offer oblations to the sacred fire for three nights, must make\r\namends for the same by performing the Ashtakapala rites in honour of the\r\nnorthern fire. He who has performed the Darsa and the Paurnamasya rites\r\nmust make the rectification with the performance of the Ashtakapala rites\r\nin honour of the Patikrit fire. If the fire of a lying-in room comes in\r\ncontact with the perpetual sacred fire, then rectification must be made\r\nwith the performance of Ashtakapala rites in honour of the Agniman fire.'\""

      "content": "Markandeya continued, \"Mudita, the favourite wife of the fire Swaha, used\r\nto live in water. And Swaha who was the regent of the earth and sky beget\r\nin that wife of his a highly sacred fire called Advanta. There is a\r\ntradition amongst learned Brahmanas that this fire is the ruler and inner\r\nsoul of all creatures. He is worshipful, resplendent and the lord of all\r\nthe great Bhutas here. And that fire, under the name of Grihapati, is\r\never worshipped at all sacrifices and conveys all the oblations that are\r\nmade in this world. That great son of Swaha--the great Adbhuta fire is\r\nthe soul of the waters and the prince and regent of the sky and the lord\r\nof everything great. His (son), the Bharata fire, consumes the dead\r\nbodies of all creatures. His first Kratu is known as Niyata at the\r\nperformance of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. That powerful prime fire (Swaha)\r\nis always missed by the gods, because when he sees Niyata approaching him\r\nhe hides himself in the sea from fear of contamination. Searching for him\r\nin every direction, the gods could not (once) find him out and on\r\nbeholding Atharvan the fire said to him, 'O valiant being, do thou carry\r\nthe oblations for the gods! I am disabled from want of strength.\r\nAttaining the state of the red-eyed fire, do thou condescend to do me\r\nthis favour!' Having thus advised Atharvan, the fire went away to some\r\nother place. But his place of concealment was divulged by the finny\r\ntribe. Upon them the fire pronounced this curse in anger, 'You shall be\r\nthe food of all creatures in various ways.' And then that carrier of\r\noblations spoke unto Atharvan (as before). Though entreated by the gods,\r\nhe did not agree to continue carrying their oblations. He then became\r\ninsensible and instantly gave up the ghost. And leaving his material\r\nbody, he entered into the bowels of the earth. Coming into contact with\r\nthe earth, he created the different metals. Force and scent arose from\r\nhis pus; the Deodar pine from his bones; glass from his phlegm; the\r\nMarakata jewel from his bile; and the black iron from his liver. And all\r\nthe world has been embellished with these three substances (wood, stone\r\nand iron). The clouds were made from his nails, and corals from his\r\nveins. And, O king, various other metals were produced from his body.\r\nThus leaving his material body, he remained absorbed in (spiritual)\r\nmeditation. He was roused by the penance of Bhrigu and Angiras. The\r\npowerful fire thus gratified with penance, blazed forth intensely. But on\r\nbeholding the Rishi (Atharvan), he again sought his watery refuse. At\r\nthis extinction of the fire, the whole world was frightened, and sought\r\nthe protection of Atharvan, and the gods and others began to worship him.\r\nAtharvan rummaged the whole sea in the presence of all those beings eager\r\nwith expectation, and finding out the fire, himself began the work of\r\ncreation. Thus in olden times the fire was destroyed and called back to\r\nlife by the adorable Atharvan. But now he invariably carries the\r\noblations of all creatures. Living in the sea and travelling about\r\nvarious countries, he produced the various fires mentioned in the Vedas.\r\n\r\nThe river Indus, the five rivers (of the Punjab), the Sone, the Devika,\r\nthe Saraswati, the Ganga, the Satakumbha, the Sarayu, the Gandaki, the\r\nCharmanwati, the Mahi, the Medha, the Medhatithi, the three rivers\r\nTamravati, the Vetravati, and the Kausiki; the Tamasa, the Narmada, the\r\nGodavari, the Vena, the Upavena, the Bhima, the Vadawa, the Bharati, the\r\nSuprayoga, the Kaveri, the Murmura, the Tungavenna, the Krishnavenna and\r\nthe Kapila, these rivers, O Bharata, are said to be the mothers of the\r\nfires! The fire called Adbhuta had a wife of the name of Priya, and Vibhu\r\nwas the eldest of his sons by her. There are as many different kinds of\r\nSoma sacrifices as the number of fires mentioned before. All this race of\r\nfires, first-born of the spirit of Brahma, sprang also from the race of\r\nAtri. Atri in his own mind conceived these sons, desirous of extending\r\nthe creation. By this act, the fires came out of his own Brahmic frame. I\r\nhave thus narrated to thee the history of the origin of these fires. They\r\nare great, resplendent, and unrivalled in power, and they are the\r\ndestroyers of darkness. Know that the powers of those fires are the same\r\nas those of the Adbhuta fire as related in the Vedas. For all these fires\r\nare one and same. This adorable being, the first born fire, must be\r\nconsidered as one. For like the Jyotishtoma sacrifice he came out of\r\nAngiras body in various forms. I have thus described to thee the history\r\nof the great race of Agni (fires) who when duly worshipped with the\r\nvarious hymns, carry the oblations of all creatures to the gods."

Listen now to the story\r\nof the birth of the intelligent Kartikeya. I shall tell thee of that\r\nwonderful and famous and highly energetic son of the Adbhuta fire\r\nbegotten of the wives of the Brahmarshis. In ancient times the gods and\r\nAsuras were very active in destroying one another. And the terrible\r\nAsuras always succeeded in defeating the gods. And Purandara (Indra)\r\nbeholding the great slaughter of his armies by them and anxious to find\r\nout a leader for the celestial host, thought within himself, 'I must find\r\nout a mighty person who observing the ranks of the celestial army\r\nshattered by the Danavas will be able to reorganize it with vigour.' He\r\nthen repaired to the Manasa mountains and was there deeply absorbed in\r\nthought of nature, when he heard the heart-rending cries of a woman to\r\nthe effect, 'May some one come quick and rescue me, and either indicate a\r\nhusband for me, or be my husband himself.' Purandara said to her, 'Do not\r\nbe afraid, lady!' And having said these words, he saw Kesin (an Asura)\r\nadorned with a crown and mace in hand standing even like a hill of metals\r\nat a distance and holding that lady by the hand. Vasava addressed then\r\nthat Asura saying, 'Why art thou bent on behaving insolently to this\r\nlady? Know that I am the god who wields the thunderbolt. Refrain thou\r\nfrom doing any violence to this lady.' To him Kesin replied, 'Do thou, O\r\nSakra, leave her alone. I desire to possess her. Thinkest thou, O slayer\r\nof Paka, that thou shalt be able to return home with thy life?' With\r\nthese words Kesin hurled his mace for slaying Indra. Vasava cut it up in\r\nits course with his thunderbolt. Then Kesin, furious with rage, hurled a\r\nhuge mass of rock at him. Beholding that, he of a hundred sacrifices rent\r\nit asunder with his thunderbolt, and it fell down upon the ground. And\r\nKesin himself was wounded by that falling mass of rock. Thus sorely\r\nafflicted, he fled leaving the lady behind. And when the Asura was gone,\r\nIndra said to that lady, 'Who and whose wife art thou, O lady with a\r\nbeautiful face, and what has brought thee here?'\""

We two sisters with our maids habitually\r\nused to come to these Manasa mountains for pleasures with the permission\r\nof Prajapati. And the great Asura Kesin used daily to pay his court to\r\nus. Daityasena, O conqueror of Paka, listened to him, but I did not.\r\nDaityasena was, therefore, taken away by him, but, O illustrious one,\r\nthou hast rescued me with thy might. And now, O lord of the celestials, I\r\ndesire that thou shouldst select an invincible husband for me.' To this\r\nIndra replied, 'Thou art a cousin of mine, thy mother being a sister of\r\nmy mother Dakshayani, and now I desire to hear thee relate thine own\r\nprowess.' The lady replied, 'O hero with long arms, I am Avala[70] (weak)\r\nbut my husband must be powerful. And by the potency of my father's boon,\r\nhe will be respected by gods and Asuras alike.' Indra said, 'O blameless\r\ncreature, I wish to hear from thee, what sort of power thou wishest thy\r\nhusband to possess.' The lady replied, 'That manly and famous and\r\npowerful being devoted to Brahma, who is able to conquer all the\r\ncelestials, Asuras, Yakshas, Kinnaras, Uragas, Rakshasas, and the\r\nevil-minded Daityas and to subdue all the worlds with thee, shall be my\r\nhusband.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'On hearing her speech, Indra was grieved and\r\ndeeply thought within himself, 'There is no husband for this lady,\r\nanswering to her own description.' And that god adorned with sun-like\r\neffulgence, then perceived the Sun rising on the Udaya hill,[71] and the\r\ngreat Soma (Moon) gliding into the Sun. It being the time of the new\r\nMoon, he of a hundred sacrifices, at the Raudra[72] moment, observed the\r\ngods and Asuras fighting on the Sunrise hill. And he saw that the morning\r\ntwilight was tinged with red clouds. And he also saw that the abode of\r\nVaruna had become blood-red. And he also observed Agni conveying\r\noblations offered with various hymns by Bhrigu, Angiras, and others and\r\nentering the disc of the Sun. And he further saw the twenty four Parvas\r\nadorning the Sun, and the terrible Soma also present in the Sun under\r\nsuch surroundings. And observing this union of the Sun and the Moon and\r\nthat fearful conjunction of theirs, Sakra thought within himself, This\r\nterrific conjunction of the Sun and the Moon forebodeth a fearful battle\r\non the morrow. And the river Sindhu (Indus) too is flowing with a current\r\nof fresh blood and the jackals with fiery laces are crying to the Sun.\r\nThis great conjunction is fearful and full of energy. This union of the\r\nMoon (Soma) with the Sun and Agni is very wonderful. And if Soma giveth\r\nbirth to a son now, that son may become the husband of this lady. And\r\nAgni also hath similar surroundings now, and he too is a god. If the two\r\nbegetteth a son, that son, may become the husband of this lady.' With\r\nthese thoughts that illustrious celestial repaired to the regions of\r\nBrahma, taking Devasena[73] with him. And saluting the Grandsire he said\r\nunto him, 'Do thou fix a renowned warrior as husband of this lady.'\r\nBrahma replied, 'O slayer of Asuras, it shall be; as thou hast intended.\r\nThe issue of that union will be mighty and powerful accordingly. That\r\npowerful being will be the husband of this lady and the joint leader of\r\nthy forces with thee.' Thus addressed, the lord of the celestials and the\r\nlady bowed unto him and then repaired to the place where those great\r\nBrahmanas, the powerful celestial Rishis, Vasistha and others, lived. And\r\nwith Indra at their head, the other gods also, desirous of drinking the\r\nSoma beverage, repaired to the sacrifices of those Rishis to receive\r\ntheir respective shares of the offerings. Having duly performed the\r\nceremonies with the bright blazing fire, those great-minded persons\r\noffered oblations to the celestials. And the Adbhuta fire, that carrier\r\nof oblations, was invited with mantras. And coming out of the solar disc,\r\nthat lordly fire duly repaired thither, restraining speech. And, O chief\r\nof Bharata's race, that fire entering the sacrificial fire that had been\r\nignited and into which various offerings were made by the Rishis with\r\nrecitations of hymns, took them with him and made them over to the\r\ndwellers of heaven. And while returning from that place, he observed the\r\nwives of those high-souled Rishis sleeping at their ease on their beds.\r\nAnd those ladies had a complexion beautiful like that of an altar of\r\ngold, spotless like moon-beams, resembling fiery flames and looking like\r\nblazing stars. And seeing those wives of the illustrious Brahmanas with\r\neager eyes, his mind became agitated and he was smitten with their\r\ncharms. Restraining his heart he considered it improper for him to be\r\nthus agitated. And he said unto himself, The wives of these great\r\nBrahmanas are chaste and faithful and beyond the reach of other people's\r\ndesires. I am filled with desire to possess them. I cannot lawfully cast\r\nmy eyes upon them, nor ever touch them when they are not filled with\r\ndesire. I shall, therefore, gratify myself daily with only looking at\r\nthem by becoming their Garhapatya (house-hold) fire.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, The Adbhuta fire, thus transforming himself into a\r\nhouse-hold one, was highly gratified with seeing those gold-complexioned\r\nladies and touching them with his flames. And influenced by their charms\r\nhe dwelt there for a long time, giving them his heart and filled with an\r\nintense love for them. And baffled in all his efforts to win the hearts\r\nof those Brahmana ladies, and his own heart tortured by love, he repaired\r\nto a forest with the certain object of destroying himself. A little while\r\nbefore, Swaha, the daughter of Daksha, had bestowed her love on him. The\r\nexcellent lady had been endeavouring for a long time to detect his weak\r\nmoments; but that blameless lady did not succeed in finding out any\r\nweakness in the calm and collected fire-god. But now that the god had\r\nbetaken himself to a forest, actually tortured by the pangs of love, she\r\nthought, 'As I too am distressed with love, I shall assume the guise of\r\nthe wives of the seven Rishis, and in that disguise I shall seek the\r\nfire-god so smitten with their charms. This done, he will be gratified\r\nand my desire too will be satisfied.'\""

That excellent lady (Swaha) at first assuming the\r\ndisguise of Siva, sought the presence of Agni unto whom she said, 'O\r\nAgni, I am tortured with love for thee. Do thou think it fit to woo me.\r\nAnd if thou dost not accede to my request, know that I shall commit\r\nself-destruction. I am Siva the wife of Angiras. I have come here\r\naccording to the advice of the wives of the other Rishis, who have sent\r\nme here after due deliberation.'\r\n\r\nAgni replied, 'How didst thou know that I was tortured with love and how\r\ncould the others, the beloved wives of the seven Rishis, of whom thou\r\nhast spoken, know this?'\r\n\r\nSwaha replied, 'Thou art always a favourite with us, but we are afraid of\r\nthee. Now having read thy mind by well-known signs, they have sent to thy\r\npresence. I have come here to gratify my desire. Be thou quick, O Agni,\r\nto encompass the object of thy desire, my sisters-in-law are awaiting me.\r\nI must return soon.'\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, 'Then Agni, filled with great joy and delight,\r\nmarried Swaha in the guise of Siva, and that lady joyfully cohabiting\r\nwith him, held the semen virile in her hands. And then she thought within\r\nherself that those who would observe her in that disguise in the forest,\r\nwould cast an unmerited slur upon the conduct of those Brahmana ladies in\r\nconnection with Agni. Therefore, to prevent this, she should assume the\r\ndisguise of a bird, and in that state she should more easily get out of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, 'Then assuming the disguise of a winged creature,\r\nshe went out of the forest and reached the White Mountain begirt with\r\nclumps of heath and other plants and trees, and guarded by strange\r\nseven-headed serpents with poison in their very looks, and abounding with\r\nRakshasas, male and female Pisachas, terrible spirits, and various kinds\r\nof birds and animals. That excellent lady quickly ascending a peak of\r\nthose mountains, threw that semen into a golden lake. And then assuming\r\nsuccessively the forms of the wives of the high-souled seven Rishis, she\r\ncontinued to dally with Agni. But on account of the great ascetic merit\r\nof Arundhati and her devotion to her husband (Vasishtha), she was unable\r\nto assume her form. And, O chief of Kuru's race, the lady Swaha on the\r\nfirst lunar day threw six times into that lake the semen of Agni. And\r\nthrown there, it produced a male child endowed with great power. And from\r\nthe fact of its being regarded by the Rishis as cast off, the child born\r\ntherefrom came to be called by the name of Skanda. And the child had six\r\nfaces, twelve ears, as many eyes, hands, and feet, one neck, and one\r\nstomach. And it first assumed a form on the second lunar day, and it grew\r\nto the size of a little child on the third. And the limbs of Guha were\r\ndeveloped on the fourth day. And being surrounded by masses of red clouds\r\nflashing forth lightning, it shone like the Sun rising in the midst of a\r\nmass of red clouds. And seizing the terrific and immense bow which was\r\nused by the destroyer of the Asura Tripura for the destruction of the\r\nenemies of the gods, that mighty being uttered such a terrible roar that\r\nthe three worlds with their mobile and immobile divisions became struck\r\nwith awe. And hearing that sound which seemed like the rumbling of a mass\r\nof big clouds, the great Nagas, Chitra and Airavata, were shaken with\r\nfear. And seeing them unsteady that lad shining with sun-like refulgence\r\nheld them with both his hands. And with a dart in (another) hand, and\r\nwith a stout, red-crested, big cock fast secured in another, that\r\nlong-armed son of Agni began to sport about making a terrible noise. And\r\nholding an excellent conch-shell with two of his hands, that mighty being\r\nbegan to blow it to the great terror of even the most powerful creatures.\r\nAnd striking the air with two of his hands, and playing about on the\r\nhill-top, the mighty Mahasena of unrivalled prowess, looked as if he were\r\non the point of devouring the three worlds, and shone like the bright\r\nSun-god at the moment of his ascension in the heavens. And that being of\r\nwonderful prowess and matchless strength, seated on the top of that hill,\r\nlooked on with his numerous faces directed towards the different cardinal\r\npoints, and observing various things, he repeated his loud roars. And on\r\nhearing those roars various creatures were prostrate with fear. And\r\nfrightened and troubled in mind they sought protection. And all those\r\npersons of various orders who then sought the protection of that god are\r\nknown as his powerful Brahmana followers. And rising from his seat, that\r\nmighty god allayed the fears of all those people, and then drawing his\r\nbow, he discharged his arrows in the direction of the White Mountain. And\r\nwith those arrows the hill Krauncha, the son of Himavat, was rent\r\nasunder. And that is the reason why swans and vultures now migrate to the\r\nSumeru mountains. The Krauncha hill, sorely wounded, fell down uttering\r\nfearful groans. And seeing him fallen, the other hills too began to\r\nscream. And that mighty being of unrivalled prowess, hearing the groans\r\nof the afflicted, was not at all moved, but himself uplifting his mace,\r\nyelled forth his war-whoop. And that high-souled being then hurled his\r\nmace of great lustre and quickly rent in twain one of the peaks of the\r\nWhite Mountain. And the White Mountain being thus pierced by him was\r\ngreatly afraid of him and dissociating himself from the earth fled with\r\nthe other mountains. And the earth was greatly afflicted and bereft of\r\nher ornaments on all sides. And in this distress, she went over to Skanda\r\nand once more shone with all her might. And the mountains too bowed down\r\nto Skanda and came back and stuck into the earth. And all creatures then\r\ncelebrated the worship of Skanda on the fifth day of the lunar month."

And the nature of\r\nmales and females, of heat and cold, and of such other pairs of\r\ncontraries, was reversed. And the planets, the cardinal points and the\r\nfirmaments became radiant with light and the earth began to rumble very\r\nmuch. And the Rishis even, seeking the welfare of the world, while they\r\nobserved all these terrific prodigies on all sides, began with anxious\r\nhearts to restore tranquillity in the universe. And those who used to\r\nlive in that Chitraratha forest said, This very miserable condition of\r\nours hath been brought about by Agni cohabiting with the six wives of the\r\nseven Rishis.' Others again who had seen the goddess assume the disguise\r\nof a bird said, 'This evil hath been brought about by a bird.' No one\r\never imagined that Swaha was the authoress of that mischief. But having\r\nheard that the (new born) male child was hers, she went to Skanda and\r\ngradually revealed to him the fact that she was his mother. And those\r\nseven Rishis, when they heard that a son of great power had been born (to\r\nthem), divorced their six wives with the exception of the adorable\r\nArundhati, because all the dwellers of that forest protested that those\r\nsix persons had been instrumental in bringing forth the child. Swaha too,\r\nO king, said again and again to the seven Rishis, saying, 'Ye ascetics,\r\nthis child is mine, your wives are not his mother.'\r\n\r\nThe great Muni Viswamitra had, after the conclusion of the sacrifices of\r\nthe seven Rishis, followed unseen the god of fire, while the latter was\r\ntortured with lust. He, therefore, knew everything as it happened and he\r\nwas the first to seek the protection of Mahasena. And he offered divine\r\nprayers to Mahasena and all the thirteen auspicious rites appertaining to\r\nchildhood, such as the natal and other ceremonies, were all performed by\r\nthe great Muni in respect of that child. And for the good of the world he\r\npromulgated the virtues of the six-faced Skanda, and performed ceremonies\r\nin honour of the cock, the goddess Sakti, and the first followers of\r\nSkanda. And for this reason he became a great favourite of the celestial\r\nyouth. That great Muni then informed the seven Rishis, of the\r\ntransformations of Swaha and told them that their wives were perfectly\r\ninnocent. But though thus informed the seven Rishis abandoned their\r\nspouses unconditionally.\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, The celestials having heard of the prowess of\r\nSkanda, all said to Vasava, 'O Sakra, do thou kill Skanda without delay\r\nfor his prowess is unbearable. And if thou dost not exterminate him, he\r\nwill conquer the three worlds with ourselves, and overpowering thee, will\r\nhimself become the mighty lord of the celestials.' Perplexed in mind,\r\nSakra replied unto them, 'This child is endowed with great prowess. He\r\ncan himself destroy the Creator of the Universe, in battle putting forth\r\nhis might. I venture not, therefore, to do away with him.' To this the\r\ngods replied, 'Thou hast no manliness in thee, in that thou talkest in\r\nthis manner. Let the great Mothers of the Universe repair to-day to\r\nSkanda. They can master at will any degree of energy. Let then kill this\r\nchild.' 'It shall be so.'--the mothers replied. And then they went away.\r\nBut on beholding that he was possessed of great might, they became\r\ndispirited, and considering that he was invincible, they sought his\r\nprotection and said unto him, 'Do thou, O mighty being, become our\r\n(adopted) son. We are full of affection for thee and desirous of giving\r\nthee suck. Lo, the milk oozes from our breasts!' On hearing these words,\r\nthe mighty Mahasena became desirous of sucking their breasts and he\r\nreceived them with due respect and acceded to their request. And that\r\nmightiest of mighty creatures then beheld his father Agni come towards\r\nhim. And that god, who is the doer of all that is good, was duly honoured\r\nby his son, and in company with the Mothers, he stayed there by the side\r\nof Mahasena to tend him. And that lady amongst the Mothers who was born\r\nof Anger[74] with a spike in hand kept watch over Skanda even like a\r\nmother guarding her own offspring, and that irascible red-coloured\r\ndaughter of the Sea, who lived herself on blood, hugged Mahasena in her\r\nbreast and nursed him like a mother. And Agni transforming himself into a\r\ntrader with a goat's mouth and followed by numerous children began to\r\ngratify that child of his with toys in that mountain abode of his.\""

And the illustrious sovereign of the gods, desirous of victory\r\nbut believing success to be doubtful mounted his elephant Airavata and\r\nattended by the other gods advanced towards Skanda. That mighty being\r\nfollowed by all the celestials was armed with his thunderbolt. And with\r\nthe object of slaying Mahasena, he marched with terrible celestial army\r\nof great-splendour, sounding their shrill war-cry and furnished with\r\nvarious sorts of standards, with warriors encased in various armour and\r\narmed with numerous bows and riding on various animals. When Mahasena\r\nbeheld the gloriously decked Sakra, attired in his best clothes,\r\nadvancing with the determination of slaying him, he (too on his part)\r\nadvanced to meet that chief of the celestials. O Partha, the mighty\r\nVasava, the lord of the celestials, then uttered a loud shout, to\r\nencourage his warriors and marching rapidly with the view of killing\r\n'Agnis' son and praised by Tridasas[75] and great Rishis, he at length\r\nreached the abode of Kartikeya. And then he shouted out with other gods;\r\nand Guha too in response to this, uttered a fearful war-cry resembling\r\nthe roaring of the sea. On hearing that noise, the celestial army behaved\r\nlike an agitated sea, and was stunned and fixed to the spot. And that son\r\nof Pavaka (the Fire-god) beholding the gods come near to him with the\r\nobject of killing him, was filled with wrath, and gave out rising flame\r\nof fire from within his mouth. And these flames destroyed the celestial\r\nforces struggling on the ground. Their heads, their bodies, their arms\r\nand riding animals were all burnt in that conflagration and they appeared\r\nall on a sudden like stars displaced from their proper spheres. Thus\r\nafflicted, the god renounced all allegiance to the thunder bolt, and\r\nsought the protection of Pavaka's son; and thus peace was again secured.\r\nWhen he was thus forsaken by the gods, Sakra hurled his thunder-bolt at\r\nSkanda. It pierced him on the right side; and, O great king, it passed\r\nthrough the body of that high-souled being. And from being struck with\r\nthe thunder-bolt, there arose from Skanda's body another being--a youth\r\nwith a club in hand, and adorned with a celestial amulet. And because he\r\nwas born on account of the piercing of the thunder-bolt, he was named\r\nVisakha. And Indra, when he beheld that another person looking like the\r\nfierce destroying Fire-god had come into being was frightened out of his\r\nwits and besought the protection of Skanda, with the palms of his hands\r\njoined together (as a mark of respect). And that excellent being Skanda,\r\nbade him renounce all fear, with his arm. The gods were then transported\r\nwith joy, and their hands too struck up.\""

Those\r\nchildren adopted Visakha as their father. That adorable and dexterous\r\nBhadrasakha, having a face like that of a goat was at the time (of the\r\nbattle), surrounded by all his sons and daughters whom he guarded\r\ncarefully in the presence of the great mothers. And for this reason the\r\ninhabitants of this earth call Skanda the father of Kumaras (little\r\nchildren). Those persons who desire to have sons born to them, worship in\r\ntheir places the powerful Rudra in the form of the Fire-god, and Uma in\r\nthe form of Swaha. And by that means they are blessed with sons. The\r\ndaughters begotten by the Fire-god, Tapa, went over to Skanda, who said\r\nto them, 'What can I do for you?' Those girls replied, 'Do us this\r\nfavour; by thy blessing, may we become the good and respected mothers of\r\nall the world!' He replied, 'Be it so.' And that liberal-minded being\r\nrepeated again and again, 'Ye shall be divided into Siva and Asiva.'[76]\r\nAnd the mothers then departed, having first established Skanda's sonship,\r\nKaki, Halima, Malini, Vrinhila, Arya, Palala and Vaimitra, these were the\r\nseven mothers of Sisu.

But he is also known\r\nas the ninth, when that being with the face of a goat, is included. Know\r\nthat the sixth face of Skanda was like that of a goat.

He granted boons (to people who sought them) and was brave,\r\nyouthful, and adorned with bright ear-rings. Whilst he was reposing\r\nhimself, the goddess of fortune, looking like a lotus and assuming a\r\npersonal embodiment, rendered her allegiance to him. When he became thus\r\npossessed of good fortune, that famous and delicate-looking creature\r\nappeared to all like the moon at its full. And high-minded Brahmanas\r\nworshipped that mighty being, and the Maharshis (great rishis) then said\r\nas follows to Skanda, 'O thou born of the golden egg, mayst thou be\r\nprosperous and mayst thou become an instrument of good to the universe! O\r\nbest of the gods, although thou wast born only six nights (days) ago, the\r\nwhole world has owned allegiance to thee (within this short time), and\r\nthou hast also allayed their fears. Therefore do thou become the Indra\r\n(lord) of the three worlds and remove their cause of apprehension.'\r\nSkanda replied, 'You gentlemen of great ascetic wealth (tell me) what\r\nIndra does with all three worlds and how that sovereign of the celestials\r\nprotects the hosts of gods unremittingly.' The Rishis replied, 'Indra is\r\nthe giver of strength, power, children and happiness to all creatures and\r\nwhen propitiated, that Lord of the celestials bestows on all the objects\r\nof their desire. He destroys the wicked and fulfils the desires of the\r\nrighteous; and that Destroyer of Vala assigns to all creatures their\r\nvarious duties. He officiates for the sun and the moon in places where\r\nthere is no sun or moon; he even when occasion requires it, acts for\r\n(serves the purposes of) fire, air, earth, and water. These are the\r\nduties of Indra; his capacities are immense. Thou too art mighty;\r\ntherefore great hero, do thou become our Indra.'\r\n\r\nSakra said, 'O mighty being, do thou make us happy, by becoming our lord.\r\nExcellent being, thou art worthy of the honour; therefore shall we anoint\r\nthee this very day.'\r\n\r\nSkanda replied, 'Do thou continue to rule the three worlds with\r\nself-possession, and with thy heart bent on conquest. I shall remain thy\r\nhumble servant. I covet not thy sovereignty.'\r\n\r\nSakra replied, 'Thy prowess is unrivalled, O hero, do thou therefore\r\nvanquish the enemies of the gods. People have been struck with wonder at\r\nthy prowess. More specially as I have been bereft of my prowess, and\r\ndefeated by thee, now if I were to act as Indra, I should not command the\r\nrespect of all creatures, and they would be busy in bringing about\r\ndissensions between us; and then, my lord, they would become the\r\npartisans of one or other of us. And when they formed themselves into two\r\ndistinct factions, war as before would be the result of that defection.\r\nAnd in that war, thou wouldst undoubtedly defeat me without difficulty\r\nand thyself become the lord of all worlds.'\r\n\r\nSkanda replied, 'Thou, O Sakra, art my sovereign, as also of the three\r\nworlds; mayst thou be prosperous! Tell me if I can obey any commands of\r\nthine.'\r\n\r\nIndra replied, 'At thy bidding, O powerful being, I shall continue to act\r\nas Indra. And if thou hast said this deliberately and in earnest, then\r\nhear me how thou canst gratify thy desire of serving me. Do thou, O\r\nmighty being, take the leadership of the celestial forces accordingly.'\r\n\r\nSkanda replied, 'Do thou anoint me as leader, for the destruction of the\r\nDanavas, for the good of the celestials, and for the well-being of cows\r\nand Brahmanas.'\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, \"Thus anointed by Indra and all other gods, and\r\nhonoured by the Maharshis, he looked grand at the moment. The golden\r\numbrella[77] held (over his head) looked like a halo of blazing fire.\r\nThat famous god, the Conqueror of Tripura, himself fastened the celestial\r\nwreath of gold, of Viswakarma's manufacture, round his neck. And, O great\r\nman and conqueror of thine enemies, that worshipful god with the emblem\r\nof the bull, had gone there previously with Parvati. He honoured him with\r\na joyous heart. The Fire-god is called Rudra by Brahmanas, and from this\r\nfact Skanda is called the son of Rudra. The White Mountain was formed\r\nfrom discharges of Rudra's semen virile and the sensual indulgences of\r\nthe Fire-god with the Krittikas took place on that same White Mountain.\r\nAnd as Rudra was seen by all the dwellers of heaven to heap honours on\r\nthe excellent Guha (Skanda), he was for that reason reputed as the son of\r\nRudra. This child had his being by the action of Rudra entering into the\r\nconstitution of the Fire-god, and for this reason, Skanda came to be\r\nknown as the son of Rudra. And, O Bharata, as Rudra, the Fire-god, Swaha,\r\nand the six wives (of the seven Rishis) were instrumental to the birth of\r\nthe great god Skanda, he was for that reason reputed as the son of Rudra.\r\n\r\n\"That son of Fire-god was clad in a pair of clean red cloths, and thus he\r\nlooked grand and resplendent like the Sun peeping forth from behind a\r\nmass of red clouds. And the red cock given to him by the Fire-god, formed\r\nhis ensign; and when perched on the top of his chariot, it looked like\r\nthe image of the all-destroying fire. And the presiding deity of the\r\npower which conduces to the victory of the god, and which is the director\r\nof the exertions of all creatures, and constitutes their glory, prop and\r\nrefuge, advanced before him. And a mysterious charm entered into his\r\nconstitution the charm which manifests its powers on the battlefield.\r\nBeauty, strength, piety, power, might, truthfulness, rectitude, devotion\r\nto Brahmanas, freedom from illusion or perplexity, protection of\r\nfollowers, destruction of foes, and care of all creatures,--these, O lord\r\nof men, are the inborn virtues of Skanda. Thus anointed by all the gods,\r\nhe looked pleased and complacent; and dressed in his best style, he\r\nlooked beautiful like the moon at its full. The much-esteemed incantation\r\nof Vedic hymns, the music of the celestial band, and the songs of gods\r\nand Gandharvas then rang on all sides. And surrounded by all the\r\nwell-dressed Apsaras, and many other gay and happy-looking Pisachas and\r\nhosts of gods, that anointed (by gods) son of Pavaka disported himself in\r\nall his grandeur. To the dwellers of heaven, the anointed Mahasena,\r\nappeared like the Sun rising after extinction of darkness. And then the\r\ncelestial forces looking upon him as their leader, surrounded him on all\r\nsides in thousands. That adorable being followed by all creatures then\r\nassumed their commands, and praised and honoured by them, he encouraged\r\nthem in return.\r\n\r\n\"The Performer of a thousand sacrifices then thought of Devasena, whom he\r\nhas rescued before. And considering that this being (Skanda) was\r\nundoubtedly destined to be the husband of this lady by Brahma himself, he\r\nhad her brought there, dressed her with the best apparel. And the\r\nvanquisher of Vala then said to Skanda, 'O foremost of gods, this lady\r\nwas, even before thy birth, destined to be thy bride by that\r\nSelf-existent Being.[78] Therefore do thou duly accept her lotus-like\r\nbeautiful right hand with invocation of the (marital) hymns.' Thus told,\r\nhe duly married her. And Vrihaspati learned in hymns performed the\r\nnecessary prayers and oblations. She who is called Shashthi, Lakshmi,\r\nAsa, Sukhaprada, Sinivali, Kuhu, Saivritti, and Aparajita, is known among\r\nmen as Devasena, the wife of Skanda. When Skanda became united to\r\nDevasena in indissoluble bonds of matrimony, then the gods of prosperity\r\nin her own personal embodiment began to serve him with diligence. As\r\nSkanda attained celebrity on the fifth lunar day, that day is called\r\nSripanchami (or the auspicious fifth day) and as he attained his object\r\non the sixth, that lunar day is considered to be of great moment.\""

They lost no time in visiting that leader of the celestial forces\r\nand then addressed him thus, 'We, O son, have been cast out by our\r\ngod-like husbands, without any cause. Some people spread the rumour that\r\nwe gave birth to thee. Believing in the truth of this story, they became\r\ngreatly indignant, and banished us from our sacred places. It behooves\r\nthee now to save us from this infamy. We desire to adopt thee as our son,\r\nso that, O mighty being, eternal bliss may be secured to us by that\r\nfavour. Do thou thus repay the obligation thou owest to us.'\r\n\r\n\"Skanda replied, 'O ladies of faultless character, do you accordingly\r\nbecome my mothers. I am your son and ye shall attain all the objects of\r\nyour desire.'\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, 'Then Sakra having expressed a wish to say\r\nsomething to Skanda, the latter enquired, 'What is it?' Being told by\r\nSkanda to speak it out, Vasava said, The lady Abhijit, the younger sister\r\nof Rohini, being jealous of her seniority, has repaired to the woods to\r\nperform austerities. And I am at a loss to find out a substitute for the\r\nfallen star. May good luck attend on thee, do thou consult with Brahma\r\n(for the purpose of filling up the room) of this great asterism.\r\nDhanishtha and other asterisms were created by Brahma, and Rohini used to\r\nserve the purpose of one such; and consequently their number was full.\r\nAnd in accordance with Sakra's advice, Krittika was assigned a place in\r\nthe heavens, and that star presided over by Agni shines as if with seven\r\nheads. Vinata also said to Skanda, 'Thou art as a son to me, and entitled\r\nto offer me the funeral cakes (at my funeral obsequies). I desire, my\r\nson, to live with thee always.'\r\n\r\n\"Skanda replied, 'Be it so, all honour to thee! Do thou guide me with a\r\nmother's affection, and honoured by thy daughter-in-law, thou shalt\r\nalways live with me.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Then the great mothers spoke as follows to\r\nSkanda, 'We have been described by the learned as the mothers of all\r\ncreatures. But we desire to be thy mothers, do thou honour us.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Skanda replied, 'Ye are all as mothers to me, and I am your son. Tell me\r\nwhat I can do to please you.\"'\r\n\r\n\"The mothers replied, 'The ladies (Brahmi, Maheswari, &c.) were appointed\r\nas mothers of the world in bygone ages. We desire, O great god, that they\r\nbe dispossessed of that dignity, and ourselves installed in their place,\r\nand that we, instead of them, be worshipped by the world. Do thou now\r\nrestore to us those of our progeny, of whom we have been deprived, by\r\nthem on thy account.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Skanda replied, 'Ye shall not recover those that have been once given\r\naway, but I can give you other offspring if ye like.'\" The mothers\r\nreplied, 'We desire that living with thee and assuming different shapes\r\nwe be able to eat up the progeny of those mothers and their guardians. Do\r\nthou grant us this favour.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Skanda said, 'I can grant you progeny, but this topic on which ye have\r\njust now dilated is a very painful one. May ye be prosperous! All honour\r\nto you, ladies, do ye vouchsafe to them your protecting care.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The mothers replied, 'We shall protect them, O Skanda, as thou desirest.\r\nMayst thou be prosperous! But, O mighty being, we desire to live with\r\nthee always.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Skanda replied, 'So long as children of the human kind do not attain the\r\nyouthful state in the sixteenth year of their age, ye shall afflict them\r\nwith your various forms, and I too shall confer on you a fierce\r\ninexhaustible spirit. And with that ye shall live happily, worshipped by\r\nall.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'And then a fiery powerful being came out of the\r\nbody of Skanda for the purpose of devouring the progeny of mortal beings.\r\nHe fell down upon the ground, senseless and hungry. And bidden by Skanda,\r\nthat genius of evil assumed a terrific form. Skandapasmara is the name by\r\nwhich it is known among good Brahmanas. Vinata is called the terrific\r\nSakuni graha (spirit of evil). She who is known as Putana Rakshasi by the\r\nlearned is the graha called Putana; that fierce and terrible looking\r\nRakshasa of a hideous appearance is also called the pisacha, Sita Putana.\r\nThat fierce-looking spirit is the cause of abortion in women. Aditi is\r\nalso known by the name of Revati; her evil spirit is called Raivata, and\r\nthat terrible graha also afflicts children. Diti, the mother of the\r\nDaityas (Asuras), is also called Muhkamandika, and that terrible creature\r\nis very fond of the flesh of little children. Those male and female\r\nchildren, O Kaurava, who are said to have been begotten by Skanda, are\r\nspirit of evil and they destroy the foetus in the womb. They (the\r\nKumaras) are known as the husbands of those very ladies, and children are\r\nseized unawares by these cruel spirits. And, O king, Surabhi who is\r\ncalled the mother of bovine kind by the wise is best ridden by the evil\r\nspirit Sakuni, who in company with her, devours children on this earth.\r\nAnd Sarama, the mother of dogs, also habitually kills human beings while\r\nstill in the womb. She who is the mother of all trees has her abode in a\r\nkaranja tree. She grants boons and has a placid countenance and is always\r\nfavourably disposed towards all creatures. Those persons who desire to\r\nhave children, bow down to her, who is seated in a karanja tree. These\r\neighteen evil spirits fond of meat and wine, and others of the same kind,\r\ninvariably take up their abode in the lying-in-room for ten days. Kadru\r\nintroduces herself in a subtle form into the body of a pregnant woman and\r\nthere she causes the destruction of the foetus, and the mother is made to\r\ngive birth to a Naga (serpent). And that mother of the Gandharvas takes\r\naway the foetus, and for this reason, conception in woman turns out to be\r\nabortive. The mother of the Apsaras removes the foetus from the womb, and\r\nfor this reason such conceptions are said to be stationary by the\r\nlearned. The daughter of the Divinity of the Red Sea is said to have\r\nnursed Skanda,--she is worshipped under the name of Lohitayani on Kadamva\r\ntrees. Arya acts the same part among female beings, as Rudra does among\r\nmale ones. She is the mother of all children and is distinctly worshipped\r\nfor their welfare. These that I have described are the evil spirits\r\npresiding over the destinies of young children, and until children attain\r\ntheir sixteenth year, these spirits exercise their influence for evil,\r\nand after that, for good. The whole body of male and female spirits that\r\nI have now described are always denominated by men as the spirits of\r\nSkanda. They are propitiated with burnt offerings, ablutions, unguents,\r\nsacrifices and other offerings, and particularly by the worship of\r\nSkanda. And, O king, when they are honoured and worshipped with due\r\nreverence, they bestow on men whatever is good for them, as also valour\r\nand long life. And now having bowed down to Maheswara, I shall describe\r\nthe nature of those spirits who influence the destinies of men after they\r\nhave attained their sixteenth year.\r\n\r\n\"The man who beholds gods while sleeping, or in a wakeful state soon\r\nturns mad, and the spirit under whose influence these hallucinations take\r\nplace is called the celestial spirit. When a person beholds his dead\r\nancestors while he is seated at ease, or lying in his bed, he soon loses\r\nhis reason, and the spirit which causes this illusion of sensible\r\nperception, is called the ancestral spirit. The man who shows disrespect\r\nto the Siddhas and who is cursed by them in return, soon runs mad and the\r\nevil influence by which this is brought about, is called the Siddha\r\nspirit. And the spirit by whose influence a man smells sweet odour, and\r\nbecomes cognisant of various tastes (when there are no odoriferous or\r\ntasteful substances about him) and soon becomes tormented, is called the\r\nRakshasa spirit. And the spirit by whose action celestial musicians\r\n(Gandharvas) blend their existence into the constitution of a human\r\nbeing, and make him run mad in no time, is called the Gandharva spirit.\r\nAnd that evil spirit by whose influence men are always tormented by\r\nPisachas, is called the Paisacha spirit. When the spirit of Yakshas\r\nenters into the system of a human being by some accident, he loses his\r\nreason immediately, and such a spirit is called the Yaksha spirit. The\r\nman who loses his reason on account of his mind being demoralised with\r\nvices, runs mad in no time, and his illness must be remedied according to\r\nmethods prescribed in the Sastras. Men also run mad from perplexity, from\r\nfear, as also on beholding hideous sights. The remedy lies in quieting\r\ntheir minds. There are three classes of spirits, some are frolicsome,\r\nsome are gluttonous, and some sensual. Until men attain the age of three\r\nscore and ten, these evil influences continue to torment them, and then\r\nfever becomes the only evil spirit that afflicts sentient beings. These\r\nevil spirits always avoid those who have subdued their senses, who are\r\nself-restrained, of cleanly habits, god-fearing and free from laziness\r\nand contamination. I have thus described to thee, O king, the evil\r\nspirits that mould the destinies of men. Thou who art devoted to\r\nMaheswara art never troubled by them.\""

And the semen of the\r\nhigh-souled Rudra cast into the reproductive organ of Uma was thrown back\r\nupon this hill, and hence the twin Mujika and Minjika came into being. A\r\nportion of it fell into the Blood Sea, another portion, into the rays of\r\nthe sun, another upon the earth and thus was it distributed in five\r\nportions. Learned men ought to remember that these thy various and\r\nfierce-looking followers living on the flesh of animals were produced\r\nfrom the semen'.

Thus all Pisachas are said to\r\nbe divided into innumerable classes. And now, O king, listen to the\r\norigin of the bells and standards of Skanda. Airavata (Indra's elephant)\r\nis known to have had two bells of the name of Vaijayanti, and the\r\nkeen-witted Sakra had them brought to him, and personally gave them to\r\nGuha. Visakha took one of those bells and Skanda the other. The standards\r\nof both Kartikeya and Visakha were of a red colour. That mighty god\r\nMahasena was pleased with the toys that had been given to him by the\r\ngods. Surrounded by hosts of gods and Pisachas and seated on the Golden\r\nMountain, he looked splendid in all the grandeur of prosperity. And that\r\nmountain covered with fine forests, also looked grand in his\r\ncompanionship, just as the Mandara hill abounding with excellent caves\r\nshines with the rays of the sun. The White Mountain was adorned with\r\nwhole tracts of wood-land covered with blossoming Santanaka flowers and\r\nwith forests of Karavira, Parijata, Jana and Asoke trees,--as also with\r\nwild tracts overgrown with Kadamva trees; and it abounded with herds of\r\ncelestial deer and flocks of celestial birds. And the rumbling of clouds\r\nserving the purpose of musical instruments sounded like the murmur of an\r\nagitated sea, and celestial Gandharvas and Apsaras began to dance. And\r\nthere arose a great sound of joy from the merriment of all creatures.\r\nThus the whole world with Indra himself seemed to have been transferred\r\nto the White Mountain. And all the people began to observe Skanda with\r\nsatisfaction in their looks, and they did not at all feel tired of doing\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nMarkandeya continued, \"When that adorable son of the Fire-god was\r\nanointed as leader of the celestial army, that grand and happy lord, Hara\r\n(Mahadeva) riding with Parvati in a chariot shining with sunlike\r\nrefulgence repaired to a place called Bhadravata. His excellent chariot\r\nwas drawn by a thousand lions and managed by Kala. They passed through\r\nblank space, and seemed as if they were about to devour the sky; and\r\nstriking terror into the heart of all creatures in the mobile divisions\r\nof the worlds, those maned beasts flitted through the air, uttering\r\nfearful growls. And that lord of all animals (Mahadeva) seated in that\r\nchariot with Uma, looked like the sun with flames of lightning\r\nilluminating masses of clouds begirt with Indra's bow (rainbow). He was\r\npreceded by that adorable Lord of riches riding on the backs of human\r\nbeings with his attendant Guhyakas riding in his beautiful car Pushpaka.\r\nAnd Sakra too riding on his elephant Airavata and accompanied by other\r\ngods brought up the rear of Mahadeva, the granter of boons, marching in\r\nthis way at the head of the celestial army. And the great Yaksha Amogha\r\nwith his attendants--the Jambhaka Yakshas and other Rakshasas decorated\r\nwith garlands of flowers--obtained a place in the right wing of his army;\r\nand many gods of wonderful fighting powers in company with the Vasus and\r\nthe Rudras, also marched with the right division of his army. And the\r\nterrible-looking Yama too in company with Death marched with him.\r\n(followed by hundreds of terrible diseases); and behind him was carried\r\nthe terrible, sharp-pointed, well-decorated trident of Siva, called\r\nVijaya. And Varuna, the adorable lord of waters with his terrible\r\nPasa,[80] and surrounded by numerous aquatic animals, marched slowly with\r\nthe trident. And the trident Vijaya was followed by the Pattisa[81] of\r\nRudra guarded by maces, balls, clubs and other excellent weapons. And the\r\nPattisa, O king, was followed by the bright umbrella of Rudra and the\r\nKamandalu served by the Maharshis; and on it progressed in the company of\r\nBhrigu, Angiras and others. And behind all these rode Rudra in his white\r\nchariot, re-assuring the gods with the exhibition of his powers. And\r\nrivers and lakes and seas, Apsaras, Rishis, Celestials, Gandharvas and\r\nserpents, stars, planets, and the children of gods, as also many women,\r\nfollowed him in his train. These handsome-looking ladies proceeded\r\nscattering flowers all around; and the clouds marched, having made their\r\nobeisance to that god (Mahadeva) armed with the Pinaka bow. And some of\r\nthem held a white umbrella over his head, and Agni (the Fire god) and\r\nVayu (the god of winds) busied themselves with two hairy fans (emblems of\r\nroyalty). And, O king, he was followed by the glorious Indra accompanied\r\nby the Rajarshis, and singing the praise of that god with the emblem of\r\nthe bull. And Gauri, Vidya, Gandhari, Kesini, and the lady called Mitra\r\nin company with Savitri, all proceeded in the train of Parvati, as also\r\nall the Vidyas (presiding deities of all branches of knowledge) that were\r\ncreated by the learned. The Rakshasa spirit who delivers to different\r\nbattalions the commands which are implicitly obeyed by Indra and other\r\ngods, advanced in front of the army as standard-bearer. And that foremost\r\nof Rakshasas, by name Pingala, the friend of Rudra, who is always busy in\r\nplaces where corpses are burnt, and who is agreeable to all people,\r\nmarched with them merrily, at one time going ahead of the army, and\r\nfalling behind again at another, his movements being uncertain. Virtuous\r\nactions are the offerings with which the god Rudra is worshipped by\r\nmortals. He who is also called Siva, the omnipotent god, armed with the\r\nPinaka bow, is Maheswara. He is worshipped in various forms.\r\n\r\n\"The son of Krittika, the leader of the celestial army, respectful to\r\nBrahmanas, surrounded by the celestial forces, also followed that lord of\r\nthe gods. And then Mahadeva said these weighty words to Mahasena, 'Do\r\nthou carefully command the seventh army corps of the celestial forces.'\r\n\r\n\"Skanda replied, 'Very well, my lord! I shall command the seventh army\r\ncorps. Now tell me quickly if there is anything else to be done.'\r\n\r\n\"Rudra said, 'Thou shall always find me in the field of action. By\r\nlooking up to me and by devotion to me shalt thou attain great welfare.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'With these words Maheswara received him in his\r\nembrace, and then dismissed him. And, O great king, after the dismissal\r\nof Skanda, prodigies of various kinds occurred to disturb the equanimity\r\nof the gods.'\r\n\r\n\"The firmament with the stars was in a blaze, and the whole universe in a\r\nstate of utter confusion. The earth quaked and gave forth a rumbling\r\nsound, and darkness overspread the whole world. Then observing this\r\nterrible catastrophe, Sankara with the estimable Uma, and the celestials\r\nwith the great Maharshis, were much exercised in mind. And when they had\r\nfallen into this state of confusion, there appeared before them a fierce\r\nand mighty host armed with various weapons, and looking like a mass of\r\nclouds and rocks. Those terrible and countless beings, speaking different\r\nlanguages directed their movements towards the point where Sankara and\r\nthe celestials stood. They hurled into the ranks of the celestial army\r\nflights of arrows in all directions, masses of rock, maces, sataghnis,\r\nprasas and parighas. The celestial army was thrown into a state of\r\nconfusion by a shower of these terrible weapons and their ranks were seen\r\nto waver. The Danavas made a great havoc by cutting up their soldiers,\r\nhorses, elephants, chariots and arms. And the celestial troops then\r\nseemed as if they were about to turn their backs upon the enemy. And\r\nnumbers of them fell, slain by the Asuras, like large trees in a forest\r\nburnt in a conflagration. Those dwellers of heaven fell with their heads,\r\nseparated from their bodies, and having none to lead them in that fearful\r\nbattle, they were slaughtered by the enemy. And then the god Purandara\r\n(Indra), the slayer of Vala, observing that they were unsteady and\r\nhard-pressed by the Asuras, tried to rally them with this speech, 'Do not\r\nbe afraid, ye heroes, may success attend your efforts! Do ye all take up\r\nyour arms, and resolve upon manly conduct, and ye will meet with no more\r\nmisfortune, and defeat those wicked and terrible-looking Danavas. May ye\r\nbe successful! Do ye fall upon the Danavas with me.'\r\n\r\n\"The dwellers of heaven were re-assured on hearing this speech from\r\nSakra; and under his leadership, they again rushed against the Danavas.\r\nAnd then the thirty-three crores of gods and all the powerful Marutas and\r\nthe Sadhyas with the Vasus returned to the charge. And the arrows which\r\nthey angrily discharged against the enemy drew a large quantity of blood\r\nfrom the bodies of the Daityas and of their horses and elephants. And\r\nthose sharp arrows passing through their bodies fell upon the ground,\r\nlooking like so many snakes falling from the sides of a hill. And, O\r\nking, the Daityas pierced by those arrows fell fast on all sides, looking\r\nlike so many detached masses of clouds. Then the Danava host, struck with\r\npanic at that charge of the celestials on the field of battle, wavered at\r\nthat shower of various weapons. Then all the gods loudly gave vent to\r\ntheir joy, with arms ready to strike; and the celestial bands too struck\r\nup various airs. Thus took place that encounter, so fearful to both\r\nsides: for all the battle-field was covered with blood and strewn with\r\nthe bodies of both gods and Asuras. But the gods were soon worsted all on\r\na sudden, and the terrible Danavas again made a great havoc of the\r\ncelestial army. Then the Asuras, drums struck up and their shrill bugles\r\nwere sounded; and the Danava chiefs yelled their terrific war-cry.\r\n\r\n\"Then a powerful Danava, taking a huge mass of rock in his hands, came\r\nout of that terrible Daitya army. He looked like the sun peering forth\r\nfrom against a mass of dark clouds. And, O king, the celestials,\r\nbeholding that he was about to hurl that mass of rock at them, fled in\r\nconfusion. But they were pursued by Mahisha, who hurled that hillock at\r\nthem. And, O lord of the world, by the falling of that mass of rock, ten\r\nthousand warriors of the celestial army were crushed to the ground and\r\nbreathed their last. And this act of Mahisha struck terror into the\r\nhearts of the gods, and with his attendant Danavas he fell upon them like\r\na lion attacking a herd of deer. And when Indra and the other celestials\r\nobserved that Mahisha was advancing to the charge, they fled, leaving\r\nbehind their arms and colours. And Mahisha was greatly enraged at this,\r\nand he quickly advanced towards the chariot of Rudra; and reaching near,\r\nhe seized its pole with his hands. And when Mahisha in a fit of rage had\r\nthus seized the chariot of Rudra, all the Earth began to groan and the\r\ngreat Rishis lost their senses. And Daityas of huge proportions, looking\r\nlike dark clouds, were boisterous with joy, thinking that victory was\r\nassured to them. And although that adorable god (Rudra) was in that\r\nplight, yet he did not think it worth while to kill Mahisha in battle; he\r\nremembered that Skanda would deal the deathblow to that evil-minded\r\nAsura. And the fiery Mahisha, contemplating with satisfaction the prize\r\n(the chariot of Rudra) which he had secured, sounded his war-cry, to the\r\ngreat alarm of the gods and the joy of the Daityas. And when the gods\r\nwere in that fearful predicament, the mighty Mahasena, burning with\r\nanger, and looking grand like the Sun advanced to their rescue. And that\r\nlordly being was clad in blazing red and decked with a wreath of red\r\nflowers. And cased in armour of gold he rode in a gold-coloured chariot\r\nbright as the Sun and drawn by chestnut horses. And at his sight the army\r\nof the daityas was suddenly dispirited on the field of battle. And, O\r\ngreat king, the mighty Mahasena discharged a bright Sakti for the\r\ndestruction of Mahisha. That missile cut off the head of Mahisha, and he\r\nfell upon the ground and died. And his head massive as a hillock, falling\r\non the ground, barred the entrance to the country of the Northern Kurus,\r\nextending in length for sixteen Yojanas though at present the people of\r\nthat country pass easily by that gate.\r\n\r\n\"It was observed both by the gods and the Danavas that Skanda hurled his\r\nsakti again and again on the field of battle, and that it returned to his\r\nhands, after killing thousands of the enemy's forces. And the terrible\r\nDanavas fell in large numbers by the arrows of the wise Mahasena. And\r\nthen a panic seized them, and the followers of Skanda began to slay and\r\neat them up by thousands and drink their blood. And they joyously\r\nexterminated the Danavas in no time, just as the sun destroys darkness,\r\nor as fire destroys a forest, or as the winds drive away the clouds. And\r\nin this manner the famous Skanda defeated all his enemies. And the gods\r\ncame to congratulate him, and he, in turn, paid his respects to\r\nMaheswara. And that son of Krittika looked grand like the sun in all the\r\nglory of his effulgence. And when the enemy was completely defeated by\r\nSkanda and when Maheswara left the battle-field, Purandara embraced\r\nMahasena and said to him, 'This Mahisha, who was made invincible by the\r\nfavour of Brahma hath been killed by thee. O best of warriors, the gods\r\nwere like grass to him. O strong-limbed hero, thou hast removed a thorn\r\nof the celestials. Thou hast killed in battle hundreds of Danavas equal\r\nin valour to Mahisha who were all hostile to us, and who used to harass\r\nus before. And thy followers too have devoured them by hundreds. Thou\r\nart, O mighty being, invincible in battle like Uma's lord; and this\r\nvictory shall be celebrated as thy first achievement, and thy fame shall\r\nbe undying in the three worlds. And, O strong-armed god, all the gods\r\nwill yield their allegiance to thee.' Having spoken thus to Mahasena, the\r\nhusband of Sachi left the place accompanied by the gods and with the\r\npermission of the adorable three-eyed god (Siva). And Rudra returned to\r\nBhadravata, and the celestials too returned to their respective abodes.\r\nAnd Rudra spoke, addressing the gods, 'Ye must render allegiance to\r\nSkanda just as ye do unto me.' And that son of the Fire-god, having\r\nkilled the Danavas hath conquered the three worlds, in one day, and he\r\nhath been worshipped by the great Rishis. The Brahmana who with due\r\nattention readeth this story of the birth of Skanda, attaineth to great\r\nprosperity in this world and the companionship of Skanda hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nYudhishthira said, \"O good and adorable Brahmana, I wish to know the\r\ndifferent names of that high-souled being, by which he is celebrated\r\nthroughout the three worlds.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by the Pandava in that assembly\r\nof Rishis, the worshipful Markandeya of high ascetic merit replied,\r\n'Agneya (Son of Agni), Skanda (Cast-off), Diptakirti (Of blazing fame),\r\nAnamaya (Always hale), Mayuraketu (Peacock-bannered), Dharmatman (The\r\nvirtuous-souled), Bhutesa (The lord of all creatures), Mahishardana (The\r\nslayer of Mahisha), Kamajit (The subjugator of desires), Kamada (The\r\nfulfiller of desires), Kanta (The handsome), Satyavak (The truthful in\r\nspeech), Bhuvaneswara (The lord of the universe), Sisu (The child),\r\nSighra (The quick), Suchi (The pure), Chanda (The fiery), Diptavarna (The\r\nbright-complexioned), Subhanana (Of beautiful face), Amogha (Incapable of\r\nbeing baffled), Anagha (The sinless), Rudra (The terrible), Priya (The\r\nfavourite), Chandranana (Of face like the moon), Dipta-sasti (The wielder\r\nof the blazing lance), Prasantatman (Of tranquil soul), Bhadrakrit (The\r\ndoer of good), Kutamahana (The chamber of even the wicked), Shashthipriya\r\n(True favourite of Shashthi), Pavitra (The holy), Matrivatsala (The\r\nreverencer of his mother), Kanya-bhartri (The protector of virgins),\r\nVibhakta (Diffused over the universe), Swaheya (The son of Swaha),\r\nRevatisuta (The child of Revati), Prabhu (The Lord), Neta (The leader),\r\nVisakha (Reared up by Visakha), Naigameya (Sprang from the Veda),\r\nSuduschara (Difficult of propitiation), Suvrata (Of excellent vows),\r\nLalita (The beautiful), Valakridanaka-priya (Fond of toys), Khacharin\r\n(The ranger of skies), Brahmacharin (The chaste), Sura (The brave),\r\nSaravanodbhava (Born in a forest of heath), Viswamitra priya (The\r\nfavourite of Viswamitra), Devasena-priya (The lover of Devasena),\r\nVasudeva-priya (The beloved of Vasudeva), and Priya-krit (The doer of\r\nagreeable things)--these are the divine names of Kartikeya. Whoever\r\nrepeateth them, undoubtedly secureth fame, wealth, and salvation.\"\r\n\r\n'Markandeya continued, \"O valiant scion of Kuru's race, I shall now with\r\ndue devotion pray to that unrivalled, mighty, six-faced, and valiant Guha\r\nwho is worshipped by gods and Rishis, enumerating his other titles of\r\ndistinction: do thou listen to them: Thou art devoted to Brahma, begotten\r\nof Brahma, and versed in the mysteries of Brahma. Thou art called\r\nBrahmasaya, and thou art the foremost of those who are possessed of\r\nBrahma. Thou art fond of Brahma, thou art austere like the Brahmanas and\r\nart versed in the great mystery of Brahma and the leader of the\r\nBrahmanas. Thou art Swaha, thou art Swadha, and thou art the holiest of\r\nthe holy, and art invoked in hymns and celebrated as the six-flamed fire.\r\nThou art the year, thou art the six seasons, thou art the months, the\r\n(lunar) half months, the (solar) declinations, and the cardinal points of\r\nspace. Thou art lotus-eyed. Thou art possessed of a lily-like face. Thou\r\nhast a thousand faces and a thousand arms. Thou art the ruler of the\r\nuniverse, thou art the great Oblation, and thou art the animating spirit\r\nof all the gods and the Asuras. Thou art the great leader of armies. Thou\r\nart Prachanda (furious), thou art the Lord, and thou art the great master\r\nand the conqueror of thine enemies. Thou art, Sahasrabhu (multiform),\r\nSahasratusti (a thousand times content), Sahasrabhuk (devourer of\r\neverything), and Sahasrapad (of a thousand legs), and thou art the earth\r\nitself. Thou art possessed of infinite forms and thousand heads and great\r\nstrength. According to thine own inclinations thou hast appeared as the\r\nson of Ganga, Swaha, Mahi, or Krittika. O six-faced god, thou dost play\r\nwith the cock and assume different forms according to thy will. Thou art\r\nDaksha. Soma, the Maruta, Dharma, Vayu, the prince of mountains, and\r\nIndra, for all time. Thou art mighty, the most eternal of all eternal\r\nthings, and the lord of all lords. Thou art the progenitor of Truth, the\r\ndestroyer of Diti's progeny (Asuras), and the great conqueror of the\r\nenemies of the celestials.

O foremost of all\r\ngods and high-souled lord of the Universe, this whole creation is\r\nover-spread with thy energy! I have thus prayed to thee according to the\r\nbest of my power. I salute thee who art possessed of twelve eyes and many\r\nhands. Thy remaining attributes transcend my powers of comprehension!'\r\n\r\nThe Brahmana who with due attention readeth this story of the birth of\r\nSkanda, or relateth it unto Brahmanas, or hears it narrated by regenerate\r\nmen, attaineth to wealth, long life, fame, children, as also victory,\r\nprosperity and contentment, and the companionship of Skanda.\""

      "content": "(Draupadi-Satyabhama Samvada)\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"After those Brahmanas and the illustrious sons of\r\nPandu had taken their seats, Draupadi and Satyabhama entered the\r\nhermitage. And with hearts full of joy the two ladies laughed merrily and\r\nseated themselves at their ease. And, O king, those ladies, who always\r\nspake sweetly to each other, having met after a long time, began to talk\r\nupon various delightful topics arising out of the stories of the Kurus\r\nand the Yadus. And the slender-waisted Satyabhama, the favourite wife of\r\nKrishna and the daughter of Satrajit, then asked Draupadi in private,\r\nsaying, 'By what behaviour is it, O daughter of Drupada, that thou art\r\nable to rule the sons of Pandu--those heroes endued with strength and\r\nbeauty and like unto the Lokapalas themselves? Beautiful lady, how is it\r\nthat they are so obedient to thee and are never angry with thee? Without\r\ndoubt the sons of Pandu, O thou of lovely features, are ever submissive\r\nto thee and watchful to do thy bidding! Tell me, O lady, the reason of\r\nthis. Is it practice of vows, or asceticism, or incantation or drug at\r\nthe time of the bath (in season) or the efficacy of science, or the\r\ninfluence of youthful appearance, or the recitation of particular\r\nformulae, or Homa, or collyrium and other medicaments? Tell me now, O\r\nprincess of Panchala, of that blessed and auspicious thing by which, O\r\nKrishna, Krishna may ever be obedient to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the celebrated Satyabhama, having said this, ceased, the chaste and\r\nblessed daughter of Drupada answered her, saying, 'Thou askedest me, O\r\nSatyabhama, of the practices of women that are wicked. How can I answer\r\nthee, O lady, about the cause that is pursued by wicked females? It doth\r\nnot become thee, lady, to pursue the questions, or doubt me, after this,\r\nfor thou art endued with intelligence and art the favourite wife of\r\nKrishna. When the husband learns that his wife is addicted to\r\nincantations and drugs, from that hour he beginneth to dread her like a\r\nserpent ensconced in his sleeping chamber. And can a man that is troubled\r\nwith fear have peace, and how can one that hath no peace have happiness?\r\nA husband can never be made obedient by his wife's incantations. We hear\r\nof painful diseases being transmitted by enemies. Indeed, they that\r\ndesire to slay others, send poison in the shape of customary gifts, so\r\nthat the man that taketh the powders so sent, by tongue or skin, is,\r\nwithout doubt, speedily deprived of life. Women have sometimes caused\r\ndropsy and leprosy, decrepitude and impotence and idiocy and blindness\r\nand deafness in men. These wicked women, ever treading in the path of\r\nsin, do sometimes (by these means) injure their husbands. But the wife\r\nshould never do the least injury to her lord. Hear now, O illustrious\r\nlady, of the behaviour I adopt towards the high-souled sons of Pandu.\r\nKeeping aside vanity, and controlling desire and wrath, I always serve\r\nwith devotion the sons of Pandu with their wives. Restraining jealousy,\r\nwith deep devotion of heart, without a sense of degradation at the\r\nservices I perform, I wait upon my husbands. Ever fearing to utter what\r\nis evil or false, or to look or sit or walk with impropriety, or cast\r\nglances indicative of the feelings of the heart, do I serve the sons of\r\nPritha--those mighty warriors blazing like the sun or fire, and handsome\r\nas the moon, those endued with fierce energy and prowess, and capable of\r\nslaying their foes by a glance of the eye. Celestial, or man, or\r\nGandharva, young or decked with ornaments, wealthy or comely of person,\r\nnone else my heart liketh. I never bathe or eat or sleep till he that is\r\nmy husband hath bathed or eaten or slept,--till, in fact, our attendants\r\nhave bathed, eaten, or slept. Whether returning from the field, the\r\nforest, or the town, hastily rising up I always salute my husband with\r\nwater and a seat. I always keep the house and all household articles and\r\nthe food that is to be taken well-ordered and clean. Carefully do I keep\r\nthe rice, and serve the food at the proper time. I never indulge in angry\r\nand fretful speech, and never imitate women that are wicked. Keeping\r\nidleness at distance I always do what is agreeable. I never laugh except\r\nat a jest, and never stay for any length of time at the house-gate. I\r\nnever stay long in places for answering calls of nature, nor in\r\npleasure-gardens attached to the house. I always refrain from laughing\r\nloudly and indulging in high passion, and from everything that may give\r\noffence. Indeed, O Satyabhama, I always am engaged in waiting upon my\r\nlords. A separation from my lords is never agreeable to me. When my\r\nhusband leaveth home for the sake of any relative, then renouncing\r\nflowers and fragrant paste of every kind, I begin to undergo penances.\r\nWhatever my husband drinketh not, whatever my husband eateth not,\r\nwhatever my husband enjoyeth not, I ever renounce. O beautiful lady,\r\ndecked in ornaments and ever controlled by the instruction imparted to\r\nme, I always devotedly seek the good of my lord. Those duties that my\r\nmother-in-law had told me of in respect of relatives, as also the duties\r\nof alms-giving, of offering worship to the gods, of oblations to the\r\ndiseased, of boiling food in pots on auspicious days for offer to\r\nancestors and guests of reverence and service to those that deserve our\r\nregards, and all else that is known to me, I always discharge day and\r\nnight, without idleness of any kind. Having with my whole heart recourse\r\nto humility and approved rules I serve my meek and truthful lords ever\r\nobservant of virtue, regarding them as poisonous snakes capable of being\r\nexcited at a trifle. I think that to be eternal virtue for women which is\r\nbased upon a regard for the husband. The husband is the wife's god, and\r\nhe is her refuge. Indeed, there is no other refuge for her. How can,\r\nthen, the wife do the least injury to her lord? I never, in sleeping or\r\neating or adorning any person, act against the wishes of my lord, and\r\nalways guided by my husbands, I never speak ill of my mother-in-law. O\r\nblessed lady, my husbands have become obedient to me in consequence of my\r\ndiligence, my alacrity, and the humility with which I serve superiors.\r\nPersonally do I wait every day with food and drink and clothes upon the\r\nrevered and truthful Kunti--that mother of heroes. Never do I show any\r\npreference for myself over her in matters of food and attire, and never\r\ndo I reprove in words that princess equal unto the Earth herself in\r\nforgiveness. Formerly, eight thousand Brahmanas were daily fed in the\r\npalace of Yudhishthira from off plates of gold. And eighty thousand\r\nBrahmanas also of the Snataka sect leading domestic lives were\r\nentertained by Yudhishthira with thirty serving-maids assigned to each.\r\nBesides these, ten thousand yatis with the vital seed drawn up, had their\r\npure food carried unto them in plates of gold. All these Brahamanas that\r\nwere the utterers of the Veda, I used to worship duly with food, drink,\r\nand raiment taken from stores only after a portion thereof had been\r\ndedicated to the Viswadeva.[82] The illustrious son of Kunti had a\r\nhundred thousand well-dressed serving-maids with bracelets on arms and\r\ngolden ornaments on necks, and decked with costly garlands and wreaths\r\nand gold in profusion, and sprinkled with sandal paste. And adorned with\r\njewels and gold they were all skilled in singing and dancing. O lady, I\r\nknew the names and features of all those girls, as also what they are and\r\nwhat they were, and what they did not. Kunti's son of great intelligence\r\nhad also a hundred thousand maid-servants who daily used to feed guests,\r\nwith plates of gold in their hands. And while Yudhishthira lived in\r\nIndraprastha a hundred thousand horses and a hundred thousand elephants\r\nused to follow in his train. These were the possessions of Yudhisthira\r\nwhile he ruled the earth. It was I however, O lady, who regulated their\r\nnumber and framed the rules to be observed in respect of them; and it was\r\nI who had to listen to all complaints about them. Indeed, I knew\r\neverything about what the maid-servants of the palace and other classes\r\nof attendants, even the cow-herds and the shepherds of the royal\r\nestablishment, did or did not. O blessed and illustrious lady, it was I\r\nalone amongst the Pandavas who knew the income and expenditure of the\r\nking and what their whole wealth was. And those bulls among the Bharatas,\r\nthrowing upon me the burden of looking after all those that were to be\r\nfed by them, would, O thou of handsome face, pay their court to me. And\r\nthis load, so heavy and incapable of being borne by persons of evil\r\nheart, I used to bear day and night, sacrificing my ease, and all the\r\nwhile affectionately devoted to them. And while my husbands were engaged\r\nin the pursuit of virtue, I only supervised their treasury inexhaustible\r\nlike the ever-filled receptacle of Varuna. Day and night bearing hunger\r\nand thirst, I used to serve the Kuru princes, so that my nights and days\r\nwere equal to me. I used to wake up first and go to bed last. This, O\r\nSatyabhama, hath ever been my charm for making my husbands obedient to\r\nme! This great art hath ever been known to me for making my husbands\r\nobedient to me. Never have I practised the charms of wicked women, nor do\r\nI ever wish to practise them.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Hearing those words of virtuous import uttered\r\nby Krishna, Satyabhama, having first reverenced the virtuous princess of\r\nPanchala, answered saying, 'O princess of Panchala, I have been guilty, O\r\ndaughter of Yajnasena, forgive me! Among friends, conversations in jest\r\narise naturally, and without premeditation.\""

By adopting it duly, dear\r\nfriend, thou will be able to draw away thy lord from other females. In\r\nall the worlds, including that of the celestials, there is no god equal,\r\nO Satyabhama, unto the husband. When he is gratified with thee, thou\r\nmayst have (from thy husband) every object of desire; when he is angry,\r\nall these may be lost. It is from her husband that the wife obtaineth\r\noffspring and various articles of enjoyment. It is from thy husband that\r\nthou mayst have handsome beds and seats, and robes and garlands, and\r\nperfumes, and great fame and heaven itself hereafter. One cannot obtain\r\nhappiness here by means that are easy. Indeed, the woman that is chaste,\r\nobtains weal with woe. Always adore Krishna, therefore, with friendship\r\nand love physical sufferings. And do thou also act in a way, by offering\r\nhandsome seats and excellent garlands and various perfumes and prompt\r\nservice, that he may be devoted to thee, thinking, 'I am truly loved by\r\nher!' Hearing the voice of thy lord at the gate, rise thou up from thy\r\nseat and stay in readiness within the room. And as soon as thou seest him\r\nenter thy chamber, worship him by promptly offering him a seat and water\r\nto wash his feet. And even when he commands a maidservant to do anything,\r\nget thou up and do it thyself. Let Krishna understand this temper of thy\r\nmind and know that thou adorest him with all thy heart. And, O\r\nSatyabhama, whatever thy lord speaketh before thee, do not blab of it\r\neven if it may not deserve concealment,--for if any of thy co-wives were\r\nto speak of it unto Vasudeva, he might be irritated with thee. Feed thou\r\nby every means in thy power those that are dear and devoted to thy lord\r\nand always seek his good. Thou shouldst, however, always keep thyself\r\naloof from those that are hostile to and against thy lord and seek to do\r\nhim injury, as also from those that are addicted to deceit. Foregoing all\r\nexcitement and carelessness in the presence of men, conceal thy\r\ninclinations by observing silence, and thou shouldst not stay or converse\r\nin private even with thy sons, Pradyumna and Samva. Thou shouldst form\r\nattachments with only such females as are high-born and sinless and\r\ndevoted to their lords, and thou shouldst always shun women that are\r\nwrathful, addicted to drinks, gluttonous, thievish, wicked and fickle.\r\nBehaviour such as this is reputable and productive of prosperity; and\r\nwhile it is capable of neutralising hostility, it also leadeth to heaven.\r\nTherefore, worship thou thy husband, decking thyself in costly garlands\r\nand ornaments and smearing thyself with unguents and excellent perfumes.\""

And\r\nthey began to roam through delightful woods and ever charming mountains\r\nand picturesque river-valleys. And after they had taken up their\r\nresidence there, many venerable ascetics endued with Vedic lore often\r\ncame to see them. And those foremost of men always received those\r\nVeda-knowing Rishis with great respect. And one day there came unto the\r\nKaurava princes a certain Brahmana who was well known on earth for his\r\npowers of speech. And having conversed with the Pandavas for a while, he\r\nwent away as pleased him to the court of the royal son of Vichitravirya.\r\nReceived with respect by that chief of the Kurus, the old king, the\r\nBrahmana took his seat; and asked by the monarch he began to talk of the\r\nsons of Dharma, Pavana, Indra and of the twins, all of whom having fallen\r\ninto severe misery, had become emaciated and reduced owing to exposure to\r\nwind and sun. And that Brahmana also talked of Krishna who was\r\noverwhelmed with suffering and who then had become perfectly helpless,\r\nalthough she had heroes for her lords. And hearing the words of that\r\nBrahmana, the royal son of Vichitravirya became afflicted with grief, at\r\nthe thought of those princes of royal lineage then swimming in a river of\r\nsorrow. His inmost soul afflicted with sorrow and trembling all over with\r\nsighs, he quieted himself with a great effort, remembering that\r\neverything had arisen from his own fault. And the monarch said, 'Alas,\r\nhow is it that Yudhishthira who is the eldest of my sons, who is truthful\r\nand pious and virtuous in his behaviour, who hath not a foe, who had\r\nformerly slept on beds made of soft Ranku skins, sleepeth now on the bare\r\nground! Alas, wakened formerly by Sutas and Magadhas and other singers\r\nwith his praises, melodiously recited every morning, that prince of the\r\nKuru race, equal unto Indra himself, is now waked from the bare ground\r\ntowards the small hours of the night by a multitude of birds! How doth\r\nVrikodara, reduced by exposure to wind and sun and filled with wrath,\r\nsleep, in the presence of the princess of Panchala, on the bare ground,\r\nunfit as he is to suffer such lot! Perhaps also, the intelligent Arjuna,\r\nwho is incapable of bearing pain, and who, though obedient to the will of\r\nYudhishthira, yet feeleth himself to be pierced over all by the\r\nremembrance of his wrongs, sleepeth not in the night! Beholding the twins\r\nand Krishna and Yudhisthira and Bhima plunged in misery, Arjuna without\r\ndoubt, sigheth like a serpent of fierce energy and sleepeth not from\r\nwrath in the night! The twins also, who are even like a couple of blessed\r\ncelestials in heaven sunk in woe though deserving of bliss, without doubt\r\npass their nights in restless wakefulness restrained (from avenging their\r\nwrongs) by virtue and truth! The mighty son of the Wind-god, who is equal\r\nto the Wind-god himself in strength, without doubt, sigheth and\r\nrestraineth his wrath, being tied through his elder brother in the bonds\r\nof truth! Superior in battle to all warriors, he now lieth quiet on the\r\nground, restrained by virtue and truth, and burning to slay my children,\r\nhe bideth his time. The cruel words that Dussasana spoke after\r\nYudhishthira had been deceitfully defeated at dice, have sunk deep into\r\nVrikodara's heart, and are consuming him, like a burning bundle of straw\r\nconsuming a fagot of dry wood! The son of Dharma never acteth sinfully;\r\nDhananjaya also always obeyeth him; but Bhima's wrath, in consequence of\r\na life of exile, is increasing like a conflagration assisted by the wind!\r\nThat hero, burning with rage such as that, squeezeth his hands and\r\nbreatheth hot and fierce sighs, as if consuming therewith my sons and\r\ngrandsons! The wielder of the Gandiva and Vrikodara, when angry, are like\r\nYama and Kala themselves; scattering their shafts, which are like unto\r\nthunder-bolts, they exterminate in battle the ranks of the enemy. Alas\r\nDuryodhana, and Sakuni, and the Suta's son, and Dussasana also of wicked\r\nsoul, in robbing the Pandavas of their kingdom by means of dice, seem to\r\nbehold the honey alone without marking the terrible ruin. A man having\r\nacted rightly or wrongly, expecteth the fruit of those acts. The fruit,\r\nhowever, confounding him, paralyses him fully. How can man, thereof, have\r\nsalvation? If the soil is properly tilled, and the seed sown therein, and\r\nif the god (of rain) showereth in season, still the crop may not grow.\r\nThis is what we often hear. Indeed, how could this saying be true unless,\r\nas I think, it be that everything here is dependent on Destiny? The\r\ngambler Sakuni hath behaved deceitfully towards the son of Pandu, who\r\never acteth honestly. From affection for my wicked sons I also have acted\r\nsimilarly. Alas, it is owing to this that the hour of destruction hath\r\ncome for the Kurus! Oh, perhaps, what is inevitable must happen! The\r\nwind, impelled or not, will move. The woman that conceives will bring\r\nforth. Darkness will be dispelled at dawn, and day disappear at evening!\r\nWhatever may be earned by us or others, whether people spend it or not,\r\nwhen the time cometh, those possessions of ours do bring on misery. Why\r\nthen do people become so anxious about earning wealth? If, indeed, what\r\nis acquired is the result of fate, then should it be protected so that it\r\nmay not be divided, nor lost little by little, nor permitted to flow out\r\nat once, for if unprotected, it may break into a hundred fragments. But\r\nwhatever the character of our possessions, our acts in the world are\r\nnever lost. Behold what the energy of Arjuna is, who went into the abode\r\nof Indra from the woods! Having mastered the four kinds of celestial\r\nweapons he hath come back into this world! What man is there who, having\r\ngone to heaven in his human form, wisheth to come back? This would never\r\nhave been but because he seeth innumerable Kurus to be at the point of\r\ndeath, afflicted by Time! The bowman is Arjuna, capable of wielding the\r\nbow with his left hand as well! The bow he wieldeth is the Gandiva of\r\nfierce impetus. He hath, besides, those celestial weapons of his! Who is\r\nthere that would bear the energy of these three!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of the monarch, the son of Suvala, going unto\r\nDuryodhana, who was then sitting with Kama, told them everything in\r\nprivate. And Duryodhana, though possessed of little sense, was filled\r\nwith grief at what he heard.\""

And the king surrounded by the\r\nladies of the royal household began cheerfully to distribute wealth and\r\nfood and drinks of various kinds amongst those that sought to please him,\r\naccording to their desires.\r\n\r\n\"And the king, attended by all his followers, began also to slay hyenas\r\nand buffaloes and deer and gayals and bears and boars all around. And the\r\nking, piercing by his shafts those animals by thousands in deep forest,\r\ncaused the deer to be caught in the more delightful parts of the woods.\r\nDrinking milk and enjoying, O Bharata, various other delicious articles\r\nand beholding, as he proceeded, many delightful forests and woods\r\nswarming with bees inebriate with floral honey and resounding with the\r\nnotes of the peacock, the king at last reached the sacred lake of\r\nDwaitavana. And the spot which the king reached swarmed with bees\r\ninebriate with floral honey, and echoed with the mellifluous notes of the\r\nblue-throated jay and was shaded by Saptacchadas and punnagas and\r\nVakulas. And the king graced with high prosperity proceeded thither like\r\nthe thunder-wielding chief of the celestials himself. And, O thou best of\r\nthe Kuru race, King Yudhishthira the just, endued with high intelligence,\r\nwas then, O monarch, residing in the vicinity of that lake at will and\r\ncelebrating with his wedded wife, the daughter of Drupada, the diurnal\r\nsacrifice called Rajarshi, according to the ordinance sanctioned for the\r\ncelestials and persons living in the wilderness. And, O monarch, having\r\nreached that spot, Duryodhana commanded his men by thousands, saying,\r\n'Let pleasure-houses be constructed soon.' Thus commanded, those doers of\r\nthe king's behests replying to the Kruru chief with the words, 'So be\r\nit,' went towards the banks of the lake for constructing pleasure-houses.\r\nAnd as the picked soldiers of Dhritarashtra's son, having reached the\r\nregion of the lake, were about to enter the gates of the wood, a number\r\nof Gandharvas appeared and forbade them to enter. For, O monarch, the\r\nking of the Gandharvas accompanied by his followers, had come thither\r\nbeforehand, from the abode of Kuvera. And the king of the Gandharvas had\r\nalso been accompanied by the several tribes of Apsaras, as also by the\r\nsons of the celestials And intent upon sport, he had come to that place\r\nfor merriment, and occupying it, had closed it against all comers. And\r\nthe attendants of the (Kuru) king, finding the lake closed by the king of\r\nthe Gandharvas, went back, O monarch, to where the royal Duryodhana was.\r\nAnd Duryodhana having heard these words, despatched a number of his\r\nwarriors difficult of being subjugated in battle, commanding them to\r\ndrive away the Gandharvas. And those warriors who formed the vanguard of\r\nthe Kuru army, hearing these words of the king, went back to the lake of\r\nDwaitavana and addressing the Gandharvas, said, 'The mighty king\r\nDuryodhana--the son of Dhritarashtra--is coming, hither for sport. Stand\r\nye aside, therefore!' Thus addressed by them, O king, the Gandharvas\r\nlaughed and replied unto those men in these harsh words: 'Your wicked\r\nking Duryodhana must be destitute of sense. How else could he have thus\r\ncommanded us that are dwellers of heaven, as if indeed, we were his\r\nservants? Without forethought, ye also are doubtless on the point of\r\ndeath; for senseless idiots as ye are, ye have dared to bring us his\r\nmessage! Return ye soon to where that king of the Kurus is, or else go\r\nthis very day to the abode of Yama.' Thus addressed by the Gandharvas,\r\nthe advanced guard of the king's army ran back to the place where the\r\nroyal son of Dhritarashtra was.\""

And the king addressed his soldiers, saying, 'Punish these wretches\r\nwho desire to oppose my will, even if they have come hither to sport,\r\naccompanied by all the celestials with him of a hundred sacrifices. And\r\nhearing these words of Duryodhana, the sons and officers of Dhritarashtra\r\nall endued with great strength, as also warriors by thousands, began to\r\narm themselves for battle. And filling the ten sides with loud leonine\r\nroars and rushing at those Gandharvas that had been guarding the gates,\r\nthey entered the forest. And as the Kuru soldiers entered the forest,\r\nother Gandharvas came up and forbade them to advance. And though gently\r\nforbidden by the Gandharvas to advance, the Kuru soldiers, without\r\nregarding them in the least, began to enter that mighty forest. And when\r\nthose rangers of the sky found that the warriors of Dhritarashtra along\r\nwith their king could not be stopped by words they all went to their king\r\nChitrasena and represented everything unto him. And when Chitrasena, the\r\nking of the Gandharvas, came to know all this he became filled with rage,\r\nalluding to the Kuru, and commanded his followers saying, 'Punish these\r\nwretches of wicked behaviour.' And, O Bharata, when the Gandharvas were\r\nso commanded by Chitrasena, they rushed weapons in hand, towards the\r\nDhritarashtra ranks. And beholding the Gandharvas impetuously rushing\r\ntowards them with upraised weapons, the Kuru warriors precipitously fled\r\nin all directions at the very sight of Duryodhana. And beholding the Kuru\r\nsoldiers all flying from the field with their backs to the foe, the\r\nheroic Radheya alone fled not. And seeing the mighty host of the\r\nGandharvas rushing towards him, Radheya checked them by a perfect shower\r\nof arrows. And the Suta's son, owing to his extreme lightness of hand,\r\nstruck hundreds of Gandharvas with Kshurapras and arrows and Bhallas and\r\nvarious weapons made of bones and steel. And that mighty warrior, causing\r\nthe heads of numerous Gandharvas to roll down within a short time, made\r\nthe ranks of Chitrasena to yell in anguish. And although they were\r\nslaughtered in great numbers by Karna endued with great intelligence, yet\r\nthe Gandharvas returned to the charge by hundreds and thousands. And in\r\nconsequence of the swarms of Chitrasena's warriors rushing impetuously to\r\nthe field the earth itself became soon covered by the Gandharva host.\r\nThen king Duryodhana, and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and Dussasana, and\r\nVikarna, and other sons of Dhritarashtra, seated on cars the clatter of\r\nwhose wheels resembled the roars of Garuda, returned to the charge,\r\nfollowing the lead of Karna, and began to slaughter that host. And\r\ndesirous of supporting Karna, these princes invested the Gandharva army,\r\nwith a large number of cars and a strong body of horses. Then the whole\r\nof the Gandharva host began to fight with the Kauravas. And the encounter\r\nthat took place between the contending hosts was fierce in the extreme\r\nand might make one's hair stand on end. The Gandharvas, at last,\r\nafflicted with the shafts of the Kuru army, seemed to be exhausted. And\r\nthe Kauravas beholding the Gandharvas so afflicted sent up a loud sound.\r\n\r\n\"And seeing the Gandharva host yielding to fear, the angry Chitrasena\r\nsprang from his seat, resolved to exterminate the Kuru army. And\r\nconversant with various modes of warfare, he waged on the fight, aided by\r\nhis weapons of illusion. And the Kaurava warriors were then all deprived\r\nof their senses by the illusion of Chitrasena. And then, O Bharata, it\r\nseemed that every warrior of the Kuru army was fallen upon and surrounded\r\nby ten Gandharvas. And attacked with great vigour, the Kuru host was\r\ngreatly afflicted and struck with panic. O king, all of them that liked\r\nto live, fled from the field. But while the entire Dhritarashtra host\r\nbroke and fled, Karna, that offspring of the Sun, stood there, O king,\r\nimmovable as a hill. Indeed, Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the son of\r\nSuvala, all fought with the Gandharvas, although every one of them was\r\nmuch wounded and mangled in the encounter. All the Gandharvas then,\r\ndesirous of slaying Karna, rushed together by hundreds and thousands\r\ntowards Karna. And those mighty warriors, desirous of slaying the Suta's\r\nson, surrounded him on all sides, with swords and battle-axes and spears.\r\nAnd some cut down the yoke of his car, and some his flagstaff, and some\r\nthe shaft of his car, and some his horses, and some his charioteer. And\r\nsome cut down his umbrella and some the wooden fender round his car and\r\nsome the joints of his car. It was thus that many thousands of\r\nGandharvas, together attacking his car, broke it into minute fragments.\r\nAnd while his car was thus attacked, Karna leaped therefrom with sword\r\nand shield in hand, and mounting on Vikarna's car, urged the steeds for\r\nsaving himself.\""

And\r\nby means of their arrows, they cut off into fragments the yoke, the\r\nshaft, the fenders, the flagstaff, the three-fold bamboo poles, and the\r\nprincipal turret of his car. And they also slew his charioteer and\r\nhorses, hacking them to pieces. And when Duryodhana, deprived of his car,\r\nfell on the ground, the strong-armed Chitrasena rushed towards him and\r\nseized him in such a way that it seemed his life itself was taken. And\r\nafter the Kuru king had been seized, the Gandharvas, surrounding\r\nDussasana, who was seated on his car, also took him prisoner. And some\r\nGandharvas seized Vivinsati and Chitrasena, and some Vinda and Anuvinda,\r\nwhile others seized all the ladies of royal household. And the warriors\r\nof Duryodhana, who were routed by the Gandharvas, joining those who had\r\nfled first, approached the Pandavas (who were living in the vicinity).\r\nAnd after Duryodhana had been made captive, the vehicles, the shops, the\r\npavilions, the carriages, and the draught animals, all were made over to\r\nthe Pandavas for protection. And those soldiers said, 'The mighty-armed\r\nson of Dhritarashtra, possessed of great strength and handsome mien, is\r\nbeing taken away captive by the Gandharvas! Ye sons of Pritha, follow\r\nthem! Dussasana, Durvishasa, Durmukha, and Durjaya, are all being led\r\naway as captives in chains by the Gandharvas, as also all the ladies of\r\nthe royal household!'\r\n\r\n\"Crying thus, the followers of Duryodhana, afflicted with grief and\r\nmelancholy, approached Yudhishthira, desirous of effecting the release of\r\nthe king. Bhima then answered those old attendants of Duryodhana, who,\r\nafflicted with grief and melancholy, were thus soliciting (the aid of\r\nYudhishthira), saying, 'What we should have done with great efforts,\r\narraying ourselves in line of battle, supported by horses and elephants\r\nhath, indeed, been done by the Gandharvas! They that come hither for\r\nother purposes, have been overtaken by consequences they had not\r\nforeseen! Indeed, this is the result of the evil counsels of a king who\r\nis fond of deceitful play! It hath been heard by us that the foe of a\r\nperson who is powerless, is overthrown by others. The Gandharvas have, in\r\nan extraordinary way illustrated before our eyes the truth of this\r\nsaying! It seems that there is still fortunately some person in the world\r\nwho is desirous of doing us good who hath, indeed, taken upon his own\r\nshoulders our pleasant load, although we are sitting idly!

O exalted one, from this forcible seizure\r\nof Duryodhana and from this insult to the ladies of our house by a\r\nstranger, our family honour is being destroyed. Therefore, ye tigers\r\namong men, arise and arm yourselves without delay for rescuing those that\r\nhave sought our protection and for guarding the honour of our family. Ye\r\ntigers among men, let Arjuna and the twins and thyself also that art\r\nbrave and unvanquished, liberate Duryodhana, who is even now being taken\r\naway a captive!

O\r\nVrikodara, if the vow in which I am engaged had been over, there is\r\nlittle doubt that I would myself have run to his aid. Strive thou by all\r\nmeans, O Bharata, to liberate Duryodhana by the arts of conciliation. If,\r\nhowever, the king of the Gandharvas cannot be managed by the arts of\r\nconciliation, then must thou try to rescue Suyodhana by lightly\r\nskirmishing with the foe.

And the Pandavas also, having liberated their relatives\r\nalong with the ladies of the royal household, and having achieved that\r\ndifficult feat (the defeat of the Gandharvas host) became well-pleased.\r\nAnd those illustrious and mighty warriors worshipped by the Kurus along\r\nwith their sons and wives, blazed forth in splendour like flaming fires\r\nin the sacrificial compound. And Yudhishthira then addressing the\r\nliberated Duryodhana in the midst of his brothers, from affection, told\r\nhim these words: 'O child, never again do such a rash act. O Bharata, a\r\nrash wight never cometh by happiness. O son of the Kuru race, pleased be\r\nthou with all thy brothers. Go back to thy capital as pleaseth thee,\r\nwithout yielding thyself to despondency or cheerlessness!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus dismissed by the son of Pandu, king\r\nDuryodhana then saluted king Yudhishthira the just and overwhelmed with\r\nshame, and his heart rent in twain, mechanically set out for his capital,\r\nlike one destitute of life. And after the Kaurava prince had departed,\r\nthe brave Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, along with his brothers, was\r\nworshipped by the Brahmanas, and surrounded by those Brahmanas endued\r\nwith the wealth of asceticism, like Sakra himself by the celestials, he\r\nbegan to pass his days happily in the woods of Dwaita.\""

The slaughtered, indeed, on both sides were great.\r\nBut when those brave Gandharvas, resorting to their many powers of\r\nillusion, ascended the skies and began to fight with us thence, our\r\nencounter with them ceased to be an equal one. Defeat then was ours and\r\neven captivity. And afflicted with sorrow, we along with our attendants\r\nand counsellors and children and wives and troops and vehicles were being\r\ntaken by them through the skies. It was then that some soldiers of ours\r\nand some brave officers repaired in grief unto the sons of Pandu--those\r\nheroes that never refuse succour to those that ask for it.

They are incapable of being insulted as long as the sons of\r\nPandu are alive.' 'Thus addressed by the illustrious son of Pandu, the\r\nchief of the Gandharvas, O Karna, disclosed unto the Pandavas the object\r\nwe had in view in proceeding to that place, viz., that we came there for\r\ncasting our eyes on the sons of Pandu with their wife, all plunged in\r\nmisery. And while the Gandharva was disclosing those counsels of ours,\r\noverwhelmed with shame I desired the earth to yield me a crevice, so that\r\nI might disappear there and then. The Gandharvas then, accompanied by the\r\nPandavas, went to Yudhishthira, and, disclosing unto him also counsels,\r\nmade us over, bound as we were, to him. Alas, what greater sorrow could\r\nbe mine than that I should thus be offered as a tribute unto\r\nYudhishthira, in the very sight of the women of our household, myself in\r\nchains and plunged in misery, and under the absolute control of my\r\nenemies. Alas, they, who have ever been persecuted by me, they unto whom\r\nI have ever been a foe released me from captivity, and wretch that I am,\r\nI am indebted to them for my life. If, O hero, I had met with my death in\r\nthat great battle, that would have been far better than that I should\r\nhave obtained my life in this way. If I had been slain by the Gandharvas,\r\nmy fame would have spread over the whole earth, and I should have\r\nobtained auspicious regions of eternal bliss in the heaven of Indra.\r\nListen to me therefore, ye bulls among men, as to what I intend to do\r\nnow. I will stay here forgoing all food, while ye all return home. Let\r\nall my brothers also go to Hastinapura. Let all our friends, including\r\nKarna, and all our relatives headed by Dussasana, return now to the\r\ncapital. Insulted by the foe, I myself will not repair thither. I who had\r\nbefore wrested from the foe his respect, I who had always enchanced the\r\nrespect of my friends, have now become a source of sorrow unto friends\r\nand of joy unto enemies. What shall I now say unto the king, going to the\r\ncity named after the elephant? What will Bhishma and Drona, Kripa, and\r\nDrona's son, Vidura and Sanjaya, Vahuka and Somadatta and other revered\r\nseniors,--what will the principal men of the other orders and men of\r\nindependent professions, say to me and what shall I say unto them in\r\nreply? Having hitherto stayed over the heads of my enemies, having\r\nhitherto trod upon their breasts, I have fallen away from my position.\r\nHow shall I ever speak with them? Insolent men having obtained prosperity\r\nand knowledge and affluence, are seldom blest for any length of time like\r\nmyself puffed up with vanity. Alas, led by folly I have done a highly\r\nimproper and wicked act, for which, fool that I am, I have fallen into\r\nsuch distress. Therefore, will I perish by starving, life having become\r\ninsupportable to me. Relieved from distress by the foe, what man of\r\nspirit is there who can drag on his existence? Proud as I am, shorn of\r\nmanliness, the foe hath laughed at me, for the Pandavas possessed of\r\nprowess have looked at me plunged in misery!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'While giving way to such reflections Duryodhana\r\nspoke unto Dussasana thus: 'O Dussasana, listen to these words of mine, O\r\nthou of the Bharata race!

Like Vishnu looking after the celestials, thou shouldst always\r\nlook after all consanguineous relatives. Thou shouldst also ever cherish\r\nthy superiors. Go, rule thou the earth gladdening thy friends and\r\nreproving thy foes.' And clasping his neck, Duryodhana said, 'Go!'\r\nHearing these words of his, Dussasana in perfect cheerlessness and\r\noverwhelmed with great sorrow, his voice choked in tears, said, with\r\njoined hands and bending his head unto his eldest brother, 'Relent!' And\r\nsaying this he fell down on earth with heavy heart. And afflicted with\r\ngrief that tiger among men, shedding his tears on the feet of his brother\r\nagain said, 'This will never be! The earth may split, the vault of heaven\r\nmay break in pieces, the sun may cast off his splendour, the moon may\r\nabandon his coolness, the wind may forsake its speed, the Himavat may be\r\nmoved from its site, the waters of the ocean may dry up, and fire may\r\nabandon its heat, yet I, O king, may never rule the earth without thee.'\r\nAnd Dussasana repeatedly said, 'Relent, O king! Thou alone shall be king\r\nin our race for a hundred years.' And having spoken thus unto the king,\r\nDussasana began to weep melodiously catching, O Bharata, the feet of his\r\neldest brother deserving of worship from him.\r\n\r\n\"And beholding Dussasana and Duryodhana thus weeping, Karna in great\r\ngrief approached them both and said, 'Ye, Kuru princes, why do you thus\r\nyield to sorrow like ordinary men, from senselessness? Mere weeping can\r\nnever ease a sorrowing man's grief. When weeping can never remove one's\r\ngriefs, what do you gain by thus giving way to sorrow? Summon patience to\r\nyour aid to not gladden the foe by such conduct. O king, the Pandavas\r\nonly did their duty in liberating thee. They that reside in the dominions\r\nof the king, should always do what is agreeable to the king. Protected by\r\nthee, the Pandavas are residing happily in thy dominion. It behoveth thee\r\nnot to indulge in such sorrow like an ordinary person. Behold, thy\r\nuterine brothers are all sad and cheerless at seeing thee resolved to put\r\nan end to thy life by forgoing food. Blest be thou!

Nor do intelligent persons like thee ever set their\r\nhands to acts that are sinful and opposed to their best interests and\r\nstriking at the very root of their purposes. Restrain this resolve of\r\nthine, therefore, O king, which is destructive of morality, profit, and\r\nhappiness, of fame, prowess, and energy, and which enhanceth the joy of\r\nfoes O exalted king, know the truth, the celestial origin of thy soul,\r\nand the maker of thy body, and then summon thou patience to thy aid. In\r\ndays of old. O king, we have obtained thee, by ascetic austerities from\r\nMaheswara. The upper part of thy body is wholly made of an assemblage of\r\nVajras, and is, therefore, invulnerable to weapons of every description,\r\nO sinless one. The lower part of thy body, capable of captivating the\r\nfemale heart by its comeliness was made of flowers by the goddess\r\nherself--the wife of Mahadeva. Thy body is thus, O best of kings, the\r\ncreation of Maheswara himself and his goddess. Therefore, O tiger among\r\nkings, thou art of celestial origin, not human. Other brave Kshatriyas of\r\nmighty energy headed by Bhagadatta, and all acquainted with celestial\r\nweapons, will slay thy foes. Therefore, let this grief of thine cease.\r\nThou hast no cause for fear. For aiding thee, many heroic Danavas have\r\nbeen born on the earth. Other Asuras will also possess Bhishma and Drona\r\nand Kama and others. Possessed by those Asuras, these heroes will cast\r\naway their kindness and fight with thy foes. Indeed, when the Danavas\r\nwill enter their heart and possess them completely, flinging all\r\naffections to a distance, becoming hard-hearted, these warriors will\r\nstrike every body opposed to them in battle without sparing sons,\r\nbrothers, fathers, friends, disciples, relatives, even children and old\r\nmen. Blinded by ignorance and wrath, and impelled by that destiny which\r\nhath been ordained by the Creator, these tigers among men, with hearts\r\nsteeped in sin, will, O thou foremost of the Kurus, depopulate the earth\r\nby hurling and shooting all kinds of weapons, with great manliness and\r\nstrength and always addressing one another boastfully with words such as\r\nthese, 'Thou shall not escape from me today with life.' And these\r\nillustrious sons of Pandu also, five in number, will fight with these.\r\nAnd, endued with mighty strength and favoured by Fate, they will compass\r\nthe destruction of these. And, O king, many Daityas and Rakshasas also\r\nthat have been born in the Kshatriya order, will fight with great prowess\r\nin the battle with thy foes, using maces and clubs and lances and various\r\nweapons of a superior kind. And, O hero, with respect to the fear that is\r\nin thy heart rising from Arjuna, we have already settled the means for\r\nslaying Arjuna. The soul of the slain Naraka hath assumed the form of\r\nKarna. Recollecting his former hostility he will encounter both Kesava\r\nand Arjuna. And that mighty warrior and foremost of smiters, proud of his\r\nprowess will vanquish Arjuna in battle as also all thy enemies. The\r\nwielder of the thunder-bolt, knowing all this, and desirous of saving\r\nArjuna, will in disguise take away from Karna his ear-rings and coat of\r\nmail. We also have for that reason appointed hundreds upon hundreds and\r\nthousands upon thousands of Daityas and Rakshasas, viz., those that are\r\nknown by the name of Samsaptakas.[83] These celebrated warriors will slay\r\nthe heroic Arjuna. Therefore, grieve not, O king. Thou wilt rule the\r\nwhole earth, O monarch, without a rival. Do not yield to despondency.\r\nConduct such as this does not suit thee. O thou of the Kuru race, if thou\r\ndiest, our party becometh weak. Go thou, O hero, and let not thy mind be\r\ndirected to any other course of action. Thou art ever our refuge as,\r\nindeed, the Pandavas are the refuge of the gods.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having addressed him thus, those Daityas\r\nembraced that elephant among kings, and those bulls among the Danavas\r\ncheered that irrepressible one like a son. And, O Bharata, pacifying his\r\nmind by soft speech, they permitted him to depart, saying, 'Go and attain\r\nvictory!' And when they had given leave to the mighty-armed one, that\r\nvery goddess carried him back to the spot where he had sat down, intent\r\nupon putting an end to his life. And having set that hero down and paid\r\nhim homage, the goddess vanished, taking the king's permission. O\r\nBharata, when she had gone, king Duryodhana considered all (that had\r\nhappened) as a dream. He then thought within himself, 'I shall defeat the\r\nPandavas in battle.' And Suyodhana thought that Karna and the Samsaptaka\r\narmy were both able (to destroy) and intent upon destroying that slayer\r\nof foes, Partha. Thus, O bull of the Bharata race, the hope was\r\nstrengthened of the wicked minded son of Dhritarashtra, of conquering the\r\nPandavas. And Karna also, his soul and faculties possessed by the inmost\r\nsoul of Naraka, had at that time cruelly determined to slay Arjuna. And\r\nthose heroes--the Samsaptakas also--having their sense possessed by the\r\nRakshasas, and influenced by the qualities of emotion and darkness, were\r\ndesirous of slaying Phalguna. And, O king, others with Bhishma, Drona,\r\nand Kripa at their head, having their faculties influenced by the\r\nDanavas, were not so affectionate towards the sons of Pandu as they had\r\nbeen. But king Suyodhana did not tell any one of this.\r\n\r\n\"When the night passed away, Karna, that offspring of the Sun, with\r\njoined hands, smilingly addressed these wise words to king Duryodhana,\r\n'No dead man conquereth his foes: it is when he is alive that he can see\r\nhis good. Where is the good of the dead person; and, O Kauraveya, where\r\nis his victory? Therefore, this is no time for grief, or fear or death.'\r\nAnd having, with his arms embraced that mighty-armed one, he further\r\nsaid, 'Rise up, O king! Why dost thou lie down? Why dost thou grieve, O\r\nslayer of foes? Having afflicted thy enemies by thy prowess, why dost\r\nthou wish for death? Or (perhaps) fear hath possessed thee at the sight\r\nof Arjuna's prowess. I truly promise unto thee that I will slay Arjuna in\r\nbattle. O lord of men, I swear by my weapon that when the three and ten\r\nyears shall have passed away, I will bring the sons of Pritha under thy\r\nsubjection.'

And, O monarch, immensely swarming with\r\nwhite umbrellas, and pennons, and white Chamaras, and cars, and\r\nelephants, and foot-soldiers, that mighty army, as it moved like the\r\nwaters of the Ganga, looked graceful like the firmament, at a season when\r\nthe clouds have dispersed and the signs of autumn have been but partially\r\ndeveloped.

But thou\r\ndidst do so. And as a consequence, O hero, wert thou forcibly taken\r\ncaptive by the enemy, and wert delivered by the Pandavas versed in\r\nmorality. Yet art thou not ashamed. Even in the presence of thee, O son\r\nof Gandhari, together with thy army, did the Suta's son, struck with\r\npanic, fly from the battle of the Gandharvas, O king.

What remaineth to be done?\r\nAnd how we can most effectively bring about the good we shall discuss\r\nto-day.' Karna said, 'O Kuru's son, Duryodhana, do thou lay to heart tie\r\nwords that I say. Bhishma always blameth us, and praiseth the Pandavas.\r\nAnd from the ill-will he beareth towards thee, he hateth me also. And, O\r\nlord of men, in thy presence he ever crieth me down. I shall never, O\r\nBharata, bear these words that Bhishma had said in thy presence in\r\nrelation to this matter, extolling the Pandavas, and censuring thee, O\r\nrepresser of foes! Do thou, O king, enjoin on me, together with servants,\r\nforces, and cars. I shall, O monarch, conquer the earth furnished with\r\nmountains and woods and forests. The earth had been conquered by the four\r\npowerful Pandavas. I shall, without doubt, conquer it for thee\r\nsingle-handed. Let that wretch of the Kuru race, the exceedingly\r\nwicked-minded Bhishma, see it,--he who vilifies those that do not deserve\r\ncensure, and praises those that should not be praised. Let him this day\r\nwitness my might, and blame himself. Do thou, O king, command me. Victory\r\nshall surely be thine.

And seeing him approach, Kunti's son,\r\nYudhishthira, stepped forward, and duly received that high-souled one.\r\nAnd having gratified Vyasa by bowing down unto him, Pandu's son of\r\nsubdued senses, after the Rishi had been seated, sat down before him,\r\ndesirous of listening to him. And beholding his grandsons lean and living\r\nin the forest on the produce of the wilderness, that mighty sage, moved\r\nby compassion, said these words, in accents choked in tears, 'O\r\nmighty-armed Yudhishthira, O thou best of virtuous persons, those men\r\nthat do not perform ascetic austerities never attain great happiness in\r\nthis world. People experience happiness and misery by turns; for surely,\r\nO bull among men, no man ever enjoyeth unbroken happiness. A wise man\r\nendued with high wisdom, knowing that life hath its ups and downs, is\r\nneither filled with joy nor with grief. When happiness cometh, one should\r\nenjoy it; when misery cometh, one should bear it, as a sower of crops\r\nmust bide his season. Nothing is superior to asceticism: by asceticism\r\none acquireth mighty fruit. Do thou know, O Bharata, that there is\r\nnothing that asceticism cannot achieve. Truth, sincerity, freedom from\r\nanger, justice, self-control, restraint of the faculties, immunity from\r\nmalice, guilelessness, sanctity, and mortification of the senses, these,\r\nO mighty monarch, purify a person of meritorious acts. Foolish persons\r\naddicted to vice and bestial ways, attain to brutish births in after life\r\nand never enjoy happiness. The fruit of acts done in this world is reaped\r\nin the next. Therefore should one restrain his body by asceticism and the\r\nobservance of vows. And, O king, free from guile and with a cheerful\r\nspirit, one should, according to his power, bestow gifts, after going\r\ndown to the recipient and paying him homage. A truth-telling person\r\nattaineth a life devoid of trouble. A person void of anger attaineth\r\nsincerity, and one free from malice acquireth supreme contentment. A\r\nperson who hath subdued his senses and his inner faculties, never knoweth\r\ntribulation; nor is a person of subdued senses affected by sorrow at the\r\nheight of other's prosperity. A man who giveth everyone his due, and the\r\nbestower of boons, attain happiness, and come by every object of\r\nenjoyment; while a man free from envy reapeth perfect ease. He that\r\nhonoureth those to whom honour is due, attaineth birth in an illustrious\r\nline; and he that hath subdued his senses, never cometh by misfortune. A\r\nman whose mind followeth good, after having paid his debt to nature, is\r\non this account, born again endued with a righteous mind.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O eminently virtuous one, O mighty sage, of the\r\nbestowal of gifts and the observance of asceticism, which is of greater\r\nefficacy in the next world, and which, harder of practice?'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'There is nothing, O child, in this world harder to practise\r\nthan charity. Men greatly thirst after wealth, and wealth also is gotten\r\nwith difficulty. Nay, renouncing even dear life itself, heroic men, O\r\nmagnanimous one, enter into the depths of the sea and the forest for the\r\nsake of wealth. For wealth, some betake themselves to agriculture and the\r\ntending of kine, and some enter into servitude. Therefore, it is\r\nextremely difficult to part with wealth that is obtained with such\r\ntrouble. Since nothing is harder to practise than charity, therefore, in\r\nmy opinion, even the bestowal of boons is superior to everything.\r\nSpecially is this to be borne in mind that well-earned gains should, in\r\nproper time and place, be given away to pious men. But the bestowal of\r\nill-gotten gains can never rescue the giver from the evil of rebirth. It\r\nhath been declared, O Yudhishthira, that by bestowing, in a pure spirit,\r\neven a slight gift in due time and to a fit recipient, a man attaineth\r\ninexhaustible fruit in the next world. In this connection is instanced\r\nthe old story regarding the fruit obtained by Mudgala, for having given\r\naway only a drona[85] of corn.'\""

Do thou tell me this. Surely, I consider the life of that\r\nvirtuous person as having borne fruit with whose practices the possessor\r\nhimself of the six attributes, witnessing everything, was well pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'There lived, O king, in Kurukshetra a virtuous man (sage),\r\nMudgala by name. And he was truthful, and free from malice, and of\r\nsubdued senses. And he used to lead the Sila and Unchha modes of\r\nlife.[86] And although living like a pigeon, yet that one of mighty\r\nausterities entertained his guests, celebrated the sacrifice called\r\nIstikrita, and performed other rites. And that sage together with his son\r\nand wife, ate for a fortnight, and during the other fortnight led the\r\nlife of a pigeon, collecting a drona of corn. And celebrating the Darsa\r\nand Paurnamasya sacrifices, that one devoid of guile, used to pass his\r\ndays by taking the food that remained after the deities and the guests\r\nhad eaten. And on auspicious lunar days, that lord of the three worlds,\r\nIndra himself, accompanied by the celestials used, O mighty monarch, to\r\npartake of the food offered at his sacrifice. And that one, having\r\nadopted the life of a Muni, with a cheerful heart entertained his guests\r\nalso with food on such days. And as that high-souled one distributed his\r\nfood with alacrity, the remainder of the drona of corn increased as soon\r\nas a guest appeared. And by virtue of the pure spirit in which the sage\r\ngave a way, that food of his increased so much that hundreds upon\r\nhundreds of learned Brahmanas were fed with it.\r\n\r\n\"And, O king, it came to pass that having heard of the virtuous Mudgala\r\nobservant of vows, the Muni Durvasa, having space alone for his\r\ncovering,[87] his accoutrements worn like that of maniac, and his head\r\nbare of hair, came there, uttering, O Pandava various insulting words.\r\nAnd having arrived there that best of Munis said unto the Brahmana. 'Know\r\nthou, O foremost of Brahmanas, that I have come hither seeking for food.\r\nThereupon Mudgala said unto the sage, 'Thou art welcome!' And then\r\noffering to that maniac of an ascetic affected by hunger, water to wash\r\nhis feet and mouth, that one observant of the vow of feeding guests,\r\nrespectfully placed before him excellent fare. Affected by hunger, the\r\nfrantic Rishi completely exhausted the food that had been offered unto\r\nhim. Thereupon, Mudgala furnished him again with food. Then having eaten\r\nup all that food, he besmeared his body with the unclean orts and went\r\naway as he had come. In this manner, during the next season, he came\r\nagain and ate up all the food supplied by that wise one leading the\r\nUnchha mode of life. Thereupon, without partaking any food himself, the\r\nsage Mudgala again became engaged in collecting corn, following the\r\nUnchha mode. Hunger could not disturb his equanimity. Nor could anger,\r\nnor guile, nor a sense of degradation, nor agitation, enter into the\r\nheart of that best of Brahmanas leading the Unchha mode of life along\r\nwith his son and his wife. In this way, Durvasa having made up his mind,\r\nduring successive seasons presented himself for six several times before\r\nthat best of sages living according to the Unchha mode; yet that Muni\r\ncould not perceive any agitation in Mudgala's heart; and he found the\r\npure heart of the pure-souled ascetic always pure. Thereupon,\r\nwell-pleased, the sage addressed Mudgala, saying, There is not another\r\nguileless and charitable being like thee on earth. The pangs of hunger\r\ndrive away to a distance the sense of righteousness and deprive people of\r\nall patience. The tongue, loving delicacies, attracteth men towards them.\r\nLife is sustained by food. The mind, moreover, is fickle, and it is hard\r\nto keep it in subjection. The concentration of the mind and of the senses\r\nsurely constitutes ascetic austerities. It must be hard to renounce in a\r\npure spirit a thing earned by pains. Yet, O pious one, all this hath been\r\nduly achieved by thee. In thy company we feel obliged and gratified.\r\nSelf-restraint, fortitude, justice, control of the senses and of\r\nfaculties, mercy, and virtue, all these are established in thee. Thou\r\nhast by the deeds conquered the different worlds and have thereby\r\nobtained admission into paths of beautitude. Ah! even the dwellers of\r\nheaven are proclaiming thy mighty deeds of charity. O thou observant of\r\nvows, thou shalt go to heaven even in thine own body.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst the Muni Durvasa was speaking thus, a celestial messenger\r\nappeared before Mudgala, upon a car yoked with swans and cranes, hung\r\nwith a neat work of bells, scented with divine fragrance, painted\r\npicturesquely, and possessed of the power of going everywhere at will.\r\nAnd he addressed the Brahmana sage, saying, 'O sage, do thou ascend into\r\nthis chariot earned by thy acts. Thou hast attained the fruit of thy\r\nasceticism!'\r\n\r\n\"As the messenger of the gods was speaking thus, the sage told him, 'O\r\ndivine messenger, I desire that thou mayst describe unto me the\r\nattributes of those that reside there. What are their austerities, and\r\nwhat their purposes? And, O messenger of the gods, what constitutes\r\nhappiness in heaven, and what are the disadvantages thereof? It is\r\ndeclared by virtuous men of good lineage that friendship with pious\r\npeople is contracted by only walking with them seven paces. O lord, in\r\nthe name of that friendship I ask thee, 'Do thou without hesitation tell\r\nme the truth, and that which is good for me now. Having heard thee, I\r\nshall, according to thy words, ascertain the course I ought to follow.'\""

O Muni,\r\nthat region which is known as heaven, existeth there above us. Those\r\nregions tower high, and are furnished with excellent paths, and are, O\r\nsage, always ranged by celestial cars. Atheists, and untruthful persons,\r\nthose that have not practised ascetic austerities and those that have not\r\nperformed great sacrifices, cannot repair thither. Only men of virtuous\r\nsouls, and those of subdued spirits, and those that have their faculties\r\nin subjection, and those that have controlled their senses, and those\r\nthat are free from malice, and persons intent on the practice of charity;\r\nand heroes, and men bearing marks of battle, after having, with subdued\r\nsenses and faculties, performed the most meritorious rites, attain those\r\nregions, O Brahmana, capable of being obtained only by virtuous acts, and\r\ninhabited by pious men. There, O Mudgala, are established separately\r\nmyriads of beautiful, shining, and resplendent worlds bestowing every\r\nobject of desire, owned by those celestial beings, the gods, the Sadhyas,\r\nand the Vaiswas, the great sages, Yamas, and the Dharmas, and the\r\nGandharvas and the Apsaras. And there is that monarch of mountains the\r\ngolden Meru extending over a space of thirty-three thousand Yojanas. And\r\nthere, O Mudgala, are the sacred gardens of the celestials, with Nandana\r\nat their head, where sport the persons of meritorious acts. And neither\r\nhunger, nor thirst, nor lassitude, nor fear, nor anything that is\r\ndisgusting or inauspicious is there. And all the odours of that place are\r\ndelightful, and all the breezes delicious to the touch. And all the\r\nsounds there are captivating, O sage, to the ear and the heart. And\r\nneither grief, nor decrepitude, nor labour, nor repentance also is there.\r\nThat world, O Muni, obtained as the fruit of one's own acts, is of this\r\nnature. Persons repair thither by virtue of their meritorious deeds. And\r\nthe persons of those that dwell there look resplendent, and this, O\r\nMudgala, solely by virtue of their own acts, and not owing to the merits\r\nof father or mothers. And there is neither sweat, nor stench, nor urine\r\nthere. And, there, O Muni, dust doth not soils one's garments. And their\r\nexcellent garlands, redolent of divine fragrance, never fade. And, O\r\nBrahmana, they yoke such cars as this (that I have brought). And, O\r\nmighty sage, devoid of envy and grief and fatigue and ignorance and\r\nmalice, men who have attained heaven, dwell in those regions happily.\r\nAnd, O bull among Munis, higher and higher over such regions there are\r\nothers endued with higher celestial virtues. Of these, the beautiful and\r\nresplendent regions of Brahma are the foremost. Thither, O Brahmana,\r\nrepair Rishis that have been sanctified by meritorious acts. And there\r\ndwell certain beings named Ribhus. They are the gods of the gods\r\nthemselves. Their regions are supremely blessed, and are adored even by\r\nthe deities. These shine by their own light, and bestow every object of\r\ndesire. They suffer no pangs that women might cause, do not possess\r\nworldly wealth, and are free from guile. The Ribhus do not subsist on\r\noblations, nor yet on ambrosia. And they are endued with such celestial\r\nforms that they cannot be perceived by the senses. And these eternal gods\r\nof the celestials do not desire happiness for happiness' sake, nor do\r\nthey change at the revolution of a Kalpa. Where, indeed, is their\r\ndecrepitude or dissolution? For them there is neither ecstasy, nor joy,\r\nnor happiness. They have neither happiness nor misery. Wherefore should\r\nthey have anger or aversion then, O Muni? O Mudgala, their supreme state\r\nis coveted even by the gods. And that crowning emancipation, hard to\r\nattain, can never be acquired by people subject to desire. The number of\r\nthose deities is thirty-three. To their regions repair wise men, after\r\nhaving observed excellent vows, or bestowed gifts according to the\r\nordinance. Thou also hast easily acquired that success by thy charities.\r\nDo thou, by effulgence displayed by virtue of thy ascetic austerities,\r\nenjoy that condition obtained by thy meritorious acts. Such, O Brahmana,\r\nis the bliss of heaven containing various worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Thus have I described unto thee the blessing of the celestial regions.\r\nDo thou now hear from me some of the disadvantages thereof. That in the\r\ncelestial regions a person, while reaping the fruit of the acts he hath\r\nalready performed, cannot be engaged in any others, and that he must\r\nenjoy the consequences of the former until they are completely exhausted,\r\nand, further, that he is subject to fall after he hath entirely exhausted\r\nhis merit, form, in my opinion, the disadvantages of heaven. The fall of\r\na person whose mind hath been steeped in happiness, must, O Mudgala, be\r\npronounced as a fault. And the discontent and regret that must follow\r\none's stay at an inferior seat after one hath enjoyed more auspicious and\r\nbrighter regions, must be hard to bear. And the consciousness of those\r\nabout to fall is stupefied, and also agitated by emotions. And as the\r\ngarlands of those about to fall fade away, fear invadeth their hearts.\r\nThese mighty drawbacks, O Mudgala, extend even to the regions of Brahma.\r\nIn the celestial regions, the virtues of men who have performed righteous\r\nacts, are countless. And, O Muni, this is another of the attributes of\r\nthe fallen that, by reason of their merits, they take birth among men.\r\nAnd then they attain to high fortune and happiness. If one, however,\r\ncannot acquire knowledge here, one cometh by an inferior birth. The\r\nfruits of acts done in this world are reaped in the next. This world, O\r\nBrahmana, hath been declared to be one of acts; the others, as one of\r\nfruit. Thus have I, O Mudgala, asked by thee, described all unto thee.\r\nNow, O pious one, with thy favour, we shall easily set out with speed.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa continued, 'Having heard this speech, Mudgala began to reflect in\r\nhis mind. And having deliberated well, that best of Munis spake thus unto\r\nthe celestial messenger, 'O messenger of the gods, I bow unto thee. Do\r\nthou, O sire, depart in peace. I have nothing to do with either\r\nhappiness, or heaven having such prominent defects. Persons who enjoy\r\nheaven suffer, after all, huge misery and extreme regret in this world.\r\nTherefore, I do not desire heaven. I shall seek for that unfailing region\r\nrepairing whither people have not to lament, or to be pained, or\r\nagitated. Thou hast described unto me these great defects belonging to\r\nthe celestial regions. Do thou now describe unto me a region free from\r\nfaults.' Thereupon the celestial messenger said, 'Above the abode of\r\nBrahma, there is the supreme seat of Vishnu, pure, and eternal, and\r\nluminous known by the name of Para Brahma. Thither, O Brahmana, cannot\r\nrepair persons who are attached to the objects of the senses: nor can\r\nthose subject to arrogance, covetousness, ignorance, anger, and envy, go\r\nto that place. It is only those that are free from affection, and those\r\nfree from pride, and those free from conflicting emotions, and those that\r\nhave restrained their senses, and those given to contemplation and Yoga,\r\nthat can repair thither.' Having heard these words, the Muni bade\r\nfarewell to the celestial messenger, and that virtuous one leading the\r\nUnchha mode of life, assumed perfect contentment. And then praise and\r\ndispraise became equal unto him; and a brickbat, stone, and gold assumed\r\nthe same aspect in his eyes. And availing himself of the means of\r\nattaining Brahma, he became always engaged in meditation. And having\r\nobtained power by means of knowledge, and acquired excellent\r\nunderstanding, he attained that supreme state of emancipation which is\r\nregarded as Eternal. Therefore, thou also, O Kunti's son, ought not to\r\ngrieve. Deprived thou hast truly been of a flourishing kingdom, but thou\r\nwilt regain it by thy ascetic austerities. Misery after happiness, and\r\nhappiness after misery, revolve by turns round a man even like the point\r\nof a wheel's circumference round the axle. After the thirteenth year hath\r\npassed away, thou wilt, O thou of immeasurable might, get back the\r\nkingdom possessed before thee by thy father and grand-father. Therefore,\r\nlet the fever of thy heart depart!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued \"Having said this to Pandu's son, the worshipful\r\nVyasa went back to his hermitage for the purpose of performing\r\nausterities.\""

I ask\r\nthee this. Do thou, worshipful Sir, enlighten me.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"When, O great king, Duryodhana heard that the\r\nPandavas were living as happily in the woods as in a city, he longed,\r\nwith the artful Karna, Dussasana and others, to do them harm. And while\r\nthose evil-minded persons were employed in concerting various wicked\r\ndesigns, the virtuous and celebrated ascetic Durvasa, following the bent\r\nof his own will, arrived at the city of the Kurus with ten thousand\r\ndisciples. And seeing the irascible ascetic arrived, Duryodhana and his\r\nbrothers welcomed him with great humility, self-abasement and gentleness.\r\nAnd himself attending on the Rishi as a menial, the prince gave him a\r\nright worshipful reception. And the illustrious Muni stayed there for a\r\nfew days, while king Duryodhana, watchful of his imprecations, attended\r\non him diligently by day and night. And sometimes the Muni would say, 'I\r\nam hungry, O king, give me some food quickly.' And sometimes he would go\r\nout for a bath and, returning at a late hour, would say, 'I shall not eat\r\nanything today as I have no appetite,' and so saying would disappear from\r\nhis sight. And sometimes, coming all on a sudden, he would say, 'Feed us\r\nquickly.' And at other times, bent on some mischief, he would awake at\r\nmidnight and having caused his meals to be prepared as before, would carp\r\nat them and not partake of them at all. And trying the prince in this way\r\nfor a while, when the Muni found that the king Duryodhana was neither\r\nangered, nor annoyed, he became graciously inclined towards him. And\r\nthen, O Bharata, the intractable Durvasa said unto him, 'I have power to\r\ngrant thee boons. Thou mayst ask of me whatever lies nearest to thy\r\nheart. May good fortune be thine. Pleased as I am with thee, thou mayst\r\nobtain from me anything that is not opposed to religion and morals.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of the great ascetic,\r\nSuyodhana felt himself to be inspired with new life. Indeed, it had been\r\nagreed upon between himself and Karna and Dussasana as to what the boon\r\nshould be that he would ask of the Muni if the latter were pleased with\r\nhis reception. And the evil-minded king, bethinking himself of what had\r\npreviously been decided, joyfully solicited the following favour, saying,\r\n'The great king Yudhishthira is the eldest and the best of our race. That\r\npious man is now living in the forest with his brothers. Do thou,\r\ntherefore, once become the guest of that illustrious one even as, O\r\nBrahmana, thou hast with thy disciples been mine for some time. If thou\r\nart minded to do me a favour, do thou go unto him at a time when that\r\ndelicate and excellent lady, the celebrated princess of Panchala, after\r\nhaving regaled with food the Brahmanas, her husbands and herself, may lie\r\ndown to rest.' The Rishi replied, 'Even so shall I act for thy\r\nsatisfaction.' And having said this to Suyodhana, that great Brahmana,\r\nDurvasa, went away in the very same state in which he had come. And\r\nSuyodhana regarded himself to have attained all the objects of his\r\ndesire. And holding Karna by the hand he expressed great satisfaction.\r\nAnd Karna, too, joyfully addressed the king in the company of his\r\nbrothers, saying, 'By a piece of singular good luck, thou hast fared well\r\nand attained the objects of thy desire. And by good luck it is that thy\r\nenemies have been immersed in a sea of dangers that is difficult to\r\ncross. The sons of Pandu are now exposed to the fire of Durvasa's wrath.\r\nThrough their own fault they have fallen into an abyss of darkness.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"O king, expressing their satisfaction in this\r\nstrain, Duryodhana and others, bent on evil machinations, returned\r\nmerrily to their respective homes.\""

The illustrious and upright king\r\nYudhishthira, seeing that guest arrived, advanced with his mothers to\r\nreceive him. And joining the palms of his hands and pointing to a proper\r\nand excellent seat, he accorded the Rishis a fit and respectful welcome.\r\nAnd the king said unto him, 'Return quick, O adorable sir, after\r\nperforming thy diurnal ablutions and observances.' And that sinless Muni,\r\nnot knowing how the king would be able to provide a feast for him and his\r\ndisciples, proceeded with the latter to perform his ablutions. And that\r\nhost of the Muni, of subdued passions, went into the stream for\r\nperforming their ablutions. Meanwhile, O king, the excellent princess\r\nDraupadi, devoted to her husbands, was in great anxiety about the food\r\n(to be provided for the Munis). And when after much anxious thought she\r\ncame to the conclusion that means there were none for providing a feast,\r\nshe inwardly prayed to Krishna, the slayer of Kansa. And the princess\r\nsaid, 'Krishna, O Krishna, of mighty arms, O son of Devaki, whose power\r\nis inexhaustible, O Vasudeva, O lord of the Universe, who dispellest the\r\ndifficulties of those that bow down to thee, thou art the soul, the\r\ncreator and the destroyer of the Universe.

Thou art\r\nthe supreme light and essence of the Universe! Thy face is directed\r\ntowards every point. They call thee Supreme Germ and the depository of\r\nall treasures. Under thy protections, O lord of the gods, all evils lose\r\ntheir terror. As thou didst protect me before from Dussasana, do thou\r\nextricate me now from this difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"The great and sovereign God, and Lord of the\r\nearth, of mysterious movements, the lord Kesava who is ever kind to the\r\ndependents, thou adored by Krishna, and perceiving her difficulty,\r\ninstantly repaired to that place leaving the bed of Rukmini who was\r\nsleeping by his side. Beholding Vasudeva, Draupadi bowed down to him in\r\ngreat joy and informed him of the arrival of the Munis and every other\r\nthing. And having heard everything Krishna said unto her, 'I am very much\r\nafflicted with hunger, do thou give me some food without delay, and then\r\nthou mayst go about thy work.' At these words of Kesava, Krishna became\r\nconfused, and replied unto him, saying, 'The sun-given vessel remains\r\nfull till I finish my meal. But as I have already taken my meal today,\r\nthere is no food in it now. Then that lotus-eyed and adorable being said\r\nunto Krishna, 'This is no time for jest, O Krishna.--I am much distressed\r\nwith hunger, go thou quickly to fetch the vessel and show it to me.' When\r\nKesava, that ornament of the Yadu's race, had the vessel brought unto\r\nhim,--with such persistence, he looked into it and saw a particle of rice\r\nand vegetable sticking at its rim. And swallowing it he said unto her,\r\n'May it please the god Hari, the soul of the Universe, and may that god\r\nwho partaketh at sacrifices, be satiated with this.' Then the long-armed\r\nKrishna, that soother of miseries, said unto Bhimasena, 'Do thou speedily\r\ninvite the Munis to dinner. Then, O good king, the celebrated Bhimasena\r\nquickly went to invite all those Munis, Durvasa and others, who had gone\r\nto the nearest stream of transparent and cool water to perform their\r\nablutions. Meanwhile, these ascetics, having plunged into the river, were\r\nrubbing their bodies and observing that they all felt their stomachs to\r\nbe full. And coming out of the stream, they began to stare at one\r\nanother. And turning towards Durvasa, all those ascetics observed,\r\n'Having bade the king make our meals ready, we have come hither for a\r\nbath. But how, O regenerate Rishi, can we eat anything now, for our\r\nstomachs seem to be full to the throat. The repast hath been uselessly\r\nprepared for us. What is the best thing to be done now?' Durvasa replied,\r\n'By spoiling the repast, we have done a great wrong to that royal sage,\r\nking Yudhishthira. Would not the Pandavas destroy us by looking down upon\r\nus with angry eyes? I know the royal sage Yudhishthira to be possessed of\r\ngreat ascetic power. Ye Brahmanas, I am afraid of men that are devoted to\r\nHari. The high-souled Pandavas are all religious men, learned, war-like,\r\ndiligent in ascetic austerities and religious observances, devoted to\r\nVasudeva, and always observant of rules of good conduct. If provoked,\r\nthey can consume us with their wrath as fire doth a bale of cotton.\r\nTherefore, ye disciples, do ye all run away quickly without seeing them\r\n(again)!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"All those Brahmanas, thus advised by their\r\nascetic preceptor, became greatly afraid of the Pandavas and fled away in\r\nall directions. Then Bhimasena not beholding those excellent Munis in the\r\ncelestial river, made a search after them here and there at all the\r\nlanding places. And learning from the ascetics of those places that they\r\nhad run away, he came back and informed Yudhishthira of what had\r\nhappened. Then all the Pandavas of subdued senses, expecting them to\r\ncome, remained awaiting their arrival for some time. And Yudhishthira\r\nsaid, 'Coming dead of night the Rishis will deceive us. Oh how, can we\r\nescape from this difficulty created by the facts?' Seeing them absorbed\r\nin such reflections and breathing long deep sighs at frequent intervals,\r\nthe illustrious Krishna suddenly appeared to them and addressed them\r\nthese words: 'Knowing, ye sons of Pritha, your danger from that wrathful\r\nRishi, I was implored by Draupadi to come, and (therefore) have I come\r\nhere speedily. But now ye have not the least fear from the Rishi Durvasa.\r\nAfraid of your ascetic powers, he hath made himself scarce ere this.\r\nVirtuous men never suffer. I now ask your permission to let me return\r\nhome. May you always be prosperous!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Hearing Kesava's words, the sons of Pritha, with\r\nDraupadi, became easy in mind. And cured of their fever (of anxiety),\r\nthey said unto him, 'As persons drowning in the wide ocean safely reach\r\nthe shore by means of a boat, so have we, by thy aid, O lord Govinda,\r\nescaped from this inextricable difficulty. Do thou now depart in peace,\r\nand may prosperity be thine.' Thus dismissed, he repaired to his capital\r\nand the Pandavas too, O blessed lord, wandering from forest to forest\r\npassed their days merrily with Draupadi. Thus, O king, have I related to\r\nthee the story which thou askedest me to repeat. And it was thus that the\r\nmachinations of the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra about the Pandavas in\r\nthe forest, were frustrated.\""

And the\r\nsons of Pandu, each like unto Indra and the terror of his enemies, dwelt\r\nthere for some time. And one day those valiant men, the conquerors of\r\ntheir foes, went about in all directions in search of game for feeding\r\nthe Brahmanas in their company, leaving Draupadi alone at the hermitage,\r\nwith the permission of the great ascetic Trinavindu, resplendent with\r\nascetic grandeur, and of their spiritual guide Dhaumya. Meanwhile, the\r\nfamous king of Sindhu, the son of Vriddhakshatra was, with a view to\r\nmatrimony, proceeding to the kingdom of Salwa, dressed in his best royal\r\napparel and accompanied by numerous princes. And the prince halted in the\r\nwoods of Kamyaka. And in that secluded place, he found the beautiful\r\nDraupadi, the beloved and celebrated wife of the Pandavas, standing at\r\nthe threshold of the hermitage. And she looked grand in the superb beauty\r\nof her form, and seemed to shed a lustre on the woodland around, like\r\nlightning illuminating masses of dark clouds. And they who saw her asked\r\nthemselves, 'Is this an Apsara, or a daughter of the gods, or a celestial\r\nphantom?' And with this thought, their hands also joined together. They\r\nstood gazing on the perfect and faultless beauty of her form. And\r\nJayadratha, the king of Sindhu, and the son of Vriddhakshatra, struck\r\nwith amazement at the sight of that lady of faultless beauty, was seized\r\nwith an evil intention. And inflamed with desire, he said to the prince\r\nnamed Kotika, 'Whose is this lady of faultless form? Is she of the human\r\nkind? I have no need to marry if I can secure this exquisitely beautiful\r\ncreature. Taking her with me, I shall go back to my abode, Oh sir, and\r\nenquire who she is and whence she has come and why also that delicate\r\nbeing hath come into this forest beset with thorns. Will this ornament of\r\nwomankind, this slender-waisted lady of so much beauty, endued with\r\nhandsome teeth and large eyes, accept me as her lord? I shall certainly\r\nregard myself successful, if I obtain the hand of this excellent lady.\r\nGo, Kotika, and enquire who her husband may be.' Thus asked, Kotika,\r\nwearing a kundala, jumped out of his chariot and came near her, as a\r\njackal approacheth a tigress, and spake unto her these words.'\""

O Sauvira, good\r\nmen never speak ill of learned persons devoted to austerities and endued\r\nwith learning, no matter whether they live in the wilderness or in\r\nhouses. It is only wretches that are mean as thou who do so. Methinks\r\nthere is none in this assemblage of Kshatriya, who is capable of holding\r\nthee by the hand to save thee from falling into the pit thou openest\r\nunder thy feet. In hoping to vanquish king Yudhishthira the just, thou\r\nreally hopest to separate, stick in hand, from a herd roaming in\r\nHimalayan valleys, its leader, huge as a mountain peak and with the\r\ntemporal juice trickling down its rent temples. Out of childish folly\r\nthou art kicking up into wakefulness the powerful lion lying asleep, in\r\norder to pluck the hair from off his face! Thou shalt, however, have to\r\nrun away when thou seest Bhimasena in wrath! Thy courting a combat with\r\nthe furious Jishnu may be likened to thy kicking up a mighty, terrible,\r\nfull-grown and furious lion asleep in a mountain cave. The encounter thou\r\nspeakest of with those two excellent youths--the younger Pandavas--is\r\nlike unto the act of a fool that wantonly trampleth on the tails of two\r\nvenomous black cobras with bifurcated tongues. The bamboo, the reed, and\r\nthe plantain bear fruit only to perish and not to grow in size any\r\nfurther.

We, too, O Krishna, belong by birth to the seventeen high\r\nclans, and are endowed with the six royal qualities.[89] We, therefore,\r\nlook down upon the Pandavas as inferior men! Therefore, do thou, O\r\ndaughter of Drupada, ride this elephant or this chariot quickly, for thou\r\ncanst not baffle us with thy words alone; or, speaking less boastfully,\r\nseek thou the mercy of the king of the Sauviras!'\r\n\r\nDraupadi replied, \"Though I am so powerful, why doth the king of Sauvira\r\nyet consider me so powerless. Well-known as I am, I cannot, from fear of\r\nviolence, demean myself before that prince. Even Indra himself cannot\r\nabduct her for whose protection Krishna and Arjuna would together follow,\r\nriding in the same chariot. What shall I say, therefore, of a weak human\r\nbeing. When Kiriti, that slayer of foes, riding on his car, will, on my\r\naccount, enter thy ranks, striking terror into every heart, he will\r\nconsume everything around like fire consuming a stack of dry grass in\r\nsummer.

And\r\nwhen thou wilt behold Arjuna shooting from the Gandiva a thick mass of\r\nmighty arrows like unto a flight of locusts, then wilt thou repent of\r\nthine own folly! Bethink thyself of what thou wilt feel when that warrior\r\narmed with the Gandiva, blowing his conch-shell and with gloves\r\nreverberating with the strokes of his bowstring will again and again\r\npierce thy breast with his shafts. And when Bhima will advance towards\r\nthee, mace in hand and the two sons of Madri range in all directions,\r\nvomiting forth the venom of their wrath, thou wilt then experience pangs\r\nof keen regret that will last for ever. As I have never been false to my\r\nworthy lords even in thought, so by that merit shall I now have the\r\npleasure of beholding thee vanquished and dragged by the sons of Pritha.\r\nThou canst not, cruel as thou art, frighten me by seizing me with\r\nviolence, for as soon as those Kuru warriors will espy me they will bring\r\nme back to the woods of Kamyaka.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Then that lady of large eyes, beholding them\r\nready to lay violent hands on her, rebuked them and said, 'Defile me not\r\nby your touch!'

O, take care that the Soma juice of a sacrifice is\r\nnot licked up by a dog through the carelessness of the officiating\r\npriests!

With a complexion like that of\r\npure gold, possessed of a prominent nose and large eyes, and endued with\r\na slender make, that husband of mine is known among people by the name of\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma and the foremost of the Kuru race. That\r\nvirtuous prince of men granteth life to even a foe that yields.\r\nTherefore, O fool, throwing down thy arms and joining thy hands, run to\r\nhim for thy good, to seek his protection. And that other man whom thou\r\nseest with long arms and tall as the full-grown Sala tree, seated on his\r\nchariot, biting his lips, and contracting his forehead so as to bring the\r\ntwo eye-brows together, is he,--my husband Vrikodara! Steeds of the\r\nnoblest breed, plump and strong, well-trained and endued with great\r\nmight, draw the cars of that warrior! His achievements are superhuman. He\r\nis known, therefore, by the name of Bhima on earth. They that offend him\r\nare never suffered to live. He never forgetteth a foe. On some pretext or\r\nother he wrecketh his vengeance. Nor is he pacified even after he has\r\nwrecked a signal vengeance. And there, that foremost of bowmen, endued\r\nwith intelligence and renown, with senses under complete control and\r\nreverence for the old--that brother and disciple of Yudhishthira--is my\r\nhusband Dhananjaya! Virtue he never forsaketh, from lust or fear or\r\nanger! Nor doth he ever commit a deed that is cruel. Endued with the\r\nenergy of fire and capable of withstanding every foe, that grinder of\r\nenemies is the son of Kunti. And that other youth, versed in every\r\nquestion of morality and profit, who ever dispelleth the fears of the\r\naffrighted, who is endued with high wisdom, who is considered as the\r\nhandsomest person in the whole world and who is protected by all the sons\r\nof Pandu, being regarded by them as dearer to them than their own lives\r\nfor his unflinching devotion to them, is my husband Nakula possessed of\r\ngreat prowess. Endued with high wisdom and having Sahadeva for his\r\nsecond, possessed of exceeding lightness of hand, he fighteth with the\r\nsword, making dexterous passes therewith. Thou, foolish man, shall\r\nwitness today his performances on the field of battle, like unto those of\r\nIndra amid the ranks of Daityas! And that hero skilled in weapons and\r\npossessed of intelligence and wisdom, and intent on doing what is\r\nagreeable to the son of Dharma, that favourite and youngest born of the\r\nPandavas, is my husband Sahadeva! Heroic, intelligent, wise and ever\r\nwrathful there is not another man equal unto him in intelligence or in\r\neloquence amid assemblies of the wise. Dearer to Kunti than her own soul,\r\nhe is always mindful of the duties of Kshatriyas, and would much sooner\r\nrush into fire or sacrifice his own life than say anything that is\r\nopposed to religion and morals. When the sons of Pandu will have killed\r\nthy warriors in battle, then wilt thou behold thy army in the miserable\r\nplight of a ship on the sea wrecked with its freight of jewels on the\r\nback of a whale. Thus have I described unto thee the prowess of the sons\r\nof Pandu, disregarding whom in thy foolishness, thou hast acted so. If\r\nthou escapest unscathed from them, then, indeed thou wilt have obtained a\r\nnew lease of life.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Then those five sons of Pritha, each like unto\r\nIndra, filled with wrath, leaving the panic-stricken infantry alone who\r\nwere imploring them for mercy, rushed furiously upon the charioteers,\r\nattacking them on all sides and darkening the very air with the thick\r\nshower of arrows they shot.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said, \"Meanwhile, the king of Sindhu was giving orders to\r\nthose princes, saying, 'Halt, strike, march, quick', and like. And on\r\nseeing Bhima, Arjuna and the twin brothers with Yudhishthira, the\r\nsoldiers sent up a loud shout on the field of battle. And the warriors of\r\nthe Sivi, Sauvira and Sindhu tribes, at the sight of those powerful\r\nheroes looking like fierce tigers, lost heart. And Bhimasena, armed with\r\na mace entirely of Saikya iron and embossed with gold, rushed towards the\r\nSaindhava monarch doomed to death. But Kotikakhya, speedily surrounding\r\nVrikodara with an array of mighty charioteers, interposed between and\r\nseparated the combatants. And Bhima, though assailed with numberless\r\nspears and clubs and iron arrows hurled at him by the strong arms of\r\nhostile heroes, did not waver for one moment. On the other hand, he\r\nkilled, with his mace, an elephant with its driver and fourteen\r\nfoot-soldiers fighting in the front of Jayadratha's car. And Arjuna also,\r\ndesirous of capturing the Sauvira king, slew five hundred brave\r\nmountaineers fighting in the van of the Sindhu army. And in that\r\nencounter, the king himself slew in the twinkling of an eye, a hundred of\r\nthe best warriors of the Sauviras. And Nakula too, sword in hand, jumping\r\nout of his chariot, scattered in a moment, like a tiller sowing seeds,\r\nthe heads of the combatants fighting in the rear. And Sahadeva from his\r\nchariot began to fell with his iron shafts, many warriors fighting on\r\nelephants, like birds dropped from the boughs of a tree. Then the king of\r\nTrigartas, bow in hand descending from his great chariot, killed the four\r\nsteeds of the king with his mace. But Kunti's son, king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, seeing the foe approach so near, and fighting on foot, pierced his\r\nbreast with a crescent-shaped arrow. And that hero, thus wounded in the\r\nbreast began to vomit blood, and fell down upon the ground besides\r\nPritha's son, like an uprooted tree. And king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nwhose steeds had been slain taking this opportunity, descended with\r\nIndrasena from his chariot and mounted that of Sahadeva. And the two\r\nwarriors, Kshemankara and Mahamuksha, singling out Nakula, began to pour\r\non him from both sides a perfect shower of keen-edged arrows. The son of\r\nMadri, however, succeeded in slaying, with a couple of long shafts, both\r\nthose warriors who had been pouring on him an arrowy shower--like clouds\r\nin the rainy season. Suratha, the king of Trigartas, well-versed in\r\nelephant-charges, approaching the front of Nakula's chariot, caused it to\r\nbe dragged by the elephant he rode. But Nakula, little daunted at this,\r\nleaped out of his chariot, and securing a point of vantage, stood shield\r\nand sword in hand, immovable as a hill. Thereupon Suratha, wishing to\r\nslay Nakula at once, urged towards him his huge and infuriate elephant\r\nwith trunk upraised. But when the beast came near, Nakula with his sword\r\nsevered from his head both trunk and tusks. And that mail-clad elephant,\r\nuttering a frightful roar, fell headlong upon the ground, crushing its\r\nriders by the fall. And having achieved this daring feat, heroic son of\r\nMadri, getting up on Bhimasena's car, obtained a little rest. And Bhima\r\ntoo, seeing prince Kotikakhya rush to the encounter, cut off the head of\r\nhis charioteer with a horse-shoe arrow. That prince did not even perceive\r\nthat his driver was killed by his strong-armed adversary, and his horses,\r\nno longer restrained by a driver, ran about on the battle-field in all\r\ndirections. And seeing that prince without a driver turn his back, that\r\nforemost of smiters, Bhima the son of Pandu, went up to him and slew him\r\nwith a bearded dart. And Dhananjaya also cut off with his sharp\r\ncrescent-shaped arrows, the heads, as well as the bows of all the twelve\r\nSauvira heroes. And the great warrior killed in battle, with the arrow,\r\nthe leaders of the Ikshwakus and the hosts of Sivis and Trigartas and\r\nSaindhavas. And a great many elephants with their colours, and chariots\r\nwith standards, were seen to fall by the hand of Arjuna. And heads\r\nwithout trunks, and trunks without heads, lay covering the entire field\r\nof battle. And dogs, and herons and ravens, and crows, and falcons, and\r\njackals, and vultures, feasted on the flesh and blood of warriors slain\r\non that field. And when Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu, saw that his\r\nwarriors were slain, he became terrified and anxious to run away leaving\r\nKrishna behind. And in that general confusion, the wretch, setting down\r\nDraupadi there, fled for his life, pursuing the same forest path by which\r\nhe had come. And king Yudhishthira the just, seeing Draupadi with Dhaumya\r\nwalking before, caused her to be taken up on a chariot by the heroic\r\nSahadeva, the son of Madri. And when Jayadratha had fled away Bhima began\r\nto mow down with his iron-arrows such of his followers as were running\r\naway striking each trooper down after naming him. But Arjuna perceiving\r\nthat Jayadratha had run away exhorted his brother to refrain from\r\nslaughtering the remnant of the Saindhava host. And Arjuna said, 'I do\r\nnot find on the field of battle Jayadratha through whose fault alone we\r\nhave experienced this bitter misfortune! Seek him out first and may\r\nsuccess crown thy effort! What is the good of thy slaughtering these\r\ntroopers? Why art thou bent upon this unprofitable business?'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Bhimasena, thus exhorted by Arjuna of great\r\nwisdom, turning to Yudhishthira, replied, saying, 'As a great many of the\r\nenemy's warriors have been slain and as they are flying in all\r\ndirections, do thou, O king, now return home, taking with thee Draupadi\r\nand the twin brothers and high-souled Dhaumya, and console the princess\r\nafter getting back to our asylum! That foolish king of Sindhu I shall not\r\nlet alone as long as he lives, even if he find a shelter in the internal\r\nregions or is backed by Indra himself! And Yudhishthira replied, saying,\r\n'O thou of mighty arms remembering (our sister) Dussala and the\r\ncelebrated Gandhari, thou shouldst not slay the king of Sindhu even\r\nthough he is so wicked!'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words, Draupadi was greatly\r\nexcited. And that highly intelligent lady in her excitement said to her\r\ntwo husbands, Bhima and Arjuna with indignation mixed with modesty, 'If\r\nyou care to do what is agreeable to me, you must slay that mean and\r\ndespicable wretch, that sinful, foolish, infamous and contemptible chief\r\nof the Saindhava clan! That foe who forcibly carries away a wife, and he\r\nthat wrests a kingdom, should never be forgiven on the battle-field, even\r\nthough he should supplicate for mercy!' Thus admonished, those two\r\nvaliant warriors went in search of the Saindhava chief. And the king\r\ntaking Krishna with him returned home, accompanied by his spiritual\r\nadviser. And on entering the hermitage, he found it was laid over with\r\nseats for the ascetics and crowded with their disciples and graced with\r\nthe presence of Markandeya and other Brahmanas. And while those Brahmanas\r\nwere gravely bewailing the lot of Draupadi, Yudhishthira endued with\r\ngreat wisdom joined their company, with his brothers. And beholding the\r\nking thus come back after having defeated the Saindhava and the Sauvira\r\nhost and recovered Draupadi, they were all elated with joy! And the king\r\ntook his seat in their midst. And the excellent princess Krishna entered\r\nthe hermitage with the two brothers.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile Bhima and Arjuna, learning the enemy was full two miles ahead\r\nof them urged their horses to greater speed in pursuit of him. And the\r\nmighty Arjuna performed a wonderful deed, killing the horse of Jayadratha\r\nalthough they were full two miles ahead of them. Armed with celestial\r\nweapons undaunted by difficulties he achieved this difficult feat with\r\narrows inspired with Mantras. And then the two warriors, Bhima and\r\nArjuna, rushed towards the terrified king of Sindhu whose horses had been\r\nslain and who was alone and perplexed in mind. And the latter was greatly\r\ngrieved on seeing his steeds slain. And beholding Dhananjaya do such a\r\ndaring deed, and intent on running away, he followed the same forest\r\ntrack by which he had come. And Falguna, seeing the Saindhava chief so\r\nactive in his fright, overtook him and addressed him saying, 'Possessed\r\nof so little manliness, how couldst thou dare to take away a lady by\r\nforce? Turn round, O prince; it is not meet that thou shouldst run away!\r\nHow canst thou act so, leaving thy followers in the midst of thy foes?'\r\nAlthough addressed by the sons of Pritha thus, the monarch of Sindhu did\r\nnot even once turn round. And then bidding him to what he chose the\r\nmighty Bhima overtook him in an instant, but the kind Arjuna entreated\r\nhim not to kill that wretch.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said, \"Jayadratha flying for his life upon beholding those\r\ntwo brothers with upraised arms, was sorely grieved and bolted off with\r\nspeed and coolness. But the mighty and indignant Bhimasena, descending\r\nfrom his chariot, ran after him thus fleeing, and seized him by the hair\r\nof his head. And holding him high up in the air, Bhima thrust him on the\r\nground with violence. And seizing the prince by the head, he knocked him\r\nabout. And when the wretch recovered consciousness, he groaned aloud and\r\nwanted to get up on his legs. But that hero endued with mighty arms\r\nkicked him on the head. And Bhima pressed him on the breast with his\r\nknees as well as with his fists. And the prince thus belaboured, soon\r\nbecame insensible. Then Falguna dissuaded the wrathful Bhimasena from\r\ninflicting further chastisement on the prince, by reminding him of what\r\nYudhishthira had said regarding (their sister) Dussala. But Bhima\r\nreplied, saying, 'This sinful wretch hath done a cruel injury to Krishna,\r\nwho never can bear such treatment. He, therefore, deserveth to die at\r\nhands! But what can I do? The king is always overflowing with mercy, and\r\nthou, too, art constantly putting obstacles in my way from a childish\r\nsense of virtue!' Having said these words, Vrikodara, with his\r\ncrescent-shaped arrow, shaved the hair of the prince's head, heaving five\r\ntufts in as many places. Jayadratha uttered not a word at this. Then\r\nVrikodara, addressing the foe said, 'If thou wishest to live, listen to\r\nme. O fool! I shall tell thee the means to attain that wish! In public\r\nassemblies and in open courts thou must say,--I am the slave of the\r\nPandavas.--on this condition alone, I will pardon thee thy life! This is\r\nthe customary rule of conquest on the field of battle.' Thus addressed\r\nand treated, king Jayadratha said to the mighty and fierce warrior who\r\nalways looked awful, 'Be it so!' And he was trembling and senseless and\r\nbegrimed with dust. Then Arjuna and Vrikodara, securing him with chains,\r\nthrust him into a chariot. And Bhima, himself mounting that chariot, and\r\naccompanied by Arjuna, drove towards the hermitage. And approaching\r\nYudhishthira seated there, he placed Jayadratha in that condition before\r\nthe king. And the king, smiling, told him to set the Sindhu prince at\r\nliberty. Then Bhima said unto the king, 'Do thou tell Draupadi that this\r\nwretch hath become the slave of the Pandavas.' Then his eldest brother\r\nsaid unto him affectionately, 'If thou hast any regard for us, do thou\r\nset this wretch at liberty!' And Draupadi too, reading the king's mind,\r\nsaid, 'Let him off! He hath become a slave of the king's and thou, too,\r\nhast disfigured him by leaving five tufts of hair on his head.' Then that\r\ncrest-fallen prince, having obtained his liberty, approached king\r\nYudhishthira and bowed down unto him. And seeing those Munis there, he\r\nsaluted them also. Then the kind-hearted king Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nDharma, beholding Jayadratha in that condition, almost supported by\r\nArjuna, said unto him, 'Thou art a free man now; I emancipate thee! Now\r\ngo away and be careful not to do such thing again; shame to thee! Thou\r\nhadst intended to take away a lady by violence, even though thou art so\r\nmean and powerless! What other wretch save thee would think of acting\r\nthus?\" Then that foremost king of Bharata's race eyed with pity that\r\nperpetrator of wicked deeds, and believing that he had lost his senses,\r\nsaid, 'Mayst thy heart grow in virtue! Never set thy heart again on\r\nimmoral deeds! Thou mayst depart in peace now with thy charioteers,\r\ncavalry and infantry.' Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the prince, O\r\nBharata, was overpowered with shame, and bending down his head, he\r\nsilently and sorrowfully wended his way to the place where the Ganga\r\ndebouches on the plains. And imploring the protection of the god of three\r\neyes, the consort of Uma, he did severe penance at that place. And the\r\nthree-eyed god, pleased with his austerities deigned to accept his\r\nofferings in person. And he also granted him a boon! Do thou listen, O\r\nmonarch, how the prince received that boon! Jayadratha, addressing that\r\ngod, asked the boon, 'May I be able to defeat in battle all the five sons\r\nof Pandu on their chariots!' The god, however, told him 'This cannot be.'\r\nAnd Maheswara said, 'None can slay or conquer them in battle. Save\r\nArjuna, however, thou shall be able to only check them (once) on the\r\nfield of battle! The heroic Arjuna, with mighty arms, is the god\r\nincarnate styled Nara. He practised austerities of old in the Vadari\r\nforest. The God Narayana is his friend. Therefore, he is unconquerable of\r\nthe very gods. I myself have given him the celestial weapon called\r\nPasupata. From the regents also of all the ten cardinal points, he has\r\nacquired the thunder-bolt and other mighty weapons. And the great god\r\nVishnu who is the Infinite Spirit, the Lord Preceptor of all the gods, is\r\nthe Supreme Being without attributes, and the Soul of the Universe, and\r\nexisteth pervading the whole creation. At the termination of a cycle of\r\nages, assuming the shape of the all-consuming fire, he consumed the whole\r\nUniverse with mountains and seas and islands and hills and woods and\r\nforests. And after the destruction of the Naga world also in the\r\nsubterranean regions in the same way, vast masses of many-coloured and\r\nloud-pealing clouds, with streaks of lightning, spreading along the\r\nentire welkin, had appeared on high. Then pouring down water in torrents\r\nthick as axles of cars, and filling the space everywhere, these\r\nextinguishing that all-consuming fire! When at the close of four thousand\r\nYugas the Earth thus became flooded with water, like one vast sea, and\r\nall mobile creatures were hushed in death, and the sun and the moon and\r\nthe winds were all destroyed, and the Universe was devoid of planets and\r\nstars, the Supreme Being called Narayana, unknowable by the senses,\r\nadorned with a thousand heads and as many eyes and legs, became desirous\r\nof rest. And the serpent Sesha, looking terrible with his thousand hoods,\r\nand shining with the splendour of ten thousand suns, and white as the\r\nKunda flower or the moon or a string of pearls, or the white lotus, or\r\nmilk, or the fibres of a lotus stalk, served for his conch. And that\r\nadorable and omnipotent God thus slept on the bosom of the deep,\r\nenveloping all space with nocturnal gloom. And when his creative faculty\r\nwas excited, he awoke and found the Universe denuded of everything. In\r\nthis connection, the following sloka is recited respecting the meaning of\r\nNarayana. \"Water was created by (the Rishi) Nara, and it formed his\r\ncorpus; therefore do we hear it styled as Nara. And because it formed his\r\nAyana (resting-place) therefore is he known as Narayana.\" As soon as that\r\neverlasting Being was engaged in meditation for the re-creation of the\r\nUniverse, a lotus flower instantaneously came into existence from his\r\nnavel, and the four-faced Brahma came out of that navel-lotus. And then\r\nthe Grandsire of all creatures, seating himself on that flower and\r\nfinding that the whole Universe was a blank, created in his own likeness,\r\nand from his will, the (nine) great Rishis, Marichi and others. And these\r\nin their turn observing the same thing, completed the creation, by\r\ncreating Yakshas, Rakshas, Pisachas, reptiles, men, and all mobile and\r\nimmobile creatures. The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form\r\nof Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the\r\nPreserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!\r\nO king of Sindhu, hast thou not heard of the wonderful achievements of\r\nVishnu, described to thee by the Munis and the Brahmanas learned in the\r\nVedas? When the world was thus reduced to one vast sea of water, with\r\nonly the heavens above, the Lord, like a fire-fly at night-time during\r\nthe rainy season, moved about hither and thither in search of stable\r\nground, with the view of rehabilitating his creation, and became desirous\r\nof raising the Earth submerged in water. What shape shall I take to\r\nrescue the Earth from this flood?--So thinking and contemplating with\r\ndivine insight, he bethought himself of the shape of a wild boar fond of\r\nsporting in water. And assuming the shape of a sacrificial boar shining\r\nwith effulgence and instinct with the Vedas and ten Yojanas in length,\r\nwith pointed tusks and a complexion like dark clouds, and with a body\r\nhuge as a mountain, and roaring like a conglomeration of clouds, the Lord\r\nplunged into the waters, and lifted up the Earth with one of his tusks,\r\nand replaced it in its proper sphere. At another time, the mighty Lord,\r\nassuming a wonderful form with a body half lion, half man, and squeezing\r\nhis hands, repaired to the court of the ruler of the Daityas. That\r\nprogenitor of the Daityas, the son of Diti, who was the enemy of the\r\n(gods), beholding the Lord's peculiar form, burst out into passion and\r\nhis eyes became inflamed with rage. And Hiranya-Kasipu, the war-like son\r\nof Diti and the enemy of the gods, adorned with garlands and looking like\r\na mass of dark clouds, taking up his trident in hand and roaring like the\r\nclouds, rushed on that being half lion, half man. Then that powerful king\r\nof wild beasts, half man, half lion, taking a leap in the air, instantly\r\nrent the Daitya in twain by means of his sharp claws. And the adorable\r\nlotus-eyed Lord of great effulgence, having thus slain the Daitya king\r\nfor the well-being of all creatures, again took his birth in the womb of\r\nAditi as son of Kasyapa. And at the expiration of a thousand years she\r\nwas delivered of that superhuman conception. And then was born that\r\nBeing, of the hue of rain-charged clouds with bright eyes and of dwarfish\r\nstature. He had the ascetic's staff and water-pot in hand, and was marked\r\nwith the emblem of a curl of hair on the breast. And that adorable Being\r\nwore matted locks and the sacrificial thread, and he was stout and\r\nhandsome and resplendent with lustre. And that Being, arriving at the\r\nsacrificial enclosure of Vali, king of the Danavas, entered the\r\nsacrificial assembly with the aid of Vrihaspati. And beholding that\r\ndwarf-bodied Being, Vali was well-pleased and said unto him, 'I am glad\r\nto see thee, O Brahmana! Say what is it that thou wantest from me!' Thus\r\naddressed by Vali, the dwarf-god replied with a smile, saying, 'So be it!\r\nDo thou, lord of the Danavas, give me three paces of ground!' And Vali\r\ncontented to give what that Brahmana of infinite power had asked. And\r\nwhile measuring with his paces the space he sought. Hari assumed a\r\nwonderful and extraordinary form. And with only three paces he instantly\r\ncovered this illimitable world. And then that everlasting God, Vishnu,\r\ngave it away unto Indra. This history which has just been related to\r\nthee, is celebrated as the 'Incarnation of the Dwarf', And from him, all\r\nthe gods had their being, and after him the world is said to be\r\nVaishnava, or pervaded by Vishnu. And for the destruction of the wicked\r\nand the preservation of religion, even He hath taken his birth among men\r\nin the race of the Yadus. And the adorable Vishnu is styled Krishna.\r\nThese, O king of Sindhu, are the achievements of the Lord whom all the\r\nworlds worship and whom the learned describe as without beginning and\r\nwithout end, unborn and Divine! They call Him, the unconquerable Krishna\r\nwith conchshell, discus and mace, and adorned with the emblem of a curl\r\nof hair, Divine, clad in silken robes of yellow hue, and the best of\r\nthose versed in the art of war. Arjuna is protected by Krishna the\r\npossessor of these attributes. That glorious and lotus-eyed Being of\r\ninfinite power, that slayer of hostile heroes, riding in the same chariot\r\nwith Pritha's son, protecteth him! He is, therefore, invincible; the very\r\ngods cannot resist his power, still less can one with human attributes\r\nvanquish the son of Pritha in battle! Therefore, O king, thou must let\r\nhim alone! Thou shalt, however, be able to vanquish for a single day\r\nonly, the rest of Yudhishthira's forces along with thine enemies--the\r\nfour sons of Pandu!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having said these words unto that prince, the\r\nadorable Hara of three eyes, the destroyer of all sins, the consort of\r\nUma, and lord of wild beasts, the destroyer of (Daksha's) sacrifice, the\r\nslayer of Tripura and He that had plucked out the eyes of Bhaga,\r\nsurrounded by his dwarfish and hunch-backed and terrible followers having\r\nfrightful eyes and ears and uplifted arms, vanished, O tiger among kings,\r\nfrom that place with his consort Uma! And the wicked Jayadratha also\r\nreturned home, and the sons of Pandu continued to dwell in the forest of\r\nKamyaka.\""

And among those foremost of ascetics who were expressing their\r\ngrief upon bearing Draupadi's misfortune, Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu,\r\naddressed Markandeya, saying, 'O adorable Sire, amongst the gods and the\r\nascetics, thou art known to have the fullest knowledge of both the past\r\nas well as; the future.

The daughter of Drupada hath never committed any sinful act, nor,\r\nhath she done anything that is not commendable: on the contrary, she hath\r\nassiduously practised the highest virtues towards Brahmanas. And yet the\r\nfoolish king Jayadratha had carried her away by force. In consequence of\r\nthis act of violence on her, that sinful wretch hath his hair shaved off\r\nhis head and sustained also, with all his allies, defeat in battle. It is\r\ntrue we have rescued her after slaughtering the troops of Sindhu. But the\r\ndisgrace of this ravishment of our wife during our hours of carelessness,\r\nhath stained us, to be sure.

Indeed, Rama,\r\nwith the help of Sugriva, brought her back, constructing a bridge across\r\nthe sea, and consuming Lanka with his keen-edged arrows.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'In what race was Rama born and what was the measure\r\nof his might and prowess? Whose son also was Ravana and for what was it\r\nthat he had any misunderstanding with Rama? It behoveth thee, O\r\nillustrious one, to tell me all this in detail; for I long to hear the\r\nstory of Rama of great achievements!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'Listen, O prince of Bharata's race, to this old\r\nhistory exactly as it happened! I will tell thee all about the distress\r\nsuffered by Rama together with his wife. There was a great king named Aja\r\nsprung from me race of Ikshwaku. He had a son named Dasaratha who was\r\ndevoted to the study of the Vedas and was ever pure. And Dasaratha had\r\nfour sons conversant with morality and profit known by the names,\r\nrespectively, of Rama, Lakshmana, Satrughna, and the mighty Bharata. And\r\nRama had for his mother Kausalya, and Bharata had for his mother Kaikeyi,\r\nwhile those scourge of their enemies Lakshmana and Satrughna were the\r\nsons of Sumitra. And Janaka was the king of Videha, and Sita was his\r\ndaughter. And Tashtri himself created her, desiring to make her the\r\nbeloved wife of Rama. I have now told thee the history of both Rama's and\r\nSita's birth. And now, O king, I will relate unto thee birth of Ravana.\r\nThat Lord of all creatures and the Creator of the Universe viz., the\r\nSelf-create Prajapati himself--that god possessed of great ascetic\r\nmerit--is the grandfather of Ravana. And Pulastya hath a mighty son\r\ncalled Vaisravana begotten of a cow. But his son, leaving his father,\r\nwent to his grandfather. And, O king, angered at this, his father then\r\ncreated a second self of himself. And with half of his own self that\r\nregenerate one became born of Visrava for wrecking a vengeance on\r\nVaisravana. But the Grandsire, pleased with Vaisravana, gave him\r\nimmortality, and sovereignty of all the wealth of the Universe, the\r\nguardianship of one of the cardinal points, the friendship of Isana, and\r\na son named Nalakuvera. And he also gave him for his capital Lanka, which\r\nwas guarded by hosts of Rakshasas, and also a chariot called Pushpaka\r\ncapable of going everywhere according to the will of the rider. And the\r\nkingship of the Yakshas and the sovereignty over sovereigns were also\r\nhis.'\""

But, O monarch, Kuvera, the king of the Rakshasas, knowing\r\nthat his father was angry with him, always sought to please him. And, O\r\nbest of Bharata's race, that king of kings living in Lanka, and borne\r\nupon the shoulders of men, sent three Rakshasa women to wait upon his\r\nfather. Their names, O king, were Pushpotkata, Raka and Malini. And they\r\nwere skilled in singing and dancing and were always assiduous in their\r\nattentions on that high-souled Rishi. And those slender-waisted ladies\r\nvied with one another, O king, in gratifying the Rishi. And that\r\nhigh-souled and adorable being was pleased with them and granted them\r\nboons. And to every one of them he gave princely sons according to their\r\ndesire. Two sons--those foremost of Rakshasas named Kumvakarna and the\r\nTen-headed Ravana,--both unequalled on earth in prowess, were born to\r\nPushpotkata. And Malini had a son named Vibhishana, and Raka had twin\r\nchildren named Khara and Surpanakha. And Vibhishana surpassed them all in\r\nbeauty. And that excellent person was very pious and assiduously\r\nperformed all religious rites. But that foremost of Rakshasas, with ten\r\nheads, was the eldest to them all. And he was religious, and energetic\r\nand possessed of great strength and prowess. And the Rakshasa Kumvakarna\r\nwas the most powerful in battle, for he was fierce and terrible and a\r\nthorough master of the arts of illusion. And Khara was proficient in\r\narchery, and hostile to the Brahmanas, subsisting as he did on flesh. And\r\nthe fierce Surpanakha was constant source of trouble to the ascetics. And\r\nthe warriors, learned in the Vedas and diligent in ceremonial rites, all\r\nlived with their father in the Gandhamadana. And there they beheld\r\nVaisravana seated with their father, possessed of riches and borne on the\r\nshoulders of men. And seized with jealousy, they resolved upon performing\r\npenances. And with ascetic penances of the most severe kind, they\r\ngratified Brahma. And the Ten-headed Ravana, supporting life by means of\r\nair alone and surrounded by the five sacred fires and absorbed in\r\nmeditation, remained standing on one leg for a thousand years. And\r\nKumvakarna with head downwards, and with restricted diet, was constant in\r\nausterities. And the wise and magnanimous Vibhishana, observing fasts and\r\nsubsisting only on dry leaves and engaged in meditation, practised severe\r\nausterities for a long period. And Khara and Surpanakha, with cheerful\r\nhearts, protected and attended on them while they were performing those\r\nausterities. And at the close of a thousand years, the invincible\r\nTen-headed One, cutting off his own heads, offered them as offering to\r\nthe sacred fire. And at this act of his, the Lord of the Universe was\r\npleased with him. And then Brahma, personally appearing to them, bade\r\nthem desist from those austerities and promised to grant boons unto every\r\none of them. And the adorable Brahma said, I am pleased with you, my\r\nsons! Cease now from these austerities and ask boons of me! Whatever your\r\ndesires may be, they, with the single exception of that of immortality,\r\nwill be fulfilled! As thou hast offered thy heads to the fire from great\r\nambition, they will again adorn thy body as before, according to thy\r\ndesire. And thy body will not be disfigured and thou shall be able to\r\nassume any form according to thy desire and become the conqueror of thy\r\nfoes in battle. There is no doubt of this!' thereupon Ravana said, 'May I\r\nnever experience defeat at the hands of Gandharvas, Celestials, Kinnaras,\r\nAsuras, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Serpents and all other creatures!' Brahma\r\nsaid, 'From those that hast named, thou shalt never have cause of fear;\r\nexcept from men (thou shalt have no occasion for fear). Good betide thee!\r\nSo hath it been ordained by me!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'Thus addressed, the Ten-headed (Ravana) was highly\r\ngratified, for on account of his perverted understanding, the man-eating\r\none slightened human beings. Then the great Grandsire addressed\r\nKumbhakarna as before. His reason being clouded by darkness, he asked for\r\nlong-lasting sleep. Saying, 'It shall be so' 'Brahma then addressed\r\nVibhishana, 'O my son, I am much pleased with thee! Ask any boon thou\r\npleasest!' Thereupon, Vibhishana replied, 'Even in great danger, may I\r\nnever swerve from the path of righteousness, and though ignorant, may I,\r\nO adorable Sire, be illumined with the light of divine knowledge!' And\r\nBrahma replied, 'O scourge of thy enemies, as thy soul inclines not to\r\nunrighteousness although born in the Rakshasa race, I grant thee\r\nimmortality!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Having obtained this boon, the Ten-headed\r\nRakshasa defeated Kuvera in battle and obtained from him the sovereignty\r\nof Lanka. That adorable Being, leaving Lanka and followed by Gandharvas,\r\nYakshas, Rakshas, and Kinnaras, went to live on mount Gandhamadana. And\r\nRavana forcibly took from him the celestial chariot Pushpaka. And upon\r\nthis Vaisravana cursed him, saying, 'This chariot shall never carry thee;\r\nit shall bear him who will slay thee in battle! And as thou hast insulted\r\nme, thy elder brother, thou shalt soon die!'\r\n\r\n\"The pious Vibhishana, O King, treading in the path followed by the\r\nvirtuous and possessed of great glory, followed Kuvera. That adorable\r\nLord of wealth, highly pleased with his younger brothers, invested him\r\nwith the command of the Yaksha and Raksha hosts. On the other hand, the\r\npowerful and man-eating Rakshasas and Pisachas, having assembled\r\ntogether, invested the Ten-headed Ravana with their sovereignty. And\r\nRavana, capable of assuming any form at will and terrible in prowess, and\r\ncapable also of passing through the air, attacked the gods and the\r\nDaityas and wrested from them all their valuable possessions. And as he\r\nhad terrified all creatures, he was called Ravana. And Ravana, capable of\r\nmustering any measure of might inspired the very gods with terror.\""

Do thou, O Brahmana, relate why the sons of Dasaratha--the\r\nbrothers Rama and Lakshmana--went to the forest with famous princess of\r\nMithila.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'The pious king Dasaratha, ever mindful of the old and\r\nassiduous in religious ceremonies, was greatly pleased when these sons\r\nwere born. And his sons gradually grew up in might and they became\r\nconversant with the Vedas together with all their mysteries, and with the\r\nscience of arms. And when after having gone through the Brahmacharyya\r\nvows the princes were married, king Dasaratha became happy and highly\r\npleased. And the intelligent Rama, the eldest of them all, became the\r\nfavourite of his father, and greatly pleased the people with his charming\r\nways. And then, O Bharata, the wise king, considering himself old in\r\nyears took counsel with his virtuous ministers and spiritual adviser for\r\ninstalling Rama as regent of the kingdom. And all those great ministers\r\nwere agreed that it was time to do so. And, O scion of Kuru's race, king\r\nDasaratha was greatly pleased to behold his son,--that enhancer of\r\nKausalya's delight--possessed of eyes that were red, and arms that were\r\nsinewy. And his steps were like those of a wild elephant. And he had long\r\narms and high shoulders and black and curly hair. And he was valiant, and\r\nglowing with splendour, and not inferior to Indra himself in battle. And\r\nhe was well-versed in holy writ and was equal to Vrihaspati in wisdom. An\r\nobject of love with all the people, he was skilled in every science. And\r\nwith senses under complete control, his very enemies were pleased to\r\nbehold him. And he was terror of the wicked and the protector of the\r\nvirtuous. And possessed of intelligence and incapable of being baffled,\r\nhe was victorious over all and never vanquished by any. And, O descendant\r\nof Kurus, beholding his son--that enhancer of Kausalya's joy--king\r\nDasaratha became highly pleased. And reflecting on Rama's virtues, the\r\npowerful and mighty king cheerfully addressed the family priest, saying,\r\n'Blessed be thou, O Brahmana! This night of the Pushya constellation will\r\nbring in a very auspicious conjunction. Let, therefore, materials be\r\ncollected and let Rama also be invited. This Pushya constellation will\r\nlast till tomorrow. And Rama, therefore, should be invested by me and my\r\nministers as prince-regent of all my subjects!'\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile Manthara (the maid of Kaikeyi), hearing these words of the\r\nking, went to her mistress, and spoke unto her as was suited to the\r\noccasion. And she said, 'Thy great ill-luck, O Kaikeyi, hath this day\r\nbeen proclaimed by the king! O unlucky one, mayst thou be bitten by a\r\nfierce and enraged snake of virulent poison! Kausalya, indeed, is\r\nfortunate, as it is her son that is going to be installed on the throne.\r\nWhere, indeed, is thy prosperity, when thy son obtaineth not the kingdom?'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of her maid, the slender-waisted and beautiful\r\nKaikeyi put on all her ornaments, and sought her husband in a secluded\r\nplace. And with a joyous heart, and smiling pleasantly, she addressed\r\nthese words to him with all the blandishments of love, 'O king, thou art\r\nalways true to thy promises. Thou didst promise before to grant me an\r\nobject of my desire. Do thou fulfil that promise now and save thyself\r\nfrom the sin of unredeemed pledge!' The king replied, saying, 'I will\r\ngrant thee a boon. Ask thou whatever thou wishest! What man undeserving\r\nof death shall be slain today and who that deserves death is to be set at\r\nliberty? Upon whom shall I bestow wealth to-day, or whose wealth shall be\r\nconfiscated? Whatever wealth there is in this world, save what belongeth\r\nto Brahmanas, is mine! I am the king of kings in this world, and the\r\nprotector of all the four classes! Tell me quickly, O blessed lady, what\r\nthat object is upon which thou hast set thy heart!' Hearing these words\r\nof the king, and tying him fast to his pledge, and conscious also of her\r\npower over him, she addressed him in these words, 'I desire that Bharata\r\nbe the recipient of that investiture which thou hast designed for Rama,\r\nand let Rama go into exile living in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen\r\nyears as an ascetic with matted locks on head and robed in rags and\r\ndeer-skins!' Hearing these disagreeable words of cruel import, the king,\r\nO chief of the Bharata race, was sorely afflicted and became utterly\r\nspeechless! But the mighty and virtuous Rama, learning that his father\r\nhad been thus solicited, went into the forest so that the king's truth\r\nmight remain inviolate. And, blessed be thou, he was followed by the\r\nauspicious Lakshmana--that foremost of bowmen and his wife Sita, the\r\nprincess of Videha and daughter of Janaka. And after Rama had gone into\r\nthe forest, king Dasaratha took leave of his body, agreeably to the\r\neternal law of time. And knowing that Rama not near and that the king was\r\ndead, queen Kaikeyi, causing Bharata to be brought before her, addressed\r\nhim in these words, 'Dasaratha hath gone to heaven and both Rama and\r\nLakshmana are in the forest! Take thou this kingdom which is so extensive\r\nand whose peace there is no rival to disturb'. Thereupon the virtuous\r\nBharata replied unto her saying, 'Thou hast done a wicked deed, having\r\nslain thy husband and exterminated this family from lust of wealth alone!\r\nHeaping infamy on my head, O accursed woman of our race, thou hast, O\r\nmother, attained this, thy object!' And having said these words, the\r\nprince wept aloud. And having proved his innocence before all the\r\nsubjects of that realm he set out in the wake of Rama, desiring to bring\r\nhim back. And placing Kausalya and Sumitra and Kaikeyi in the vehicles at\r\nthe van of his train, he proceeded with a heavy heart, in company with\r\nSatrughna. And he was accompanied by Vasishtha and Vamadeva, and other\r\nBrahmanas by thousands and by the people of the cities and the provinces,\r\ndesiring to bring back Rama. And he saw Rama with Lakshmana, living on\r\nthe mountains of Chitrakuta with bow in hand and decked with the\r\nornaments of ascetics. Bharata, however, was dismissed by Rama, who was\r\ndetermined to act according to the words, of his father. And returning,\r\nBharata ruled at Nandigrama, keeping before him, his brother's wooden\r\nsandals. And Rama fearing a repetition of intrusion by the people of\r\nAyodhya, entered into the great forest towards the asylum of Sarabhanga.\r\nAnd having paid his respects to Sarabhanga, he entered the forest of\r\nDandaka and took up his abode on the banks of beautiful river Godavari.\r\nAnd while living there, Rama was inveigled into hostilities with Khara,\r\nthen dwelling in Janasthana, on account of Surpanakha. And for the\r\nprotection of the ascetics the virtuous scion of Raghu's race slew\r\nfourteen thousand Rakshasas on earth, and having slain those mighty\r\nRakshasas, Khara and Dushana, the wise descendant of Raghu once more made\r\nthat sacred forest free from danger.'\r\n\r\n\"And after these Rakshasas had been slain, Surpanakha with mutilated nose\r\nand lips, repaired to Lanka--the abode of her brother (Ravana). And when\r\nthat Rakshasa woman, senseless with grief and with dry blood-stains on\r\nher face, appeared before Ravana, she fell down at his feet. And\r\nbeholding her so horribly mutilated, Ravana became senseless with wrath\r\nand grinding his teeth sprung up from his seat. And dismissing his\r\nministers, he enquired of her in private, saying, 'Blessed sister, who\r\nhath made thee so, forgetting and disregarding me? Who is he that having\r\ngot a sharp-pointed spear hath rubbed his body with it? Who is he that\r\nsleepeth in happiness and security, after placing a fire close to his\r\nhead? Who is he that hath trodden upon a revengeful snake of virulent\r\npoison? Who indeed, is that person who standeth with his hand thrust into\r\nthe mouth of the maned lion!' Then flames of wrath burst forth from his\r\nbody, like those that are emitted at night from the hollows of a tree on\r\nfire. His sister then related unto him the prowess of Rama and the defeat\r\nof the Rakshasas with Khara and Dushana at their head. Informed of the\r\nslaughter of his relatives, Ravana, impelled by Fate, remembered Maricha\r\nfor slaying Rama. And resolving upon the course he was to follow and\r\nhaving made arrangements for the government of his capital, he consoled\r\nhis sister, and set out on an aerial voyage. And crossing the Trikuta and\r\nthe Kala mountains, he beheld the vast receptacle of deep waters--the\r\nabode of the Makaras. Then crossing the Ocean, the Ten headed Ravana\r\nreached Gokarna--the favourite resort of the illustrious god armed with\r\nthe trident. And there Ravana met with his old friend Maricha who, from\r\nfear of Rama himself, had adopted an ascetic mode of life.'\""

And after Ravana\r\nhad taken his seat, and rested himself a while, Maricha skilled in\r\nspeech, sat beside Ravana and addressed him who was himself as eloquent\r\nin speech, saying, 'Thy complexion hath assumed an unnatural hue; is it\r\nall right with thy kingdom, O king of the Rakshasas? What hath brought\r\nthee here? Do thy subjects continue to pay thee the same allegiance that\r\nthey used to pay thee before? What business hath brought thee here? Know\r\nthat it is already fulfilled, even if it be very difficult of fulfilment!\r\nRavana, whose heart was agitated with wrath and humiliation informed him\r\nbriefly of the acts of Rama and the measures that were to be taken.' And\r\non hearing his story, Maricha briefly replied to him, saying, 'Thou must\r\nnot provoke Rama, for I know his strength! Is there a person who is\r\ncapable of withstanding the impetus of his arrows? That great man hath\r\nbeen the cause of my assuming my present ascetic life. What evil-minded\r\ncreature hath put thee up to this course calculated to bring ruin and\r\ndestruction on thee?' To this Ravana indignantly replied, reproaching him\r\nthus, 'If thou dost not obey my orders, thou shall surely die at my\r\nhands.' Maricha then thought within himself, 'When death is inevitable, I\r\nshall do his biddings; for it is better to die at the hands of one that\r\nis superior.' Then he replied to the lord of the Rakshasas saying, 'I\r\nshall surely render thee whatever help I can!' Then the Ten-headed Ravana\r\nsaid unto him, 'Go and tempt Sita, assuming the shape of a deer with\r\ngolden horns and a golden skin! When Sita will observe thee thus, she\r\nwill surely send away Rama to hunt thee. And then Sita will surely come\r\nwithin my power, and I shall forcibly carry her away. And then that\r\nwicked Rama will surely die of grief at the loss of his wife. Do thou\r\nhelp me in this way!'\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed, Maricha performed his obsequies (in anticipation) and\r\nwith a sorrowful heart, followed Ravana who was in advance of him. And\r\nhaving reached the hermitage of Rama of difficult achievements, they both\r\ndid as arranged beforehand. And Ravana appeared in the guise of an\r\nascetic with head shaven, and adorned with a Kamandala, and a treble\r\nstaff. And Maricha appeared in the shape of a deer. And Maricha appeared\r\nbefore the princess of Videha in that guise. And impelled by Fate, she\r\nsent away Rama after that deer. And Rama, with the object of pleasing\r\nher, quickly took up his bow, and leaving Lakshmana behind to protect\r\nher, went in pursuit of that deer. And armed with his bow and quiver and\r\nscimitar, and his fingers encased in gloves of Guana skin, Rama went in\r\npursuit of that deer, after the manner of Rudra following the stellar\r\ndeer[90] in days of yore. And that Rakshasa enticed away Rama to a great\r\ndistance by appearing before him at one time and disappearing from his\r\nview at another. And when Rama at last knew who and what that deer was,\r\nviz., that he was a Rakshasa, that illustrious descendant of Raghu's race\r\ntook out an infallible arrow and slew that Rakshasa, in the disguise of a\r\ndeer. And struck with Rama's arrow, the Rakshasa, imitating Rama's voice,\r\ncried out in great distress, calling upon Sita and Lakshmana. And when\r\nthe princess of Videha heard that cry of distress, she urged Lakshmana to\r\nrun towards the quarter from whence the cry came. Then Lakshmana said to\r\nher, \"Timid lady, thou hast no cause of fear! Who is so powerful as to be\r\nable to smite Rama? O thou of sweet smiles, in a moment thou wilt behold\r\nthy husband Rama!' Thus addressed, the chaste Sita, from that timidity\r\nwhich is natural to women, became suspicious of even the pure Lakshmana,\r\nand began to weep aloud. And that chaste lady, devoted to her husband,\r\nharshly reproved Lakshmana, saying, 'The object which thou, O fool,\r\ncherishest in thy heart, shall never be fulfilled! I would rather kill\r\nmyself with a weapon or throw myself from the top of a hill or enter into\r\na blazing fire than live with a sorry wretch like thee, forsaking my\r\nhusband Rama, like a tigress under the protection of a jackal!--\r\n\r\nWhen the good natured Lakshmana, who was very fond of his brother, heard\r\nthese words, he shut his ears (with his hands) and set out on the track\r\nthat Rama had taken. And Lakshmana set out without casting a single\r\nglance on that lady with lips soft and red like the Bimba fruit.\r\nMeanwhile, the Rakshasa Ravana, wearing a genteel guise though wicked at\r\nheart, and like unto fire enveloped in a heap of ashes, showed himself\r\nthere. And he appeared there in the disguise of a hermit, for forcibly\r\ncarrying away that lady of blameless character. The virtuous daughter of\r\nJanaka, seeing him come, welcomed him with fruits and root and a seat.\r\nDisregarding these and assuming his own proper shape, that bull among\r\nRakshasas began to re-assure the princess of Videha in these words, 'I\r\nam, O Sita, the king of the Rakshasas, known by the name of Ravana! My\r\ndelightful city, known by the name of Lanka is on the other side of the\r\ngreat ocean! There among beautiful women, thou wilt shine with me! O lady\r\nof beautiful lips, forsaking the ascetic Rama do thou become my wife!'\r\nJanaka's daughter of beautiful lips, hearing these and other words in the\r\nsame strain, shut her ears and replied unto him, saying, 'Do not say so!\r\nThe vault of heaven with all its stars may fall down, the Earth itself\r\nmay be broken into fragments, fire itself may change its nature by\r\nbecoming cool, yet I cannot forsake the descendant of Raghu! How can a\r\nshe-elephant, who hath lived with the mighty leader of a herd with rent\r\ntemples forsake him and live with a hog? Having once tasted the sweet\r\nwine prepared from honey or flowers, how can a woman, I fancy, relish the\r\nwretched arrak from rice?' Having uttered those words, she entered the\r\ncottage, her lips trembling in wrath and her arms moving to and fro in\r\nemotion. Ravana, however, followed her thither and intercepted her\r\nfurther progress. And rudely scolded by the Rakshasa, she swooned away.\r\nBut Ravana seized her by the hair of her head, and rose up into the air.\r\nThen a huge vulture of the name of Jatayu living on a mountain peak,\r\nbeheld that helpless lady thus weeping and calling upon Rama in great\r\ndistress while being carried away by Ravana.\""

If thou dost not release my daughter-in-law, thou shalt not\r\nescape from me with life!' And having said these words Jatayu began to\r\ntear the king of the Rakshasas with his talons. And he mangled him in a\r\nhundred different parts of his body by striking him with his wings and\r\nbeaks. And blood began to flow as copiously from Ravana's body as water\r\nfrom a mountain spring. And attacked thus by that vulture desirous of\r\nRama's good, Ravana, taking up a sword, cut off the two wings of that\r\nbird. And having slain that king of the vultures, huge as a mountain-peak\r\nshooting forth above the clouds, the Rakshasa rose high in the air with\r\nSita on his lap. And the princess of Videha, wherever she saw an asylum\r\nof ascetics, a lake, a river, or a tank, threw down an ornament of hers.\r\nAnd beholding on the top of a mountain five foremost of monkeys, that\r\nintelligent lady threw down amongst them a broad piece of her costly\r\nattire. And that beautiful and yellow piece of cloth fell, fluttering\r\nthrough the air, amongst those five foremost of monkeys like lightning\r\nfrom the clouds. And that Rakshasa soon passed a great way through the\r\nfirmament like a bird through the air. And soon the Rakshasa beheld his\r\ndelightful and charming city of many gates, surrounded on all sides by\r\nhigh walls and built by Viswakrit himself. And the king of the Rakshasa\r\nthen entered his own city known by the name of Lanka, accompanied by\r\nSita.'\r\n\r\n\"And while Sita was being carried away, the intelligent Rama, having\r\nslain the great deer, retraced his steps and saw his brother Lakshmana\r\n(on the way). And beholding his brother, Rama reproved him, saying, 'How\r\ncouldst thou come hither, leaving the princess of Videha in a forest that\r\nis haunted by the Rakshasa?' And reflecting on his own enticement to a\r\ngreat distance by that Rakshasa in the guise of a deer and on the arrival\r\nof his brother (leaving Sita alone in the asylum), Rama was filled with\r\nagony. And quickly advancing towards Lakshmana while reproving him still,\r\nRama asked him, 'O Lakshmana, is the princess of Videha still alive? I\r\nfear she is no more!' Then Lakshmana told him everything about what Sita\r\nhad said, especially that unbecoming language of hers subsequently. With\r\na burning heart Rama then ran towards the asylum. And on the way he\r\nbeheld a vulture huge as a mountain, lying in agonies of death. And\r\nsuspecting him to be a Rakshasa, the descendant of the Kakutstha race,\r\nalong with Lakshmana rushed towards him, drawing with great force his bow\r\nto a circle. The mighty vulture, however, addressing them both, said,\r\n'Blessed be ye, I am the king of the vultures, and friend of Dasaratha!'\r\nHearing these words of his, both Rama and his brother put aside their\r\nexcellent bow and said, 'Who is this one that speaketh the name of our\r\nfather in these woods?' And then they saw that creature to be a bird\r\ndestitute of two wings, and that bird then told them of his own overthrow\r\nat the hands of Ravana for the sake of Sita. Then Rama enquired of the\r\nvulture as to the way Ravana had taken. The vulture answered him by a nod\r\nof his head and then breathed his last. And having understood from the\r\nsign the vulture had made that Ravana had gone towards the south, Rama\r\nreverencing his father's friend, caused his funeral obsequies to be duly\r\nperformed. Then those chastisers of foes, Rama and Lakshmana, filled with\r\ngrief at the abduction of the princess of Videha, took a southern path\r\nthrough the Dandaka woods beholding along their way many uninhabited\r\nasylums of ascetics, scattered over with seats of Kusa grass and\r\numbrellas of leaves and broken water-pots, and abounding with hundreds of\r\njackals. And in that great forest, Rama along with Sumatra's son beheld\r\nmany herds of deer running in all directions. And they heard a loud\r\nuproar of various creatures like what is heard during a fast spreading\r\nforest conflagration. And soon they beheld a headless Rakshasa of\r\nterrible mien. And that Rakshasa was dark as the clouds and huge as a\r\nmountain, with shoulders broad as those of a Sola tree, and with arms\r\nthat were gigantic. And he had a pair of large eyes on his breast, and\r\nthe opening of his mouth was placed on his capacious belly. And that\r\nRakshasa seized Lakshmana by the hand, without any difficulty. And seized\r\nby the Rakshasa the son of Sumitra, O Bharata, became utterly confounded\r\nand helpless. And casting his glances on Rama, that headless Rakshasa\r\nbegan to draw Lakshmana towards that part of his body where his mouth\r\nwas. And Lakshmana in grief addressed Rama, saying, 'Behold my plight!\r\nThe loss of thy kingdom, and then the death of our father, and then the\r\nabduction of Sita, and finally this disaster that hath overwhelmed me!\r\nAlas, I shall not behold thee return with the princess of Videha to\r\nKosala and seated on thy ancestral throne as the ruler of the entire\r\nEarth! They only that are fortunate will behold thy face, like unto the\r\nmoon emerged from the clouds, after thy coronation bath in water\r\nsanctified with Kusa grass and fried paddy and black peas!' And the\r\nintelligent Lakshmana uttered those and other lamentations in the same\r\nstrain. The illustrious descendant, however, of Kakutstha's race\r\nundaunted amid danger, replied unto Lakshmana, saying, 'Do not, O tiger\r\namong men, give way to grief! What is this thing when I am here? Cut thou\r\noff his right arm and I shall cut off his left.' And while Rama was still\r\nspeaking so, the left arm of the monster was severed by him, cut off with\r\na sharp scimitar, as if indeed, that arm were a stalk of the Tila corn.\r\nThe mighty son of Sumitra then beholding his brother standing before him\r\nstruck off with his sword the right arm also of that Rakshasa. And\r\nLakshmana also began to repeatedly strike Rakshasa under the ribs, and\r\nthen that huge headless monster fell upon the ground and expired quickly.\r\nAnd then there came out from the Rakshasa's body a person of celestial\r\nmake. And he showed himself to the brothers, staying for a moment in the\r\nskies, like the Sun in his effulgence in the firmament. And Rama skilled\r\nin speech, asked him, saying, 'Who art thou? Answer me who enquire of\r\nthee? Whence could such a thing happen? All this seems to me to be\r\nexceedingly wonderful!' Thus addressed by Rama, that being replied unto\r\nhim, saying, 'I am, O prince, a Gandharva of the name of Viswavasu! It\r\nwas through the curse of a Brahmana that I had to assume the form and\r\nnature of a Rakshasa. As to thyself, O Rama, Sita hath been carried away\r\nwith violence by king Ravana who dwelleth in Lanka. Repair thou unto\r\nSugriva who will give thee his friendship. There, near enough to the peak\r\nof Rishyamuka is the lake known by the name of Pampa of sacred water and\r\ncranes. There dwelleth, with four of his counsellors, Sugriva, the\r\nbrother of the monkey-king Vali decked with a garland of gold. Repairing\r\nunto him, inform of thy cause of sorrow. In plight very much like thy\r\nown, he will render thee assistance. This is all that we can say. Thou\r\nwilt, without doubt, see the daughter of Janaka! Without doubt Ravana and\r\nothers are known to the king of the monkeys!' Having said these words,\r\nthat celestial being of great effulgence made himself invisible, and\r\nthose heroes, both Rama and Lakshmana, wondered much.\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya said, 'Afflicted with grief at the abduction of Sita, Rama\r\nhad not to go much further before he came upon Pampa--that lake which\r\nabounded with lotuses of various kinds. And fanned by the cool, delicious\r\nand fragrant breezes in those woods, Rama suddenly remembered his dear\r\nspouse. And, O mighty monarch, thinking of that dear wife of his, and\r\nafflicted at the thought of his separation from her, Rama gave way to\r\nlamentations. The son of Sumitra then addressed him saying, 'O thou that\r\ngivest proper respect to those that deserve it, despondency such as this\r\nshould not be suffered to approach thee, like illness that can never\r\ntouch an old man leading a regular life! Thou hast obtained information\r\nof Ravana and of the princess of Videha! Liberate her now with exertion\r\nand intelligence! Let us now approach Sugriva, that foremost of monkeys,\r\nwho is even now on the mountain top! Console thyself, when I, thy\r\ndisciple and slave and ally, am near!' And addressed by Lakshmana in\r\nthese and other words of the same import, Rama regained his own nature\r\nand attended to the business before him. And bathing in the waters of\r\nPampa and offering oblations therewith unto their ancestors, both those\r\nheroic brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, set out (for Rishyamuka). And\r\narriving at Rishyamuka which abounded with fruits and roots and trees,\r\nthose heroes beheld five monkeys on the top of the mountain-peak. And\r\nseeing them approach, Sugriva sent his counsellor the intelligent\r\nHanuman, huge as the Himavat-mountains, to receive them. And the\r\nbrothers, having first exchanged words with Hanuman, approached Sugriva.\r\nAnd then, O king, Rama made friends with Sugriva. And when Rama informed\r\nSugriva of the object he had in view, Sugriva showed him the piece of\r\ncloth that Sita had dropped among the monkeys, while being carried away\r\nby Ravana. And having obtained from him those credentials, Rama himself\r\ninstalled Sugriva--that foremost of monkeys--in sovereignty of all the\r\nmonkeys of Earth. And Rama also pledged himself to slay Vali in battle.\r\nAnd having come to that understanding and placing the fullest confidence\r\nin each other, they all repaired to Kiskindhya, desirous of battle (with\r\nVali). And arriving at Kiskindhya, Sugriva sent forth a loud roar deep as\r\nthat of a cataract. Unable to bear that challenge, Vali was for coming\r\nout (but his wife) Tara stood in way, saying, 'Himself endued with great\r\nstrength, the way in which Sugriva is roaring, showeth, I ween, that he\r\nhath found assistance! It behoveth thee not, therefore, to go out! Thus\r\naddressed by her, that king of the monkeys, the eloquent Vali, decked in\r\na golden garland replied unto Tara of face beautiful as the moon, saying,\r\n'Thou understandest the voice of every creature. Tell me after reflection\r\nwhose help it is that this brother in name only of mine hath obtained!'\r\nThus addressed by him Tara endued with wisdom and possessed of the\r\neffulgence of the moon, answered her lord after a moment's reflection,\r\nsaying, 'Listen, O monarch of the monkeys! That foremost of bowmen,\r\nendued with great might, Rama the son of Dasaratha, whose spouse hath\r\nbeen ravished, hath made an alliance offensive and defensive with\r\nSugriva! And his brother the intelligent Lakshmana also of mighty arms,\r\nthe unvanquished son of Sumitra, standeth beside him for the success of\r\nSugriva's object. And Mainda and Dwivida, and Hanuman the son of Pavana,\r\nand Jamvuman, the king of the bears, are beside Sugriva as his\r\ncounsellors. All these illustrious ones are endued with great strength\r\nand intelligence. And these all, depending upon the might and energy of\r\nRama, are prepared for thy destruction!' Hearing these words of hers that\r\nwere for his benefit, the king of the monkeys disregarded them\r\naltogether. And filled with jealousy, he also suspected her to have set\r\nher heart on Sugriva! And addressing Tara in harsh words, he went out of\r\nhis cave and coming before Sugriva who was staying by the side of the\r\nmountains of Malyavat, he spoke unto him thus, 'Frequently vanquished\r\nbefore by me, fond as thou art of life, thou art allowed by me to escape\r\nwith life owing to thy relationship with me! What hath made thee wish for\r\ndeath so soon?' Thus addressed by Vali, Sugriva, that slayer of foes, as\r\nif addressing Rama himself for informing him of what had happened,\r\nreplied unto his brother in these words of grave import, 'O king, robbed\r\nby thee of my wife and my kingdom also, what need have I of life? Know\r\nthat it is for this that I have come!' Then addressing each other in\r\nthese and other words of the same import, Vali and Sugriva rushed to the\r\nencounter, fighting with Sala and Tala trees and stones. And they struck\r\neach other down on the earth. And leaping high into the air, they struck\r\neach other with their fists. And mangled by each other's nail and teeth,\r\nboth of them were covered with blood. And the two heroes shone on that\r\naccount like a pair of blossoming Kinshukas. And as they fought with each\r\nother, no difference (in aspect) could be observed so as to distinguish\r\nthem. Then Hanuman placed on Sugriva's neck a garland of flowers. And\r\nthat hero thereupon shone with that garland on his neck, like the\r\nbeautiful and huge peak of Malya with its cloudy belt. And Rama,\r\nrecognising Sugriva by that sign, then drew his foremost of huge bows,\r\naiming at Vali as his mark. And the twang of Rama's bow resembled the\r\nroar of an engine. And Vali, pierced in the heart by that arrow, trembled\r\nin fear. And Vali, his heart having been pierced through, began to vomit\r\nforth blood. And he then beheld standing before him Rama with Sumatra's\r\nson by his side. And reproving that descendant of Kakutstha's race, Vali\r\nfell down on the ground and became senseless. And Tara then beheld that\r\nlord of hers possessed of the effulgence of the Moon, lying prostrate on\r\nthe bare earth. And after Vali had been thus slain, Sugriva regained\r\npossession of Kishkindhya, and along with it, of the widowed Tara also of\r\nface beautiful as the moon. And the intelligent Rama also dwelt on the\r\nbeautiful breast of the Malyavat hill for four months, duly worshipped by\r\nSugriva all the while.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile Ravana excited by lust, having reached his city of Lanka,\r\nplaced Sita in an abode, resembling Nandana itself, within a forest of\r\nAsokas, that looked like an asylum of ascetics. And the large-eyed Sita\r\npassed her days there in distress, living on fruits and roots, practising\r\nascetic austerities with fasts, attired in ascetic garb, and waning thin\r\nday by day, thinking of her absent lord. And the king of the Rakshasas\r\nappointed many Rakshasa women armed with bearded darts and swords and\r\nlances and battle-axes and maces and flaming brands, for guarding her.\r\nAnd some of these had two eyes, and some three. And some had eyes on\r\ntheir foreheads. And some had long tongues and some had none. And some\r\nhad three breasts and some had only one leg. And some had three matted\r\nbraids on their heads, and some had only one eye. And these, and others\r\nof blazing eyes and hair stiff as the camel's, stood beside Sita\r\nsurrounding her day and night most watchfully. And those Pisacha women of\r\nfrightful voice and terrible aspect always addressed that large-eyed lady\r\nin the harshest tones. And they said, 'Let us eat her up, let us mangle\r\nher, let us tear her into pieces, her, that is, that dwelleth here\r\ndisregarding our lord!' And filled with grief at the separation from her\r\nlord, Sita drew a deep sigh and answered those Rakshasa women, saying,\r\n'Reverend ladies, eat me up without delay! I have no desire to live\r\nwithout that husband of mine, of eyes like lotus-leaves and locks wavy,\r\nand blue in hue! Truly I will, without food and without the least love of\r\nlife, emaciate my limbs, like a she-snake (hibernating) within a Tala\r\ntree. Know this for certain that I will never seek the protection of any\r\nother person than the descendant of Raghu. And knowing this, do what ye\r\nthink fit!' And hearing these words of hers, those Rakshasas with\r\ndissonant voice went to the king of the Rakshasas, for representing unto\r\nhim all she had said. And when those Rakshasas had gone away, one of\r\ntheir number known by the name of Trijata, who was virtuous and agreeable\r\nin speech, began to console the princess of Videha. And she said,\r\n'Listen, O Sita! I will tell thee something! O friend, believe in what I\r\nsay! O thou of fair hips, cast off thy fears, and listen to what I say.\r\nThere is an intelligent and old chief of the Rakshasas known by the name\r\nof Avindhya. He always seeketh Rama's good and hath told me these words\r\nfor thy sake! 'Reassuring and cheering her, tell Sita in my name, saying:\r\n'Thy husband the mighty Rama is well and is waited upon by Lakshmana. And\r\nthe blessed descendant of Raghu hath already made friends with Sugriva,\r\nthe king of the monkeys, and is ready to act for thee! And, O timid lady,\r\nentertain thou no fear on account of Ravana, who is censured by the whole\r\nworld, for, O daughter, thou art safe from him on account of Nalakuvera's\r\ncurse. Indeed, this wretch had been cursed before for his having violated\r\nhis daughter-in-law, Rambha. This lustful wretch is not able to violate\r\nany woman by force. Thy husband will soon come, protected by Sugriva and\r\nwith the intelligent son of Sumitra in his train, and will soon take thee\r\naway hence! O lady, I have had a most terrible dream of evil omen,\r\nindicating the destruction of this wicked-minded wretch of Pulastya's\r\nrace! This night wanderer of mean deeds is, indeed, most wicked and\r\ncruel. He inspireth terror in all by the defects of his nature and the\r\nwickedness of his conduct. And deprived of his senses by Fate, he\r\nchallengeth the very gods. In my vision I have seen every indication of\r\nhis downfall. I have seen the Ten-headed, with his crown shaven and body\r\nbesmeared with oil, sunk in mire, and the next moment dancing on a\r\nchariot drawn by mules. I have seen Kumbhakarna and others, perfectly\r\nnaked and with crowns shaven, decked with red wreaths and unguents, and\r\nrunning towards the southern direction. Vibhishana alone, with umbrella\r\nover his head, and graced with a turban, and with body decked with white\r\nwreaths and unguents, I beheld ascending the summit of the White hill.\r\nAnd I saw four of his counsellors also, decked with white wreaths and\r\nunguents, ascending the summit of that hill along with him. All this\r\nbodeth that these alone will be saved from the impending terror. The\r\nwhole earth with its oceans and seas will be enveloped with Rama's\r\narrows. O lady, thy husband will fill the whole earth with his fame. I\r\nalso saw Lakshmana, consuming all directions (with his arrows) and\r\nascending on a heap of bones and drinking thereon honey and rice boiled\r\nin milk. And thou, O lady, hast been beheld by me running towards a\r\nnorthernly direction, weeping and covered with blood and protected by a\r\ntiger! And, O princess of Videha, soon wilt thou find happiness, being\r\nunited, O Sita, with thy lord, that descendant of Raghu accompanied by\r\nhis brother!' Hearing these words of Trijata, that girl with eyes like\r\nthose of a young gazelle, once more began to entertain hopes of a union\r\nwith her lord. And when at last those fierce and cruel Pisacha guards\r\ncame back, they saw her sitting with Trijata as before.\""

And inflamed by desire, that conquerer in\r\nbattle of the gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, and the\r\nKimpurushas, attired in celestial robes and possessing handsome features,\r\ndecked with jewelled earrings and wearing a beautiful garland and crown,\r\nentered the Asoka woods, like an embodiment of the vernal season. And\r\ndressed with care, Ravana looked like the Kalpa tree in Indra's garden.\r\nBut though adorned with every embellishment, that inspired her only with\r\nawe, like a beautified banian in the midst of a cemetery. And that night\r\nwanderer, having approached the presence of that slender-waisted lady,\r\nlooked like the planet Saturn in the presence of Rohini. And smitten with\r\nthe shafts of the god of the flowery emblem he accosted that fair-hipped\r\nlady then affrighted like a helpless doe, and told her these words, 'Thou\r\nhast, O Sita, shown thy regard for thy lord too much! O thou of delicate\r\nlimbs, be merciful unto me. Let thy person be embellished now (by these\r\nmaids in waiting). O excellent lady, accept me as thy lord!

Many are\r\nthe daughters of the celestials and also the Gandharvas that I possess! I\r\nam lord also of many Danava and Daitya ladies! One hundred and forty\r\nmillions of Pisachas, twice as many man-eating Rakshasa of terrible deed,\r\nand thrice as many Yaksha do my bidding! Some of these are under the sway\r\nof my brother who is the lord of all treasures. In my drinking hall, O\r\nexcellent lady of beautiful thighs, Gandharvas and Apsaras wait on me as\r\nthey do on my brother! I am, again, the son of that regenerate Rishi\r\nVisravas himself of high ascetic merit. I am renowned, again, as the\r\nfifth Regent of the Universe! And, O beautiful lady, of food and edibles\r\nand drinks of the very best kind, I have as much as the Lord himself of\r\nthe celestials! Let all thy troubles consequent on a life in the woods\r\ncease! O thou of fair hips, be my Queen, as Mandodari herself!' Thus\r\naddressed by him, the beautiful princess of Videha, turning away and\r\nregarding him as something less than a straw, replied unto that wanderer\r\nof the night. And at that time the princess of Videha, that girl of\r\nbeautiful hips, had her deep and compact bosom copiously drenched by her\r\ninauspicious tears shed ceaselessly. And she who regarded her husband as\r\nher god, answered that mean wretch, saying, 'By sheer ill-luck it is, O\r\nking of the Rakshasas, that I am obliged to hear such words of grievous\r\nimport spoken by thee! Blessed be thou, O Rakshasa fond of sensual\r\npleasures, let thy heart be withdrawn from me! I am the wife of another,\r\never devoted to my husband, and, therefore, incapable of being possessed\r\nby thee! A helpless human being that I am, I cannot be a fit wife for\r\nthee! What joy can be thine by using violence towards an unwilling woman?\r\nThy father is a wise Brahmana, born of Brahma and equal unto that Lord\r\nhimself of the creation! Why dost thou not, therefore, thyself being\r\nequal to a Regent of the Universe, observe virtue? Disgracing thy\r\nbrother, that king of the Yakshas, that adorable one who is the friend of\r\nMaheswara himself, that lord of treasures, how is it that thou feelest no\r\nshame?' Having said these words, Sita began to weep, her bosom shivering\r\nin agitation, and covering her neck and face with her garments. And the\r\nlong and well-knit braid, black and glossy, falling from the head of the\r\nweeping lady, looked like a black snake. And hearing these cruel words\r\nuttered by Sita, the foolish Ravana, although thus rejected, addressed\r\nSita once more, saying, 'O lady, let the god having the Makara for his\r\nemblem burn me sorely. I will, however, on no account, O thou of sweet\r\nsmiles and beautiful hips, approach thee, as thou art unwilling! What can\r\nI do to thee that still feelest a regard for Rama who is only a human\r\nbeing and, therefore, our food?' Having said those words unto that lady\r\nof faultless features, the king of the Rakshasa made himself invisible\r\nthen and there and went away to the place he liked.

And virtuous Rama, dejected in spirits at\r\nthe thought of Sita's captivity in the abode of the Rakshasa, addressed\r\nthe heroic Lakshmana in the morning saying, 'Go, Lakshmana and seek in\r\nKishkindhya that ungrateful king off the monkeys, who understand well his\r\nown interest and is even now indulging in dissipations, that foolish\r\nwretch of his race whom I have installed on a throne and to whom all apes\r\nand monkeys and bears owe allegiance, that fellow for whose sake, O\r\nmighty-armed perpetuator of Raghu's race, Vali was slain by me with thy\r\nhelp in the wood of Kishkindhya! I regard that worst of monkeys on earth\r\nto be highly ungrateful, for, O Lakshmana, that wretch hath now forgotten\r\nme who am sunk in such distress! I think he is unwilling to fulfil his\r\npledge, disregarding, from dullness of understanding, one who hath done\r\nhim such services! If thou findest him lukewarm and rolling in sensual\r\njoys, thou must then send him, by the path Vali hath been made to follow,\r\nto the common goal of all creatures! If, on the other hand, thou seest\r\nthat foremost of monkeys delight in our cause, then, O descendant of\r\nKakutstha, shouldst thou bring him hither with thee! Be quick, and delay\r\nnot!' Thus addressed by his brother, Lakshmana ever attentive to the\r\nbehests and welfare of his superiors, set out taking with him his\r\nhandsome bow with string and arrows. And reaching the gates of\r\nKishkindhya he entered the city unchallenged. And knowing him to be\r\nangry, the monkey-king advanced to receive him. And with his wife,\r\nSugriva the king of the monkeys, with a humble heart, joyfully received\r\nhim with due honours. And the dauntless son of Sumitra then told him what\r\nRama had said. And having heard everything in detail, O mighty monarch,\r\nSugriva, the king of the monkeys with his wife and servants, joined his\r\nhands, and cheerfully said unto Lakshmana, that elephant among men, these\r\nwords: 'I am, O Lakshmana, neither wicked, nor ungrateful, nor destitute\r\nof virtue! Hear what efforts I have made for finding out Sita's place of\r\ncaptivity! I have despatched diligent monkeys in all directions. All of\r\nthem have stipulated to return within a month. They will, O hero, search\r\nthe whole earth with her forests and hills and seas, her villages and\r\ntowns and cities and mines. Only five nights are wanting to complete that\r\nmonth, and then thou wilt, with Rama, hear tidings of great joy!'\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed by that intelligent king of the monkeys, the high-souled\r\nLakshmana became appeased, and he in his turn worshipped Sugriva. And\r\naccompanied by Sugriva, he returned to Rama on the breast of the Malyavat\r\nhill. And approaching him, Lakshmana informed him of the beginning\r\nalready made in respect of his undertaking. And soon thousands of\r\nmonkey-chiefs began to return, after having carefully searched the three\r\nquarters of the earth, viz., the North, the East and the West. But they\r\nthat had gone towards the South did not make their appearance And they\r\nthat came back represented to Rama, saying that although they had\r\nsearched the whole earth with her belt of seas, yet they could not find\r\neither the princess of Videha or Ravana. But that descendant of\r\nKakutstha's race, afflicted at heart, managed to live yet, resting his\r\nhopes (of hearing Sita's tidings) on the great monkeys that had gone\r\ntowards the South.\r\n\r\n\"After the lapse of two months, several monkeys seeking with haste the\r\npresence of Sugriva, addressed him, saying, 'O king, that foremost of\r\nmonkeys, the son of Pavana, as also Angada, the son of Vali, and the\r\nother great monkeys whom thou hadst despatched to search the southern\r\nregion, have come back and are pillaging that great and excellent orchard\r\ncalled Madhuvana, which was always guarded by Vali and which hath been\r\nwell-guarded by thee also after him!' Hearing of this act of liberty on\r\ntheir part, Sugriva inferred the success of their mission, for it is only\r\nservants that have been crowned with success that can act in this way.\r\nAnd that intelligent and foremost of monkeys communicated his suspicions\r\nto Rama. And Rama also, from this, guessed that the princess of Mithila\r\nhad been seen. Then Hanuman and the other monkeys, having refreshed\r\nthemselves thus, came towards their king, who was then staying with Rama\r\nand Lakshmana. And, O Bharata, observing the gait of Hanuman and the\r\ncolour of his face, Rama was confirmed in the belief that Hanuman had\r\nreally seen Sita. Then those successful monkeys with Hanuman at their\r\nhead, duly bowed unto Rama and Lakshmana and Sugriva. And Rama then\r\ntaking up his bow and quiver, addressed those monkeys, saying, 'Have you\r\nbeen successful? Will ye impart life unto me? Will ye once more enable me\r\nto reign in Ayodhya after having slain my enemy in battle and rescued the\r\ndaughter of Janaka? With the princess of Videha unrescued, and the foe\r\nunslain in battle, I dare not live, robbed of wife and honour!' Thus\r\naddressed by Rama, the son of Pavana, replied unto him, saying, 'I bring\r\nthee good news, O Rama; for Janaka's daughter hath been seen by me.\r\nHaving searched the southern region with all its hills, forests, and\r\nmines for some time, we became very weary. At length we beheld a great\r\ncavern. And having beheld it, we entered that cavern which extended over\r\nmany Yojanas. It was dark and deep and overgrown with trees and infested\r\nby worms. And having gone a great way through it, we came upon sun-shine\r\nand beheld a beautiful palace. It was, O Raghava, the abode of the Daitya\r\nMaya. And there we beheld a female ascetic named Prabhavati engaged in\r\nascetic austerities. And she gave us food and drink of various kinds. And\r\nhaving refreshed ourselves therewith and regained our strength, we\r\nproceeded along the way shown by her. At last we came out of the cavern\r\nand beheld the briny sea, and on its shores, the Sahya, the Malaya and\r\nthe great Dardura mountains. And ascending the mountains of Malaya, we\r\nbeheld before us the vast ocean.[91] And beholding it we felt sorely\r\ngrieved in mind. And dejected in spirits and afflicted with pain and\r\nfamishing with hunger, we despaired of returning with our lives. Casting\r\nour eyes on the great ocean extending over many hundreds of Yojanas and\r\nabounding in whales and alligators and other aquatic animals, we became\r\nanxious and filled with grief. We then sat together, resolved to die\r\nthere of starvation. And in course of conversation we happened to talk of\r\nthe vulture Jatayu. Just then we saw a bird huge as a mountain, of\r\nfrightful form, and inspiring terror into every heart, like a second son\r\nof Vinata.[92] And coming upon us unawares for devouring us, he said,\r\n'Who are ye that are speaking thus of my brother Jatayu? I am his elder\r\nbrother, by name Sampati, and am the king of birds. Once upon a time, we\r\ntwo, with the desire of outstripping each other, flew towards the sun. My\r\nwings got burnt, but those of Jatayu were not. That was the last time I\r\nsaw my beloved brother Jatayu, the king of vultures! My wings burnt, I\r\nfell down upon the top of this great mountain where I still am!' When he\r\nfinished speaking, we informed him of the death of his brother in a few\r\nwords and also of this calamity that hath befallen thee! And, O king, the\r\npowerful Sampati heating this unpleasant news from us, was greatly\r\nafflicted and again enquired of us, saying, 'Who is this Rama and why was\r\nSita carried off and how was Jatayu slain? Ye foremost of monkeys I wish\r\nto hear everything in detail!' We then informed him of everything about\r\nthis calamity of thine and of the reason also of our vow of starvation.\r\nThat king of birds then urged us (to give up our vow) by these words of\r\nhis: 'Ravana is, indeed, known to me. Lanka is his capital. I beheld it\r\non the other side of the sea in a valley of the Trikuta hills! Sita must\r\nbe there. I have little doubt of this!' Hearing these words of his, we\r\nrose up quickly and began, O chastiser of foes, to take counsel of one\r\nanother for crossing the ocean! And when none dared to cross it, I,\r\nhaving recourse to my father, crossed the great ocean which is a hundred\r\nYojanas in width. And having slain the Rakshasis on the waters, I saw the\r\nchaste Sita within Ravana's harem, observing ascetic austerities, eager\r\nto behold her lord, with matted locks on head, and body besmeared with\r\nfilth, and lean, and melancholy and helpless. Recognising her as Sita by\r\nthose unusual signs, and approaching that worshipful lady while alone, I\r\nsaid, 'I am, O Sita, an emissary of Rama and monkey begotten by\r\nPavana![93] Desirous of having a sight of thee, hither have I come\r\ntravelling through the skies! Protected by Sugriva, that monarch of all\r\nthe monkeys, the royal brothers Rama and Lakshmana are in peace! And\r\nRama, O lady, with Sumitra's son, hath enquired of thy welfare! And\r\nSugriva also, on account of his friendship (with Rama and Lakshmana)\r\nenquireth of thy welfare. Followed by all the monkeys, thy husband will\r\nsoon be here. Confide in me, O adorable lady, I am a monkey and not a\r\nRakshasa!' Thus addressed by me, Sita seemed to meditate for a moment and\r\nthen replied to me, saying, 'From the words of Avindhya I know that thou\r\nart Hanuman! O mighty-armed one, Avindhya is an old and respected\r\nRakshasa! He told me that Sugriva is surrounded by counsellors like thee.\r\nThou mayst depart now!' And with these words she gave me this jewel as a\r\ncredential. And, indeed, it was by means of this jewel that the faultless\r\nSita had been able to support her existence. And the daughter of Janaka\r\nfurther told me as a token from her, that by thee, O tiger among men, a\r\nblade of grass (inspired with Mantras and thus converted into a fatal\r\nweapon) had once been shot at a crow while ye were on the breast of the\r\nmighty hill known by the name of Chitrakuta! And this she said as\r\nevidence of my having met her and hers being really the princess of\r\nVideha. I then caused myself to be seized by Ravana's soldiers, and then\r\nset fire to the city of Lanka!'\""

The father-in-law of Vali,\r\nthe illustrious Sushena, accompanied by a thousand crores of active apes,\r\ncame to Rama. And those two foremost of monkeys endued with mighty\r\nenergy, viz., Gaya and Gavakshya, each accompanied by a hundred crores of\r\nmonkeys, showed themselves there. And, O king, Gavakshya also of terrible\r\nmien and endued with a bovine tail, showed himself there, having\r\ncollected sixty thousand crores of monkeys. And the renowned\r\nGandhamadana, dwelling on the mountains of the same name, collected a\r\nhundred thousand crores of monkeys. And the intelligent and mighty monkey\r\nknown by the name of Panasa mustered together fifty-two crores of\r\nmonkeys.[94] And that foremost and illustrious of monkeys named\r\nDadhimukha of mighty energy mustered a large army of monkeys possessed of\r\nterrible prowess. And Jamvuvan showed himself there with a hundred\r\nthousand crores of black bears of terrible deeds and faces having the\r\nTilaka mark.[95] And these and many other chiefs of monkey-chiefs,\r\ncountless in number, O king, came there for aiding Rama's cause. And\r\nendued with bodies huge as mountain-peaks and roaring like lions, loud\r\nwas the uproar that was heard there made by those monkeys running\r\nrestlessly from place to place. And some of them looked like\r\nmountain-peaks, and some looked like buffaloes. And some were of the hue\r\nof autumnal clouds and the faces of some were red as vermillion. And some\r\nrose high, and some fell down, and some cut capers, and some scattered\r\nthe dust, as they mustered together from various directions. And that\r\nmonkey army, vast as the sea at full tide, encamped there at Sugriva's\r\nbidding. And after those foremost of monkeys had mustered from every\r\ndirection, the illustrious descendant of Raghu, with Sugriva by his side,\r\nset out in an auspicious moment of a very fair day under a lucky\r\nconstellation, accompanied by that host arrayed in order of battle, as if\r\nfor the purpose of destroying all the worlds. And Hanuman, the son of the\r\nWind-god, was in the van of that host, while the rear was protected by\r\nthe fearless son of Sumitra. And surrounded by the monkey-chiefs, those\r\nprinces of Raghu's house with fingers cased in guana skin, shone, as they\r\nwent, like the Sun and the Moon in the midst of the planets. And that\r\nmonkey host armed with stones and Sala and Tala trees, looked very much\r\nlike a far-extending field of corn under the morning sun. And that mighty\r\narmy, protected by Nala and Nila and Angada and Kratha and Mainda and\r\nDwivida, marched forth for achieving the purpose of Raghava. And\r\nencamping successively, without interruption of any kind, on wide and\r\nhealthy tracts and valleys abounding with fruits and roots and water and\r\nhoney and meat, the monkey host at last reached the shores of the briny\r\nsea. And like unto a second ocean, that mighty army with its countless\r\ncolours, having reached the shores of sea, took up its abode there. Then\r\nthe illustrious son of Dasaratha, addressing Sugriva amongst all those\r\nforemost monkeys, spoke unto him these words that were suited to the\r\noccasion, 'This army is large. The ocean also is difficult to cross. What\r\ncontrivance, therefore, commends itself to thee for crossing the ocean?'\r\nAt these words, many vain-glorious monkeys answered, 'We are fully able\r\nto cross the sea.' This answer, however, was not of much use, as all\r\ncould not avail of that means. Some of the monkeys proposed to cross the\r\nsea in boats, and some in rafts of various kinds. Rama, however,\r\nconciliating them all, said, 'This cannot be. 'The sea here is a full\r\nhundred Yojanas in width. All the monkeys, ye heroes, will not be able to\r\ncross it. This proposal, therefore, that ye have made, is not consonant\r\nto reason. Besides we have not the number of boats necessary for carrying\r\nall our troops. How, again, can one like us raise such obstacles in the\r\nway of the merchants? Our army is very large. The foe wilt make a great\r\nhavoc if a hole is detected. Therefore, to cross the sea in boats and\r\nrafts doth not recommend itself to me. I will, however, pray to the Ocean\r\nfor the necessary means. Foregoing food, I will lie down on the shore. He\r\nwill certainly show himself to me. If, however, he doth not show himself,\r\nI will chastise him then by means of my great weapons that are more\r\nblazing than fire itself and are incapable of being baffled!' Having said\r\nthese words, both Rama and Lakshmana touched water[96] and duly laid\r\nthemselves down on a bed of kusa grass on the seashore. The divine and\r\nillustrious Ocean then that lord of male and female rivers, surrounded by\r\naquatic animals, appeared unto Rama in a vision. And addressing Rama in\r\nsweet accents, the genius of the Ocean, surrounded by countless mines of\r\ngems, said, 'O son of Kausalya, tell me what aid, O bull among men, I am\r\nto render thee! I also have sprung from the race of Ikshwaku[97] and am,\r\ntherefore, a relative of thine!' Rama replied unto him, saying, 'O lord\r\nof rivers, male and female, I desire thee to grant me a way for my\r\ntroops, passing along which I may slay the Ten-headed (Ravana), that\r\nwretch of Pulastya's race! If thou dost not grant the way I beg of thee,\r\nI will then dry thee up by means of my celestial arrows inspired with\r\nmantras!' And hearing these words of Rama, the genius of Varuna's abode,\r\njoining his hands, answered in great affliction, 'I do not desire to put\r\nany obstacle in thy way. I am no foe of thine! Listen, O Rama, to these\r\nwords, and having listened, do what is proper! If, at thy command, I get\r\na way for the passage of thy army, others then, from strength of their\r\nbows, will command me to do the same! In thy army there is a monkey of\r\nthe name of Nala, who is a skilful mechanic. And endued with great\r\nstrength, Nala is the son of Tashtri, the divine artificer of the\r\nUniverse. And whether it is wood, or grass or stone, that he will throw\r\ninto my waters, I will support the same on my surface, and thus wilt thou\r\nhave a bridge (over which to pass)!' And having said these words, the\r\ngenius of the Ocean disappeared. And Rama awaking, called Nala unto him\r\nand said, 'Build thou a bridge over the sea! Thou alone, I am sure, art\r\nable to do it!' And it was by this means that the descendant of\r\nKakutstha's race caused a bridge to be built that was ten Yojanas in\r\nwidth and a hundred Yojanas in length. And to this day that bridge is\r\ncelebrated over all the world by the name of Nala's bridge. And having\r\ncompleted that bridge, Nala, of body huge as a hill, came away at the\r\ncommand of Rama.\r\n\r\n\"And while Rama was on this side of the ocean, the virtuous Vibhishana,\r\nthe brother of the king of the Rakshasas accompanied by four of his\r\ncounsellors, came unto Rama. And the high-souled Rama received him with\r\ndue welcome. Sugriva, however, feared, thinking he might be a spy. The\r\nson of Raghu, meanwhile perfectly satisfied (with Vibhishana) in\r\nconsequence of the sincerity of his exertions and the many indications of\r\nhis good conduct, worshipped him with respect. And he also installed\r\nVibhishana in the sovereignty of all the Rakshasas and made him his own\r\njunior counsellor, and a friend of Lakshmana's. And it was under\r\nVibhishana's guidance, O king, that Rama with all his troops crossed the\r\ngreat ocean by means of that bridge in course of a month. And having\r\ncrossed the ocean and arrived at Lanka, Rama caused its extensive and\r\nnumerous gardens to be devastated by his monkeys. And while Rama's troops\r\nwere there, two of Ravana's counsellors and officers, named Suka and\r\nSarana, who had come as spies, having assumed the shape of monkeys, were\r\nseized by Vibhishana. And when those wanderers of the night assumed their\r\nreal Rakshasa forms, Rama showed them his troop and dismissed them\r\nquietly. And having quartered his troops in those woods that skirted the\r\ncity, Rama then sent the monkey Angada with great wisdom as his envoy to\r\nRavana.\""

Ravana, on the other hand,\r\nplanted in his city many appliances constructed according to the rules of\r\nmilitary science. And his city, naturally impregnable on account of its\r\nstrong ramparts and gate-ways, had seven trenches, that were deep and\r\nfull of water to the brim and that abounded with fishes and sharks and\r\nalligators, made more impregnable still by means of pointed stakes of\r\nKhadira wood. And the ramparts, heaped with stones, were made impregnable\r\nby means of catapults. And the warriors (who guarded the walls) were\r\narmed with earthen pots filled with venomous snakes, and with resinous\r\npowders of many kinds. And they were also armed with clubs, and\r\nfire-brands and arrows and lances and swords and battle-axes. And they\r\nhad also Sataghnis[98] and stout maces steeped in wax.[99] And at all the\r\ngates of the city were planted movable and immovable encampments manned\r\nby large numbers of infantry supported by countless elephants and horses.\r\nAnd Angada, having reached one of the gates of the city, was made known\r\nto the Rakshasas. And he entered the town without suspicion or fear. And\r\nsurrounded by countless Rakshasas, that hero in his beauty looked like\r\nthe Sun himself in the midst of masses of clouds. And having approached\r\nthe hero of Pulastya's race in the midst of his counsellors, the eloquent\r\nAngada saluted the king and began to deliver Rama's message in these\r\nwords, 'That descendant of Raghu, O king, who ruleth at Kosala and whose\r\nrenown hath spread over the whole world, sayeth unto thee these words\r\nsuited to the occasion. Accept thou that message and act according to it!\r\nProvinces and towns, in consequence of their connection with sinful kings\r\nincapable of controlling their souls, are themselves polluted and\r\ndestroyed. By the violent abduction of Sita, thou alone hast injured me!\r\nThou, however, wilt become the cause of death to many unoffending\r\npersons. Possessed of power and filled with pride, thou hast, before\r\nthis, slain many Rishis living in the woods, and insulted the very gods.\r\nThou hast slain also many great kings and many weeping women. For those\r\ntransgressions of thine, retribution is about to overtake thee! I will\r\nslay thee with thy counsellors. Fight and show thy courage![100] O\r\nwanderer of the night, behold the power of my bow, although I am but a\r\nman! Release Sita, the daughter of Janaka! If thou dost not release her,\r\nI shall make the Earth divested of all Rakshasas with my keen-edged\r\narrows!' Hearing these defiant words of the enemy, king Ravana bore them\r\nill, becoming senseless with wrath. And thereupon four Rakshasas skilled\r\nin reading every sign of their master, seized Angada like four hawks\r\nseizing a tiger. With those Rakshasas, however, holding him fast by his\r\nlimbs, Angada leaped upwards and alighted on the palace terrace. And as\r\nhe leaped up with a great force, those wanderers of the night fell down\r\nthe earth, and bruised by the violence of the fall, had their ribs\r\nbroken. And from the golden terrace on which he had alighted, he took a\r\ndownward leap. And overleaping the walls of Lanka, he alighted to where\r\nhis comrades were. And approaching the presence of the lord of Kosala and\r\ninforming him of everything, the monkey Angada endued with great energy\r\nretired to refresh himself, dismissed with due respect by Rama.\r\n\r\nThe descendant of Raghu then caused the ramparts of Lanka to be broken\r\ndown by a united attack of all those monkeys endued with the speed of the\r\nwind. Then Lakshmana, with Vibhishana and the king of the bears marching\r\nin the van, blew up the southern gate of the city that was almost\r\nimpregnable. Rama then attacked Lanka with a hundred thousand crores of\r\nmonkeys, all possessed of great skill in battle, and endued with reddish\r\ncomplexions like those of young camels. And those crores of greyish bears\r\nwith long arms, and legs and huge paws, and generally supporting\r\nthemselves on their broad haunches, were also urged on to support the\r\nattack. And in consequence of those monkeys leaping up and leaping down\r\nand leaping in transverse directions, the Sun himself, his bright disc\r\ncompletely shaded, became invisible for the dust they raised. And the\r\ncitizens of Lanka beheld the wall of their town assume all over a tawny\r\nhue, covered by monkeys of complexions yellow as the ears of paddy, and\r\ngrey as Shirisha flowers, and red as the rising Sun, and white as flax or\r\nhemp. And the Rakshasas, O king, with their wives and elders, were struck\r\nwith wonders at that sight. And the monkey warriors began to pull down\r\npillars made of precious stones and the terraces and tops of palatial\r\nmansions. And breaking into fragments the propellers of catapults and\r\nother engines, they began to cast them about in all directions. And\r\ntaking up the Sataghnis along with the discs, the clubs, and stones, they\r\nthrew them down into the city with great force and loud noise. And\r\nattacked thus by the monkeys, those Rakshasas that had been placed on the\r\nwalls to guard them, fled precipitately by hundreds and thousands.\r\n\r\n\"Then hundreds of thousands of Rakshasas, of terrible mien, and capable\r\nof assuming any form at will, came out at the command of the king. And\r\npouring a perfect shower of arrows and driving the denizens of the\r\nforest, those warriors, displaying great prowess, adorned the ramparts.\r\nAnd soon those wanderers of the night, looking like masses of flesh, and\r\nof terrible mien, forced the monkeys to leave the walls. And mangled by\r\nthe enemies' lances, numerous monkey-chiefs fell down from the ramparts,\r\nand crushed by the falling columns and gate-ways, numerous Rakshasas also\r\nfell down to rise no more. And the monkeys and the brave Rakshasas that\r\ncommenced to eat up the foe, struggled, seizing one another by the hair,\r\nand mangling and tearing one another with their nails and teeth. And the\r\nmonkeys and the Rakshasas roared and yelled frightfully, and while many\r\nof both parties were slain and fell down to rise no more, neither side\r\ngave up the contest. And Rama continued all the while to shower a thick\r\ndownpour of arrows like the very clouds. And the arrows he shot,\r\nenveloping Lanka, killed large numbers of Rakshasas. And the son of\r\nSumitra, too, that mighty bowman incapable of being fatigued in battle,\r\nnaming particular Rakshasas stationed on the ramparts, slew them with his\r\nclothyard shafts. And then the monkey host, having achieved success was\r\nwithdrawn at the command of Rama, after it had thus pulled down the\r\nfortifications of Lanka and made all objects within the city capable of\r\nbeing aimed at by the besieging force.\""

And\r\nseeing those foremost of monkeys suddenly give way, that tiger among\r\nmonkeys, Hanuman, the son of Pavana, began to advance. And beholding the\r\nson of Pavana staying still on the field of battle, the retreating\r\nmonkeys, O king, one and all quickly rallied.

And having awaked him with great\r\nefforts, the Rakshasa king, still afflicted with anxiety, addressed the\r\nmighty Kumbhakarna and said unto him when seated at his ease on his bed,\r\nhaving perfectly recovered consciousness and self-possession, these\r\nwords, 'Thou, indeed, art happy, O Kumbhakarna, that canst enjoy profound\r\nand undisturbed repose, unconscious of the terrible calamity that hath\r\novertaken us! Rama with his monkey host hath crossed the Ocean by a\r\nbridge and disregarding us all is waging a terrible war (against us). I\r\nhave stealthily brought away his wife Sita, the daughter of Janaka. and\r\nit is to recover her that he hath come hither, after having made a bridge\r\nover the great Ocean. Our great kinsmen also, Prahasta and others, have\r\nalready been slain by him. And, O scourge of thy enemies, there is not\r\nanother person, save thee, that can slay Rama! Therefore, O warrior,\r\nputting on thy armour, do thou set out this day for the purpose of\r\nvanquishing Rama and his followers! The two younger brothers of Dushana,\r\nviz., Vajravega and Promathin, will join thee with their forces!' And\r\nhaving said this unto the mighty Kumbhakarna. the Rakshasa king gave\r\ninstructions to Vajravega and Promathin as to what they should do. And\r\naccepting his advice, those two warlike brothers of Dushana quickly\r\nmarched out of the city, preceded by Kumbhakarna.\""

And passing them by with the object of seeking out Rama, he\r\nbeheld the son of Sumitra standing at his post, bow in hand. Then the\r\nmonkey warriors, speedily advancing towards him, surrounded him on all\r\nsides. And then they commenced to strike him with numberless large trees.\r\nAnd many amongst them fearlessly began to tear his body with their nails.\r\nAnd those monkeys began to fight with him in various ways approved by the\r\nlaws of warfare. And they soon overwhelmed that chief of the Rakshasas\r\nwith a shower of terrible weapons of various kinds. And attacked by them\r\nthus, Kumbhakarna only laughed at them and began to eat them up. And he\r\ndevoured those foremost of monkeys known by the name of Chala, and\r\nChandachala, and Vajravahu. And beholding that fearful act of the\r\nRakshasa, other monkeys were frightened and set forth a loud wail of\r\nfear. And hearing the screams of those monkey-leaders, Sugriva boldly\r\nadvanced towards Kumbhakarna. And that high-souled king of the monkeys\r\nswiftly approaching the Rakshasa, violently struck him on the head with\r\nthe trunk of a Sala tree. And though the high-souled Sugriva always\r\nprompt in action broke that Sala tree on the head of Kumbhakarna, he\r\nfailed to make any impression on that Rakshasa. And then, as if roused\r\nfrom his torpor by that blow, Kumbhakarna stretching forth his arms\r\nseized Sugriva by main force. And beholding Sugriva dragged away by the\r\nRakshasa, the heroic son of Sumitra, that delighter of his friends,\r\nrushed towards Kumbhakarna. And that slayer of hostile heroes, Lakshmana,\r\nadvancing towards Kumbhakarna, discharged at him an impetuous and mighty\r\narrow furnished with golden wings. And that arrow, cutting through his\r\ncoat of mail and penetrating into his body, passed through it outright\r\nand struck into the earth, stained with the Rakshasa's blood. Kumbhakarna\r\nthen, having his breast thus bored through, released the king of monkeys.\r\nAnd taking up a huge mass of stone as his weapon, the mighty warrior\r\nKumbhakarna then rushed towards the son of Sumitra, aiming it at him. And\r\nas the Rakshasa rushed towards him, Lakshmana cut off his upraised arms\r\nby means of a couple of keen-edged shafts furnished with heads resembling\r\nrazors. But as soon as the two arms of the Rakshasa were thus cut off,\r\ndouble that number of arms soon appeared on his person. Sumitra's son,\r\nhowever, displaying his skill in weapon, soon by means of similar arrows\r\ncut off those arms also, each of which had seized a mass of stone. At\r\nthis, that Rakshasa assumed a form enormously huge and furnished with\r\nnumerous heads and legs and arms. Then the son of Sumitra rived, with a\r\nBrahma weapon, that warrior looking like an assemblage of hill. And rent\r\nby means of that celestial weapon, that Rakshasa fell on the field of\r\nbattle like a huge tree with spreading branches suddenly consumed by\r\nheaven's thunderbolt. And beholding Kumbhakarna endued with great\r\nactivity and resembling the Asura Vritra himself, deprived of life and\r\nprostrated on the field of battle, the Rakshasa warriors fled in fear.\r\nAnd beholding the Rakshasa warriors running away from the field of\r\nbattle, the younger brother of Dushana, rallying them, rushed in great\r\nwrath upon the son of Sumitra. Sumitra's son, however, with a loud roar,\r\nreceived with his winged shafts both those wrathful warriors, Vajravega\r\nand Promathin, rushing towards him. The battle then, O son of Pritha,\r\nthat took place between those two younger brothers of Dushana on the one\r\nhand and the intelligent Lakshmana on the other, was exceedingly furious\r\nand made the bristles of the spectators stand on end. And Lakshmana\r\noverwhelmed the two Rakshasas with a perfect shower of arrows. And those\r\ntwo Rakshasa heroes, on the other hand, both of them excited with fury,\r\ncovered Lakshmana with an arrowy hail. And that terrible encounter\r\nbetween Vajravega and Promathin and the mighty-armed Lakshmana lasted for\r\na short while. And Hanumana, the son of Pavana, taking up a mountain\r\npeak, rushed towards one of the brothers, and with that weapon took the\r\nlife of the Rakshasa Vajravega. And that mighty monkey, Nala, also, with\r\na large mass of rock, crushed Promathin, that other younger brother of\r\nDushana. The deadly struggle, however, between the soldiers of Rama and\r\nRavana, rushing against one another, instead of coming to an end even\r\nafter this, raged on as before. And hundreds of Rakshasas were slain by\r\nthe denizens of the forest, while many of the latter were slain by the\r\nformer. The loss, however, in killed, of the Rakshasas was far greater\r\nthan that of the monkeys."

My\r\ngood son, it was by thee that this blazing fame of mine had been acquired\r\nby vanquishing in battle that wielder of the thunderbolt, the\r\nthousand-eyed Lord of Sachi! Having the power of appearing and vanishing\r\nat thy will, slay thou, O smiter of foes, my enemies by means, O thou\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, of thy celestial arrows received as\r\nboons (from the gods)! Rama and Lakshmana and Sugriva are incapable of\r\nenduring the bare touch of thy weapons. What shall I say, therefore, of\r\ntheir followers? That cessation of hostilities which could not be brought\r\nabout by either Prahasta or Kumbhakarna in battle, be it thine, O\r\nmighty-armed one, to bring about! Slaying my enemies with all their army\r\nby means of thy keen-edged shafts, enhance my joy to-day, O son, as thou\r\ndidst once before by vanquishing Vasava!' Thus addressed by him. Indrajit\r\nsaid--So be it,--and encased in mail he quickly ascended his chariot, and\r\nproceeded, O king, towards the field of battle. And then that bull\r\namongst Rakshasas loudly announcing his own name, challenged Lakshmana\r\nendued with auspicious marks, to a single combat. And Lakshmana, thus\r\nchallenged, rushed towards that Rakshasa, with his bow and arrows, and\r\nstriking terror into his adversary's heart by means of the flapping of\r\nhis bow-string on the leathern case of his left hand. And the encounter\r\nthat took place between those warriors that defied each other's prowess\r\nand each of whom was desirous of vanquishing the other, and both of whom\r\nwere conversant with celestial weapons, was terrible in the extreme. But\r\nwhen the son of Ravana found that he could not by his arrows gain any\r\nadvantage over his adversary, that foremost of mighty warriors mustered\r\nall his energy. And Indrajit then began to hurl at Lakshmana with great\r\nforce numberless javelins. The son of Sumitra, however, cut them into\r\nfragments by means of his own keen-edged arrows. And those javelins, thus\r\ncut into pieces by the keen-edged arrows of Lakshmana, dropped down upon\r\nthe ground. Then the handsome Angada, the son of Vali, taking up a large\r\ntree, rushed impetuously at Indrajit and struck him with it on the head.\r\nUndaunted at this, Indrajit of mighty energy sought to smite Angada with\r\na lance. Just at that juncture, however, Lakshmana cut into pieces the\r\nlance taken up by Ravana's son. The son of Ravana then took up a mace and\r\nstruck on the left flank that foremost of monkeys, the heroic Angada who\r\nwas then staying close beside him. Angada, the powerful son of Vali,\r\nlittle recking that stroke, hurled at Indrajit a mighty Sal stem. And\r\nhurled in wrath by Angada for the destruction of Indrajit, that tree, O\r\nson of Pritha, destroyed Indrajit's chariot along with his horses and\r\ncharioteer. And thereupon jumping from his horseless and driverless car,\r\nthe son of Ravana disappeared from sight, O king, by aid of his powers of\r\nillusion. And beholding that Rakshasa, abundantly endued with powers of\r\nillusion, disappear so suddenly, Rama proceeded towards that spot and\r\nbegan to protect his troops with care. Indrajit, however, with arrows,\r\nobtained as boons from the gods, began to pierce both Rama and mighty\r\nLakshmana in every part of their bodies. Then the heroic Rama and\r\nLakshmana both continued to contend with their arrows against Ravana's\r\nson who had made himself invisible by his powers of illusion. But\r\nIndrajit continued to shower in wrath all over those lions among men his\r\nkeen-edged shafts by hundreds and thousands. And seeking that invisible\r\nwarrior who was ceaselessly showering his arrows, the monkeys penetrated\r\ninto every part of the firmament, armed with huge masses of stone. Them\r\nas well as the two brothers, however, the invisible Rakshasa began to\r\nafflict with his shafts. Indeed, the son of Ravana, concealing himself by\r\nhis powers of illusion, furiously attacked the monkey host. And the\r\nheroic brothers Rama and Lakshmana, pierced all over with arrows, dropped\r\ndown on the ground like the Sun and the Moon fallen down from the\r\nfirmament.'\""

And tied by Indrajit\r\non the field of battle by means of that arrowy net, those heroic tigers\r\namong men resembled a couple of hawks immured in a cage. And beholding\r\nthose heroes prostrate on the ground pierced with hundreds of arrows,\r\nSugriva with all the monkeys stood surrounding them on all sides. And the\r\nking of the monkeys stood there, accompanied by Sushena and Mainda and\r\nDwivida, and Kumuda and Angada and Hanuman and Nila and Tara and Nala.\r\nAnd Vibhishana, having achieved success in another part of the field,\r\nsoon arrived at that spot, and roused those heroes from insensibility,\r\nawakening them by means of the weapon called, Prajna.[101] Then Sugriva\r\nsoon extracted the arrows from their bodies. And by means of that most\r\nefficacious medicine called the Visalya[102], applied with celestial\r\nmantras, those human heroes regained their consciousness. And the arrow\r\nhaving been extracted from their bodies, those mighty warriors in a\r\nmoment rose from their recumbent posture, their pains and fatigue\r\nthoroughly alleviated. And beholding Rama the descendant of Ikshwaku's\r\nrace, quite at his ease, Vibhishana, O son of Pritha, joining his hands;\r\ntold him these words, 'O chastiser of foes, at the command of the king of\r\nthe Guhyakas, a Guhyaka hath come from the White mountains, bringing with\r\nhim his water![103] O great king, this water is a present to thee from\r\nKuvera, so that all creatures that are invisible may, O chastiser of\r\nfoes, become visible to thee! This water laved over the eyes will make\r\nevery invisible creature visible to thee, as also to any other person to\r\nwhom thou mayst give it!'--Saying--So be it,--Rama took that sacred\r\nwater, and sanctified his own eyes therewith. And the high-minded\r\nLakshmana also did the same. And Sugriva and Jambuvan, and Hanuman and\r\nAngada, and Mainda and Dwivida, and Nila and many other foremost of the\r\nmonkeys, laved their eyes with that water. And thereupon it exactly\r\nhappened as Vibhishana had said, for, O Yudhishthira, soon did the eyes\r\nof all these became capable of beholding things that could not be seen by\r\nthe unassisted eye!\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Indrajit, after the success he had won, went to his father.\r\nAnd having informed him of the feats he had achieved, he speedily\r\nreturned to the field of battle and placed himself at the van of his\r\narmy. The son of Sumitra then, under Vibhishana's guidance, rushed\r\ntowards that wrathful son of Ravana coming back, from desire of battle,\r\nto lead the attack. And Lakshmana, excited to fury and receiving a hint\r\nfrom Vibhishana, and desiring to slay Indrajit who had not completed his\r\ndaily sacrifice, smote with his arrows that warrior burning to achieve\r\nsuccess. And desirous of vanquishing each other, the encounter that took\r\nplace between them was exceedingly wonderful like that (in days of yore)\r\nbetween the Lord of celestials and Prahrada. And Indrajit pierced the son\r\nof Sumitra with arrows penetrating into his very vitals. And the son of\r\nSumitra also pierced Ravana's son with arrows of fiery energy. And\r\npierced with Lakshmana's arrows, the son of Ravana became senseless with\r\nwrath. And he shot at Lakshmana eight shafts fierce as venomous snakes.\r\nListen now, O Yudhishthira, as I tell thee how the heroic son of Sumitra\r\nthen took his adversary's life by means of three winged arrows possessed\r\nof the energy and effulgence of fire! With one of these, he severed from\r\nIndrajit's body that arm of his enemy which had grasped the bow. With the\r\nsecond he caused that other arm which had held the arrows, to drop down\r\non the ground. With the third that was bright and possessed of the\r\nkeenest edge, he cut off his head decked with a beautiful nose and bright\r\nwith ear-rings. And shorn of arms and head, the trunk became fearful to\r\nbehold. And having slain the foe thus, that foremost of mighty men then\r\nslew with his arrows the charioteer of his adversary. And the horses then\r\ndragged away the empty chariot into the city. And Ravana then beheld that\r\ncar without his son on it. And hearing that his son had been slain,\r\nRavana suffered his heart to be overpowered with grief. And under the\r\ninfluence of extreme grief and affliction, the king of the Rakshasas\r\nsuddenly cherished the desire of killing the princess of Mithila. And\r\nseizing a sword, the wicked Rakshasa hastily ran towards that lady\r\nstaying within the Asoka wood longing to behold her lord. Then Avindhya\r\nbeholding that sinful purpose of the wicked wretch, appeased his fury.\r\nListen, O Yudhishthira, to the reasons urged by Avindhya! That wise\r\nRakshasa said, 'Placed as thou art on the blazing throne of an empire, it\r\nbehoveth thee not to slay a woman! Besides, this woman is already slain,\r\nconsidering that she is a captive in thy power! I think, she would not be\r\nslain if only her body were destroyed. Slay thou her husband! He being\r\nslain, she will be slain too! Indeed, not even he of an hundred\r\nsacrifices (Indra) is thy equal in prowess! The gods with Indra at their\r\nhead, had repeatedly been affrighted by thee in battle!' With these and\r\nmany other words of the same import, Avindhya succeeded in appeasing\r\nRavana. And the latter did, indeed, listen to his counsellor's speech.\r\nAnd that wanderer of the night, then, resolved to give battle himself\r\nsheathed his sword, and issued orders for preparing his chariot.'\""

And those foremost of monkeys and bears began to\r\nexterminate with trunks of trees, the soldiers of the Ten-necked\r\n(Ravana), in his every sight. And beholding the enemy slaughtering his\r\ntroops, the Rakshasa king, Ravana, possessed of great powers of illusion,\r\nbegan to put them forth. And forth from his body began to spring hundreds\r\nand thousands of Rakshasas armed with arrows and lances and double-edged\r\nswords in hand. Rama, however, with a celestial weapon slew all those\r\nRakshasas. The king of the Rakshasas then once more put forth his prowess\r\nof illusion. The Ten-faced, producing from his body numerous warriors\r\nresembling, O Bharata, both Rama and Lakshmana, rushed towards the two\r\nbrothers. And then those Rakshasas, hostile to Rama and Lakshmana and\r\narmed with bows and arrows, rushed towards Rama, and beholding that power\r\nof illusion put forth by the king of Rakshasas, that descendant of\r\nIkshwaku's race, the son of Sumitra, addressed Rama in these heroic\r\nwords, 'Slay those Rakshasas, those wretches with forms like thy own!'\r\nAnd Rama, thereupon slew those and other Rakshasas of forms resembling\r\nhis own. And that time Matali, the charioteer of Indra, approached Rama\r\non the field of battle, with a car effulgent as the Sun and unto which\r\nwere yoked horses of a tawny hue. And Matali said, 'O son of Kakutstha's\r\nrace, this excellent and victorious car, unto which have been yoked this\r\npair of tawny horses, belonging to the Lord of celestials! It is on this\r\nexcellent car, O tiger among men, that Indra hath slain in battle\r\nhundreds of Daityas and Danavas! Therefore, O tiger among men, do thou,\r\nriding on the car driven by me, quickly slay Ravana in battle! Do not\r\ndelay in achieving this!' Thus addressed by him, the descendant of\r\nRaghu's race, however, doubted the truthful words of Matali, thinking\r\nthis is another illusion produced by the Rakshasas--Vibhishana then\r\naddressed him saying, 'This, O tiger among men, is no illusion of the\r\nwicked Ravana! Ascend thou this chariot quickly, for this, O thou of\r\ngreat effulgence, belongeth to Indra!' The descendant of Kakutstha then\r\ncheerfully said unto Vibhishana, 'So be it', and riding on that car,\r\nrushed wrathfully upon Ravana. And when Ravana, too, rushed against his\r\nantagonist, a loud wail of woe was set up by the creatures of the Earth,\r\nwhile the celestials in heaven sent forth a leonine roar accompanied by\r\nbeating of large drums. The encounter then that took place between the\r\nTen-necked Rakshasa and that prince of Raghu's race, was fierce in the\r\nextreme. Indeed, that combat between them hath no parallel elsewhere. And\r\nRakshasa hurled at Rama a terrible javelin looking like Indra's\r\nthunderbolt and resembling a Brahmana's curse on the point of\r\nutterance.[104] Rama, however, quickly cut into fragments that javelin by\r\nmeans of his sharp arrows. And beholding that most difficult feat, Ravana\r\nwas struck with fear. But soon his wrath was excited and the Ten-necked\r\nhero began to shower on Rama whetted arrows by thousands and tens of\r\nthousands and countless weapons of various kinds, such as rockets and\r\njavelins and maces and battle-axes and darts of various kinds and\r\nShataghnis and whetted shafts. And beholding that terrible form of\r\nillusion displayed by the Ten-necked Rakshasa, the monkeys fled in fear\r\nin all directions. Then the descendant of Kakutstha, taking out of his\r\nquiver an excellent arrow furnished with handsome wings and golden\r\nfeathers and a bright and beautiful head, fixed it on the bow with\r\nBrahmastra mantra. And beholding that excellent arrow transformed by\r\nRama, with proper mantras into a Brahma weapon, the celestials and the\r\nGandharvas with Indra at their head, began to rejoice. And the gods and\r\nthe Danavas and the Kinnaras were led by the display of that Brahma\r\nweapon to regard the life of their Rakshasa foe almost closed. Then Rama\r\nshot that terrible weapon of unrivalled energy, destined to compass\r\nRavana's death, and resembling the curse of a Brahmana on the point of\r\nutterance. And as soon, O Bharata, as that arrow was shot by Rama from\r\nhis bow drawn to a circle, the Rakshasa king with his chariot and\r\ncharioteer and horses blazed up, surrounded on all sides by a terrific\r\nfire. And beholding Ravana slain by Rama of famous achievements, the\r\ncelestials, with the Gandharvas and the Charanas, rejoiced exceedingly.\r\nAnd deprived of universal dominion by the energy of the Brahma weapon,\r\nthe five elements forsook the illustrious Ravana.

And, O thou of unfading glory, the firmament at\r\nthat time looked as if a great festival was being celebrated.\r\n\r\n\"And having slain the Ten-necked Rakshasa, the lord Rama of worldwide\r\nfame, that conqueror of hostile cities, bestowed Lanka on Vibhishana.\r\nThen that old and wise counsellor (of Ravana) known by the name of\r\nAvindhya, with Sita walking before him but behind Vibhishana who was at\r\nthe front, came out of the city. And with great humility Avindhya said\r\nunto the illustrious descendant of Kakutstha, 'O illustrious one, accept\r\nthou this goddess, Janaka's daughter of excellent conduct!' Hearing these\r\nwords, the descendant of Ikshwaku's race alighted from his excellent\r\nchariot and beheld Sita bathed in tears. And beholding that beautiful\r\nlady seated within her vehicle, afflicted with grief, besmeared with\r\nfilth, with matted locks on head, and attired in dirty robes, Rama,\r\nafraid of the loss of his honour, said unto her, 'Daughter of Videha, go\r\nwithersover thou likest! Thou art now free! What should have been done by\r\nme, hath been done! O blessed lady, owning me for thy husband, it is not\r\nmeet that thou shouldst grow old in the abode of the Rakshasa! It is for\r\nthis I have slain that wanderer of the night! But how can one like us,\r\nacquainted with every truth of morality embrace even for a moment a woman\r\nthat had fallen into other's hands? O princess of Mithila whether thou\r\nart chaste or unchaste, I dare not enjoy thee, now that thou art like\r\nsacrificial butter lapped by a dog!' Hearing these cruel words, that\r\nadorable girl suddenly fell down in great affliction of heart, like a\r\nplantain tree severed from its roots. And the colour that was suffusing\r\nher face in consequence of the joy she had felt, quickly disappeared,\r\nlike watery particles on a mirror blown thereon by the breath of the\r\nmouth. And hearing these words of Rama, all the monkeys also with\r\nLakshmana became still as dead. Then the divine and pure-souled Brahma of\r\nfour faces, that Creator of the Universe himself sprung from a lotus,\r\nshowed himself on his car to Raghu's son. And Sakra and Agni and Vayu,\r\nand Yama and Varuna and the illustrious Lord of the Yakshas, and the holy\r\nRishis, and king Dasaratha also in a celestial and effulgent form and on\r\ncar drawn by swans, showed themselves. And then the firmament crowded\r\nwith celestials and Gandharvas became as beautiful as the autumnal welkin\r\nspangled with stars. And rising up from the ground, the blessed and\r\nfamous princess of Videha, in the midst of those present spoke unto Rama\r\nof wide chest, these words, 'O prince, I impute no fault to thee, for\r\nthou art well acquainted with the behaviour that one should adopt towards\r\nboth men and women. But hear thou these words of mine! The ever-moving\r\nAir is always present within every creature. If I have sinned, let him\r\nforsake my vital forces! If I have sinned, Oh, then let Fire, and Water,\r\nand Space, and Earth, like Air (whom I have already invoked), also\r\nforsake my vital forces! And as, O hero, I have never, even in my dreams,\r\ncherished the image of any other person, so be thou my lord as appointed\r\nby the gods.' After Sita had spoken, a sacred voice, resounding through\r\nthe whole of that region, was heard in the skies, gladdening the hearts\r\nof the high-souled monkeys. And the Wind-god was heard to say, O son of\r\nRaghu, what Sita hath said is true! I am the god of Wind. The princess of\r\nMithila is sinless! Therefore, O king, be united with thy wife!' And the\r\ngod of Fire said, 'O son of Raghu, I dwell within the bodies of all\r\ncreatures! O descendant of Kakutstha, the princess of Mithila is not\r\nguilty of even the minutest fault!' And Varuna then said, 'O son of\r\nRaghu, the humours in every creature's body derive their existence from\r\nme! I tell thee, let the princess of Mithila be accepted by thee!' And\r\nBrahma himself then said, 'O descendant of Kakutstha, O son, in thee that\r\nart honest and pure and conversant with the duties of royal sages, this\r\nconduct is not strange. Listen, however, to these words of mine! Thou\r\nhast, O hero, slain this enemy of the gods, the Gandharvas, the Nagas,\r\nthe Yakshas, the Danavas, and the great Rishis! It was through my grace\r\nthat he had hitherto been unslayable of all creatures. And indeed, it was\r\nfor some reason that I had tolerated him for some time! The wretch,\r\nhowever, abducted Sita for his own destruction. And as regards Sita, I\r\nprotected her through Nalakuvera's curse. For that person had cursed\r\nRavana of old, saying, that if he ever approached an unwilling woman, his\r\nhead should certainly be split into a hundred fragments. Let no\r\nsuspicion, therefore, be thine! O thou of great glory, accept thy wife!\r\nThou hast indeed, achieved a mighty feat for the benefit of the gods, O\r\nthou that art of divine effulgence!' And last of all Dasaratha said, 'I\r\nhave been gratified with thee, O child! Blessed be thou, I am thy father\r\nDasaratha! I command thee to take back thy wife, and rule thy kingdom, O\r\nthou foremost of men!' Rama then replied, 'If thou art my father, I\r\nsalute thee with reverence, O king of kings! I shall indeed, return, at\r\nthy command, to the delightful city of Ayodhya!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed, his father, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, gladly answered Rama, the corners of whose eyes were of a reddish\r\nhue, saying, 'Return to Ayodhya and rule thou that kingdom! O thou of\r\ngreat glory, thy fourteen years (of exile) have been completed.' Thus\r\naddressed by Dasaratha, Rama bowed to the gods, and saluted by his\r\nfriends he was united with his wife, like the Lord of the celestials with\r\nthe daughter of Puloman. And that chastiser of foes then gave a boon to\r\nAvindhya. And he also bestowed both riches and honours on the Rakshasa\r\nwoman named Trijata. And when Brahma with all the celestials having India\r\nat their head, said unto Rama, 'O thou that ownest Kausalya for thy\r\nmother, what boons after thy heart shall we grant thee?' Rama, thereupon,\r\nprayed them to grant him firm adherence to virtues and invincibility in\r\nrespect of all foes. And he also asked for the restoration to life of all\r\nthose monkeys that had been slain by the Rakshasas, and after Brahma had\r\nsaid--So be it, those monkeys, O king, restored to life, rose up from the\r\nfield of battle, and Sita too, of great good fortune, granted unto\r\nHanuman a boon, saying, 'Let thy life, O son, last as long as (the fame\r\nof) Rama's achievements! And, O Hanuman of yellow eyes, let celestial\r\nviands and drinks be ever available to thee through my grace!'\r\n\r\n\"Then the celestials with Indra at their head all disappeared in the very\r\nsight of those warriors of spotless achievements. And beholding Rama\r\nunited with the daughter of Janaka, the charioteer of Sakra, highly\r\npleased, addressed him in the midst of friends, and said these words, 'O\r\nthou of prowess that can never be baffled thou hast dispelled the sorrow\r\nof the celestials, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Asuras, the Nagas,\r\nand human beings! As long, therefore, as the Earth will hold together, so\r\nlong will all creatures with the celestials, the Asuras, the Gandharvas,\r\nthe Yakshas, the Rakshasas, and the Pannagas, speak of thee.' And having\r\nsaid these words unto Rama, Matali worshipped that son of Raghu, and\r\nhaving obtained the leave of that foremost of wielders of weapons, he\r\nwent away, on that same chariot of solar effulgence. And Rama also, with\r\nSumatra's son and Vibhishana, and accompanied by all the monkeys with\r\nSugriva at their head, placing Sita in the van and having made\r\narrangements for the protection of Lanka, recrossed the ocean by the same\r\nbridge. And he rode on that beautiful and sky-ranging chariot called the\r\nPushpaka that was capable of going everywhere at the will of the rider.\r\nAnd that subduer of passions was surrounded by his principal counsellors\r\nin order of precedence. And arriving at that part of the sea-shore where\r\nhe had formerly laid himself down, the virtuous king, with all the\r\nmonkeys, pitched his temporary abode. And the son of Raghu then, bringing\r\nthe monkeys before him in due time, worshipped them all, and gratifying\r\nthem with presents of jewels and gems, dismissed them one after another.\r\nAnd after all the monkey-chiefs, and the apes with bovine tails, and the\r\nbears, had gone away, Rama re-entered Kishkindhya with Sugriva. And\r\naccompanied by both Vibhishana and Sugriva, Rama re-entered Kishkindhya\r\nriding on the Pushpaka car and showing the princess of Videha the woods\r\nalong the way. And having arrived at Kishkindhya, Rama, that foremost of\r\nall smiters, installed the successful Angada as prince-regent of the\r\nkingdom. And accompanied by the same friends as also by Sumitra's son,\r\nRama proceeded towards his city along the same path by which he had come.\r\nAnd having reached the city of Ayodhya, the king despatched Hanuman\r\nthence as envoy to Bharata. And Hanuman, having ascertained Bharata's\r\nintentions from external indications, gave him the good news (of Rama's\r\narrival). And after the son of Pavana had come back, Rama entered\r\nNandigrama. And having entered that town, Rama beheld Bharata besmeared\r\nwith filth and attired in rags and seated with his elder brother's\r\nsandals placed before him. And being united, O bull of Bharata race, with\r\nboth Bharata and Shatrughna, the mighty son of Raghu, along with\r\nSumitra's son, began to rejoice exceedingly. And Bharata and Shatrughna\r\nalso, united with their eldest brother, and beholding Sita, both derived\r\ngreat pleasure. And Bharata then, after having worshipped his returned\r\nbrother, made over to him with great pleasure, the kingdom that had been\r\nin his hands as a sacred trust. And Vasishtha and Vamadeva then together\r\ninstalled that hero in the sovereignty (of Ayodhya) at the eighth\r\nMuhurta[105] of the day under the asterism called Sravana. And after his\r\ninstallation was over, Rama gave leave to well-pleased Sugriva the king\r\nof the monkeys, along with all his followers, as also to rejoicing\r\nVibhishana of Pulastya's race, to return to their respective abodes. And\r\nhaving worshipped them with various articles of enjoyment, and done\r\neverything that was suitable to the occasion, Rama dismissed those\r\nfriends of his with a sorrowful heart. And the son of Raghu then, having\r\nworshiped that Pushpaka chariot, joyfully gave it back unto Vaisravana.\r\nAnd then assisted by the celestial Rishi (Vasishtha), Rama performed on\r\nthe banks of the Gomati ten horse-sacrifices without obstruction of any\r\nkind and with treble presents unto Brahmanas.'\""

When we were afflicted at the game of the dice by those\r\nwicked-souled ones, it was Krishna that delivered us. And she was\r\nforcibly carried off from the forest by Jayadratha. Hast thou even seen\r\nor heard of any chaste and exalted lady that resembleth this daughter of\r\nDrupada?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'Listen, O king, how the exalted merit of chaste\r\nladies, O Yudhishthira, was completely obtained by a princess named\r\nSavitri. There was a king among the Madras, who was virtuous and highly\r\npious. And he always ministered unto the Brahmanas, and was high-souled\r\nand firm in promise. And he was of subdued senses and given to\r\nsacrifices. And he was the foremost of givers, and was able, and beloved\r\nby both the citizens and the rural population. And the name of that lord\r\nof Earth was Aswapati. And he was intent on the welfare of all beings.\r\nAnd that forgiving (monarch) of truthful speech and subdued senses was\r\nwithout issue. And when he got old, he was stricken with grief at this.\r\nAnd with the object of raising offspring, he observed rigid vows and\r\nbegan to live upon frugal fare, having recourse to the Brahmacharya mode\r\nof life, and restraining his senses. And that best of kings, (daily)\r\noffering ten thousand oblations to the fire, recited Mantras in honour of\r\nSavitri[106] and ate temperately at the sixth hour. And he passed\r\neighteen years, practising such vows. Then when the eighteen years were\r\nfull, Savitri was pleased (with him). And O king, issuing with great\r\ndelight, in embodied form, from the Agnihotra fire, the goddess showed\r\nherself to that king. And intent on conferring boons, she spoke these\r\nwords unto the monarch, 'I have been gratified, O king, with thy\r\nBrahmacharya practices, thy purity and self-restraint and observance of\r\nvows, and all thy endeavours and veneration! Do thou, O mighty king. O\r\nAswapati, ask for the boon that thou desirest! Thou ought, however, by no\r\nmeans show any disregard for virtue.' Thereat Aswapati said, 'It is with\r\nthe desire of attaining virtue that I have been engaged in this task. O\r\ngoddess, may many sons be born unto me worthy of my race! If thou art\r\npleased with me, O goddess, I ask for this boon. The twice-born ones have\r\nassured me that great merit lieth in having offspring!' Savitri replied,\r\n'O king, having already learnt this thy intention, I had spoken unto that\r\nlord, the Grandsire, about thy sons. Through the favour granted by the\r\nSelf-create, there shall speedily be born unto thee on earth a daughter\r\nof great energy. It behoveth thee not to make any reply. Well-pleased, I\r\ntell thee this at the command of the Grandsire.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'Having accepted Savitri's words and saying, 'So be\r\nit!' the king again gratified her and said, 'May this happen soon!' On\r\nSavitri vanishing away, the monarch entered his own city. And that hero\r\nbegan to live in his kingdom, ruling his subjects righteously. And when\r\nsome time had elapsed, that king, observant of vows, begat offspring on\r\nhis eldest queen engaged in the practice of virtue. And then, O bull of\r\nthe Bharata race, the embryo in the womb of the princess of Malava\r\nincreased like the lord of stars in the heavens during the lighted\r\nfortnight. And when the time came, she brought forth a daughter furnished\r\nwith lotus-like eyes. And that best of monarchs, joyfully performed the\r\nusual ceremonies on her behalf. And as she had been bestowed with delight\r\nby the goddess Savitri by virtue of the oblations offered in honour of\r\nthat goddess, both her father, and the Brahmanas named her Savitri. And\r\nthe king's daughter grew like unto Sree herself in an embodied form. And\r\nin due time, that damsel attained her puberty. And beholding that\r\ngraceful maiden of slender waist and ample hips, and resembling a golden\r\nimage, people thought, 'We have received a goddess.' And overpowered by\r\nher energy, none could wed that girl of eyes like lotus-leaves, and\r\npossessed of a burning splendour.'\r\n\r\n'And it came to pass that once on the occasion of a parva, having fasted\r\nand bathed her head, she presented herself before the (family) deity and\r\ncaused the Brahmanas to offer oblations with due rites to the sacrificial\r\nfire. And taking the flowers that had been offered to the god, that lady,\r\nbeautiful as Sree herself, went to her high-souled sire. And having\r\nreverenced the feet of her father and offering him the flowers she had\r\nbrought, that maiden of exceeding grace, with joined hands, stood at the\r\nside of the king. And seeing his own daughter resembling a celestial\r\ndamsel arrived at puberty, and unsought by people, the king became sad.\r\nAnd the king said, 'Daughter, the time for bestowing thee is come! Yet\r\nnone asketh thee. Do thou (therefore) thyself seek for a husband equal to\r\nthee in qualities! That person who may be desired by thee should be\r\nnotified to me. Do thou choose for thy husband as thou listest. I shall\r\nbestow thee with deliberation. Do thou, O auspicious one, listen to me as\r\nI tell thee the words which I heard recited by the twice-born ones. The\r\nfather that doth not bestow his daughter cometh by disgrace. And the\r\nhusband that knoweth not his wife in her season meeteth with disgrace.\r\nAnd the son that doth not protect his mother when her husband is dead,\r\nalso suffereth disgrace. Hearing these words of mine, do thou engage\r\nthyself in search of a husband. Do thou act in such a way that we may not\r\nbe censured by the gods!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya said, 'Having said these words to his daughter and his old\r\ncounsellors, he instructed the attendants to follow her, saying,--Go!\r\nThereat, bashfully bowing down unto her father's feet, the meek maid went\r\nout without hesitation, in compliance with the words of her sire. And\r\nascending a golden car, she went to the delightful asylum of the royal\r\nsages, accompanied by her father's aged counsellors. There, O son,\r\nworshipping the feet of the aged ones, she gradually began to roam over\r\nall the woods. Thus the king's daughter distributing wealth in all sacred\r\nregions, ranged the various places belonging to the foremost of the\r\ntwice-born ones.'\""

Aswapati answered, saying, 'Surely it was on this\r\nvery business that she had been sent, and she returneth now (from her\r\nsearch). Do thou, O celestial sage, listen, even from her as to the\r\nhusband she hath chosen herself!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Then the blessed maid, commanded by her father\r\nwith the words,--Relate everything in detail,--regarded those words of\r\nher sire as if they were those of a god, and spoke unto him thus, 'There\r\nwas, amongst the Salwas, a virtuous Kshatriya king known by the name of\r\nDyumatsena.

And thereupon the\r\nmonarch, accompanied by his wife bearing a child on her breast, went into\r\nthe woods. And having retired into the forests, he adopted great vows and\r\nbegan to practise ascetic austerities. And his son, born in the city,\r\nbegan to grow in the hermitage. That youth, fit to be my husband, I have\r\naccepted in my heart for my lord!' At these words of hers, Narada said,\r\n'Alas, O king, Savitri hath committed a great wrong, since, not knowing,\r\nshe hath accepted for her lord this Satyavan of excellent qualities! His\r\nfather speaketh the truth and his mother also is truthful in her speech.\r\nAnd it is for this that the Brahmanas have named the son Satyavan. In his\r\nchildhood he took great delight in horses, and used to make horses of\r\nclay. And he used also to draw pictures of horses. And for this that\r\nyouth is sometimes called by the name of Chitraswa.' The king then asked,\r\n'And is prince Satyavan, who is devoted to his father, endued with energy\r\nand intelligence and forgiveness and courage?' Narada replied, saying,\r\n'In energy Satyavan is like unto the sun, and in wisdom like unto\r\nVrihaspati! And he is brave like unto the lord of the celestials and\r\nforgiving like unto the Earth herself!' Aswapati then said, 'And is the\r\nprince Satyavan liberal in gifts and devoted to the Brahmanas? Is he\r\nhandsome and magnanimous and lovely to behold?' Narada said, 'In bestowal\r\nof gifts according to his power, the mighty son of Dyumatsena is like\r\nunto Sankriti's son Rantideva. In truthfulness of speech and devotion\r\nunto Brahmanas, he is like Sivi, the son of Usinara. And he is\r\nmagnanimous like Yayati, and beautiful like the Moon. And in beauty of\r\nperson he is like either of the twin Aswins. And with senses under\r\ncontrol, he is meek, and brave, and truthful! And with passion in\r\nsubjection he is devoted to his friends, and free from malice and modest\r\nand patient. Indeed, briefly speaking, they that are possessed of great\r\nascetic merit and are of exalted character say that he is always correct\r\nin his conduct and that honour is firmly seated on his brow.' Hearing\r\nthis, Aswapati said, 'O reverend sage, thou tellest me that he is\r\npossessed of every virtue! Do thou now tell me his defects if, indeed, he\r\nhath any!' Narada then said, 'He hath one only defect that hath\r\noverwhelmed all his virtues. That defect is incapable of being conquered\r\nby even the greatest efforts. He hath only one defect, and no other.\r\nWithin a year from this day, Satyavan, endued with a short life will cast\r\noff his body!' Hearing these words of the sage, the king said, 'Come, O\r\nSavitri, go thou and choose another for thy lord, O beautiful damsel!\r\nThat one great defect (in this youth) existeth, covering all his merits.\r\nThe illustrious Narada honoured by even the gods, sayeth, that Satyavan\r\nwill have to cast off his body within a year, his days being numbered!'\r\nAt these words of her father, Savitri said, 'The death can fall but once;\r\na daughter can be given away but one; and once only can a person say, I\r\ngive away! These three things can take place only once. Indeed, with a\r\nlife short or long, possessed of virtues or bereft of them, I have, for\r\nonce, selected my husband. Twice I shall not select. Having first settled\r\na thing mentally, it is expressed in words, and then it is carried out\r\ninto practice. Of this my mind is an example!' Narada then said, 'O best\r\nof men, the heart of thy daughter Savitri wavereth not! It is not\r\npossible by any means to make her swerve from this path of virtue! In no\r\nother person are those virtues that dwell in Satyavan. The bestowal of\r\nthy daughter, therefore, is approved by me!' The king said, 'What thou\r\nhast said, O illustrious one, should never be disobeyed, for thy words\r\nare true! And I shall act as thou hast said, since thou art my\r\npreceptor!' Narada said, 'May the bestowal of thy daughter Savitri be\r\nattended with peace! I shall now depart. Blessed be all of ye!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Having said this, Narada rose up into the sky and\r\nwent to heaven.

And, O lady, the forest-paths are hard to pass!\r\nBesides thou hast been reduced by fast on account of thy vow. How wouldst\r\nthou, therefore, be able to walk on foot?' Thus addressed, Savitri said,\r\n'I do not feel langour because of the fast, nor do I feel exhaustion. And\r\nI have made up my mind to go. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to prevent\r\nme!' At this, Satyavan said, 'If thou desirest to go, I will gratify that\r\ndesire of thine. Do thou, however, take the permission of my parents, so\r\nthat I may be guilty of no fault!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed by her lord, Savitri of high vows\r\nsaluted her father-in-law and mother-in-law and addressed them, saying,\r\n'This my husband goeth to the forest for procuring fruits. Permitted by\r\nmy revered lady-mother and father-in-law, I will accompany him. For\r\nto-day I cannot bear to be separated from him. Thy son goeth out for the\r\nsake of the sacrificial fire and for his reverend superiors. He ought\r\nnot, therefore, to be dissuaded. Indeed, he could be dissuaded if he went\r\ninto the forest on any other errand. Do ye not prevent me! I will go into\r\nthe forest with him. It is a little less than a year that I have not gone\r\nout of the asylum. Indeed, I am extremely desirous of beholding the\r\nblossoming woods!' Hearing these words Dyumatsena said, 'Since Savitri\r\nhath been bestowed by her father as my daughter-in-law, I do not remember\r\nthat she hath ever spoken any words couching a request. Let my\r\ndaughter-in-law, therefore, have her will in this matter. Do thou,\r\nhowever, O daughter, act in such a way that Satyavan's work may not be\r\nneglected!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Having received the permission of both, the\r\nillustrious Savitri, departed with her lord, in seeming smiles although\r\nher heart was racked with grief. And that lady of large eyes went on,\r\nbeholding picturesque and delightful woods inhabited by swarms of\r\npeacocks. And Satyavan sweetly said unto Savitri, 'Behold these rivers of\r\nsacred currents and these excellent trees decked with flowers!' But the\r\nfaultless Savitri continued to watch her lord in all his moods, and\r\nrecollecting the words of the celestial sage, she considered her husband\r\nas already dead. And with heart cleft in twain, that damsel, replying to\r\nher lord, softly followed him expecting that hour.'\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya said, The powerful Satyavan then, accompanied by his wife,\r\nplucked fruits and filled his wallet with them. And he then began to fell\r\nbranches of trees. And as he was hewing them, he began to perspire. And\r\nin consequence of that exercise his head began to ache. And afflicted\r\nwith toil, he approached his beloved wife, and addressed her, saying, 'O\r\nSavitri, owing to this hard exercise my head acheth, and all my limbs and\r\nmy heart also are afflicted sorely! O thou of restrained speech, I think\r\nmyself unwell, I feel as if my head is being pierced with numerous darts.\r\nTherefore, O auspicious lady, I wish to sleep, for I have not the power\r\nto stand.' Hearing these words, Savitri quickly advancing, approached her\r\nhusband, and sat down upon the ground, placing his head upon her lap. And\r\nthat helpless lady, thinking of Narada's words, began to calculate the\r\n(appointed) division of the day, the hour, and the moment. The next\r\nmoment she saw a person clad in red attire with his head decked with a\r\ndiadem. And his body was of large proportions and effulgent as the Sun.\r\nAnd he was of a darkish hue, had red eyes, carried a noose in his hand,\r\nand was dreadful to behold. And he was standing beside Satyavan and was\r\nsteadfastly gazing at him. And seeing him, Savitri gently placed her\r\nhusband's head on the ground, and rising suddenly, with a trembling\r\nheart, spake these words in distressful accents, 'Seeing this thy\r\nsuperhuman form, I take thee to be a deity. If thou will, tell me, O\r\nchief of the gods, who thou art and what also thou intendst to do!'\r\nThereat, Yama replied, 'O Savitri, thou art ever devoted to thy husband,\r\nand thou art also endued with ascetic merit. It is for this reason that I\r\nhold converse with thee. Do thou, O auspicious one, know me for Yama.\r\nThis thy lord Satyavan, the son of a king, hath his days run out. I\r\nshall, therefore, take him away binding him in this noose. Know this to\r\nbe my errand!' At these words Savitri said, 'I had heard that thy\r\nemissaries come to take away mortals, O worshipful one! Why then, O lord,\r\nhast thou come in person?'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Thus addressed by her, the illustrious lord of\r\nPitris, with a view to oblige her, began to unfold to her truly all about\r\nhis intentions. And Yama said, 'This prince is endued with virtues and\r\nbeauty of person, and is a sea of accomplishments. He deserveth not to be\r\nborne away by my emissaries. Therefore is it that I have come\r\npersonally.' Saying this, Yama by main force pulled out of the body of\r\nSatyavan, a person of the measure of the thumb, bound in noose and\r\ncompletely under subjection. And when Satyavan's life had thus been taken\r\nout, the body, deprived of breath, and shorn of lustre, and destitute of\r\nmotion, became unsightly to behold. And binding Satyavan's vital essence,\r\nYama proceeded in a southerly direction. Thereupon, with heart\r\noverwhelmed in grief, the exalted Savitri, ever devoted to her lord and\r\ncrowned with success in respect of her vows, began to follow Yama. And at\r\nthis, Yama said, 'Desist, O Savitri! Go back, and perform the funeral\r\nobsequies of thy lord! Thou art freed from all thy obligations to thy\r\nlord. Thou hast come as far as it is possible to come'. Savitri replied,\r\n'Whither my husband is being carried, or whither he goeth of his own\r\naccord, I will follow him thither. This is the eternal custom. By virtue\r\nof my asceticism, of my regard for my superiors, of my affection for my\r\nlord, of my observance of vows, as well as of thy favour, my course is\r\nunimpeded. It hath been declared by wise men endued with true knowledge\r\nthat by walking only seven paces with another, one contracteth a\r\nfriendship with one's companion. Keeping that friendship (which I have\r\ncontracted with thee) in view, I shall speak to thee something. Do thou\r\nlisten to it. They that have not their souls under control, acquire not\r\nmerit by leading the four successive modes of life, viz.,--celibacy with\r\nstudy, domesticity, retirement into the woods, and renunciation of the\r\nworld. That which is called religious merit is said to consist of true\r\nknowledge. The wise, therefore, have declared religious merit to be the\r\nforemost of all things and not the passage through the four successive\r\nmodes. By practising the duties of even one of these four modes agreeable\r\nto the directions of the wise, we have attained to true merit, and,\r\ntherefore, we do not desire the second or the third mode, viz., celibacy\r\nwith study or renunciation. It is for this again that the wise have\r\ndeclared religious merit to be the foremost of all things!' Hearing these\r\nwords of hers, Yama said, 'Do thou desist! I have been pleased with these\r\nwords of thine couched in proper letters and accents, and based on\r\nreason. Do thou ask for a boon! Except the life of thy husband, O thou of\r\nfaultless features, I will bestow on thee any boon that thou mayst\r\nsolicit!' Hearing these words, Savitri said, 'Deprived of his kingdom and\r\nbereft also of sight, my father-in-law leadeth a life of retirement in\r\nour sylvan asylum. Let that king through thy favour attain his eye-sight,\r\nand become strong 'like either fire or the Sun!' Yama said, 'O thou of\r\nfaultless features, I grant thee this boon! It will even be as thou hast\r\nsaid! It seems that thou art fatigued with thy journey. Do thou desist,\r\ntherefore, and return! Suffer not thyself to be weary any longer!'\r\nSavitri said, 'What weariness can I feel in the presence of my husband?\r\nThe lot that is my husband's is certainly mine also. Whither thou\r\ncarriest my husband, thither will I also repair! O chief of the\r\ncelestials, do thou again listen to me! Even a single interview with the\r\npious is highly desirable; friendship with them is still more so. And\r\nintercourse with the virtuous can never be fruitless. Therefore, one\r\nshould live in the company of the righteous!' Yama said, 'These words\r\nthat thou hast spoken, so fraught with useful instruction, delight the\r\nheart and enhance the wisdom of even the learned. Therefore, O lady,\r\nsolicit thou a second boon, except the life of Satyavan!' Savitri said,\r\n'Sometime before, my wise and intelligent father-in-law was deprived of\r\nhis kingdom. May that monarch regain his kingdom. And may that superior\r\nof mine never renounce his duties! Even this is the second boon that I\r\nsolicit!' Then Yama said,--'The king shall soon regain his kingdom. Nor\r\nshall he ever fall off from his duties. Thus, O daughter of a king have I\r\nfulfilled thy desire. Do thou now desist! Return! Do not take any future\r\ntrouble!' Savitri said, 'Thou hast restrained all creatures by thy\r\ndecrees, and it is by thy decrees that thou takest them away, not\r\naccording to thy will. Therefore it is, O god, O divine one, that people\r\ncall thee Yama! Do thou listen to the words that I say! The eternal duty\r\nof the good towards all creatures is never to injure them in thought,\r\nword, and deed, but to bear them love and give them their due. As regards\r\nthis world, everything here is like this (husband of mine). Men are\r\ndestitute of both devotion and skill. The good, however, show mercy to\r\neven their foes when these seek their protection. Yama said, 'As water to\r\nthe thirsty soul, so are these words uttered by thee to me! Therefore, do\r\nthou, O fair lady, if thou will, once again ask for any boon except\r\nSalyavana's life!' At these words Savitri replied, That lord of earth, my\r\nfather, is without sons. That he may have a hundred sons begotten of his\r\nloins, so that his line may be perpetuated, is the third boon I would ask\r\nof thee!' Yama said, Thy sire, O auspicious lady, shall obtain a hundred\r\nillustrious sons, who will perpetuate and increase their father's race!\r\nNow, O daughter of a king, thou hast obtained thy wish. Do thou desist!\r\nThou hast come far enough.' Savitri said, 'Staying by the side of my\r\nhusband, I am not conscious of the length of the way I have walked.\r\nIndeed, my mind rusheth to yet a longer way of. Do thou again, as thou\r\ngoest on, listen to the words that I will presently utter! Thou art the\r\npowerful son of Vivaswat. It is for this that thou art called Vaivaswata\r\nby the wise. And, O lord, since thou dealest out equal law unto all\r\ncreated things, thou hast been designated the lord of justice! One\r\nreposeth not, even in one's own self, the confidence that one doth in the\r\nrighteous. Therefore, every one wisheth particularly for intimacy with\r\nthe righteous. It is goodness of heart alone that inspireth the\r\nconfidence of all creatures. And it is for this that people rely\r\nparticularly on the righteous.' And hearing these words, Yama said, 'The\r\nwords that thou utterest, O fair lady, I have not heard from any one save\r\nthee; I am highly pleased with this speech of thine. Except the life of\r\nSatyavan, solicit thou, therefore, a fourth boon, and then go thy way!'\r\nSavitri then said, 'Both of me and Satyavan's loins, begotten by both of\r\nus, let there be a century of sons possessed of strength and prowess and\r\ncapable of perpetuating our race! Even this is the fourth boon that I\r\nwould beg of thee!' Hearing these words of hers, Yama replied, 'Thou\r\nshalt, O lady, obtain a century of sons, possessed of strength and\r\nprowess, and causing thee great delight, O daughter of a king, let no\r\nmore weariness be thine! Do thou desist! Thou hast already come too far!'\r\nThus addressed, Savitri said, 'They that are righteous always practise\r\neternal morality! And the communion of the pious with the pious is never\r\nfruitless! Nor is there any danger to the pious from those that are\r\npious. And verily it is the righteous who by their truth make the Sun\r\nmove in the heaven. And it is the righteous that support the earth by\r\ntheir austerities! And, O king, it is the righteous upon whom both the\r\npast and the future depend! Therefore, they that are righteous, are never\r\ncheerless in the company of the righteous. Knowing this to be the eternal\r\npractice of the good and righteous, they that are righteous continue to\r\ndo good to others without expecting any benefit in return. A good office\r\nis never thrown away on the good and virtuous. Neither interest nor\r\ndignity suffereth any injury by such an act. And since such conduct ever\r\nadheres to the righteous, the righteous often become the protectors of\r\nall.' Hearing these words of hers, Yama replied, 'The more thou utterest\r\nsuch speeches that are pregnant with great import, full of honeyed\r\nphrases, instinct with morality, and agreeable to mind, the more is the\r\nrespect that I feel for thee! O thou that art so devoted to thy lord, ask\r\nfor some incomparable boon!' Thus addressed, Savitri said, 'O bestower of\r\nhonours, the boon thou hast already given me is incapable of\r\naccomplishment without union with my husband. Therefore, among other\r\nboons, I ask for this, may this Satyavan be restored to life! Deprived of\r\nmy husband, I am as one dead! Without my husband, I do not wish for\r\nhappiness. Without my husband, I do not wish for heaven itself. Without\r\nmy husband, I do not wish for prosperity. Without my husband, I cannot\r\nmake up my mind to live! Thou thyself hast bestowed on me the boon,\r\nnamely, of a century of sons; yet thou takest away my husband! I ask for\r\nthis boon, 'May Satyavan be restored to life, for by that thy words will\r\nbe made true.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Thereupon saying,--So be it,--Vivaswat's son,\r\nYama, the dispenser of justice, untied his noose, and with cheerful heart\r\nsaid these words to Savitri, 'Thus, O auspicious and chaste lady, is thy\r\nhusband freed by me! Thou wilt be able to take him back free from\r\ndisease. And he will attain to success! And along with thee, he will\r\nattain a life of four hundred years. And celebrating sacrifices with due\r\nrites, he will achieve great fame in this world. And upon thee Satyavan\r\nwill also beget a century of sons. And these Kshatriyas with their sons\r\nand grandsons will all be kings, and will always be famous in connection\r\nwith thy name. And thy father also will beget a hundred sons on thy\r\nmother Malavi. And under the name of the Malavas, thy Kshatriya brothers,\r\nresembling the celestials, will be widely known along with their sons and\r\ndaughters!' And having bestowed these boons on Savitri and having thus\r\nmade her desist, Yama departed for his abode. Savitri, after Yama had\r\ngone away, went back to the spot where her husband's ash-coloured corpse\r\nlay, and seeing her lord on the ground, she approached him, and taking\r\nhold of him, she placed his head on her lap and herself sat down on the\r\nground. Then Satyavan regained his consciousness, and affectionately\r\neyeing Savitri again and again, like one come home after a sojourn in a\r\nstrange land, he addressed her thus, 'Alas, I have slept long! Wherefore\r\ndidst thou not awake me? And where is that same sable person that was\r\ndragging me away?' At these words of his, Savitri said, 'Thou hast, O\r\nbull among men, slept long on my lap! That restrainer of creatures, the\r\nworshipful Yama, had gone away. Thou art refreshed, O blessed one, and\r\nsleep hath forsaken thee, O son of a king! If thou art able, rise thou\r\nup! Behold, the night is deep!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Having regained consciousness, Satyavan rose up\r\nlike one who had enjoyed a sweet sleep, and seeing every side covered\r\nwith woods, said, 'O girl of slender waist, I came with thee for\r\nprocuring fruits. Then while I was cutting wood I felt a pain in my head.\r\nAnd on account of that intense pain about my head I was unable to stand\r\nfor any length of time, and, therefore, I lay on thy lap and slept. All\r\nthis, O auspicious lady, I remember. Then, as thou didst embrace me,\r\nsleep stole away my senses. I then saw that it was dark all around. In\r\nthe midst of it I saw a person of exceeding effulgence. If thou knowest\r\neverything, do thou then, O girl of slender waist, tell me whether what I\r\nsaw was only a dream or a reality!' Thereupon, Savitri addressed him,\r\nsaying, The night deepens. I shall, O prince, relate everything unto thee\r\non the morrow. Arise, arise, may good betide thee! And, O thou of\r\nexcellent vows, come and behold thy parents! The sun hath set a long\r\nwhile ago and the night deepens. Those rangers of the night, having\r\nfrightful voices, are walking about in glee. And sounds are heard,\r\nproceeding from the denizens of the forest treading through the woods.\r\nThese terrible shrieks of jackals that are issuing from the south and the\r\neast make my heart tremble (in fear)!' Satyavan then said, 'Covered with\r\ndeep darkness, the wilderness hath worn a dreadful aspect. Thou wilt,\r\ntherefore, not be able to discern the tract, and consequently wilt not be\r\nable to go!' Then Savitri replied, 'In consequence of a conflagration\r\nhaving taken place in the forest today a withered tree standeth aflame,\r\nand the flames being stirred by the wind are discerned now and then. I\r\nshall fetch some fire and light these faggots around. Do thou dispel all\r\nanxiety. I will do all (this) if thou darest not go, for I find thee\r\nunwell. Nor wilt thou be able to discover the way through this forest\r\nenveloped in darkness. Tomorrow when the woods become visible, we will go\r\nhence, if thou please! If, O sinless one, it is thy wish, we shall pass\r\nthis night even here!' At these words of hers, Satyavan replied, 'The\r\npain in my head is off; and I feel well in my limbs. With thy favour I\r\nwish to behold my father and mother. Never before did I return to the\r\nhermitage after the proper time had passed away. Even before it is\r\ntwilight my mother confineth me within the asylum. Even when I come out\r\nduring the day, my parents become anxious on my account, and my father\r\nsearcheth for me, together with all the inhabitants of the sylvan\r\nasylums. Before this, moved by deep grief, my father and mother had\r\nrebuked me many times and often, saying,--Thou comest having tarried\r\nlong! I am thinking of the pass they have today come to on my account,\r\nfor, surely, great grief will be theirs when they miss me. One night\r\nbefore this, the old couple, who love me dearly, wept from deep sorrow\r\nand said into me, 'Deprived of thee, O son, we cannot live for even a\r\nmoment. As long as thou livest, so long, surely, we also will live. Thou\r\nart the crutch of these blind ones; on thee doth perpetuity of our race\r\ndepend. On thee also depend our funeral cake, our fame and our\r\ndescendants! My mother is old, and my father also is so. I am surely\r\ntheir crutch. If they see me not in the night, what, oh, will be their\r\nplight! I hate that slumber of mine for the sake of which my unoffending\r\nmother and my father have both been in trouble, and I myself also, am\r\nplaced in such rending distress! Without my father and mother, I cannot\r\nbear to live. It is certain that by this time my blind father, his mind\r\ndisconsolate with grief, is asking everyone of the inhabitants of the\r\nhermitage about me! I do not, O fair girl, grieve so much for myself as I\r\ndo for my sire, and for my weak mother ever obedient to her lord! Surely,\r\nthey will be afflicted with extreme anguish on account of me. I hold my\r\nlife so long as they live. And I know that they should be maintained by\r\nme and that I should do only what is agreeable to them!'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Having said this, that virtuous youth who loved\r\nand revered his parents, afflicted with grief held up his arms and began\r\nto lament in accents of woe. And seeing her lord overwhelmed with sorrow\r\nthe virtuous Savitri wiped away the tears from his eyes and said, 'If I\r\nhave observed austerities, and have given away in charity, and have\r\nperformed sacrifice, may this night be for the good of my father-in-law,\r\nmother-in-law and husband! I do not remember having told a single\r\nfalsehood, even in jest. Let my father-in-law and mother-in-law hold\r\ntheir lives by virtue of the truth!' Satyavan said, 'I long for the sight\r\nof my father and mother! Therefore, O Savitri, proceed without delay. O\r\nbeautiful damsel, I swear by my own self that if I find any evil to have\r\nbefallen my father and mother, I will not live. If thou hast any regard\r\nfor virtue, if thou wishest me to live, if it is thy duty to do what is\r\nagreeable to me, proceed thou to the hermitage!' The beautiful Savitri\r\nthen rose and tying up her hair, raised her husband in her arms. And\r\nSatyavan having risen, rubbed his limbs with his hands. And as he\r\nsurveyed all around, his eyes fell upon his wallet. Then Savitri said\r\nunto him, 'Tomorrow thou mayst gather fruits. And I shall carry thy axe\r\nfor thy ease.' Then hanging up the wallet upon the bough of a tree, and\r\ntaking up the axe, she re-approached her husband. And that lady of\r\nbeautiful thighs, placing her husband's left arm upon her left shoulder,\r\nand embracing him with her right arms, proceeded with elephantic gait.\r\nThen Satyavan said, 'O timid one, by virtue of habit, the (forest) paths\r\nare known to me. And further, by the light of the moon between the trees,\r\nI can see them. We have now reached the same path that we took in the\r\nmorning for gathering fruits. Do thou, O auspicious one, proceed by the\r\nway that we had come: thou needst not any longer feel dubious about our\r\npath. Near that tract overgrown with Palasa tree, the way diverges into\r\ntwo. Do thou proceed along the path that lies to the north of it. I am\r\nnow well and have got back my strength. I long to see my father and\r\nmother!' Saying this Satyavan hastily proceeded towards the hermitage.'\""

      "content": "\"Markandeya said, 'Meanwhile the mighty Dyumatsena, having regained his\r\nsight, could see everything. And when his vision grew clear he saw\r\neverything around him. And, O bull of the Bharata race, proceeding with\r\nhis wife Saivya to all the (neighbouring) asylums in search of his son,\r\nhe became extremely distressed on his account. And that night the old\r\ncouple went about searching in asylums, and rivers, and woods, and\r\nfloods. And whenever they heard any sound, they stood rising their heads,\r\nanxiously thinking that their son was coming, and said, 'O yonder cometh\r\nSatyavan with Savitri!' And they rushed hither and thither like maniacs,\r\ntheir feet torn, cracked, wounded, and bleeding, pierced with thorns and\r\nKusa blades. Then all the Brahmanas dwelling in that hermitage came unto\r\nthem, and surrounding them on all sides, comforted them, and brought them\r\nback to their own asylum. And there Dyumatsena with his wife surrounded\r\nby aged ascetics, was entertained with stories of monarchs of former\r\ntimes. And although that old couple desirous of seeing their son, was\r\ncomforted, yet recollecting the youthful days of their son, they became\r\nexceedingly sorry. And afflicted with grief, they began to lament in\r\npiteous accents, saying, 'Alas, O son, alas, O chaste daughter-in-law,\r\nwhere are you?' Then a truthful Brahmana of the name of Suvarchas spake\r\nunto them, saying, 'Considering the austerities, self-restraint, and\r\nbehaviour of his wife Savitri, there can be no doubt that Satyavan\r\nliveth!' And Gautama said, 'I have studied all the Vedas with their\r\nbranches, and I have acquired great ascetic merit. And I have led a\r\ncelibate existence, practising also the Brahmacharya mode of life. I have\r\ngratified Agni and my superiors. With rapt soul I have also observed all\r\nthe vows: and I have according to the ordinance, frequently lived upon\r\nair alone. By virtue of this ascetic merit, I am cognisant of all the\r\ndoings of others. Therefore, do thou take it for certain that Satyavan\r\nliveth.' Thereupon his disciple said, 'The words that have fallen from\r\nthe lips of my preceptor can never be false. Therefore, Satyavan surely\r\nliveth.' And the Rishi said, 'Considering the auspicious marks that his\r\nwife Savitri beareth and all of which indicate immunity from widowhood,\r\nthere can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth!' And Varadwaja said, 'Having\r\nregard to the ascetic merit, self-restraint, and conduct of his wife\r\nSavitri, there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth.' And Dalbhya said,\r\n'Since thou hast regained thy sight, and since Savitri hath gone away\r\nafter completion of the vow, without taking any food, there can be no\r\ndoubt that Satyavan liveth.' And Apastamba said, 'From the manner in\r\nwhich the voices of birds and wild animals are being heard through the\r\nstillness of the atmosphere on all sides, and from the fact also of thy\r\nhaving regained the use of thy eyes, indicating thy usefulness for\r\nearthly purposes once more, there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth.'\r\nAnd Dhauma said, 'As thy son is graced with every virtue, and as he is\r\nthe beloved of all, and as he is possessed of marks betokening a long\r\nlife, there can be no doubt that Satyavan liveth.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Thus cheered by those ascetics of truthful\r\nspeech, Dyumatsena pondering over those points, attained a little ease. A\r\nlittle while after, Savitri with her husband Satyavan reached the\r\nhermitage during the night and entered it with a glad heart. The\r\nBrahmanas then said, 'Beholding this meeting with thy son, and thy\r\nrestoration to eye-sight, we all wish thee well, O lord of earth. Thy\r\nmeeting with thy son, the sight of thy daughter-in-law, and thy\r\nrestoration to sight--constitute a threefold prosperity which thou hast\r\ngained. What we all have said must come to pass: there can be no doubt of\r\nthis. Henceforth thou shalt rapidly grow in prosperity.' Then, O Pritha's\r\nson, the twice-born ones lighted a fire and sat themselves down before\r\nking Dyumatsena. And Saivya, and Satyavan, and Savitri who stood apart,\r\ntheir hearts free from grief, sat down with the permission of them all.\r\nThen, O Partha, seated with the monarch those dwellers of the woods,\r\nactuated by curiosity, asked the king's son, saying, 'Why didst thou not,\r\nO illustrious one, come back earlier with thy wife? Why hast thou come so\r\nlate in the night? What obstacle prevented thee! We do not know, O son of\r\na king, why thou hast caused such alarm to us, and to thy father and\r\nmother. It behoveth thee to tell us all about this,' Thereupon, Satyavan\r\nsaid, 'With the permission of my father, I went to the woods with\r\nSavitri. There, as I was hewing wood in the forest, I felt a pain in my\r\nhead. And in consequence of the pain, I fell into a deep sleep.--This is\r\nall that I remember. I had never slept so long before I have come so late\r\nat night, in order that ye might not grieve (on my account). There is no\r\nother reason for this.' Gautama then said, 'Thou knowest not then the\r\ncause of thy father's sudden restoration to sight. It, therefore,\r\nbehoveth Savitri to relate it. I wish to hear it (from thee), for surely\r\nthou art conversant with the mysteries of good and evil. And, O Savitri,\r\nI know thee to be like the goddess Savitri herself in splendour. Thou\r\nmust know the cause of this. Therefore, do thou relate it truly! If it\r\nshould not be kept a secret, do thou unfold it unto us!' At these words\r\nof Gautama Savitri said, 'It is as ye surmise. Your desire shall surely\r\nnot be unfulfilled. I have no secret to keep. Listen to the truth then!\r\nThe high-souled Narada had predicted the death of my husband. To-day was\r\nthe appointed time. I could not, therefore, bear to be separated from my\r\nhusband's company. And after he had fallen asleep, Yama, accompanied by\r\nhis messengers, presented himself before him, and tying him, began to\r\ntake him away towards the region inhabited by the Pitris. Thereupon I\r\nbegan to praise that august god, with truthful words. And he granted me\r\nfive boons, of which do ye hear from me! For my father-in-law I have\r\nobtained these two boons, viz., his restoration to sight as also to his\r\nkingdom. My father also hath obtained a hundred sons. And I myself have\r\nobtained a hundred sons. And my husband Satyavan hath obtained a life of\r\nfour hundred years. It was for the sake of my husband's life that I had\r\nobserved that vow. Thus have I narrated unto you in detail the cause by\r\nwhich this mighty misfortune of mine was afterwards turned into\r\nhappiness. The Rishis said, 'O chaste lady of excellent disposition,\r\nobservant of vows and endued with virtue, and sprung from an illustrious\r\nline, by thee hath the race of this foremost of kings, which was\r\noverwhelmed with calamities, and was sinking in an ocean of darkness,\r\nbeen rescued.'\r\n\r\n\"Markandeya continued, 'Then having applauded and reverenced that best of\r\nwomen, those Rishis there assembled bade farewell to that foremost of\r\nkings as well as to his son. And having saluted them thus, they speedily\r\nwent, in peace with cheerful hearts, to their respective abodes.'\""

And although those mighty sages again and again spake\r\nunto Dyumatsena of the high fortune of Savitri, yet they were never\r\nsatisfied. And it so happened, O king, that there came to that hermitage\r\na large body of people from Salwa. And they brought tidings of the enemy\r\nof Dyumatsena having been slain by his own minister. And they related\r\nunto him all that had happened, viz., how having heard that the usurper\r\nhad been slain with all his friends and allies by his minister, his\r\ntroops had all fled, and how all the subjects had become unanimous (on\r\nbehalf of their legitimate king), saying, 'Whether possessed of sight or\r\nnot, even he shall be our king!' And they said, 'We have been sent to\r\nthee in consequence of that resolve. This car of thine, and this army\r\nalso consisting of four kinds of forces, have arrived for thee! Good\r\nbetide thee, O King! Do thou come! Thou hast been proclaimed in the city.\r\nDo thou for ever occupy the station belonging to thy lather and\r\ngrand-father!' And beholding the king possessed of sight and able-bodied,\r\nthey bowed down their heads, their eyes expanded with wonder. Then having\r\nworshipped those old and Brahmanas dwelling in the hermitage and honoured\r\nby them in return, the king set out for his city. And surrounded by the\r\nsoldiers, Saivya also accompanied by Savitri, went in a vehicle furnished\r\nwith shining sheets and borne on the shoulders of men. Then the priests\r\nwith joyful hearts installed Dyumatsena on the throne with his\r\nhigh-souled son as prince-regent. And after the lapse of a long time,\r\nSavitri gave birth to a century of sons, all warlike and unretreating\r\nfrom battle, and enhancing the fame of Salwa's race. And she also had a\r\ncentury of highly powerful uterine brothers born unto Aswapati, the lord\r\nof the Madras, by Malavi.

And, O best of ascetics, why\r\nwas it that the virtuous Yudhishthira never expressed it to any one?\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"As thou askest me, O tiger among kings, I will relate\r\nthat history unto thee! Do thou listen to my words, O best of the\r\nBharatas! After twelve years (of their exile) had passed away and the\r\nthirteenth year had set in, Sakra, ever friendly to the sons of Pandu,\r\nresolved to beg of Karna (his ear-rings). And, O mighty monarch,\r\nascertaining this intention of the great chief of the celestials about\r\n(Karna's) ear-rings, Surya, having effulgence for his wealth, went unto\r\nKarna. And, O foremost of kings, while that hero devoted to the Brahmanas\r\nand truthful in speech was lying down at night at his ease on a rich bed\r\noverlaid with a costly sheet, the effulgent deity, filled with kindness\r\nand affection for his son, showed himself, O Bharata, unto him in his\r\ndreams. And assuming from ascetic power the form of a handsome Brahmana\r\nversed in the Vedas, Surya sweetly said unto Karna these words for his\r\nbenefit, 'O son, do thou O Karna, listen to these words of mine, O thou\r\nforemost of truthful persons! O mighty-armed one, I tell thee to-day from\r\naffection, what is for thy great good! With the object, O Karna, of\r\nobtaining thy ear-rings, Sakra, moved by the desire of benefiting the\r\nsons of Pandu, will come unto thee, disguised as a Brahmana! He, as Well\r\nas all the world, knoweth thy character, viz., that when solicited by\r\npious people, thou givest away but never takest in gift! Thou, O son,\r\ngivest unto Brahmanas wealth or any other thing that is asked of thee and\r\nnever refusest anything to anybody. Knowing thee to be such, the subduer\r\nhimself of Paka will come to beg of thee thy ear-rings and coat of mail.\r\nWhen he beggeth the ear-rings of thee, it behoveth thee not to give them\r\naway, but to gratify him with sweet speeches to the best of thy power.\r\nEven this, is for thy supreme good! While asking thee for the ear-rings,\r\nthou shalt, with various reasons, repeatedly refuse Purandara who is\r\ndesirous of obtaining them, offering him, instead, various other kinds of\r\nwealth, such as gems and women and kine, and citing various precedents.\r\nIf thou, O Kama, givest away thy beautiful ear-rings born with thee, thy\r\nlife being shortened, thou wilt meet with death! Arrayed in thy mail and\r\near-rings, thou wilt, O bestower of honours, be incapable of being slain\r\nby foes in battle! Do thou lay to heart these words of mine! Both these\r\njewelled ornaments have sprung from Amrita. Therefore, they should be\r\npreserved by thee, if thy life is at all dear to thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words, Kama said, 'Who art thou that tellest me so,\r\nshowing me such kindness? If it pleaseth thee, tell me, O illustrious\r\none, who thou art in the guise of a Brahmana!'--The Brahmana thereupon\r\nsaid, 'O son, I am he of a thousand rays! Out of affection, I point out\r\nto thee the path! Act thou according to my words, as it is for thy great\r\ngood to do so!' Kama replied, 'Surely, this itself is highly fortunate\r\nfor me that the god himself of splendour addresses me today, seeking my\r\nwelfare. Listen, however, to these words of mine! May it please thee, O\r\nbestower of boons, it is only from affection that I tell thee this! If I\r\nam dear to thee, I should not be dissuaded from the observance of my vow!\r\nO thou that are possessed of the wealth of effulgence, the whole world\r\nknoweth this to be my vow that, of a verity, I am prepared to give away\r\nlife itself unto superior Brahmanas! If, O best of all rangers of the\r\nsky, Sakra cometh to me, disguised as a Brahmana, to beg for the benefit\r\nof the sons of Pandu, I will, O chief of the celestials, give him the\r\near-rings and the excellent mail, so that my fame which hath spread over\r\nthe three worlds may not suffer any diminution! For persons like us, it\r\nis not fit to save life by a blame-worthy act. On the contrary, it is\r\neven proper for us to meet death with the approbation of the world and\r\nunder circumstances bringing fame. Therefore, will I bestow upon Indra\r\nthe ear-rings with my coat of mail! If the slayer himself of Vala and\r\nVritra cometh to ask for the ear-rings for the benefit of the sons of\r\nPandu, that will conduce to my fame, leading at the same time to his\r\ninfamy! O thou possessed of splendour, I wish for fame in this world,\r\neven if it is to be purchased with life itself, for they that have fame\r\nenjoy the celestial regions, while they that are destitute of it are\r\nlost. Fame keepeth people alive in this world even like a mother, while\r\ninfamy killeth men even though they may move about with bodies\r\nundestroyed. O lord of the worlds, O thou possessed of the wealth of\r\neffulgence, that fame is the life of men is evidenced by an ancient sloka\r\nsung by the Creator himself,--In the next world it is fame that is the\r\nchief support of a person, while in this world pure fame lengthens life.\r\nTherefore, by giving away my ear-rings and mail with both of which I was\r\nborn I will win eternal fame! And by duly giving away the same to\r\nBrahmanas according to the ordinance, by offering up my body (as a gift\r\nto the gods) in the sacrifice of war, by achieving feats difficult of\r\nperformance, and by conquering my foes in fight, I will acquire nothing\r\nbut renown. And by dispelling on the field of battle the fears of the\r\naffrighted that may beg for their lives, and relieving old men and boys\r\nand Brahmanas from terror and anxiety, I will win excellent fame and the\r\nhighest heaven. My fame is to be protected with the sacrifice of even my\r\nlife. Even this, know thou, is my vow! By giving away such a valuable\r\ngift to Maghavan disguised as a Brahmana, I will, O god, acquire in this\r\nworld the most exalted state.'\""

Once on a\r\ntime, O king, there appeared before Kuntibhoja a Brahmana of fierce\r\nenergy and tall stature, bearing a beard and matted locks, and carrying a\r\nstaff in his hand. And, he was agreeable to the eye and of faultless\r\nlimbs, and seemed to blaze forth in splendour. And he was possessed of a\r\nyellow-blue complexion like that of honey. And his speech was\r\nmellifluous, and he was adorned with ascetic merit and a knowledge of the\r\nVedas. And that person of great ascetic merit, addressing king\r\nKuntibhoja, said, 'O thou that are free from pride, I wish to live as a\r\nguest in thy house feeding on the food obtained as alms from thee!\r\nNeither thy followers, nor thou thyself, shall ever act in such a way as\r\nto produce my displeasure!

And, O king, no one shall offend me in respect\r\nof my food or bed.'--Then Kuntibhoja spake unto him these words\r\ncheerfully, 'Be it so, and more.' And he again said unto him, 'O thou of\r\ngreat wisdom, I have an illustrious daughter named Pritha. And she\r\nbeareth an excellent character, is observant of vow, chaste, and of\r\nsubdued senses. And she shall attend on thee and minister unto thee with\r\nreverence. And thou wilt be pleased with her disposition!'

Do thou\r\ngive him with alacrity whatever this reverend Brahmana possessed of\r\nascetic merit and engaged in the study of the Vedas, may want.

It\r\nwas for their disregard of Brahmanas that were deserving of honour that\r\nthe mighty Asura Vatapi, as also Talajangha, was destroyed by the curse\r\nof the Brahmanas. For the present, O child, it is a highly virtuous one\r\nof that order that is entrusted to thy keep. Thou shouldst always tend\r\nthis Brahmana with concentrated mind.

It is\r\nfor this reason that thou art my daughter. Born in such a race and reared\r\nin such a race, thou hast come from one happy state to another like a\r\nlotus transferred from one lake to another. O auspicious girl, women,\r\nspecially they that are of mean extraction, although they may with\r\ndifficulty be kept under restraint, become in consequence of their unripe\r\nage, generally deformed in character.

And\r\neven like a disciple, daughter, or a sister, that blameless gem of a girl\r\nwith a devoted heart, O king, gratified that foremost of Brahmanas. And\r\nthat best of Brahmanas became well-pleased with her conduct and\r\nministrations. And he received those attentions of hers, valuing them\r\nrightly. And, O Bharata, her father asked her every morning and evening\r\nsaying, \"O daughter, is the Brahmana satisfied with thy ministrations?\r\nAnd that illustrious maiden used to reply, 'Exceedingly well!' And\r\nthereupon, the high-souled Kuntibhoja experienced the greatest delight.\r\nAnd when after a full year that best of ascetics was unable to find any\r\nfault whatever in Pritha, who was engaged in ministering unto him,\r\nwell-pleased he said unto her, 'O gentle maid, I have been well-pleased\r\nwith thy attentions, O beautiful girl! Do thou, O blessed girl, ask even\r\nfor such boons as are difficult of being obtained by men in this world,\r\nand obtaining which, thou mayst surpass in fame all the women in this\r\nworld'. At these words of his, Kunti said, 'Everything hath already been\r\ndone in my behalf since thou, O chief of those that are versed in the\r\nVedas, and my father also, have been pleased with me! As regards the\r\nboons, I consider them as already obtained by me, O Brahmana!' The\r\nBrahmana thereupon said, 'If, O gentle maid, thou dost not, O thou of\r\nsweet smiles, wish to obtain boons from me, do thou then take this mantra\r\nfrom me for invoking the celestials! Any one amongst the celestials whom\r\nthou mayst invoke by uttering this mantra, will appear before thee and be\r\nunder thy power. Willing or not, by virtue of this mantra, that deity in\r\ngentle guise, and assuming the obedient attitude of slave, will become\r\nsubject to thy power!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, that faultless maiden could-not,\r\nO king, from fear of a curse, refuse tor the second time compliance with\r\nthe wishes of that best of the twice-born ones. Then, O king, that\r\nBrahmana imparted unto that girl of faultless limbs those mantras which\r\nare recited in the beginning of the Atharvan Veda. And, O king, having\r\nimparted unto her those mantras, he said unto Kuntibhoja. 'I have, O\r\nmonarch, dwelt happily in thy house, always worshipped with due regard\r\nand gratified by thy daughter. I shall now depart.' And saying this, he\r\nvanished there and then. And beholding that Brahmana vanish there and\r\nthen, the king was struck with amazement. And the monarch then treated\r\nhis daughter Pritha with proper regard.\""

And she said to herself, 'Of what nature are those mantras that\r\nhave been bestowed on me by that high-souled one? I shall without delay\r\ntest their power'. And as she was thinking in this way, she suddenly\r\nperceived indications of the approach of her season. And her season\r\nhaving arrived, while she was yet unmarried, she blushed in shame. And it\r\ncame to pass that as she was seated in her chamber on a rich bed, she\r\nbeheld the solar orb rising in the east. And both the mind and the eyes\r\nof that maiden of excellent waist became rivetted fast upon the solar\r\norb. And she gazed and gazed on that orb without being satiated with the\r\nbeauty of the morning Sun. And she suddenly became gifted with celestial\r\nsight. And then she beheld that god of divine form accoutred in mail and\r\nadorned with ear-rings. And at sight of the god, O lord of men, she\r\nbecame curious as to the (potency of the) mantras. And thereupon that\r\nmaiden resolved to invoke him. And having recourse to Pranayama, she\r\ninvoked the Maker of day. And thus invoked by her, O king, the Maker of\r\nday speedily presented himself. And he was of a yellowish hue like honey,\r\nand was possessed of mighty arms, and his neck was marked with lines like\r\nthose of a conchshell. And furnished with armlets, and decked with a\r\ndiadem, he came smiling, and illumining all the directions. And it was by\r\nYoga power that he divided himself in twain, one of which continued to\r\ngive heat, and the other appeared before Kunti. And he addressed Kunti in\r\nwords that were exceedingly sweet, saying, 'O gentle maiden, over-powered\r\nby the mantras, I come hither obedient to thee. Subject as I am to thy\r\npower, what shall I do, O queen? Tell me, for I shall do whatever thou\r\nmayst command? Hearing these words of the deity, Kunti said, 'O\r\nworshipful one, go thou back to the place thou hast come from! I invoked\r\nthee from curiosity alone. Pardon me, O worshipful one!' Surya then said,\r\n'O damsel of slender waist, I will, even as thou hast said, return to the\r\nplace I have come from! Having called a celestial, it is not, however,\r\nproper to send him away in vain. Thy intention, O blessed one, it is to\r\nhave from Surya a son furnished with a coat of mail and ear-rings, and\r\nwho in point of prowess would be beyond compare in this world! Do thou,\r\ntherefore, O damsel of elephantine gait, surrender thy person to me! Thou\r\nshall then have, O lady, a son after thy wish! O gentle girl, O thou of\r\nsweet smiles, I will go back after having known thee! If thou do not\r\ngratify me to-day by obeying my word, I shall in anger curse thee, thy\r\nfather and that Brahmana also. For thy fault, I will surely consume them\r\nall, and I shall inflict condign punishment on that foolish father of\r\nthine that knoweth not this transgression of thine and on that Brahmana\r\nwho hath bestowed the mantras on thee without knowing thy disposition and\r\ncharacter! Yonder are all the celestials in heaven, with Purandara at\r\ntheir head, who are looking at me with derisive smiles at my being\r\ndeceived by thee, O lady! Look at those celestials, for thou art now\r\npossessed of celestial sight! Before this I have endued thee with\r\ncelestial vision, in consequence of which thou couldst see me!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thereupon the princess beheld the celestials\r\nstanding in the firmament, each in his proper sphere[107], even as she\r\nsaw before her that highly resplendent deity furnished with rays, viz.,\r\nSurya himself. And beholding them all, the girl became frightened and her\r\nface was suffused with blushes of shame. And then she addressed Surya,\r\nsaying, 'O lord of rays, go thou back to thy own region. On account of my\r\nmaidenhood, this outrage of thine is fraught with woe to me! It is only\r\none's father, mother, and other superiors, that are capable of giving\r\naway their daughter's body. Virtue I shall never sacrifice, seeing that\r\nin this world the keeping of their persons inviolate is deemed as the\r\nhighest duty of women, and is held in high regard! O thou possessed of\r\nwealth of splendour, it is only to test the power of my mantras that I\r\nhave, from mere childishness, summoned thee. Considering that this hath\r\nbeen done by a girl of tender years, it behoveth thee, O lord, to forgive\r\nher!' Then Surya said, 'It is because I consider thee a girl that, O\r\nKunti, I am speaking to thee so mildly. To one that is not so I would not\r\nconcede this. Do thou, O Kunti, surrender thyself! Thou shalt surely\r\nattain happiness thereby. Since, O timid maiden, thou hast invoked me\r\nwith mantras, it is not proper for me to go away without any purpose\r\nbeing attained, for, if I do so I shall then. O thou of faultless limbs,\r\nbe the object of laughter in the world, and, O beauteous damsel, a\r\nbye-word with all the celestials. Do thou, therefore, yield to me! By\r\nthat thou shalt obtain a son even like myself, and thou shalt also be\r\nmuch praised in all the world.'\""

And when she failed to dissuade the dispeller of darkness, at last\r\nfrom fear of a curse, she reflected, O king, for a long time!--'How may\r\nmy innocent father, and that Brahmana also, escape the angry Surya's\r\ncurse for my sake? Although energy and asceticism are capable of\r\ndestroying sins, yet even honest persons, if they be of unripe age,\r\nshould not foolishly court them. By foolishly acting in that way I have\r\ntoday been placed in a frightful situation. Indeed, I have been placed\r\nentirely within the grasp of this deity. Ye how can I do what is sinful\r\nby taking it on myself to surrender my person to him?'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, afflicted with fear of a curse, and thinking much\r\nwithin herself, an utter stupefaction of the senses came upon her. And\r\nshe was so confounded that she could not settle what to do. Afraid, on\r\nthe one hand, O king, of the reproach of friends if she obeyed the deity,\r\nand, on the other, of his curse if she disobeyed him, the damsel at last,\r\nO foremost of kings, said these words unto that god, in accents tremulous\r\nwith bashfulness, 'O god, as my father and mother and friends are still\r\nliving, this violation of duty on my part should not take place. If; O\r\ngod, I commit this unlawful act with thee, the reputation of this race\r\nshall be sacrificed in this world on my account. If thou, however, O thou\r\nforemost of those that impart heat, deem this to be a meritorious act, I\r\nshall then fulfil thy desire even though my relatives may not have\r\nbestowed me on thee! May I remain chaste after having surrendered my\r\nperson to thee! Surely, the virtue, the reputation, the fame, and the\r\nlife of every creature are established in thee!' Hearing these words of\r\nhers, Surya replied, 'O thou of sweet smiles, neither thy father, nor thy\r\nmother, nor any other superior of thine, is competent to give thee away!\r\nMay good betide thee, O beauteous damsel! Do thou listen to my words! It\r\nis because a virgin desireth the company of every one, that she hath\r\nreceived the appellation of Kanya, from the root kama meaning to desire.\r\nTherefore, O thou of excellent hips and the fairest complexion, a virgin\r\nis, by nature, free in this world. Thou shalt not, O lady, by any means,\r\nbe guilty of any sin by complying with my request. And how can I, who am\r\ndesirous of the welfare of all creatures, commit an unrighteous act? That\r\nall men and women should be bound by no restraints, is the law of nature.\r\nThe opposite condition is the perversion of the natural state. Thou shalt\r\nremain a virgin after having gratified me. And thy son shall also be\r\nmighty-armed and illustrious.' Thereupon Kunti said, 'If, O dispeller of\r\ndarkness, I obtain a son from thee, may he be furnished with a coat of\r\nmail and ear-rings, and may he be mighty-armed and endued with great\r\nstrength!' Hearing these words of hers, Surya answered, 'O gentle maiden,\r\nthy son shall be mighty-armed and decked with ear-rings and a celestial\r\ncoat of mail. And both his ear-rings and coat of mail will be made of\r\nAmrita, and his coat will also be invulnerable.' Kunti then said, 'If the\r\nexcellent mail and ear-rings of the son thou wilt beget on me, be,\r\nindeed, made of Amrita, then, O god, O worshipful deity, let thy purpose\r\nbe fulfilled! May he be powerful, strong, energetic, and handsome, even\r\nlike thee, and may he also be endued with virtue!' Surya then said, 'O\r\nprincess, O excellent damsel, these ear-rings had been given to me by\r\nAditi. O timid lady, I will bestow them, as also this excellent mail, on\r\nthy son!' Kunti then said, 'Very well, O worshipful one!

At\r\nthis, that damsel, on account of Surya's energy, became stupefied. And\r\nthat reverend lady then fell down on her bed, deprived of her senses.\r\nSurya then addressed her, saying, 'I will now depart, O thou of graceful\r\nhips! Thou shalt bring forth a son who will become the foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons. At the same time thou shalt remain a virgin.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Then, O foremost of kings, as the highly\r\neffulgent Surya was about to depart, that girl bashfully said unto him,\r\n'So be it!' And it was thus that the daughter of king Kuntibhoja,\r\nimportuned by Surya, had after soliciting a son from him, fallen down\r\nstupefied on that excellent bed, like a broken creeper. And it was thus\r\nthat deity of fierce rays, stupefying her, entered into her by virtue of\r\nYoga power, and placed his own self within her womb.

And\r\nthat damsel of excellent hips from fear of her friends, concealed her\r\nconception, so that no one knew her condition. And as the damsel lived\r\nentirely in the apartments assigned to the maidens and carefully\r\nconcealed her condition, no one except her nurse knew the truth. And in\r\ndue time that beauteous maiden, by the grace of deity, brought forth a\r\nson resembling a very god. And even like his father, the child was\r\nequipped in a coat of mail, and decked with brilliant ear-rings. And he\r\nwas possessed of leonine eyes and shoulders like those of a bull. And no\r\nsooner was the beauteous girl delivered of a child, then she consulted\r\nwith her nurse and placed the infant in a commodious and smooth box made\r\nof wicker work and spread over with soft sheets and furnished with a\r\ncostly pillow.

And although she\r\nknew it to be improper for an unmarried girl to bear offspring, yet from\r\nparental affection, O foremost of kings, she wept piteously.

And may the Adityas and the Vasus,\r\nthe Rudras and the Sadhyas, the Viswadevas and the Maruts, and the\r\ncardinal points with the great Indra and the regents presiding over them,\r\nand, indeed, all the celestials, protect thee in every place! Even in\r\nforeign lands I shall be able to recognise thee by this mail of thine!\r\nSurely, thy sire, O son, the divine Surya possessed of the wealth of\r\nsplendour, is blessed, for he will with his celestial sight behold thee\r\ngoing down the current! Blessed also is that lady who will, O thou that\r\nare begotten by a god, take thee for her son, and who will give thee suck\r\nwhen thou art thirsty! And what a lucky dream hath been dreamt by her\r\nthat will adopt thee for her son, thee that is endued with solar\r\nsplendour, and furnished with celestial mail, and adorned with celestial\r\near-rings, thee that hast expansive eyes resembling lotuses, a complexion\r\nbright as burnished copper or lotus leaves, a fair forehead, and hair\r\nending in beautiful curls! O son, she that will behold thee crawl on the\r\nground, begrimed with dust, and sweetly uttering inarticulate words, is\r\nsurely blessed! And she also, O son, that will behold thee arrive at thy\r\nyouthful prime like maned lion born in Himalayan forests, is surely\r\nblessed!'\"\r\n\r\n\"O king, having thus bewailed long and piteously, Pritha laid the basket\r\non the waters of the river Aswa.

Meanwhile, the basket\r\nfloated from the river Aswa to the river Charmanwati, and from the\r\nCharmanwati it passed to the Yamuna, and so on to the Ganga. And carried\r\nby the waves of the Ganga, the child contained in the basket came to the\r\ncity of Champa ruled by a person of the Suta tribe.

And, O king, his wife named Radha was\r\nunparalleled on earth for beauty. And although that highly blessed dame\r\nhad made great endeavours to obtain a son, yet she had failed, O\r\nrepresser of foes, to obtain one. And on coming to the river Ganga, she\r\nbeheld a box drifting along the current. And containing articles capable\r\nof protecting from dangers and decked with unguents, that box was brought\r\nbefore her by the waves of the Janhavi.

And the infant was furnished with\r\ngolden mail, and looked exceedingly beautiful with a face decked in\r\near-rings. And thereupon the charioteer, together with his wife, was\r\nstruck with such astonishment that their eyes expanded in wonder.

And beholding that hero among men thus cutting his body with an\r\nweapon, smiling ever and anon, celestial kettle-drums began to be played\r\nupon and celestial flowers began to be showered on him. And Karna cutting\r\noff the excellent mail from his person, gave it to Vasava, still\r\ndripping. And cutting off his ear-rings also from off his ears, he made\r\nthem over to Indra. And it is for this fact that he came to be called\r\nKarna. And Sakra, having thus beguiled Karna that made him famous in the\r\nworld, thought with a smile that the business of the sons of Pandu had\r\nalready been completed. And having done all this, he ascended to heaven.\r\nAnd hearing that Karna had been beguiled, all the sons of Dhritarashtra\r\nbecame distressed and shorn of pride. And the sons of Pritha, on the\r\nother hand, learning that such plight had befallen the son of the\r\ncharioteer, were filled with joy.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"When were those heroes, the sons of Pandu, at that\r\ntime? And from whom did they hear this welcome news? And what also did\r\nthey do, when the twelfth year of their exile passed away? Do thou, O\r\nillustrious one, tell me all this!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"Having defeated the chief of the Saindhavas, and\r\nrescued Krishna, and having outlived the entire term of their painful\r\nexile in the woods, and having listened to the ancient stories about gods\r\nand Rishis recited by Markandeya, those heroes among men returned from\r\ntheir asylum in Kamyaka to the sacred Dwaitavana, with all their cars,\r\nand followers, and accompanied by their charioteers, their kine, and the\r\ncitizens who had followed them.\""

And the sons of Pandu with their wife Krishna began to reside\r\nthere, living frugally on fruits and practising rigid vows. And while\r\nthose repressers of foes, the virtuous king Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nKunti, and Bhimasena, and Arjuna, and those other sons of Pandu born of\r\nMadri, were dwelling in Dwaitavana, practising rigid vows, they\r\nunderwent, for the sake of a Brahmana, great trouble, which, however, was\r\ndestined to bring about their future happiness. I will tell thee all\r\nabout the trouble which those foremost of Kurus underwent while living in\r\nthose woods, and which in the end brought about their happiness. Do thou\r\nlisten to it! Once on a time, as a deer was butting about, it chanced\r\nthat the two sticks for making fire and a churning staff belonging to a\r\nBrahmana devoted to ascetic austerities, struck fast into its antlers.\r\nAnd, thereupon, O king, that powerful deer of exceeding fleetness with\r\nlong bounds, speedily went out of the hermitage, taking those articles\r\naway. And, O foremost of Kurus, seeing those articles of his thus carried\r\naway, the Brahmana, anxious on account of his Agnihotra, quickly came\r\nbefore the Pandavas. And approaching without loss of time Ajatasatru\r\nseated in that forest with his brothers, the Brahmana, in great distress,\r\nspake these words, 'As a deer was butting about, it happened, O king,\r\nthat my fire-sticks and churning staff which had been placed against a\r\nlarge tree stuck fast to its antlers. O king, that powerful deer of\r\nexceeding fleetness hath speedily gone out of the hermitage with long\r\nbounds, taking those articles away. Tracking that powerful deer, O king,\r\nby its foot-prints, do ye, ye sons of Pandu, bring back those articles of\r\nmine, so that my Agnihotra may not be stopped!' Hearing these words of\r\nthe Brahmana, Yudhishthira became exceedingly concerned. And the son of\r\nKunti taking up his bow sallied out with his brothers. And putting on\r\ntheir corselets and equipped with their bows, those bulls among men,\r\nintent upon serving the Brahmana, swiftly sallied out in the wake of the\r\ndeer. And descrying the deer at no great distance, those mighty warriors\r\ndischarged at it barbed arrows and javelins and darts, but the sons of\r\nPandu could not pierce it by any means. And as they struggled to pursue\r\nand slay it, that powerful deer became suddenly invisible. And losing\r\nsight of the deer, the noble-minded sons of Pandu, fatigued and\r\ndisappointed and afflicted with hunger and thirst, approached a banian\r\ntree in that deep forest, and sat down in its cool shade. And when they\r\nhad sat down, Nakula stricken with sorrow and urged by impatience,\r\naddressed his eldest brother of the Kuru race, saying, 'In our race, O\r\nking, virtue hath never been sacrificed, nor hath there been loss of\r\nwealth from insolence. And being asked, we have never said to any\r\ncreature, Nay! Why then in the present case have we met with this\r\ndisaster?\""

It is the Lord of\r\njustice alone who distributeth the fruits of both virtue and vice.'\r\nThereupon Bhima said, 'Surely, this calamity hath befallen us, because I\r\ndid not slay the Pratikamin on the very spot, when he dragged Krishna as\r\na slave into the assembly. And Arjuna said, 'Surely, this calamity hath\r\nbefallen us because I resented not those biting words piercing the very\r\nbones, uttered by the Suta's son!' And Sahadeva said, 'Surely, O Bharata,\r\nthis calamity hath befallen us because I did not slay Sakuni when he\r\ndefeated thee at dice!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Then king Yudhishthira addressed Nakula saying,\r\n'Do thou, O son of Madri, climb this tree and look around the ten points\r\nof the horizon. Do thou see whether there is water near us or such trees\r\nas grow on watery grounds! O child, these thy brothers are all fatigued\r\nand thirsty.' Thereupon saying, 'So be it,' Nakula speedily climbed up a\r\ntree, and having looked around, said unto his eldest brother, 'O king, I\r\nsee many a tree that groweth by the water-side, and I hear also the cries\r\nof cranes. Therefore, without doubt, water must be somewhere here.'\r\nHearing these words, Kunti's son Yudhishthira, firm in truth, said, 'O\r\namiable one, go thou and fetch water in these quivers!' Saying, 'So be\r\nit,' at the command of his eldest brother Nakula quickly proceeded\r\ntowards the place where there was water and soon came upon it. And\r\nbeholding a crystal lake inhabited by cranes he desired to drink of it,\r\nwhen he heard these words from the sky, 'O child, do not commit this rash\r\nact! This lake hath already been in my possession. Do thou, O son of\r\nMadri, first answer my questions and then drink of this water and take\r\naway (as much as thou requirest). Nakula, however, who was exceedingly\r\nthirsty, disregarding these words, drank of the cool water, and having\r\ndrunk of it, dropped down dead. And, O represser of foes, seeing Nakula's\r\ndelay, Yudhishthira the son of Kunti said unto Sahadeva, the heroic\r\nbrother of Nakula, 'O Sahadeva, it is long since our brother, he who was\r\nborn immediately before thee, hath gone from hence! Do thou, therefore,\r\ngo and bring back thy uterine brother, together with water.' At this,\r\nSahadeva, saying, 'So be it,' set out in that direction; and coming to\r\nthe spot, beheld his brother lying dead on the ground. And afflicted at\r\nthe death of his brother, and suffering severely from thirst, he advanced\r\ntowards the water, when these words were heard by him, 'O child, do not\r\ncommit this rash act! This lake hath already been in my possession. First\r\nanswer my question, and then drink of the water and take away as much as\r\nthou mayst require.' Sahadeva, however, who was extremely thirsty,\r\ndisregarding these words, drank of the water, and having drunk of it,\r\ndropped down dead. Then Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, said unto Vijaya,\r\n'It is long since, O Vibhatsu, that thy two brothers have gone, O\r\nrepresser of foes! Blessed be thou! Do thou bring them back, together\r\nwith water. Thou art, O child, the refuge of us all when plunged in\r\ndistress!' Thus addressed, the intelligent Gudakesa, taking his bow and\r\narrows and also his naked sword, set out tor that lake of waters. And\r\nreaching that spot, he whose car was drawn by white steeds beheld those\r\ntigers among men, his two younger brothers who had come to fetch water,\r\nlying dead there. And seeing them as if asleep, that lion among men,\r\nexceedingly aggrieved, raised his bow and began to look around that wood.\r\nBut he found none in that mighty forest. And, being fatigued, he who was\r\ncapable of drawing the bow by his left hand as well, rushed in the\r\ndirection of the water. And as he was rushing (towards the water), he\r\nheard these words from the sky, 'Why dost thou approach this water? Thou\r\nshalt not be able to drink of it by force. If thou, O Kaunteya, can\r\nanswer the question I will put to thee, then only shalt thou drink of the\r\nwater and take away as much as thou requirest, O Bharata!' Thus\r\nforbidden, the son of Pritha said, 'Do thou forbid me by appearing before\r\nme! And when thou shalt be sorely pierced with my arrows, thou wilt not\r\nthen again speak in this way!' Having said this, Partha covered all sides\r\nwith arrows inspired by mantras. And he also displayed his skill in\r\nshooting at an invisible mark by sound alone. And, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, sorely afflicted with thirst, he discharged barbed darts and\r\njavelins and iron arrows, and showered on the sky innumerable shafts\r\nincapable of being baffled. Thereupon, the invisible Yaksha said, 'What\r\nneed of all this trouble, O son of Pritha? Do thou drink only after\r\nanswering my questions! If thou drink, however, without answering my\r\nquestions, thou shalt die immediately after.' Thus addressed, Pritha's\r\nson Dhananjaya capable of drawing the bow with his left hand as well,\r\ndisregarding those words, drank of the water, and immediately after\r\ndropped down dead. And (seeing Dhananjaya's delay) Kunti's son\r\nYudhishthira addressed Bhimasena, saying, 'O represser of foes, it is a\r\nlong while that Nakula and Sahadeva and Vibhatsu have gone to fetch\r\nwater, and they have not come yet, O Bharata! Good betide thee! Do thou\r\nbring them back, together with water!' Thereupon saying, 'So be it,'\r\nBhimasena set out for that place where those tigers among men, his\r\nbrothers, lay dead. And beholding them, Bhima afflicted though he was\r\nwith thirst, was exceedingly distressed. And that mighty armed hero\r\nthought all that to have been the act of some Yaksha or Rakshasa. And\r\nPritha's son Vrikodara thought, 'I shall surely have to fight today. Let\r\nme, therefore, first appease my thirst.' Then that bull of the Bharata\r\nrace rushed forward with the intention of drinking. Thereupon the Yaksha\r\nsaid, 'O child, do not commit this rash act! This lake hath already been\r\nin my possession. Do thou first answer my questions, and then drink and\r\ntake away as much water as thou requirest!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by that Yaksha of immeasurable\r\nenergy, Bhima, without answering his questions, drank of the water. And\r\nas soon as he drank, he fell down dead on the spot. Then thinking that\r\nhis brothers had left him long since, Yudhishthira waited for some time.\r\nAnd the king said unto himself again and again, 'Why is it that the two\r\nsons of Madri are delaying? And why doth the wielder also of the Gandiva\r\ndelay? And why doth Bhima too, endued with great strength, delay? I shall\r\ngo to search for them!' And resolved to do this, the mighty-armed\r\nYudhishthira then rose up, his heart burning in grief. And that bull\r\namong men, the royal son of Kunti thought within himself. 'Is this forest\r\nunder some malign influence? Or, is it infested by some wicked beasts?\r\nOr, have they all fallen, in consequence of having disregarded some\r\nmighty being? Or, not finding water in the spot whither those heroes had\r\nfirst repaired, they have spent all this time in search through the\r\nforest? What is that reason for which those bulls among men do not come\r\nback?' And speaking in this strain, that foremost of monarchs, the\r\nillustrious Yudhishthira, entered into that mighty forest where no human\r\nsound was heard and which was inhabited by deer and bears and birds, and\r\nwhich was adorned with trees that were bright and green, and which echoed\r\nwith the hum of the black-bee and the notes of winged warblers. As he was\r\nproceeding along, he beheld that beautiful lake which looked as if it had\r\nbeen made by the celestial artificer himself. And it was adorned with\r\nflowers of a golden hue and with lotuses and Sindhuvars. And it abounded\r\nwith canes and Ketakas and Karaviras and Pippalas, and fatigued with\r\ntoil, Yudhishthira saw that tank and was struck with wonder.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said, \"Yudhishthira saw his brothers, each possessed of the\r\nglory of Indra himself, lying dead like the Regents of the world dropped\r\nfrom their spheres at the end of the Yuga. And beholding Arjuna lying\r\ndead, with his bow and arrows dropped on the ground, and also Bhimasena\r\nand the twins motionless and deprived of life, the king breathed a hot\r\nand long sigh, and was bathed in tears of grief. And beholding his\r\nbrothers lying dead, the mighty armed son of Dharma with heart racked in\r\nanxiety, began to lament profusely, saying, 'Thou hadst, O mighty-armed\r\nVrikodara, vowed, saying,--I shall with mace smash the thighs of\r\nDuryodhana in battle! O enhancer of the glory of the Kurus, in thy death,\r\nO mighty-armed and high-souled one, all that hath become fruitless now!\r\nThe promises of men may be ineffectual; but why have the words of the\r\ngods uttered in respect of thee been thus fruitless? O Dhananjaya, while\r\nthou wert in thy mother's lying-in-room, the gods had said,--O Kunti,\r\nthis thy son shall not be inferior to him of a thousand eyes! And in the\r\nnorthern Paripatra mountains, all beings had sung, saying,--The\r\nprosperity (of this race), robbed by foes will be recovered by this one\r\nwithout delay. No one will be able to vanquish him in battle, while there\r\nwill be none whom he will not be able to vanquish. Why then hath that\r\nJishnu endued with great strength been subject to death? Oh, why doth\r\nthat Dhananjaya, relying on whom we had hitherto endured all this misery,\r\nlie on the ground blighting[108] all my hopes! Why have those heroes,\r\nthose mighty sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and Dhananjaya, came under the\r\npower of the enemy,--those who themselves always slew their foes, and\r\nwhom no weapons could resist! Surely, this vile heart of mine must be\r\nmade of adamant, since, beholding these twins lying today on the ground\r\nit doth not split! Ye bulls among men, versed in holy writ and acquainted\r\nwith the properties of time and place, and endued with ascetic merit, ye\r\nwho duly performed all sacred rites, why lie ye down, without performing\r\nacts deserving of you? Alas, why lie ye insensible on the earth, with\r\nyour bodies unwounded, ye unvanquished ones, and with your vows\r\nuntouched?' And beholding his brothers sweetly sleeping there as (they\r\nusually did) on mountain slopes, the high souled king, overwhelmed with\r\ngrief and bathed in sweat, came to a distressful condition. And\r\nsaying,--It is even so--that virtuous lord of men, immersed in an ocean\r\nof grief anxiously proceeded to ascertain the cause (of that\r\ncatastrophe). And that mighty-armed and high-souled one, acquainted with\r\nthe divisions of time and place, could not settle his course of action.\r\nHaving thus bewailed much in this strain, the virtuous Yudhishthira, the\r\nson of Dharma or Tapu, restrained his soul and began to reflect in his\r\nmind as to who had slain those heroes. 'There are no strokes of weapons\r\nupon these, nor is any one's foot-print here. The being must be mighty I\r\nween, by whom my brothers have been slain. Earnestly shall I ponder over\r\nthis, or, let me first drink of the water, and then know all. It may be\r\nthat the habitually crooked-minded Duryodhana hath caused this water to\r\nbe secretly placed here by the king of the Gandharvas. What man of sense\r\ncan trust wicked wight of evil passions with whom good and evil are\r\nalike? Or, perhaps, this may be an act of that wicked-souled one through\r\nsecret messengers of his.' And it was thus that that highly intelligent\r\none gave way to diverse reflections. He did not believe that water to\r\nhave been tainted with poison, for though dead no corpse-like pallor was\r\non them. 'The colour on the faces of these my brothers hath not faded!'\r\nAnd it was thus that Yudhishthira thought. And the king continued, 'Each\r\nof these foremost of men was like unto a mighty cataract. Who, therefore,\r\nsave Yama himself who in due time bringeth about the end of all things,\r\ncould have baffled them thus.' And having concluded this for certain, he\r\nbegan to perform his ablutions in that lake. And while he descended into\r\nit, he heard these words from the sky, uttered by the Yaksha,--'I am a\r\ncrane, living on tiny fish. It is by me that thy younger brothers have\r\nbeen brought under the sway of the lord of departed spirits. If, thou, O\r\nprince, answer not the questions put by me, even thou shalt number the\r\nfifth corpse. Do not, O child, act rashly! This lake hath already been in\r\nmy possession. Having answered my questions first, do thou, O Kunti's\r\nson, drink and carry away (as much as thou requirest)!' Hearing these\r\nwords, Yudhishthira said, 'Art thou the foremost of the Rudras, or of the\r\nVasus, or of the Marutas? I ask, what god art thou? This could not have\r\nbeen done by a bird! Who is it that hath overthrown the four mighty\r\nmountains, viz., the Himavat, the Paripatra, the Vindhya, and the Malaya?\r\nGreat is the feat done by thee, thou foremost of strong persons! Those\r\nwhom neither gods, nor Gandharvas nor Asuras, nor Rakshasas could endure\r\nin mighty conflict, have been slain by thee! Therefore, exceedingly\r\nwonderful is the deed done by thee! I do not know what thy business may\r\nbe, nor do I know thy purpose. Therefore, great is the curiosity and fear\r\nalso that have taken possession of me? My mind is greatly agitated, and\r\nas my head also is aching, I ask thee, therefore, O worshipful one, who\r\nart thou that stayest here?' Hearing these words the Yaksha said, 'I am,\r\ngood betide thee, a Yaksha, and not an amphibious bird. It is by me that\r\nall these brothers of thine, endued with mighty prowess, have been slain!'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these accursed words couched in harsh\r\nsyllabus,[109] Yudhishthira, O king, approaching the Yaksha who had\r\nspoken then, stood there. And that bull among the Bharatas then beheld\r\nthat Yaksha of unusual eyes and huge body tall like a palmyra-palm and\r\nlooking like fire or the Sun, and irresistible and gigantic like a\r\nmountain, staying on a tree, and uttering a loud roar deep as that of the\r\nclouds. And the Yaksha said, 'These thy brothers, O king, repeatedly\r\nforbidden by me, would forcibly take away water. It is for this that they\r\nhave been slain by me! He that wisheth to live, should not, O king, drink\r\nthis water! O son of Pritha, act not rashly! This lake hath already been\r\nin my possession. Do thou, O son of Kunti, first answer my questions, and\r\nthen take away as much as thou likest!' Yudhishthira said, 'I do not, O\r\nYaksha, covet, what is already in thy possession! O bull among male\r\nbeings, virtuous persons never approve that one should applaud his own\r\nself (without boasting, I shall, therefore, answer thy questions,\r\naccording to my intelligence). Do thou ask me!' The Yaksha then said,\r\n'What is it that maketh the Sun rise? Who keeps him company? Who causeth\r\nhim to set? And in whom is he established?' Yudhishthira answered,\r\n'Brahma maketh the Sun rise: the gods keep him company: Dharma causeth\r\nhim to set: and he is established in truth.'[110] The Yaksha asked, 'By\r\nwhat doth one become learned? By what doth he attain what is very great?\r\nHow can one have a second? And, O king, how can one acquire\r\nintelligence?' Yudhishthira answered, 'It is by the (study of the) Srutis\r\nthat a person becometh learned; it is by ascetic austerities that one\r\nacquireth what is very great: it is by intelligence that a person\r\nacquireth a second and it is by serving the old that one becometh\r\nwise.'[111] The Yaksha asked, 'What constituteth the divinity of the\r\nBrahmanas? What even is their practice that is like that of the pious?\r\nWhat also is the human attribute of the Brahmanas? And what practice of\r\ntheirs is like that of the impious?' Yudhishthira answered, 'The study of\r\nthe Vedas constitutes their divinity: their asceticism constitutes\r\nbehaviour that is like that of the pious; their liability to death is\r\ntheir human attribute and slander is their impiety.' The Yaksha asked,\r\n'What institutes the divinity of the Kshatriyas? What even is their\r\npractice that is like that of the pious? What is their human attribute?\r\nAnd what practice of theirs is like that of the impious?' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered, 'Arrows and weapons are their divinity: celebration of\r\nsacrifices is that act which is like that of the pious: liability to fear\r\nis their human attribute; and refusal of protection is that act of theirs\r\nwhich is like that of the impious.' The Yaksha asked, 'What is that which\r\nconstitutes the Sama of the sacrifice? What the Yajus of the sacrifice?\r\nWhat is that which is the refuge of a sacrifice? And what is that which\r\nsacrifice cannot do without?' Yudhishthira answered, 'Life is the Sama of\r\nthe sacrifice; the mind is the Yajus of the sacrifice: the Rik is that\r\nwhich is the refuge of the sacrifice; and it is Rik alone which sacrifice\r\ncannot do without.'[112] The Yaksha asked, 'What is of the foremost value\r\nto those that cultivate? What is of the foremost value to those that sow?\r\nWhat is of the foremost value to those that wish for prosperity in this\r\nworld? And what is of the foremost value to those that bring forth?'\r\nYudhishthira answered, 'That which is of the foremost value to those that\r\ncultivate is rain: that of the foremost value to those that sow is seed:\r\nthat of the foremost value to those that bring forth is offspring.[113]'\r\nThe Yaksha asked, 'What person, enjoying all the objects of the senses,\r\nendued with intelligence, regarded by the world and liked by all beings,\r\nthough breathing, doth not offer anything to these five, viz., gods,\r\nguests, servants, Pitris, and himself, though endued with breath, is not\r\nyet alive.' The Yaksha asked, 'What is weightier than the earth itself?\r\nWhat is higher than the heavens?' What is fleeter than the wind? And what\r\nis more numerous than grass?' Yudhishthira answered, 'The mother is\r\nweightier than the earth; the father is higher than the heaven; the mind\r\nis fleeter than the wind; and our thoughts are more numerous than grass.'\r\nThe Yaksha asked, 'What is that which doth not close its eyes while\r\nasleep; What is that which doth not move after birth? What is that which\r\nis without heart? And what is that which swells with its own impetus?'\r\nYudhishthira answered, 'A fish doth not close its eyes while asleep: an\r\negg doth not move after birth: a stone is without heart: and a river\r\nswelleth with its own impetus.' The Yaksha asked, 'Who is the friend of\r\nthe exile? Who is the friend of the householder? Who is the friend of him\r\nthat ails? And who is the friend of one about to die?' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered, 'The friend of the exile in a distant land is his companion,\r\nthe friend of the householder is the wife; the friend of him that ails is\r\nthe physician: and the friend of him about to die is charity. The Yaksha\r\nasked,--'Who is the guest of all creatures? What is the eternal duty?\r\nWhat, O foremost of kings, is Amrita? And what is this entire Universe?'\r\nYudhishthira answered,--Agni is the guest of all creatures: the milk of\r\nkine is amrita: Homa (therewith) is the eternal duty: and this Universe\r\nconsists of air alone.'[114] The Yaksha asked,--'What is that which\r\nsojourneth alone? What is that which is re-born after its birth? What is\r\nthe remedy against cold? And what is the largest field?' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered,--'The sun sojourneth alone; the moon takes birth anew: fire is\r\nthe remedy against cold: and the Earth is the largest field.' The Yaksha\r\nasked,--'What is the highest refuge of virtue? What of fame? What of\r\nheaven? And what, of happiness?' Yudhishthira answered,--'Liberality is\r\nthe highest refuge of virtue: gift, of fame: truth, of heaven: and good\r\nbehaviour, of happiness.' The Yaksha asked,--'What is the soul of man?\r\nWho is that friend bestowed on man by the gods? What is man's chief\r\nsupport? And what also is his chief refuge?' Yudhishthira answered,--'The\r\nson is a man's soul: the wife is the friend bestowed on man by the gods;\r\nthe clouds are his chief support; and gift is his chief refuge.' The\r\nYaksha asked,--'What is the best of all laudable things? What is the most\r\nvaluable of all his possessions? What is the best of all gains? And what\r\nis the best of all kinds of happiness?' Yudhishthira answered,--\"The best\r\nof all laudable things is skill; the best of all possessions is\r\nknowledge: the best of all gains is health: and contentment is the best\r\nof all kinds of happiness.' The Yaksha asked,--'What is the highest duty\r\nin the world? What is that virtue which always beareth fruit? What is\r\nthat which if controlled, leadeth not to regret? And who are they with\r\nwhom an alliance cannot break?' Yudhishthira answered,--'The highest of\r\nduties is to refrain from injury: the rites ordained in the Three (Vedas)\r\nalways bear fruit: the mind, if controlled, leadeth to no regret: and an\r\nalliance with the good never breaketh.' The Yaksha asked,--'What is that\r\nwhich, if renounced, maketh one agreeable? What is that which, if\r\nrenounced, leadeth to no regret? What is that which, if renounced, maketh\r\none wealthy? And what is that which if renounced, maketh one happy?'\r\nYudhishthira answered,--'Pride, if renounced, maketh one agreeable;\r\nwrath, if renounced leadeth to no regret: desire, if renounced, maketh\r\none wealthy: and avarice, if renounced, maketh one happy.' The Yaksha\r\nasked,--'For what doth one give away to Brahmanas? For what to mimes and\r\ndancers? For what to servants? And for what to king?' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered,--'It is for religious merit that one giveth away to Brahmanas:\r\nit is for fame that one giveth away to mimes and dancers: it is for\r\nsupporting them that one giveth away to servants: and it is for obtaining\r\nrelief from fear that one giveth to kings.' The Yaksha asked,--'With what\r\nis the world enveloped? What is that owing to which a thing cannot\r\ndiscover itself? For what are friends forsaken? And for what doth one\r\nfail to go to heaven?' Yudhishthira answered,--'The world is enveloped\r\nwith darkness. Darkness doth not permit a thing to show itself. It is\r\nfrom avarice that friends are forsaken. And it is connection with the\r\nworld for which one faileth to go to heaven.' The Yaksha asked,--'For\r\nwhat may one be considered as dead? For what may a kingdom be considered\r\nas dead? For what may a Sraddha be considered as dead? And for what, a\r\nsacrifice?' Yudhishthira answered,--'For want of wealth may a man be\r\nregarded as dead. A kingdom for want of a king may be regarded as dead. A\r\nSraddha that is performed with the aid of a priest that hath no learning\r\nmay be regarded as dead. And a sacrifice in which there are no gifts to\r\nBrahmanas is dead.' The Yaksha asked,--'What constitutes the way? What,\r\nhath been spoken of as water? What, as food? And what, as poison? Tell us\r\nalso what is the proper time of a Sraddha, and then drink and take away\r\nas much as thou likest!' Yudhishthira answered,--'They that are good\r\nconstitute the way.[115] Space hath been spoken of as water.[116] The cow\r\nis food.[117] A request is poison. And a Brahmana is regarded as the\r\nproper time of a Sraddha.[118] I do not know what thou mayst think of all\r\nthis, O Yaksha?' The Yaksha asked,--'What hath been said to be the sign\r\nof asceticism? And what is true restraint? What constitutes forgiveness.\r\nAnd what is shame?' Yudhishthira answered,--'Staying in one's own\r\nreligion is asceticism: the restraint of the mind is of all restraints\r\nthe true one: forgiveness consists in enduring enmity; and shame, in\r\nwithdrawing from all unworthy acts.' The Yaksha asked,--'What, O king is\r\nsaid to be knowledge? What, tranquillity? What constitutes mercy? And\r\nwhat hath been called simplicity?' Yudhishthira answered,--'True\r\nknowledge is that of Divinity. True tranquillity is that of the heart.\r\nMercy consists in wishing happiness to all. And simplicity is equanimity\r\nof heart.' The Yaksha asked,--'What enemy is invincible? What constitutes\r\nan incurable disease for man? What sort of a man is called honest and\r\nwhat dishonest?' Yudhishthira answered,--'Anger is an invincible enemy.\r\nCovetousness constitutes an incurable disease. He is honest that desires\r\nthe weal of all creatures, and he is dishonest who is unmerciful.' The\r\nYaksha asked,--'What, O king, is ignorance? And what is pride? What also\r\nis to be understood by idleness? And what hath been spoken of as grief?'\r\nYudhishthira answered,--'True ignorance consists in not knowing one's\r\nduties. Pride is a consciousness of one's being himself an actor or\r\nsufferer in life. Idleness consists in not discharging one's duties, and\r\nignorance in grief.' The Yaksha asked,--'What hath steadiness been said\r\nby the Rishis to be? And what, patience? What also is a real ablution?\r\nAnd what is charity?' Yudhishthira answered,--'Steadiness consists in\r\none's staying in one's own religion, and true patience consists in the\r\nsubjugation of the senses. A true bath consists in washing the mind clean\r\nof all impurities, and charity consists in protecting all creatures.' The\r\nYaksha asked,--'What man should be regarded as learned, and who should be\r\ncalled an atheist? Who also is to be called ignorant? What is called\r\ndesire and what are the sources of desire? And what is envy?'\r\nYudhishthira answered,--'He is to be called learned who knoweth his\r\nduties. An atheist is he who is ignorant and so also he is ignorant who\r\nis an atheist. Desire is due to objects of possession, and envy is\r\nnothing else than grief of heart.' The Yaksha asked,--'What is pride, and\r\nwhat is hypocrisy? What is the grace of the gods, and what is\r\nwickedness?' Yudhishthira answered,--'Stolid ignorance is pride. The\r\nsetting up of a religious standard is hypocrisy. The grace of the gods is\r\nthe fruit of our gifts, and wickedness consists in speaking ill of\r\nothers.' The Yaksha asked,--'Virtue, profit, and desire are opposed to\r\none another. How could things thus antagonistic to one another exist\r\ntogether?' Yudhishthira answered,--'When a wife and virtue agree with\r\neach other, then all the three thou hast mentioned may exist together.'\r\nThe Yaksha asked,--'O bull of the Bharata race, who is he that is\r\ncondemned to everlasting hell? It behoveth thee to soon answer the\r\nquestion that I ask!' Yudhishthira answered,--'He that summoneth a poor\r\nBrahmana promising to make him a gift and then tells him that he hath\r\nnothing to give, goeth to everlasting hell. He also must go to\r\neverlasting hell, who imputes falsehood to the Vedas, the scriptures, the\r\nBrahmanas, the gods, and the ceremonies in honour of the Pitris, He also\r\ngoeth to everlasting hell who though in possession of wealth, never\r\ngiveth away nor enjoyeth himself from avarice, saying, he hath none.' The\r\nYaksha asked,--'By what, O king, birth, behaviour, study, or learning\r\ndoth a person become a Brahmana? Tell us with certitude!' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered,-'Listen, O Yaksha! It is neither birth, nor study, nor\r\nlearning, that is the cause of Brahmanahood, without doubt, it is\r\nbehaviour that constitutes it. One's behaviour should always be\r\nwell-guarded, especially by a Brahmana. He who maintaineth his conduct\r\nunimpaired, is never impaired himself. Professors and pupils, in fact,\r\nall who study the scriptures, if addicted to wicked habits, are to be\r\nregarded as illiterate wretches. He only is learned who performeth his\r\nreligious duties. He even that hath studied the four Vedas is to be\r\nregarded as a wicked wretch scarcely distinguishable from a Sudra (if his\r\nconduct be not correct). He only who performeth the Agnihotra and hath\r\nhis senses under control, is called a Brahmana!' The Yaksha asked,--'What\r\ndoth one gain that speaketh agreeable words? What doth he gain that\r\nalways acteth with judgment? What doth he gain that hath many friends?\r\nAnd what he, that is devoted to virtue?'--Yudhishthira answered,--'He\r\nthat speaketh agreeable words becometh agreeable to all. He that acteth\r\nwith judgment obtaineth whatever he seeketh. He that hath many friends\r\nliveth happily. And he that is devoted to virtue obtaineth a happy state\r\n(in the next world).' The Yaksha asked,--'Who is truly happy? What is\r\nmost wonderful? What is the path? And what is the news? Answer these four\r\nquestions of mine and let thy dead brothers revive.' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered,--'O amphibious creature, a man who cooketh in his own house, on\r\nthe fifth or the sixth part of the day, with scanty vegetables, but who\r\nis not in debt and who stirreth not from home, is truly happy. Day after\r\nday countless creatures are going to the abode of Yama, yet those that\r\nremain behind believe themselves to be immortal. What can be more\r\nwonderful than this? Argument leads to no certain conclusion, the Srutis\r\nare different from one another; there is not even one Rishi whose opinion\r\ncan be accepted by all; the truth about religion and duty is hid in\r\ncaves: therefore, that alone is the path along which the great have trod.\r\nThis world full of ignorance is like a pan. The sun is fire, the days and\r\nnights are fuel. The months and the seasons constitute the wooden ladle.\r\nTime is the cook that is cooking all creatures in that pan (with such\r\naids); this is the news.' The Yaksha asked,--'Thou hast, O represser of\r\nfoes, truly answered all my questions! Tell us now who is truly a man,\r\nand what man truly possesseth every kind of wealth.' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered,--'The report of one's good action reacheth heaven and spreadeth\r\nover the earth. As long as that report lasteth, so long is a person to\r\nwhom the agreeable and the disagreeable, weal and woe, the past and the\r\nfuture, are the same, is said to possess every kind of wealth.' The\r\nYaksha said,--'Thou hast, O king truly answered who is a man, and what\r\nman possesseth every kind of wealth. Therefore, let one only amongst thy\r\nbrothers, whom thou mayst wish, get up with life!' Yudhishthira\r\nanswered,--'Let this one that is of darkish hue, whose eyes are red, who\r\nis tall like a large Sala tree, whose chest is broad and arms long, let\r\nthis Nakula, O Yaksha, get up with life! The Yaksha rejoined,-'This\r\nBhimasena is dear unto thee, and this Arjuna also is one upon whom all of\r\nyou depend! Why, then, O king dost thou, wish a step-brother to get up\r\nwith his life! How canst thou, forsaking Bhima whose strength is equal to\r\nthat of ten thousand elephants, wish Nakula to live? People said that\r\nthis Bhima was dear to thee. From what motive then dost thou wish a\r\nstep-brother to revive? Forsaking Arjuna the might of whose arm is\r\nworshipped by all the sons of Pandu, why dost thou wish Nakula to\r\nrevive?' Yudhishthira said,--'If virtue is sacrificed, he that\r\nsacrificeth it, is himself lost. So virtue also cherisheth the cherisher.\r\nTherefore taking care that virtue by being sacrificed may not sacrifice\r\nus, I never forsake virtue. Abstention from injury is the highest virtue,\r\nand is, I ween, even higher than the highest object of attainment. I\r\nendeavour to practise that virtue. Therefore, let Nakula, O Yaksha,\r\nrevive! Let men know that the king is always virtuous! I will never\r\ndepart from my duty. Let Nakula, therefore, revive! My father had two\r\nwives, Kunti and Madri. Let both of them have children. This is what I\r\nwish. As Kunti is to me, so also is Madri. There is no difference between\r\nthem in my eye. I desire to act equally towards my mothers. Therefore,\r\nlet Nakula live?' The Yaksha said,--'Since abstention from injury is\r\nregarded by thee as higher than both profit and pleasure, therefore, let\r\nall thy brothers live, O bull of Bharata race!\""

Art thou the foremost of the Vasus,\r\nor of the Rudras, or of the chief of the Maruts? Or art thou the lord\r\nhimself of the celestials, wielder of the thunder-bolt! Each of these my\r\nbrothers is capable of fighting as hundred thousand warriors, and I see\r\nnot the warrior that can slay them all! I see also that their senses have\r\nrefreshed, as if they have sweetly awaked from slumber. Art thou a friend\r\nof ours, or even our father himself? At this the Yaksha replied,-'O\r\nchild, I am even thy father, the Lord of justice, possessed of great\r\nprowess! Know, bull of the Bharata race, that I came hither desirous of\r\nbeholding thee! Fame, truth, self-restraint, purity, candour, modesty,\r\nsteadiness, charity, austerities and Brahmacharya, these are my body! And\r\nabstention from injury, impartiality, peace, penances, sanctity, and\r\nfreedom from malice are the doors (through which I am accessible). Thou\r\nart always dear to me! By good luck thou art devoted to the five;[119]\r\nand by good luck also thou hast conquered the six.[120] Of the six, two\r\nappear in the first part of life; two in the middle part thereof; and the\r\nremaining two at the end, in order to make men repair to the next world.\r\nI am, good betide thee, the lord of justice! I came hither to test thy\r\nmerit. I am well-pleased to witness thy harmlessness; and, O sinless one,\r\nI will confer boons on thee. Do thou, O foremost of kings, ask of me\r\nboons. I shall surely confer them, O sinless one! Those that revere me,\r\nnever come by distress!' Yudhishthira said,--'A deer was carrying away\r\nthe Brahmana's fire-sticks. Therefore, the first boon that I shall ask,\r\nis, may that Brahmana's adorations to Agni be not interrupted!' The\r\nYaksha said,--'O Kunti's son endued with splendour, it was I who for\r\nexamining thee, was carrying away, in the guise of a deer, that\r\nBrahmana's fire-sticks!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Thereupon that worshipful one said,--'I give\r\nthee this boon! Good betide thee! O thou that are like unto an immortal,\r\nask thou a fresh boon! Yudhishthira said,--'We have spent these twelve\r\nyears in the forest; and the thirteenth year is come. May no one\r\nrecognise us, as we spend this year somewhere.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,-'Thereat that worshipful one replied,--'I give\r\nthis boon unto thee!' And then reassuring Kunti's son having truth for\r\nprowess, he also said, 'Even if, O Bharata, ye range this (entire) earth\r\nin your proper forms none in the three worlds shall recognise you. Ye\r\nperpetuators of the Kuru race, through my grace, ye will spend this\r\nthirteenth year, secretly and unrecognised, in Virata's kingdom! And\r\nevery one of you will be able at will to assume any form he likes! Do ye\r\nnow present the Brahmana with his fire-sticks. It was only to test you\r\nthat I carried them away in the form of a deer! O amiable Yudhishthira,\r\ndo thou ask for another boon that thou mayst like! I will confer it on\r\nthee. O foremost of men, I have not yet been satisfied by granting boons\r\nto thee! Do thou my son, accept a third boon that is great and\r\nincomparable! Thou, O king, art born of me, and Vidura of portion or\r\nmine!\" Thereat Yudhishthira said,--'It is enough that I have beheld thee\r\nwith my senses, eternal God of gods as thou art! O father, whatever boon\r\nthou wilt confer on me I shall surely accept gladly!

      "content": "Vaisampayana continued,--\"Commanded by the Lord of justice to thus spend\r\nin disguise the thirteenth year of non-discovery, the high-souled\r\nPandavas, observant of vows and having truth for prowess, sat before\r\nthose learned and vow-observing ascetics that from regard were dwelling\r\nwith them in their exile in the forest. And with joined hands they said\r\nthese words, with the intention of obtaining permission to spend the\r\nthirteenth year in the manner indicated. And they said, 'Ye know well\r\nthat the sons of Dhritarashtra have by deceit deprived us of our kingdom,\r\nand have also done us many other wrongs! We have passed twelve years in\r\nthe forest in great affliction. The thirteenth year only, which we are to\r\nspend unrecognised, yet remaineth. It behoveth you to permit us now to\r\nspend this year in concealment! Those rancorous enemies of ours\r\nSuyodhana, the wicked-minded Kama, and Suvala's son should they discover\r\nus, would do mighty wrong to the citizens and our friends! Shall we all\r\nwith the Brahmanas, be again established in our own kingdom? Having said\r\nthis, that pure-spirited son of Dharma king Yudhishthira, overwhelmed\r\nwith grief and with accents choked in tears, swooned away. Thereupon the\r\nBrahmanas, together with his brothers began to cheer him up. Then Dhaumya\r\nspake unto the king these words fraught with mighty meaning,--'O king,\r\nthou art learned and capable of bearing privations, art firm in promise,\r\nand of subdued sense! Men of such stamp are not overwhelmed by any\r\ncalamity whatever. Even the high-souled gods themselves have wandered\r\nover various places in disguise, for the purpose of overcoming foes.\r\nIndra for the purpose of overcoming his toes, dwelt in disguise in the\r\nasylum of Giriprastha, in Nishadha and thus attained his end. Before\r\ntaking his birth in the womb of Aditi, Vishnu for the purpose of\r\ndestroying the Daityas passed a long time unrecognised, assuming the form\r\nof the Haya-griba (Horse-necked). Then how disguising himself in the form\r\nof a dwarf, he by his prowess deprived Vali of his kingdom, hath been\r\nheard by thee! And thou hast also heard how Hutasana entering into water\r\nand remaining in concealment, achieved the purpose of the gods. And O\r\nthou versed in duty, thou hast heard how Hari with the view of overcoming\r\nhis foes, entered into Sakra's thunder-bolt, and lay concealed there.\r\nAnd, O sinless one, thou hast heard of the office the regenerate Rishi\r\nAurva at one time performed for the gods, remaining concealed in his\r\nmother's womb. And O child, living in concealment in every part of the\r\nearth, Vivaswat, endued with excellent energy, at last entirely burnt up\r\nall his foes. And living disguised in the abode of Dasaratha, Vishnu of\r\ndreadful deeds slew the Ten-necked one in battle.' Thus remaining in\r\ndisguise in various places, high-souled persons have before this\r\nconquered their enemies in battle. Thus cheered by these words of\r\nDhaumya, the virtuous Yudhishthira, relying on his own wisdom and also\r\nthat acquired from the scriptures regained his composure. Then that\r\nforemost of strong persons, the mighty-armed Bhimasena endued with great\r\nstrength encouraging the king greatly, spake these words, 'Looking up to\r\nthy face (for permission), the wielder of the Gandiva, acting according\r\nto his sense of duty hath not yet, O king, shown any rashness! And\r\nalthough fully able to destroy the foe, Nakula and Sahadeva of dreadful\r\nprowess have been ever prevented by me! Never shall we swerve from that\r\nin which thou wilt engage us! Do thou tell us what is to be done! We\r\nshall speedily conquer our enemies! When Bhimasena had said this, the\r\nBrahmanas uttered benedictions on the Bharatas, and then obtaining their\r\npermission, went to their respective quarters. And all those foremost of\r\nYatis and Munis versed in the Vedas, exceedingly desirous of again\r\nbeholding the Pandavas, went back to their homes. And accompanied by\r\nDhaumya, these heroes, the five learned Pandavas equipped in vows set out\r\nwith Krishna. And each versed in a separate science, and all proficient\r\nin mantras and cognisant of when peace was to be concluded and when war\r\nwas to be waged those tigers among men, about to enter upon a life of\r\nnon-recognition, the next day proceeded for a Krose and then sat\r\nthemselves down with the view of taking counsel of each other.\r\n\r\nThe End of Vana Parva\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1. This seems to be the obvious. There is a different reading however.\r\nFor Drie--cyate-seen, some texts have Sasyate--applauded. Nilakantha\r\nimagines that the meaning is \"As distribution (of food) amongst the\r\nvarious classes of beings like the gods, the Pitris, &c., is applauded\r\n&c., &c.\"\r\n\r\n2. A form of sacrifice which consists in pouring oblations of clarified\r\nbutter with prayers into a blazing fire. It is obligatory on Brahmanas\r\nand Kshatriyas, except those that accept certain vows of great austerity.\r\n\r\n3. The Viswedeva sacrifice is the offer of food to all creatures of the\r\nearth (by scattering a portion).\r\n\r\n4. A gift. It may be of various kinds. The fees paid to Brahmanas\r\nassisting at sacrifices and religious rites, such as offering oblations\r\nto the dead, are Dakshinas, as also gifts to Brahmanas on other occasions\r\nparticularly when they are fed, it bring to this day the custom never to\r\nfeed a Brahmana without paying him a pecuniary fee. There can be no\r\nsacrifice, no religious rite, without Dakshina.\r\n\r\n5. Reference to self, i.e. without the motive of bettering one's own\r\nself, or without any motive at all. (This contains the germ of the\r\ndoctrine preached more elaborately in the Bhagavad gita).\r\n\r\n6. This Yoga consists, in their case, of a combination of attributes by\r\nnegation of the contrary ones, i.e. by renunciation of motives in all\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\n7. A form of Yoga that is said to consist in the mingling of some of the\r\nair supposed to exist in every animal body. These airs are five: Prana,\r\nApana, Samana, Udana, and Vyana.\r\n\r\n8. The 8 Vasus, the 11 Rudras, the 12 Adityas, Prajapati, and Vashatkara.\r\n\r\n9. An order of celestials.\r\n\r\n10. Celestial flowers of much fragrance.\r\n\r\n11. The ascetic properties are Anima, Laghima, etc.\r\n\r\n12. The bow of Vishnu, as that of Siva is called Pinaka.\r\n\r\n13. The words of the text are Adhana, Pashubandha, Ishti Mantra, Yajana\r\nand Tapa-kriya.\r\n\r\n14. Dhritarashtra being blind is described as Pragnachakshu, i.e. having\r\nknowledge for his eye. It may also mean. \"Of the prophetic eye.\"\r\n\r\n15. The great preceptor of the Asuras, viz., Sukra, possessing the\r\nhighest intelligence as evidenced by his various works on all manner of\r\nsubjects particularly, the Sukra-niti.\r\n\r\n16. Also called Vadarika, a hermitage on the Himalaya near the sources of\r\nthe Ganges.\r\n\r\n17. Nilakantha explains kshetra as including Mahabhuta, consciousness,\r\nintellect, the unmanifest (primordial elements), the ten senses, the five\r\nobjects of the senses, viz., earth, water, &c., desire, aversion,\r\npleasure, pain, the combinations of elements, and chaitanya.\r\n\r\n18. Hari here means the developed seed that is to expand into the vast\r\nwhole of the universe.\r\n\r\n19. This wheel is the wheel of Time--i.e., measured according to the\r\nsolar, lunar and astral revolutions. The importance of Ashtavakra's reply\r\nis this: May the meritorious deeds performed at proper times, during the\r\nrevolution of this wheel of Time protect thee.\r\n\r\n20. Thunder and lightning or misery and death.\r\n\r\n21. Cloud or the mind.\r\n\r\n22. The male being that is ever conscious.\r\n\r\n23. The mundane egg.\r\n\r\n24. The soul that has renounced connection with the body.\r\n\r\n25. The heart of a Yogi.\r\n\r\n26. Ashtavakra comes to Janaka's sacrifice with the object of proving the\r\nunity of the Supreme Being. Vandin avails himself of various system of\r\nPhilosophy to combat his opponent. He begins with the Buddhistic system.\r\nThe form of the dialogue is unique in literature being that of enigmas\r\nand the latent meaning is in a queer way hid under the appearance of\r\npuerile and heterogeneous combinations of things.\r\n\r\nVandin opens the controversy by saying that as the number of each of\r\nthese is one, so one only intellect is the lord, leader and guide of the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n27. There is a Vedic revelation that two birds live together on a tree as\r\nfriends--one of these eats the fruits and the other looks at the former.\r\nFrom this it is manifest that two are the lords, leaders, and guides of\r\nthe senses. That there is a second faculty besides the intellect is also\r\nproved by the fact that in sleep when the intellect is inactive that\r\nfaculty continues in action, for if it were not so we could not remember\r\nhaving slept, nor connect the state after awaking with that preceding\r\nsleep. Accordingly by citing the number two Ashtavakra assets that\r\nbesides intellect there is another faculty--consciousness that these two\r\nare jointly the lords, leaders and guides of the senses and that they act\r\ntogether as Indra and Agni, etc.\r\n\r\n28. By citing the number three Vandin means to say that as it is Acts\r\nthat produce the three kinds of born beings, etc., so Acts are supreme\r\nand that everything else be it intellect alone, or intellect and\r\nconsciousness together is subservient to Acts.\r\n\r\n29. Ashtavakra here advances the thesis that even if Acts be supreme\r\nstill when the (fourth) or Supreme Being becomes manifest to the soul, it\r\nstands in no further needs to Acts.\r\n\r\n30. By bringing in the quinquennial series, Vandin wishes to assert that\r\nthe five senses are competent to cognise their respective objects and\r\nthat besides these senses and their objects there is neither any other\r\nsense to perceive nor any other object of perception. He also cites the\r\nauthority of the Veda according to which the Apsaras (or consciousness)\r\nhave five \"locks\" on their hands--i.e., five objects of perception.\r\n\r\n31. Besides the five senses Ashtavakra contends for an additional sense\r\nnamely the Mind and accordingly cites the number six.\r\n\r\n32. Vandin admits the existence of the six senses but says that the soul\r\nexperiences happiness and misery through those as well as through the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\n33. Ashtavakra advances an eighth element, namely, the knowledge of the\r\nego.\r\n\r\n34. Each of the three qualities (existence, foulness and ignorance) of\r\nprakriti (the passive or material cause of the world) mixing with each of\r\nthe three corresponding qualities of pradhana (the active or spiritual\r\ncause of the world) in various proportions produces the mundane order of\r\nthings. Thus is proved the eternity of prakriti or nature and is also\r\nestablished the doctrine of duality.\r\n\r\n35. Prakriti does not really create. It is the Supreme Being who through\r\nthe medium of illusion in contract with the ten organs (viz., the five\r\nlocomotive organs and the five organs of sense) makes manifest the system\r\nof things. Prakriti therefore has no real existence--her existence is\r\nonly apparent in the real existence of the soul.\r\n\r\n36. Yupas (stakes) mean here, feelings, etc, which keep men bound to the\r\nworld. Rudras are those who makes others cry.\r\n\r\nVandin means to say that the soul is not essential free from the fetters\r\nof happiness and misery arising from the eleven objects of perception. In\r\nthis world all men are subject to happiness and misery. We also hear that\r\nthere are Rudras in heaven.\r\n\r\n37. The supreme soul unaffected by happiness and misery really\r\nexists--but His existence is not susceptible of being proved--nor can the\r\nignorant ever perceive Him. Men attain that condition through these\r\ntwelve, viz., virtue, true, self-restraint, penances, good-will, modesty,\r\nforgiveness, exemption from envy, sacrifice, charity, concentration and\r\ncontrol over the senses.\r\n\r\n38. According to some, endeavours to attain emancipation can be\r\nsuccessful not in this world but in the world of Brahma. Others say that\r\nto that end a special yoga is necessary. By bringing forward the objects\r\nnumbering thirteen. Vandin advances the opinion that, virtue, etc., are\r\nnot sufficient for purposes of emancipation but that suitable time and\r\nplace are also essential.\r\n\r\n39. Ashtavakra concludes by citing the same number thirteen. The soul\r\nwhich is essentially unaffected, becomes subject to happiness and misery\r\nthrough, the thirteen, viz., the ten organs of locomotion and sense, and\r\nintellect mind and egoism. But Atichhanadas, i.e., those that have\r\nsurmounted ignorance, namely, the twelve, virtue, etc. destroy those\r\nthirteen and that is emancipation.\r\n\r\n40. Su means excellent, and uta, sacrifice. The compound accordingly\r\nmeans,--performer of excellent sacrifice.\r\n\r\n41. Iti means these six things, unfavourable to crops--excessive rain,\r\ndrought, rats, locusts, birds, and a neighbouring hostile king.\r\n\r\n42. In as much as the rites performed by the Sudras have their origin in\r\nthe Vedas.\r\n\r\n43. More literally, the state of the gods. It may appropriately be\r\nremarked here that the ordinary Hindu gods, of the post-Vedic period,\r\nlike the gods of Ancient Greece and Italy, were simply a class of\r\nsuperhuman beings, distinctly contra-distinguished from the Supreme\r\nSpirit, the Paramatman or Parabrahma. After death, a virtuous man was\r\nsupposed to be transformed into one of these so-called gods.\r\n\r\n44. This is the well-known and popular doctrine of transmigration of\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n45. The word in the text is Kora-dushakas, supposed by Wilson to be the\r\nPaspalum frumentacea (vide Dict.).\r\n\r\n46. The word in the text is mlecchibhutam. The Sanskrit grammar affords a\r\ngreat facility for the formation of verbs from substantives. Mlecchify\r\nmay be hybrid, but it correctly and shortly signifies the Sanskrit word.\r\n\r\n47. Pushya is the eighth lunar asterism consisting of three stars, of\r\nwhich one is, the Cancer. (Vide Wilson's Diet.).\r\n\r\n48. An Indian creeper of the order of Goertnera racemosa. It bears large\r\nwhite flowers of much fragrance.\r\n\r\n49. They, therefore, that lead deathless lives can enjoy this bliss from\r\nday to day for ever.\r\n\r\n50. It is difficult to understand how all that Vaka says can be an answer\r\nto Indra's question. The chief of the gods enquires: What are the joys of\r\nthose that lead deathless lives? Vaka breaks away unto a confused\r\nrigmarole about the merits of independence and the religious merit of\r\nentertaining guests and servants. All the printed editions have the\r\npassage as rendered here.\r\n\r\n51. The ceremony of Swastivachana is described to be \"a religious rite,\r\npreparatory to any important observance, in which the Brahmanas strew\r\nboiled rice on the ground, and invoke the blessings of the gods on the\r\nceremony about to commence\" (Vide Wilson's Dict).\r\n\r\nA flowery car was, probably, one of celestial make that the kings,\r\nprocured from heaven by performing costly rites and ceremonies. These\r\nwere sometimes exhibited to the people, and prior to these exhibitions,\r\nthe ceremony of Swastivachana was performed.\r\n\r\n52. A man is said to sell the Vedas who lectures on the Vedas taking fees\r\nfrom the hearers.\r\n\r\n53. Japa is the silent recitation of particular Mantras.\r\n\r\n54. Mantras are particular formulae of worship. They are for the most\r\npart rhythmic compositions, believed to be of great efficacy.\r\n\r\n55. The Homa is that sacrificial rite which consists of pouring libations\r\nof clarified butter into fire.\r\n\r\n56. Vedamayi nou. Lit, a boat made of the Vedas.\r\n\r\n57. Vishada is the original. It means discontent, but here it means more\r\na mixture of discontent, perplexity and confusion than mere discontent.\r\n\r\n58. A form of Hindu etiquette at parting.\r\n\r\n59. It is so very difficult to translate the word Karma,--religion and\r\nmorals were invariably associated with each other in ancient Hindu mind.\r\n\r\n60. Agni or fire was supposed to convey the oblations offered by men to\r\nthe gods.\r\n\r\n61. Kumara means a boy, hence a prince. Here Kartika the war-god is meant.\r\n\r\n62. By carrying their oblations to the gods.\r\n\r\n63. Portions of the Vedas.\r\n\r\n64. Raga means love.\r\n\r\n65. Kama is the name of the god of love, Indian Cupid.\r\n\r\n66. The body, the exciting Cause of our actions is an uktha, the soul of\r\nthe vivifier of the body is the second uktha, and the Supreme Spirit, the\r\ninciter of the soul is the third.\r\n\r\n67. The word of God.\r\n\r\n68. In Hindu Mythology there are no gods who destroy sacrifices. It is\r\nonly the Asuras who do so. The Burdwan translator renders this\r\npassage,--\"fifteen other gods belonging to western nations or Asuras.\" It\r\nis noticeable that the beings that were denounced as Asuras by the Hindus\r\nwere worshipped as Gods (Asuras) by the followers of Zarathustra.\r\n\r\n69. In connection with the names of these Mitra-gods, it is to be\r\nremembered that Mitra was the name of the principal god of the ancient\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n70. Avala is a common name of women. It means one who has no vala or\r\nstrength or power. The word is also used as an adjective.\r\n\r\n71. According to the Hindus, the sun rises from and sets behind two hills\r\nrespectively. He rises from the Udaya or Sun-rise hill and sets behind\r\nthe Asta or sun-set hill.\r\n\r\n72. Raudra--belonging to Rudra, the god of fury, violence, war, &c.\r\n\r\n73. Devasena literally means the celestial army. This fable seems to be\r\nan allegorical representation of the attempts made by Indra to procure a\r\nleader for the celestial host.\r\n\r\n74. Anger personified is a deity.\r\n\r\n75. Another name of gods, so named from their having only three stages of\r\nlife--viz., infancy, childhood, and youth--and being exempt from the\r\nfourth--old age.\r\n\r\n76. i.e., good and evil spirits.\r\n\r\n77. One of the ensigns of royalty in Hindustan.\r\n\r\n78. Brahma.\r\n\r\n79. Devasenapati is the original. It may mean either the pati (leader) of\r\nthe sena (forces) of devas or the pati (husband) of Devasena.\r\n\r\n80. A kind of missile.\r\n\r\n81. Another kind of weapon.\r\n\r\n82. The word in the text is \"Agrahara,\" which, as Nilakantha explains,\r\nmeans here, \"That which is first taken from a heap after the dedication\r\nof a portion to the \"Viswadevas.\" What Draupadi means to say is, that she\r\nalways took care to feed those Brahmanas with food \"first\" taken from the\r\nstores, without, in fact, having taken anything there from the use of\r\nanybody else.\r\n\r\n83. Lit, Soldiers that have sworn to conquer or die. A full Akshauhini of\r\nthese soldiers was owned by Krishna, who gave them to Duryodhana to fight\r\nfor him. The story of Krishna's offering to Duryodhana the choice between\r\nthese soldiers on the one side, and himself sworn not to fight but only\r\nto aid with his counsels on the other, is given in full in the Udyoga\r\nParva. Duryodhana, from folly, accepted the former, who were all slain by\r\nArjuna.\r\n\r\n84. The vow of the Asuras was (according to the Burdwan Pundits) never to\r\ndrink wine. It is more rational to suppose that Karna swears to give up\r\nthe refined manners and practices of the Aryas and adopt those of the\r\nAsuras till the consummation of the cherished desire.\r\n\r\n85. A very small measure.\r\n\r\n86. Picking up for support (1) ears of corn and (2) individual grains,\r\nleft on the field by husbandmen after they have gathered and carried away\r\nthe sheaves, are called the Sila and the Unchha modes of life.\r\n\r\n87. Naked.\r\n\r\n88. Both these words are of doubtful meaning. It seems they are employed\r\nin the Vedas to denote the faculties of knowledge and the moral sense\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n89. The six acts of a king are peace, war, marching, halting, sowing\r\ndissention, and seeking protection.\r\n\r\n90. Tard-mrigam. Formerly Prajapati, assuming the Form of a deer,\r\nfollowed his daughter from lust, and Rudra, armed with a trident, pursued\r\nPrajapati and struck off his head. That deer-head of Prajapati severed\r\nfrom the trunk, became the star, or rather constellation, called\r\nMrigasiras.\r\n\r\n91. Abode of Varuna in the original.\r\n\r\n92. Garuda.\r\n\r\n93. Pavana, the God of the wind.\r\n\r\n94. There is a difference of reading here. Some texts read fifty seven,\r\n\r\n95. A difference of reading is observable here.\r\n\r\n96. As a purificatory ceremony, called the Achamana. To this day, no\r\nHindu can perform any ceremony without going through the Achamana in the\r\nfirst instance.\r\n\r\n97. Traditions represents the sons of king Sagara of the Ikshwaku race as\r\nthe excavator of the ocean. Hence the ocean is called Sagara.\r\n\r\n98. Lit. an engine killing a hundred. Perhaps, some kind of rude cannon.\r\n\r\n99. Perhaps, brands or torches steeped in wax, intended to be thrown in a\r\nburning state, amongst the foe. Readers of Indian history know how Lord\r\nLake was repulsed from Bharatpore by means of huge bales of cotton,\r\nsteeped in oil, rolled from the ramparts of that town, in a burning\r\nstate, towards the advancing English.\r\n\r\n100. Lit. be a Purusha (male)! Manhood would not be appropriate in\r\nconnection with a Rakshasa.\r\n\r\n101. This weapon could restore an insensible warrior to consciousness, as\r\nthe Sam-mohana weapon could deprive one of consciousness.\r\n\r\n102. Visalya a medicinal plant of great efficacy in healing cuts and\r\nwounds. It is still cultivated in several parts of Bengal. A medical\r\nfriend of the writer tested the efficacy of the plant known by that name\r\nand found it to be much superior to either gallic acid or tannic acid in\r\nstopping blood.\r\n\r\n103. The Guhyakas occupy, in Hindu mythology, a position next only to\r\nthat of the gods, and superior to that of the Gandharvas who are the\r\ncelestial choristers. The White mountain is another name of Kailasa, the\r\npeak where Siva hath his abode.\r\n\r\n104. According to both Vyasa and Valmiki, there is nothing so fierce as a\r\nBrahmana's curse. The very thunderbolt of Indra is weak compared to a\r\nBrahmana's curse. The reason is obvious. The thunder smites the\r\nindividual at whom it may be aimed. The curse of Brahmana smites the\r\nwhole race, whole generation, whole country.\r\n\r\n105. Abhijit is lit, the eighth muhurta of the day, a muhurta being equal\r\nto an hour of 48 minutes, i.e. the thirtieth part of a whole day and\r\nnight. The Vaishnava asterism is as explained by Nilakantha, the Sravava.\r\n\r\n106. Also called Gayatri, the wife of Brahma.\r\n\r\n107. In the original., Vimanam, i. e., a car.\r\n\r\n108. Samhritya--killing.\r\n\r\n109. Lit. Letters.\r\n\r\n110. Behind the plain and obvious meanings of the words employed both in\r\nthe question and the answer, there is a deeper signification of a\r\nspiritual kind. I think Nilakantha has rightly understood the passage. By\r\nAditya, which of course commonly means the Sun, is indicated the\r\nunpurified soul (from adatte sabdadin indriadivis &c.). The first\r\nquestion then, becomes, 'Who is it that exalteth the unpurified soul?'\r\nThe act of exaltation implies a raising of the soul from its earthly\r\nconnections. The answer to this is, 'Brahma, i.e., Veda or\r\nself-knowledge.' The second question--'What are those that keep company\r\nwith the soul during its progress of purification?' The answer is,\r\nSelf-restraint and other qualities, which are all of a god-like or divine\r\nnature.' The third question is.--Who lead the soul to its place (state)\r\nof rest? The answer is, Dharma, i.e., restitude, morality, and religious\r\nobservances.' It is often asserted that one must pass through the\r\nobservances (Karma) before attaining to a state of Rest or Truth or Pure\r\nKnowledge. The last question is,--'On what is the soul established!' The\r\nanswer, according to all that has been previously said, is 'Truth or Pure\r\nKnowledge.' For the soul that is emancipated from and raised above all\r\ncarnal connections, is no longer in need of observances and acts (Karma)\r\nbut stays unmoved in True Knowledge (Janana).\r\n\r\n111. Nilakantha explains both Dhriti and Dwitiya in a spiritual sense.\r\nThere is no need, however, of a spiritual explanation here. By Dhriti is\r\nmeant steadiness of intelligence; by Dwitiya lit, a second. What\r\nYudhishthira says is that a steady intelligence serves the purposes of a\r\nhelpful companion.\r\n\r\n112. Nilakantha explains this correctly, as I imagine, by supposing that\r\nby 'sacrifice' is meant the spiritual sacrifice for the acquisition of\r\npure knowledge. In the objective sacrifice which one celebrates, the\r\nSama, the Yajus, and the Rik mantras are all necessary. In the subjective\r\nsacrifice the acquisition of true knowledge, life and mind are as\r\nnecessary as the mantras from the Sama and the Yajur Vedas in an\r\nobjective one. And as no objective sacrifice can do without the Riks,\r\nbeing principally dependent on them, so the subjective sacrifices for\r\nacquiring true knowledge can never do without prayerfulness, which, I\r\nimagine, is represented as the Riks. To understand this passage\r\nthoroughly would require an intimate acquaintance with the ritual of a\r\nsacrifice like the Agnishtoma or any other of that kind.\r\n\r\n113. Some texts read apatatam for uvapatam. If the former be the correct\r\nreading, the meaning would be--'What is the best of things that fall?'\r\nNilakantha explains both avapatam nivapatam in a spiritual sense. By the\r\nfirst he understands--'They that offer oblation to the gods,' and by the\r\nsecond, 'They that offer oblations to the Pitris.' The necessity of a\r\nspiritual interpretation, however, is not very apparent.\r\n\r\n114. Yudhishthira has the authority of the Srutis for saying that the one\r\npervading element of the universe is air.\r\n\r\n115. The word used in the question is dik, literally, direction.\r\nObviously, of course, it means in this connection way. Yudhishthira\r\nanswers that the way which one is to tread along is that of the good.\r\n\r\n116. Footnote 2: The Srutis actually speak of space as water. These are\r\nquestions to test Yudhishthira's knowledge of the Vedic cosmogony.\r\n\r\n117. The Srutis speak of the cow as the only food, in the following\r\nsense. The cow gives milk. The milk gives butter. The butter is used in\r\nHoma. The Homa is the cause of the clouds. The clouds give rain. The rain\r\nmakes the seed to sprout forth and produce food. Nilakantha endeavours to\r\nexplain this in a spiritual sense. There is however, no need of such\r\nexplanation here.\r\n\r\n118. What Yudhishthira means to say is that there is no special time for\r\na Sraddha. It is to be performed whenever a good and able priest may be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n119. That is, tranquillity of mind, self-restraint, abstention from\r\nsensual pleasures, resignation, and Yoga meditation.\r\n\r\n120. That is, hunger, thirst, sorrow, bluntness of mortal feeling,\r\ndecrepitude, and death"
