      "content": "(Asramavasa Parva)\r\n\r\nOM! AFTER HAVING bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the foremost of men,\r\nand unto the goddess Saraswati also, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Janamejaya said 'After having acquired their kingdom, how did my\r\ngrandsires, the high-souled Pandavas, conduct themselves towards the\r\nhigh-souled king Dhritarashtra? How, indeed, did that king who had all\r\nhis counsellors and sons slain, who was without a refuge, and whose\r\naffluence had disappeared, behave? How also did Gandhari of great fame\r\nconduct herself? For how many years did my high-souled grandsires rule\r\nthe kingdom? It behoveth thee to tell me all this.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Having got back their kingdom, the high-souled\r\nPandavas, their foes all slain, ruled the Earth, placing Dhritarashtra at\r\ntheir head. Vidura, and Sanjaya and Yuyutsu of great intelligence, who\r\nwas Dhritarashtra's son by his Vaisya wife, used to wait upon\r\nDhritarashtra. The Pandavas used to take the opinion of that king in all\r\nmatters. Indeed, for ten and five years, they did all things under the\r\nadvice of the old king. Those heroes used very often to go to that\r\nmonarch and sit beside him, after having worshipped his feet, agreeably\r\nto the wishes of king Yudhishthira the just. They did all things under\r\nthe command of Dhritarashtra who smelt their heads in affection. The\r\ndaughter of king Kuntibhoja also obeyed Gandhari in everything. Draupadi\r\nand Subhadra and the other ladies of the Pandavas behaved towards the old\r\nking and the queen as if they were their own father-in-law and\r\nmother-in-law. Costly beds and robes and ornaments, and food and drink\r\nand other enjoyable articles, in profusion and of such superior kinds as\r\nwere worthy of royal use, were presented by king Yudhishthira unto\r\nDhritarashtra. Similarly Kunti behaved towards Gandhari as towards a\r\nsenior. Vidura, and Sanjaya, and Yuyutsu, O thou of Karu's race, used to\r\nalways wait upon the old king whose sons had all been slain. The dear\r\nbrother-in-law of Drona, viz., the very Superior Brahmana, Kripa, that\r\nmighty bowman, also attended upon the king. The holy Vyasa also used to\r\noften meet with the old monarch and recite to him the histories of old\r\nRishis and celestial ascetics and Pitris and Rakshasas. Vidura, under the\r\norders of Dhritarashtra, superintended the discharge of all acts of\r\nreligious merit and all that related to the administration of the law.\r\nThrough the excellent policy of Vidura, by the expenditure of even a\r\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\r\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\r\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\r\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\r\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\r\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\r\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\r\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\r\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\r\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\r\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\r\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\r\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\r\nas before. Kunti, and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, possessed\r\nof great fame, and Ulupi, the daughter of the snake chief, and queen\r\nChitrangada, and the sister of Dhrishtaketu, and the daughter of\r\nJarasandha,--these and many other ladies, O chief of men, used to wait\r\nupon the daughter of Suvala like maids of all work. That Dhritarashtra,\r\nwho was deprived of all his children, might not feel unhappy in any\r\nmatter, was what Yudhishthira often said unto his brothers to see. They\r\nalso, on their part, listening to these commands of grave import from\r\nking Yudhishthira, showed particular obedience to the old king. There was\r\none exception, however. It embraced Bhimasena. All that had followed from\r\nthat match at dice which had been brought about by the wicked\r\nunderstanding of Dhritarashtra, did not disappear from the heart of that\r\nhero. (He remembered those incidents still).\"'"

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus worshipped by the Pandavas, the royal soil of\r\nAmvika passed his time happily as before, waited upon and honoured by the\r\nRishis. That perpetuator of Kuru's race used to make those foremost of\r\nofferings which should be given to the Brahmanas. The royal son of Kunti\r\nalways placed those articles under Dhritarashtra's control. Destitute of\r\nmalice as king Yudhishthira was, he was always affectionate towards his\r\nuncle. Addressing his brothers and councillors, the king said, 'King\r\nDhritarashtra should be honoured both by myself and you all. He. indeed,\r\nis a well-wisher of mine who is obedient to the commands of\r\nDhritarashtra. He, on the other hand, who behaves otherwise towards him,\r\nis my enemy. Such a man should certainly be punished by me. On days of\r\nperforming the rites ordained for the Pitris, as also in the Sraddhas\r\nperformed for his sons and all well-wishers, the high-souled Kuru king\r\nDhritarashtra, gave away unto Brahmanas, as each deserved, as profuse\r\nmeasures of wealth as he liked. King Yudhishthira the just, and Bhima,\r\nand Arjuna, and the twins, desirous of doing what was agreeable to the\r\nold king, used to execute all his orders. They always took care that the\r\nold king who was afflicted with the slaughter of his sons and\r\ngrandsons,--with, that is, grief caused by the Pandavas\r\nthemselves,--might not die of his grief Indeed, the Pandavas bore\r\nthemselves towards him in such a way that that Kuru hero might not be\r\ndeprived of that happiness and all those articles of enjoyment which had\r\nbeen his while his sons lived. The five brothers, viz., the sons of\r\nPandu, behaved themselves even thus towards Dhritarashtra, living under\r\nhis command. Dhritarashtra also, seeing them so humble and obedient to\r\nhis commands and acting towards him as disciples towards preceptors,\r\nadopted the affectionate behaviour of a preceptor towards them in return.\r\nGandhari, by performing the diverse rites of the Sraddha and making gifts\r\nunto Brahmanas of diverse objects of enjoyment, became freed from the\r\ndebt she owed to her slain children. Thus did that foremost of righteous\r\nmen, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great intelligence,\r\nalong with his brothers, worship king Dhritarashtra.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Possessed of great energy, that perpetuator of\r\nKuru's race, viz., the old king Dhritarashtra, could not notice any\r\nill-will in Yudhishthira Seeing that the high-souled Pandavas were in the\r\nobservance of a wise and righteous conduct, king Dhritarashtra, the son\r\nof Amvika, became gratified with them. Suvala's daughter, Gandhari,\r\ncasting off all sorrow for her (slain) children, began to show great\r\naffection for the Pandavas as if they were her own children. Endued with\r\ngreat energy, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, never did anything that was\r\ndisagreeable to the royal son of Vichitraviryya. On the other hand, he\r\nalways behaved towards him in a highly agreeable way. Whatever acts,\r\ngrave or light, were directed by king Dhritarashtra, or the helpless\r\nGandhari to be done, were all accomplished with reverence, O monarch, by\r\nthat slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the Pandava king. The old king\r\nbecame highly gratified with such conduct of Yudhishthira. Indeed, he was\r\ngrieved at the remembrance of his own wicked son. Rising every day at\r\nearly dawn, he purified himself and went through his recitations, and\r\nthen blessed the Pandavas by wishing them victory in battle. Making the\r\nusual gifts unto the Brahmanas and causing them to utter benedictions,\r\nand Pouring libations on the sacred fire, the old king prayed for long\r\nlife to the Pandavas. Indeed, the king had never derived that great\r\nhappiness from his own sons which he always derived from the sons of\r\nPandu. King Yudhishthira at that time became as agreeable to the\r\nBrahmanas as to the Kshatriyas, and the diverse bands of Vaisyas and\r\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\r\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\r\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\r\nKunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the\r\nevil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and\r\nVidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru\r\nshowed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer\r\nof foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to\r\nhis uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very\r\ncheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old\r\nking, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart.\"'"

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\r\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\r\nYudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana. When the Kuru king recollected\r\nhis wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,\r\ntowards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to\r\nbe wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara\r\nsecretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through\r\ndeceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.\r\nRecollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,\r\nBhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the\r\nhearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,\r\nrecollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a\r\ntransport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind\r\nking, capable of fighting with diverse kinds of weapons, have all been\r\ndespatched by me to the other world with these arms of mine that resemble\r\na pair of iron clubs. Verily, these are those two arms of mine, looking\r\nlike maces of iron, and invincible by foes, coming within whose clasp the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra have all met with destruction. These are those two\r\nwell-developed and round arms of mine, resembling a pair of elephantine\r\ntrunks. Coming within their clasp, the foolish sons of Dhritarashtra have\r\nall met with destruction. Smeared with sandal-paste and deserving of that\r\nadornment are those two arms of mine by which Duryodhana has been\r\ndespatched to the other world along with all his sons and kinsmen.'\r\nHearing these and many other words, O king, of Vrikodara, that were\r\nveritable darts, king Dhritarashtra gave way to cheerlessness and sorrow.\r\nQueen Gandhari, however, who was conversant with every duty and possessed\r\nof great intelligence, and who knew what Time brings on its course,\r\nregarded them as untrue. After five and ten years had passed away, O\r\nmonarch, king Dhritarashtra afflicted (constantly) by the wordy darts of\r\nBhima, became penetrated with despair and grief. King Yudhishthira the\r\nson of Kunti, however, knew it not; nor Arjuna of white steeds, nor\r\nKunti; nor Draupadi possessed of great fame; nor the twin sons of Madri,\r\nconversant with every duty and who were always engaged in acting after\r\nthe wishes of Dhritarashtra. Employed in doing the behests of the king,\r\nthe twins never said anything that was disagreeable to the old king. Then\r\nDhritarashtra one day honoured his friends by his confidence. Addressing\r\n'them with tearful eyes, He said these words.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'How the destruction of the Kurus has happened is\r\nwell known to you. All that was brought about by my fault though the\r\nKauravas approved of all my counsels. Fool that I was, I installed the\r\nwicked minded Duryodhana, that enhancer of the terrors of kinsmen, to\r\nrule over the Kurus. Vasudeva had said unto me, 'Let this sinful wretch\r\nof wicked understanding be killed along with all his friends and\r\ncounsellors.' I did not listen to those words of grave import. All\r\nwisemen gave me the same beneficial advice. Vidura, and Bhishma, and\r\nDrona, and Kripa, said the same thing. The holy and high-souled Vyasa\r\nrepeatedly said the same, as also Sanjaya and Gandhari. Overwhelmed,\r\nhowever, by filial affection, I could not follow that advice. Bitter\r\nrepentance is now my lot for my neglect. I also repent for not having\r\nbestowed that blazing prosperity, derived from sires and grand sires, on\r\nthe high-souled Pandavas possessed of every accomplishment. The eldest\r\nbrother of Gada foresaw the destruction of all the kings; Janarddana,\r\nhowever, regarded that destruction as highly beneficial.[2] So many\r\nAnikas of troops, belonging tome, have been destroyed. Alas, my heart is\r\npierced with thousands of darts in consequence of all these results. Of\r\nwicked understanding as I am, now after the lapse of five and ten years,\r\nI am seeking to expiate my sins. Now at the fourth division of the day or\r\nsometimes at the eighth division, with the regularity of a vow, I eat a\r\nlittle food for simply conquering my thirst. Gandhari knows this. All my\r\nattendants are under the impression that I eat as usual. Through fear of\r\nYudhishthira alone I concealed my acts, for if the eldest son of Pandu\r\ncame to know of my vow, he would feel great pain. Clad in deer-skin, I\r\nlie down on the Earth, spreading a small quantity of Kusa grass, and pass\r\nthe time in silent recitations. Gandhari of great fame passes her time in\r\nthe observance of similar vows. Even thus do we both behave, we that have\r\nlost a century of gong none of whom even retreated from battle. I do not,\r\nhowever, grieve for those children of mine. They have all died in the\r\nobservance of Kshatriya duties.' Having said these words, the old king\r\nthen addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed be thou, O\r\nson of the princess of Yadu's race. Listen now to what I say. Cherished\r\nby thee, O son, I have lived these years very happily. I have (with thy\r\nhelp) made large gifts and performed Sraddhas repeatedly.[3] I have, O\r\nson, to the best of my power, achieved merit largely. This Gandhari,\r\nthough destitute of sons, has lived with great fortitude, looking all the\r\nwhile at me. They whom inflicted great wrongs on Draupadi and robbed thee\r\nof thy affluence,--those cruel wights--have all left the world, slain in\r\nbattle agreeably to the practice of their order.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to do for them, O delighter of the Kurus. Stain with their\r\nfaces towards battle, they have attained to those regions which are for\r\nwielders of weapons.[4] I should now accomplish what is beneficial and\r\nmeritorious for me as also for Gandhari. It behoveth thee, O great king,\r\nto grant me permission. Thou art the foremost of all righteous persons.\r\nThou art always devoted to righteousness. The king is the preceptor of\r\nall creatures. It is for this that I say so. With thy permission, O hero,\r\nI shall retire into the woods, clad in rags and barks. O king, alone with\r\nthis Gandhari, I shall live in the woods, always blessing thee. It is\r\nmeet, O son, for the members of our race, to make over sovereignty, when\r\nold age comes, to children and lead the forest mode of life. Subsisting\r\nthere on air alone, or abstaining from all food, I shall, with this wife\r\nof mine, O hero, practise severe austerities. Thou shalt be a sharer of\r\nthese penances, O son, for thou art the king. Kings are sharers of both\r\nauspicious and inauspicious acts done in their kingdom.'[5]\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'When thou, O king, art thus subject to grief,\r\nsovereignty does not please me at all. Fie on me that am of wicked\r\nunderstanding, devoted to the pleasures of rule, and utterly heedless of\r\nmy true concerns. Alas, I, with all my brothers, was ignorant of thyself\r\nhaving so long been afflicted with grief, emaciated with fasts,\r\nabstaining from food, and lying on the bare ground. Alas, foolish that I\r\nam, I have been deceived by thee that hast deep intelligence, inasmuch\r\nas, having inspired me with confidence at first thou hast latterly\r\nundergone such grief. What need have I of kingdom or of articles of\r\nenjoyment, what need of sacrifices or of happiness, when thou, O king,\r\nhast undergone go much affliction? I regard my kingdom as a disease, and\r\nmyself also as afflicted. Plunged though I am in sorrow, what, however,\r\nis the use of these words that I am addressing thee? Thou art our father,\r\nthou art our mother; thou art our foremost of superiors. Deprived of thy\r\npresence, how shall we live? O best of king, let Yuyutsu, the son of thy\r\nloins, be made king, or, indeed, anybody else whom thou mayst wish. I\r\nshall go into the woods. Do thou rule the kingdom. It behoveth thee not\r\nto burn me that am already burned by infamy. I am not the king. Thou art\r\nthe king. I am dependent on thy will. How can I dare grant permission to\r\nthee that art my preceptor? O sinless one, I harbour no resentment in my\r\nheart on account of the wrongs done to us by Suyodhana. It was ordained\r\nthat it should be so. Both ourselves and others were stupefied (by fate).\r\nWe are thy children as Duryodhana and others were. My conviction is that\r\nGandhari is as much my mother as Kunti. If thou, O king of kings, goest\r\nto the woods leaving me, I shall the, follow thee. I swear by my soul.\r\nThis Earth, with her belt of seas, go full of wealth, will not be a\r\nsource of joy to me when I am deprived of thy presence. All this belongs\r\nto thee. I gratify thee, bending my head. We are all dependent on thee, O\r\nking of kings. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled. I think, O lord\r\nof Earth, that all this that has come upon thee is due to destiny. By\r\ngood luck, I had thought, that waiting upon thee and executing thy\r\ncommands obediently, I would rescue thee from the fever of thy heart.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O delighter of the Kurus, my mind is fixed, O son,\r\non penances. O puissant one, it is meet for our race that I should retire\r\ninto the woods. I have lived long under thy protection, O son, I have for\r\nmany years been served by thee with reverence. I am now old. It behoveth\r\nthee, O king, to grant me permission (to take up my abode in the woods).'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words unto king Yudhishthira,\r\nthe just, king Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, trembling the while and\r\nwith hands joined together, further said unto the high-souled Sanjaya and\r\nthe great car-warrior Kripa, these words, 'I wish to solicit the king\r\nthrough you. My mind has become cheerless, my mouth has become dry,\r\nthrough the weakness of age and the exertion of speaking.' Having said\r\nso, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, viz., the, righteous-souled old\r\nking, blessed with prosperity, leaned on Gandhari and suddenly looked\r\nlike one deprived of life. Beholding him thus seated like one deprived of\r\nconsciousness, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the royal son of\r\nKunti, became penetrated by a poignant grief.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, he whose strength was equal to that of a\r\nhundred thousand elephants, alas, that king sitteth today, leaning on a\r\nwoman. Alas! he by whom the iron image of Bhima on a former occasion wag\r\nreduced to fragments, leaneth today on a weak woman. Fie on me that am\r\nexceedingly unrighteous! Fie on my understanding! Fie on my knowledge of\r\nthe scripture! Fie on me for whom this lord of Earth lieth today in a\r\nmanner that is not becoming of him! I also shall fast even as my\r\npreceptor. Verily, I shall fast if this king and Gandhari of great fame\r\nabstain from food.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Pandava king, conversant with every duty,\r\nusing his own hand, then softly rubbed with cold water the breast and the\r\nface of the old monarch. At the touch of the king's hand which was\r\nauspicious and fragrant, and on which were jewels and medicinal herbs,\r\nDhritarashtra regained his senses.[6]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Do thou again touch me, O son of Pandu, with thy\r\nhand, and do thou embrace me. O thou of eyes like lotus petals, I am\r\nrestored to my senses through the auspicious touch of thy hand. O ruler\r\nof men, I desire to smell thy head. The clasp of thy arms is highly\r\ngratifying to me. This is the eighth division of the day and, therefore,\r\nthe hour of taking my food. For not having taken my food, O child of\r\nKuru's race, I am so weak as to be unable to move. In addressing my\r\nsolicitations to thee, great hag been my exertion. Rendered cheerless by\r\nit, O son, I had fainted. O perpetuator of Kuru's race, I think that\r\nreceiving the touch of thy hand, which resembles nectar in its vivifying\r\neffects I have been restored to my senses.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed, O Bharata, by the eldest brother of\r\nhis father, the son of Kunti, from affection, gently touched every part\r\nof his body. Regaining his life-breaths, king Dhritarashtra embraced the\r\nson of Pandu with his arms and smelled his head. Vidura and others wept\r\naloud in great grief. In consequence, however, of the poignancy of their\r\nsorrow, they said nothing to either the old king or the son of Pandu.\r\nGandhari, conversant with every duty, bore her sorrow with fortitude, and\r\nloaded as her heart was, O king, said nothing. The other ladies, Kunti\r\namong them, became greatly afflicted. They wept, shedding copious tears,\r\nand sat surrounding the old king. Then 'Dhritarashtra, once more\r\naddressing Yudhishthira, said these words, Do thou, O king, grant me\r\npermission to practise penances. By speaking repeatedly, O son, my mind\r\nbecomes weakened. It behoveth thee not, O son, to afflict me after this.'\r\nWhen that foremost one of Kuru's race was saying go unto Yudhishthira, a\r\nloud sound of wailing arose from all the warriors there present.\r\nBeholding his royal father of great splendour, emaciated and pale,\r\nreduced to a state unbecoming of him, worn out with fasts, and looking\r\nlike a skeleton covered with skin, Dharma's son Yudhishthira shed tears\r\nof grief and once more said these words. 'O foremost of men, I do not\r\ndesire life and the Earth. O scorcher of foes, I shall employ myself in\r\ndoing what is agreeable to thee. If I deserve thy favour, if I am dear to\r\nthee, do thou eat something. I shall then know what to do.' Endued with\r\ngreat energy, Dhritarashtra then said to Yudhishthira,--'I wish, O son,\r\nto take some food, with thy permission.' When Dhritarashtra said these\r\nwords to Yudhishthira, Satyavati's son Vyasa came there and said as\r\nfollows.`"

With weakened strength and slow motion, that king of great\r\nintelligence walked with difficulty, like the leader, worn out with age,\r\nof an elephantine herd. He was followed by Vidura of great learning, and\r\nhis charioteer Sanjaya, as also that mighty bowman Kripa, the son of\r\nSaradwata. Entering his mansion, O king, he went through the morning\r\nrites and after gratifying many foremost of Brahmanas he took some food.\r\nGandhari conversant with every duty, as also Kunti of great intelligence,\r\nworshipped with offers of various articles by their daughters-in-law,\r\nthen took some food, O Bharata. After Dhritarashtra had eaten, and Vidura\r\nalso and others had done the same, the Pandavas, having finished their\r\nmeals, approached and sat around the old king. Then the son of Amvika, O\r\nmonarch, addressing Kunti's son who was seated near him and touching his\r\nback with his hand, said, 'Thou shouldst always, O delighter of the\r\nKurus, act without heedlessness as regards everything connected with thy\r\nkingdom consisting of eight limbs, O foremost of rulers, and in which the\r\nclaims of righteousness should ever be kept foremost.[7] Thou art\r\npossessed, O son of Kunti, of intelligence and learning. Listen to me, O\r\nking, as I tell thee what the means are by which, O son of Pandu, the\r\nkingdom is capable of being righteously protected. Thou shouldst always,\r\nO Yudhishthira, honour those persons that are old in learning. Thou\r\nshouldst listen to what they would say, and act accordingly without any\r\nscruple. Rising at dawn, O king, worship them with due rites, and when\r\nthe time comes for action, thou shouldst consult them about thy\r\n(intended) acts. When, led by the desire of knowing what would be\r\nbeneficial to thee in respect of thy measures, thou honourest them; they\r\nwill, O son, always declare what is for thy good, O Bharata. Thou\r\nshouldst always keep thy senses, as thou keepest thy horses. They will\r\nthen prove beneficial to thee, like wealth that is not wasted. Thou\r\nshouldst employ only such ministers as have passed the tests of honesty,\r\n(i.e., as are possessed of loyalty, disinterestedness, continence, and\r\ncourage), as are hereditary officers of state, possessed of pure conduct,\r\nself-restrained, clever in the discharge of business, and endued with\r\nrighteous conduct. Thou shouldst always collect information through spies\r\nin diverse disguises, whose faithfulness have been tasted, who are\r\nnatives of thy kingdom, and who should not be known to thy foes. Thy\r\ncitadel should be properly protected with strong walls and arched gates.\r\nOn every side the walls, with watch-towers on them standing close to one\r\nanother, should be such as to admit of six persons walking side by side\r\non their top.[8] The gates should all be large and sufficiently strong.\r\nKept in proper places those gates should be carefully guarded. Let thy\r\npurposes be accomplished through men whose families and conduct are well\r\nknown. Thou shouldst always protect thy person also with care, in matters\r\nconnected with thy food, O Bharata, as also in the hours of sport and\r\neating and in matters connected with the garlands thou wearest and the\r\nbeds thou liest upon. The ladies of thy household should be properly\r\nprotected, looked over by aged and trusted servitors, of good behaviour,\r\nwell-born, and possessed of learning, O Yudhishthira. Thou shouldst make\r\nministers of Brahmanas possessed of learning, endued with humility,\r\nwell-born, conversant with religion and wealth, and adorned with\r\nsimplicity of behaviour. Thou shouldst hold consultations with them. Thou\r\nshouldst not, however, admit many persons into thy consultations. On\r\nparticular occasions thou mayst consult with the whole of thy council or\r\nwith a portion of it. Entering a chamber or spot that is well protected\r\n(from intruders) thou shouldst hold thy consultation. Thou mayst hold thy\r\nconsultation in a forest that is divested of grass. Thou shouldst never\r\nconsult at night time.[9] Apes and birds and other animals that can\r\nimitate human beings should all be excluded from the council chamber, as\r\nalso idiots and lame and palsied individuals. I think that the evils that\r\nflow from the divulgence of the counsels of kings are such that they\r\ncannot be remedied. Thou shouldst repeatedly refer, in the midst of thy\r\ncounsellors, to the evils that arise from the divulgence of counsels, O\r\nchastiser of foes, and to the merits that flow from counsels properly\r\nkept. Thou shouldst, O Yudhishthira, act in such a manner as to ascertain\r\nthe merits and faults of the inhabitants of thy city and the provinces.\r\nLet thy laws, O king, be always administered by trusted judges placed in\r\ncharge thereof, who should also be contented and of good behaviour. Their\r\nacts should also be ascertained by thee through spies. Let thy judicial\r\nofficers, O Yudhishthira, inflict punishments, according to the law, on\r\noffenders after careful ascertainment of the gravity of the offences.\r\nThey that are disposed to take bribes, they that are the violators of the\r\nchastity of other people's wives, they that inflict heavy punishments,\r\nthey that are utterers of false speeches, they that are revilers, they\r\nthat are stained by cupidity, they that are murderers, they that are\r\ndoers of rash deeds, they that are disturbers of assemblies and the\r\nsports of others, and they that bring about a confusion of castes,\r\nshould, agreeably to considerations of time and place, be punished with\r\neither fines or death.[10] In the morning thou shouldst see those that\r\nare employed in making thy disbursements. After that thou shouldst look\r\nto thy toilet and then to thy food. Thou shouldst next supervise thy\r\nforces, gladdening them on every occasion. Thy evenings should be set\r\napart for envoys and spies. The latter end of the night should be devoted\r\nby thee to settle what acts should be done by thee in the day. Mid-nights\r\nand mid-days should be devoted to thy amusements and sports. At all\r\ntimes, however thou shouldst think of the means for accomplishing thy\r\npurposes. At the proper time, adorning thy person, thou shouldst sit\r\nprepared to make gifts in profusion. The turns for different acts, O son,\r\nceaselessly revolve like wheels. Thou shouldst always exert thyself to\r\nfill thy treasuries of various kinds by lawful means. Thou shouldst avoid\r\nall unlawful means towards that end. Ascertaining through thy spies who\r\nthy foes are that are bent on finding out thy laches, thou shouldst,\r\nthrough trusted agents, cause them to be destroyed from a distance.\r\nExamining their conduct, thou shouldst O perpetuator of Kuru's race,\r\nappoint thy servants. Thou shouldst cause all thy acts to be accomplished\r\nthrough thy servitors: whether they are appointed for those acts or not.\r\nThe commandant of thy forces should be of firm conduct, courageous,\r\ncapable of bearing hardships, loyal, and devoted to thy good. Artisans\r\nand mechanics, O son of Pandu, dwelling in thy provinces, should always\r\ndo thy acts like kine and asses.[11] Thou shouldst always, O\r\nYudhishthira, be careful to ascertain thy own laches as also those of thy\r\nfoes. The laches also of thy own men as also of the men of thy foes\r\nshould equally be ascertained. Those men of thy kingdom, that are well\r\nskilled in their respective vocations, and are devoted to thy good,\r\nshould be favoured by thee with adequate means of support. A wise king, O\r\nruler of men, should always see that the accomplishments of his\r\naccomplished subjects might be kept up. They would then be firmly devoted\r\nto thee, seeing that they did not fall away from their skill.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, Thou shouldst always ascertain the Mandalas that\r\nbelong to thee, to thy foes, to neutrals, and to those that are disposed\r\nequally towards thee and thy foes, O Bharata.[12] The Mandalas also of\r\nthe four kinds of foes, of these called Atatayins, and of allies, and the\r\nallies of foes, should be distinguished by thee, O crusher of foes.[13]\r\nThe ministers of state, the people of the provinces, the garrisons of\r\nforts, and the forces, O foremost one of Kuru's race, may or may not be\r\ntampered with. (Thou shouldst, therefore, behave in such a manner that\r\nthese may not be tampered with by thy foes). The twelve (enumerated\r\nabove), O son of Kunti, constitute the principal concerns of kings. These\r\ntwelve, as also sixty, having Ministers for their foremost, should be\r\nlooked after by the king.[14] Professors conversant with the science of\r\npolitics call these by the name of Mandala. Understand, O Yudhishthira,\r\nthat the six incidents (of peace, war, march, halt, sowing dissensions,\r\nand conciliation) depend upon these. Growth and diminution should also be\r\nunderstood, as also the condition of being stationary. The attributes of\r\nthe sixfold incidents, O thou of mighty arms, as resting on the two and\r\nseventy (already enumerated), should also be carefully understood. When\r\none's own side has become strong and the side of the foe his become weak,\r\nit is then, O son of Kunti, that the king should war against the foe and\r\nstrive to will victory. When the enemy is strong and one's own side is\r\nweak, then the weak king, if possessed of intelligence, should seek to\r\nmake peace with the enemy. The king should collect a large store of\r\narticles (for his commissariat). When able to march out, he should on no\r\naccount make a delay, O Bharata. Besides, he should on that occasion set\r\nhis men to offices for which they are fit, without being moved by any\r\nother consideration. (When obliged to yield a portion of his territories)\r\nhe should give his foe only such land as does not produce crops in\r\nabundance. (When obliged to give wealth), he should give gold containing\r\nmuch base metal. (When obliged to give a portion of his forces), he\r\nshould give such men as are not noted for strength. One that is skilled\r\nin treaties should, when taking land or gold or men from the foe, take\r\nwhat is possessed of attributes the reverse of this.[15] In making\r\ntreaties of peace, the son of the (defeated) king, should be demanded as\r\na hostage, O chief of the Bharatas. A contrary course of conduct would\r\nnot be beneficial, O son. If a calamity comes over the king, he should,\r\nwith knowledge of means-and counsels, strive to emancipate himself from\r\nit.[16] The king, O foremost of monarchs, should maintain the cheerless\r\nand the destitute (such as the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the\r\ndiseased) among his people. Himself protecting his own kingdom, the king,\r\npossessed of great might, should direct all his efforts, either one after\r\nanother or simultaneously, against his foes. He should afflict and\r\nobstruct them and seek to drain their treasury. The king that desires his\r\nown growth should never injure the subordinate chieftains that are under\r\nhis sway. O son of Kunti, thou shouldst never seek to war with that king\r\nwho desires to conquer the whole Earth. Thou shouldst seek to gain\r\nadvantages by producing, with the aid of thy ministers, dissensions among\r\nhis aristocracy and subordinate chieftains. A powerful king should never\r\nseek to exterminate weak kings, for these do good to the world by\r\ncherishing the good and punishing the wicked. O foremost of kings, thou\r\nshouldst live, adopting the behaviour of the cane.[17] If a strong king\r\nadvances against a weak one, the latter should make him desist, by\r\nadopting conciliation and other modes. If unable to stop the invader in\r\nthis way, then he, as also those that are disposed to do him good, should\r\nfall upon the foe for battling with him. Indeed, with his ministers and\r\ntreasury and citizens, he should thus adopt force against the invader. If\r\nbattling with the foe becomes hopeless, then he should fall, sacrificing\r\nhis resources one after another. Casting off his life in this way, he\r\nwill attain to liberation from all sorrow.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O best of kings, thou shouldst also reflect\r\nproperly on war and peace. Each is of two kinds. The means are various,\r\nand the circumstances also, under which war or peace may be made, are\r\nvarious, O Yudhishthira.[18] O thou of Kuru's race, thou shouldst, with\r\ncoolness, reflect on the two (viz., thy strength and weakness) with\r\nregard to thyself. Thou shouldst not suddenly march against a foe that is\r\npossessed of contented and healthy soldiers, and that is endued with\r\nintelligence. On the other hand, thou shouldst think carefully of the\r\nmeans of vanquishing him.[19] Thou shouldst march against a foe that is\r\nnot provided with contented and healthy combatants. When everything is\r\nfavourable, the foe may be beaten. After that, however, the victor should\r\nretire (and stay in a strong position). He should next cause the foe to\r\nbe plunged into various calamities, and sow dissensions among his allies.\r\nHe should afflict the foe and inspire terror in his heart, and attacking\r\nhim weaken his forces. The king, conversant with the scriptures that\r\nmarches against a foe, should think of the three kinds of strength, and,\r\nindeed, reflect on his own strength and of his foe.[20] Only that king, O\r\nBharata, who is endued with alacrity, discipline, and strength of\r\ncounsels, should march against a foe. When his position is otherwise, he\r\nshould avoid defensive operations.[21] The king should provide himself\r\nwith power of wealth, power of allies, power of foresters, power of paid\r\nsoldiery, and power of the mechanical and trading classes, O puissant\r\none.[22] Among all these, power of allies and power of wealth are\r\nsuperior to the rest. The power of classes and that of the standing army\r\nare equal. The power of spies is regarded by the king as equal in\r\nefficacy to either of the above, on many occasions, when the time comes\r\nfor applying each. Calamity, O king, as it overtakes rulers should be\r\nregarded as of many forms. Listen, O thou of Kuru's race, as to what\r\nthose diverge forms are. Verily of various kinds are calamities, O son of\r\nPandu. Thou shouldst always count them, distinguishing their forms, O\r\nking, and strive to meet them by applying the well-known ways of\r\nconciliation and the rest (without concealing them through idleness). The\r\nking should, when equipt with a good force, march (out against a foe), O\r\nscorcher of enemies. He should attend also to the considerations of time\r\nand place, while preparing to march, as also to the forces he has\r\ncollected and his own merits (in other respects). That king who is\r\nattentive to his own growth and advancement should not march unless\r\nequipt with cheerful and healthy warriors. When strong, O son of Pandu,\r\nhe may march in even an unfavourable season. The king should make a river\r\nhaving quivers for its stones, steeds and cars for its current, and\r\nstandards for the trees that cover its banks, and which is miry with\r\nfoot-soldiers and elephants. Even such a river should the king apply for\r\nthe destruction of his foe. Agreeably to the science known to Usanas,\r\narrays called Sakata, Padma, and Vijra, should be formed, O Bharata, for\r\nfighting the enemy.[23] Knowing everything about the enemy's strength\r\nthrough spies, and examining his own strength himself the king should\r\ncommence war either within his own territories or within those of his\r\nfoe.[24] The king should always gratify his army, and hurl all his\r\nstrongest warriors (against the enemy). First ascertaining the state of\r\nhis kingdom, he should apply conciliation or the other well-known means.\r\nBy all means, O king, should the body be protected. One should do that\r\nwhich is highly beneficial for one both here and hereafter. The king, O\r\nmonarch, by behaving duly according to these ways, attains to Heaven\r\nhereafter, after ruling his subjects righteously in this world. O\r\nforemost one of Kuru's race, it is even thus that thou shouldst always\r\nseek the good of thy subjects for attaining to both the worlds.[25] Thou\r\nhast been instructed in all duties by Bhishma, by Krishna, and by Vidura,\r\nI should also, O best of kings, from the affection I bear thee, give thee\r\nthese instructions. O giver of profuse presents in sacrifices, thou\r\nshouldst do all this duly. Thou shalt, by conducting thyself in this way,\r\nbecome dear to thy subjects and attain to felicity in Heaven. That king\r\nwho adores the deities in a hundred horse-sacrifices, and he who rules\r\nhis subjects righteously, acquire merit that is equal.'\""

I desire, however, to give away some\r\nwealth capable of following the status of Preta, in respect of all those\r\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\r\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra\r\nsent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all\r\nthe articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many\r\nKshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's\r\nmansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner\r\napartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.\r\nBeholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,\r\nand his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of\r\nBrahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great\r\nintelligence, O monarch, said these words,--'Ye all and the Kurus have\r\nlived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each\r\nemployed in doing good to the other. What I shall now say in view of the\r\nopportunity that has come, should be accomplished by you all even as\r\ndisciples accomplish the biddings of their preceptors. I have set my\r\nheart upon retiring into the woods, along with Gandhari as my companion.\r\nVyasa has approved of this, as also the son of Kunti. Let me have your\r\npermission too. Do not hesitate in this. That goodwill, which has always\r\nexisted between you and us, is not to be seen, I believe, in other realms\r\nbetween the rulers and the ruled. I am worn out with this load of years\r\non my head. I am destitute of children. Ye sinless ones, I am emaciated\r\nwith fasts, along with Gandhari. The kingdom having passed to\r\nYudhishthira, I have enjoyed great happiness. Ye foremost of men, I think\r\nthat happiness has been greater than what I could expect from\r\nDuryodhana's sovereignty. What other refuge can I have, old as I am and\r\ndestitute of children, save the woods? Ye highly blessed ones, it behoves\r\nyou to grant me the permission I seek. Hearing these words of his, all\r\nthese residents of Kurujangala, uttered loud lamentations, O best of the\r\nBharatas, with voices choked with tears.

Protected and ruled by thee, we have\r\nall lived in great happiness. The slightest demerit is incapable of being\r\nalleged against thee and thy son.

In eight and ten days that host was destroyed by the foremost\r\nof Kuru warriors, viz., Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others, and the\r\nhigh-souled Karna, and the heroic Yuyudhana, and Dhrishtadyumna, and by\r\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\r\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\r\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\r\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\r\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\r\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\r\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\r\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\r\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\r\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\r\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\r\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\r\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\r\nsport blissfully in heaven. Thou also shalt attain to great merit, and\r\nunswerving steadiness in virtue. O thou of excellent vows, follow thou\r\nfully the duties indicated in the Vedas. It is not necessary for either\r\nthee or ourselves to look after the Pandavas. They are capable of ruling\r\nthe very Heavens, what need then be said of the Earth? O thou of great\r\nintelligence, in prosperity as in adversity, the subjects of this\r\nkingdom, O foremost one of Kuru's race, will be obedient to the Pandavas\r\nwho have conduct for their ornament. The son of Pandu makes those\r\nvaluable gifts which are always to be made to foremost of regenerate\r\npersons in sacrifices and in obsequial rites, after the manner of all the\r\ngreat kings of antiquity. The high-minded son of Kunti is mild, and\r\nself-restrained, and is always disposed to spend as if he were a second\r\nVaisravana. He has great ministers that attend on him. He is\r\ncompassionate to even his foes. Indeed, that foremost one of Bharata's\r\nrace is of pure conduct. Endued with great intelligence, he is perfectly\r\nstraight-forward in his dealings and rules and protects us like a father\r\nprotecting his children. From association with him who is the son of\r\nDharma, O royal sage, Bhima and Arjuna and others will never do us the\r\nleast wrong. They are mild, O thou of Kuru's race, unto them that are\r\nmild, and fierce like snakes of virulent poison unto them that are\r\nfierce. Possessed of great energy, those high-souled ones are always\r\ndevoted to the good of the people. Neither Kunti, nor thy\r\n(daughter-in-law) Panchali, nor Ulupi, nor the princess of the Sattwata\r\nrace, will do the least wrong to these people.[28] The affection which\r\nthou hast shown towards us and which in Yudhishthira is seen to exist in\r\na still larger measure is incapable of being forgotten by the people of\r\nthe city and the provinces. Those mighty car-warriors, viz., the son of\r\nKunti, themselves devoted to the duties of the righteousness, will\r\nprotect and cherish the people even if these happen to be unrighteous. Do\r\nthou, therefore, O king, dispelling all anxiety of heart on account of\r\nYudhishthira, set thyself to the accomplishment of all meritorious acts,\r\nO foremost of men.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words, fraught with righteousness\r\nand merit, of that Brahmana and approving of them, every person in that\r\nassembly said, 'Excellent, Excellent' and accepted them as his own.\r\nDhritarashtra also, repeatedly applauding those words, slowly dismissed\r\nthat assembly of his subjects. Thus honoured by them and looked upon with\r\nauspicious glances, the old king, O chief of Bharata's race, joined his\r\nhands and honoured them all in return. He then entered his own mansion\r\nwith Gandhari. Listen now to what he did after that night had passed\r\naway.\"'"

He wishes to make gifts for advancing the\r\nhappiness of his slain kinsmen and well-wishers now in the other world. O\r\nthou of Kuru's race, he wishes to give away wealth that belongs to thee\r\nby conquest. Indeed, O mighty-armed one, it is for Bhishma and others\r\nthat the old king is desirous of making those gifts. It behoves thee to\r\ngrant thy permission. By good luck it is, O thou of mighty arms that\r\nDhritarashtra today begs wealth of us, he who was formerly begged by us.\r\nBehold the reverse brought about by Time. That king who was before the\r\nlord and protector of the whole Earth, now desires to go into the woods,\r\nhis kinsmen and associates all slain by foes.

Do thou\r\nlearn your duty in this matter from the king, thy eldest brother, who is\r\nlord of all. It becometh thee to give instead of refusing, O chief of\r\nBharata's race. Vibhatsu who was saying so wag applauded by king\r\nYudhishthira the just. Yielding to wrath, Bhimasena said these words, 'O\r\nPhalguna, it is we that shall make gifts in the matter of Bhishma's\r\nobsequies, as also of king Somadatta and of Bhurisravas, of the royal\r\nsage Valhika, and of the high-souled Drona, and of all others. Our mother\r\nKunti shall make such obsequial offerings for Karna. O foremost of men,\r\nlet not Dhritarashtra perform those Sraddhas. Even this is what I think.\r\nLet not our foes be gladdened. Let Duryodhana and others sink from a\r\nmiserable to a more miserable position. Alas, it was those wretches of\r\ntheir race that caused the whole Earth to be exterminated. How hast thou\r\nbeen able to forget that anxiety of twelve long years, and our residence\r\nin deep incognito that was so painful to Draupadi? Where was\r\nDhritarashtra's affection for us then? Clad in a black deer-skin and\r\ndivested of all thy ornaments, with the princess of Panchala in thy\r\ncompany, didst thou not follow this king? Where were Bhishma and Drona\r\nthen, and where was Somadatta? Thou hadst to live for thirteen years in\r\nthe woods, supporting thyself on the products of the wilderness. Thy\r\neldest father did not then look at thee with eyes of parental affection.\r\nHast thou forgotten, O Partha, that it was this wretch of our race, of\r\nwicked understanding, that enquired of Vidura, when the match at dice was\r\ngoing on,--'What has been won?'

The sons and\r\ngrandsons of that person who brings a race to infamy never succeed in\r\nattaining to the regions of the righteous. Verily, the ancestors of the\r\nKaurava race were in danger of losing those regions of felicity which had\r\nbecome theirs. As regards myself, O my sons, I, before this, enjoyed the\r\ngreat fruits of that sovereignty which my husband had acquired. I made\r\nlarge gifts. I duly drank the Soma juice in sacrifice.[35] It was not for\r\nmy own sake that I had urged Vasudeva with the stirring words of Vidula.\r\nIt was for your sake that I had called upon you to follow that advice. O\r\nmy sons, I do not desire the fruits of that sovereignty which has been\r\nwon by my children. O thou of great puissance, I wish to attain, by my\r\npenances, to those regions of felicity which have been acquired by my\r\nhusband. By rendering obedient service to my father-in-law and\r\nmother-in-law both of whom wish to take up their abode in the woods, and\r\nby penances, I desire, O Yudhishthira, to waste my body. Do thou cease to\r\nfollow me, O foremost one of Kuru's race, along with Bhima and others.\r\nLet thy understanding be always devoted to righteousness. Let thy mind be\r\nalways great.'\""

They, therefore, desisted, along with\r\nthe princess of-Panchala, from following her.[36] Beholding Kunti\r\nresolved to go into the woods, the ladies of the Pandava household\r\nuttered loud lamentations. The Pandavas then circumambulated the king and\r\nsaluted him duly. They ceased to follow further, having failed to\r\npersuade Pritha to return. Then Amvika's son of great energy, viz.,\r\nDhritarashtra, addressing Gandhari and Vidura and supporting himself on\r\nthem, said, 'Let the royal mother of Yudhishthira cease to go with us.\r\nWhat Yudhishthira has said is all very true. Abandoning this high\r\nprosperity of her sons, abandoning those high fruits that may be hers,\r\nwhy should she go into the inaccessible woods, leaving her children like\r\na person of little intelligence? Living in the enjoyment of sovereignty,\r\nshe is capable of practising penances and observing the high vow of\r\ngifts. Let her, therefore, listen to my words. O Gandhari, I have been\r\nmuch gratified with the services rendered to me by this daughter-in-law\r\nof mine. Conversant as thou art with all duties, it behoveth thee to\r\ncommand her return.' Thus addressed by her lord, the daughter of Suvala\r\nrepeated unto Kunti all those words of the old king and added her own\r\nwords of grave import. She, however, failed to cause Kunti to desist\r\ninasmuch as that chaste lady, devoted to righteousness, had firmly set\r\nher heart upon residing in the woods. The Kuru ladies, understanding how\r\nfirm her resolution was regarding her retirement into the woods, and\r\nseeing that those foremost ones of Kuru's race (viz., their own lords),\r\nhad ceased to follow her, set up a loud wail of lamentation. After all\r\nthe sons of Pritha and all the ladies had retraced their steps, king\r\nYudhishthira of great wisdom continued his journey to the woods. The\r\nPandavas, exceedingly cheerless and afflicted with grief and sorrow\r\naccompanied by their wives, returned to the city, on their cars. At that\r\ntime the city of Hastinapura, with its entire population of men, both old\r\nand young, and women, became cheerless and plunged into sorrow. No\r\nfestivals of rejoicing were observed. Afflicted with grief, the Pandavas\r\nwere without any energy. Deserted by Kunti, they were deeply afflicted\r\nwith grief, like calves destitute of their dams. Dhritarashtra reached\r\nthat day a place far removed from the city. The puissant monarch arrived\r\nat last on the banks of the Bhagirathi and took rest there for the night.\r\nBrahmanas conversant with the Vedas duly ignited their sacred fires in\r\nthat retreat of ascetics. Surrounded by those foremost of Brahmanas,\r\nthose sacred fires blazed forth in beauty. The sacred fire of the old\r\nking was also ignited. Sitting near his own fire, he poured libations on\r\nit according to due rites, and then worshipped the thousand-rayed sun as\r\nhe was on the point of setting. Then Vidura and Sanjaya made a bed for\r\nthe king by spreading some blades of Kusa grass. Near the bed of that\r\nKuru hero they made another for Gandhari. In close proximity to Gandhari,\r\nYudhishthira's mother Kunti, observant of excellent vows, happily laid\r\nherself down. Within hearing distance of those three, slept Vidura and\r\nothers. The Yajaka Brahmanas and other followers of the king laid\r\nthemselves down on their respective beds. The foremost of Brahmanas that\r\nwere there chanted aloud many sacred hymns. The sacrificial fires blazed\r\nforth all around. That night, therefore, seemed as delightful to them as\r\na Brahmi night.[37] When the night passed away, they all arose from their\r\nbeds and went through their morning acts. Pouring libations then on the\r\nsacred fire, they continued their journey. Their first day's experience\r\nof the forest proved very painful to them on account of the grieving\r\ninhabitants of both the city and the provinces of the Kuru kingdom.\""

Restraining their senses in thought, words, and deeds, as well as\r\nby eye, they began to practise severe austerities. Divested of all\r\nstupefaction of mind, king Dhritarashtra began to practise vows and\r\npenances like a great Rishi, reducing his body to skin and bones, for his\r\nflesh was all dried up, bearing matted locks on head, and his person clad\r\nin barks and skins. Vidura, conversant with the true interpretations of\r\nrighteousness, and endued with great intelligence, as also Sanjaya,\r\nwaited upon the old king with his wife.

Reaching the other end of blazing\r\npenances, that lord of Earth. endued with great splendour, attained to\r\nthe region of Purandara where he continued to live in his company. On\r\nmany occasions, while visiting the region of Indra, O king, I saw the\r\nmonarch, whose sins had all been burnt off by penances, residing in\r\nIndra's abode. After the same manner, king Sailalaya, the grandfather of\r\nBhagadatta, attained to the region of Indra by the power alone of his\r\npenances. There was another king, O monarch, of the name of Prishadhra\r\nwho resembled the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. That king also, by\r\nhis penances proceeded from the Earth to Heaven. In this very forest, O\r\nking, that lord of Earth, Purukutsa, the soil of Mandhatri, attained to\r\nhigh success. That foremost of rivers, viz., Narmada, became the consort\r\nof that king. Having undergone penances in this very forest, that ruler\r\nof Earth proceeded to Heaven. There was another king, highly righteous,\r\nof the name of Sasaloman.

Thou also, O\r\nforemost of kings, at the end of thy penances, become endued with great\r\nprosperity and, accompanied by Gandhari, attain to the goal reached by\r\nthose high-souled ones.

'How, indeed, is that king,\r\nwhose sons have all been slain and who is without refuge, living alone,\r\nwith only his wife, in the woods that are the haunt of beasts of prey?\r\nAlas, how does that highly blessed queen, Gandhari, whose dear ones have\r\nall been slain, follow her blind lord in the solitary woods?'--Even such\r\nwas the anxiety manifested by the Pandavas when they talked with one\r\nanother. They then set their hearts upon seeing the king in his forest\r\nretreat. Then Sahadeva, bowing down to the king, said, 'I see thy heart\r\nto be set upon seeing our sire. From my respect for thee, however, I\r\ncould not speedily open my mouth on the subject of our journey to the\r\nwoods. The time for that sojourn is now come.

Without doubt, O\r\nchief of Bharata's race, the ends of mortals are exceedingly uncertain,\r\nsince Kunti, who is a princess by birth, is now living in misery in the\r\nwoods.' Hearing these words of Sahadeva, queen Draupadi, that foremost of\r\nall women duly honouring the king said, with proper salutations,--Alas,\r\nwhen shall I see queen Pritha, if, indeed, she be yet alive. I shall\r\nconsider my life as not passed in vain if I succeed in beholding her once\r\nmore, O king. Let this sort of understanding be ever stable in thee.

Know, O\r\nking, that all these ladies of thy house are staying with their feet\r\nraised for the journey, from desire of beholding Kunti, and Gandhari, and\r\nmy father-in-law. Thus addressed by queen Draupadi, the king, O chief of\r\nBharata's race, summoned all the leaders of his forces to his presence\r\nand told them,--'Cause my army, teeming with cars and elephants, to march\r\nout. I shall behold king Dhritarashtra who is now living in the woods.'\r\nUnto those that supervised the concerns of the ladies, the king gave the\r\norder, 'Let diverse kinds of conveyances be properly equipt, and all my\r\nclosed litters that count by thousands.

They said, 'We wish to know who\r\namongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,\r\nand who is Draupadi of great fame.' Then the Suta, Sanjaya, in answer to\r\ntheir queries, pointed out to them the Pandavas. naming each, and\r\nDraupadi too as also the other ladies of the Kuru household.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'This one that is as fair of complexion as pure gold, that\r\nis endued with a body which looks like that of a full-grown lion, that is\r\npossessed of a large aquiline nose, and wide and expansive eyes that are,\r\nagain, of a coppery hue, is the Kuru king. This one, whose tread\r\nresembles that of an infuriate elephant, whose complexion is as fair as\r\nthat of heated gold, whose frame is of large and expansive proportions\r\nand whose arms are long and stout, is Vrikodara. Behold him well! The\r\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\r\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\r\nare as high as those of a lion, who walks like a sporting elephant, and\r\nwhose eyes are as expansive as the petals of a lotus, is the hero called\r\nArjuna. Those two foremost of men, that are sitting besides Kunti, are\r\nthe twins, resembling Vishnu and Mahendra. In this whole world of men,\r\nthey have not their equals in beauty and strength and excellence of\r\nconduct. This lady, of eyes as expansive as lotus petals, who seems to\r\nhave touched the middle age of life, whose complexion resembles that of\r\nthe blue lotus, and who looks like a goddess of Heaven, is Krishna, the\r\nembodied form of the goddess of prosperity.[39] She who sits besides her,\r\npossessed of the complexion of pure gold, who looks like the embodied\r\nrays of the moon, in the midst of the other ladies, is, ye foremost of\r\nregenerate ones, the sister of that unrivalled hero who wields the\r\ndiscus. This other, as fair as pure gold, is the daughter of the\r\nsnake-chief and wife of Arjuna.[40] This other whose complexion is like\r\nthat of pure gold or like that of Madhuka flowers, is the princess\r\nChitrangada. This one, that is possessed of the complexion of an\r\nassemblage of blue lotuses, is the sister of that monarch, that lord of\r\nhosts, who used to always challenge Krishna. She is the foremost wife of\r\nVrikodara. This is the daughter of the king of Magadha who was known by\r\nthe name of Jarasandha. Possessed of the complexion of an assemblage of\r\nChampakas, she is the wife of the youngest son of Madravati. Possessed of\r\na complexion as darkish as that of the blue lotus, she who sits there on\r\nthe earth, and whose eyes are as expansive as lotus-petals, is the wife\r\nof the eldest son of Madravati, This lady whose complexion is as fair as\r\nthat of heated gold and who sits with her child on her lap, is the\r\ndaughter of king Virata. She is the wife of that Abhimanyu who, while\r\ndivested of his car, was slain by Drona and others fighting from their\r\ncars.[41] These ladies, the hair on whose heads shows not the parted\r\nline, and who are clad in white, are the widows of the slain sons of\r\nDhritarashtra. They are the daughters-in-law of this old king, the wives\r\nof his hundred sons, now deprived of both their husbands and children who\r\nhave been slain by heroic foes. I have now pointed them out in the order\r\nof precedence. In consequence of their devotion to Brahmanas, their\r\nunderstandings and hearts are divested of every kind of crookedness.\r\nPossessed of pure souls, they have all been pointed out by me,--these\r\nprincesses of the Kaurava house-hold,--in answer to your queries.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus that king of Kuru's race, of very advanced\r\nyears, having met with those sons of him that was a deity among men.\r\nenquired about their welfare after all the ascetics had gone away. The\r\nwarriors who had accompanied the Pandavas, leaving the retreat, sat\r\nthemselves down at a little distance, alighting from their cars and the\r\nanimals they rode. Indeed, after all the crowd, viz., the ladies, the old\r\nmen, and the children, had been seated, the old king duly addressed them,\r\nmaking the usual enquiries of politeness.\"'"

Dost thou follow the old\r\nand traditional conduct of rulers of men? Is thy treasury filled without\r\ndisregarding the restraints imposed by justice and equity? Dost thou\r\nbehave as thou shouldst towards foes, neutrals, and allies? Dost thou\r\nduly look after the Brahmanas, always making them the first gifts\r\n(ordained in sacrifices and religious rites)? What need I say of the\r\ncitizens, and thy servants, and kinsmen,--are they foes, O chief of\r\nBharata's race, gratified with thy behaviour? Dost thou, O king of kings,\r\nadore with devotion the Pitris and the deities? Dost thou worship guests\r\nwith food and drink, O Bharata? Do the Brahmanas in thy dominions,\r\ndevoted to the duties of their order, walk along the path of\r\nrighteousness? Do the Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras also within thy\r\nkingdom, and all thy relatives, observe their respective duties? I hope\r\nthe women, the children, and the old, among thy subjects, do not grieve\r\n(under distress) and do not beg (the necessaries of life). Are the ladies\r\nof thy household duly honoured in thy house, O best of men? I hope, O\r\nmonarch, that this race of royal sages, having obtained thee for their\r\nking, have not fallen away from fame and glory.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto the old king who said so, Yudhishthira,\r\nconversant with morality and justice, and well-skilled in acts and\r\nspeech, spoke as follows, putting some questions about his welfare.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Doth thy peace, O king, thy self-restraint, thy\r\ntranquillity of heart, grow? Is this my mother able to serve thee without\r\nfatigue and trouble? Will, O king, her residence in the woods be\r\nproductive of fruits? I hope this queen, who is my eldest mother, who is\r\nemaciated with (exposure to) cold and wind and the toil of walking, and\r\nwho is now devoted to the practice of severe austerities, no longer gives\r\nway, to grief for her children of mighty energy, all of whom, devoted to\r\nthe duties of the Kshatriya order, have been slain on the field of\r\nbattle. Does she accuse us, sinful wretches, that are responsible for\r\ntheir slaughter? Where is Vidura, O king? We do not see him here. I hope\r\nthis Sanjaya, observant of penances, is in peace and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Dhritarashtra answered king\r\nYudhishthira, saying,--'O son. Vidura is well. He is performing austere\r\npenances, subsisting on air alone, for he abstains from all other food.\r\nHe is emaciated and his arteries and nerves have become visible.\r\nSometimes he is seen in this empty forest by Brahmanas.' While\r\nDhritarashtra was saying this Vidura was seen at a distance. He had\r\nmatted locks on his head, and gravels in his mouth, and was exceedingly\r\nemaciated. He was perfectly naked. His body was besmeared all over with\r\nfilth, and with the dust of various wild flowers. When Kshattri was\r\nbeheld from a distance, the fact was reported to Yudhishthira. Vidura\r\nsuddenly stopped, O king, casting his eyes towards the retreat (and\r\nseeing it peopled by so many individuals). King Yudhishthira pursued him\r\nalone, as he ran and entered the deep forest, sometimes not seen by the\r\npursuer. He said aloud, 'O Vidura, O Vidura, I am king Yudhishthira, thy\r\nfavourite!'--Exclaiming thus, Yudhishthira, with great exertion, followed\r\nVidura. That foremost of intelligent men, viz., Vidura, having reached a\r\nsolitary spot in the forest, stood still, leaning against a tree. He was\r\nexceedingly emaciated. He retained only the shape of a human being (all\r\nhis characteristic features having totally disappeared). Yudhishthira of\r\ngreat intelligence recognised him, however, (in spite of such change).\r\nStanding before him, Yudhishthira addressed him, saying, 'I am\r\nYudhishthira!' Indeed, worshipping Vidura properly, Yudhishthira said\r\nthese words in the hearing of Vidura. Meanwhile Vidura eyed the king with\r\na steadfast gaze. Casting his gaze thus on the king, he stood motionless\r\nin Yoga. Possessed of great intelligence, he then (by his Yoga-power)\r\nentered the body of Yudhishthira, limb by limb. He united his\r\nlife-breaths with the king's life-breaths, and his senses with the king's\r\nsenses. Verify, with the aid of Yoga-power, Vidura, blazing with energy,\r\nthus entered the body of king Yudhishthira the just. Meanwhile, the body\r\nof Vidura continued to lean against the tree, with eyes fixed in a\r\nsteadfast gaze. The king soon saw that life had fled out of it. At the\r\nsame time, he felt that he himself had become stronger than before and\r\nthat he had acquired many additional virtues and accomplishments.\r\nPossessed of great learning and energy, O monarch, Pandu's son, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, then recollected his own state before his birth\r\namong men.[42] Endued with mighty energy, he had heard of Yoga practice\r\nfrom Vyasa. King Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great learning,\r\nbecame desirous of doing the last rites to the body of Vidura, and wished\r\nto cremate it duly. An invisible voice was then heard,--saying,--'O king,\r\nthis body that belonged to him called Vidura should not be cremated. In\r\nhim is thy body also. He is the eternal deity of Righteousness. Those\r\nregions of felicity which are known by the name of Santanika will be his,\r\nO Bharata. He was an observer of the duties of Yatis. Thou shouldst not,\r\nO scorcher of foes, grieve for him at all. Thus addressed, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, returned from that spot, and represented\r\neverything unto the royal son of Vichitraviryya. At this, that king of\r\ngreat splendour, all these men, and Bhimasena and others, became filled\r\nwith wonder. Hearing what had happened, king Dhritarashtra became pleased\r\nand then, addressing the son of Dharma. said,--'Do thou accept from me\r\nthese gifts of water and roots and fruits. It has been said, O king, that\r\none's guest should take that which one takes oneself.' Thus addressed,\r\nDharma's son answered the king, saying,--'So be it.' The mighty-armed\r\nking ate the fruits and roots which the monarch gave him. Then they all\r\nspread their beds under a tree and passed that night thus, having eaten\r\nfruits and roots and drunk the water that the old king had given them.\"'"

The conversation that occurred was characterised by many\r\nreflections on morality and wealth. Consisting of delightful and sweet\r\nwords, it was graced with diverse citations from the Srutis. The\r\nPandavas, O king, leaving costly beds, laid themselves down, near their\r\nmother, on the bare ground. Indeed, those heroes passed that night,\r\nhaving eaten the food which was the food of the high-souled king\r\nDhritarashtra. After the night had passed away, king Yudhishthira, having\r\ngone through his morning acts, proceeded to survey that retreat in the\r\ncompany of his brothers. With the ladies of his household the servants,\r\nand his priest, the king roved about the retreat in all directions, as he\r\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\r\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\r\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\r\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\r\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\r\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\r\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\r\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\r\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\r\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\r\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\r\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\r\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\r\nwith large heaps of fruits and roots gathered from the wilderness. King\r\nYudhishthira then gave those ascetics jars made of gold or copper which\r\nhe had brought for them, and many deer-skins and blankets and sacrificial\r\nladles made of wood, and Kamandalus and wooden platters, and pots and\r\npans, O Bharata.[44] Diverse kinds of vessels, made of iron, and smaller\r\nvessels and cups of various sizes, were also given away by the king, the\r\nascetics taking them away, each as many as he liked. King Yudhishthira of\r\nrighteous soul, having thus roved through the woods and beheld the\r\ndiverse retreats of ascetics and made many gifts, returned to the place\r\nwhere his uncle was. He saw king Dhritarashtra, that lord of Earth, at\r\nhis ease, with Gandhari beside him, after having finished his morning\r\nrites. The righteous-souled monarch saw also his mother, Kunti, seated\r\nnot much remote from that place, like a disciple with bent head, endued\r\nwith humility. He saluted the old king, proclaiming his name. 'Sit down'\r\nwere the words the old king said. Receiving Dhritarashtra's permission,\r\nYudhishthira sat himself down on a mat of Kusa grass. Then the other sons\r\nof Pandu with Bhima among them, O thou of Bharata's race, saluted the\r\nking and touched his feet and sat themselves down, receiving his\r\npermission. The old Kuru king, surrounded by them, looked exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. Indeed, he blazed with a Vedic splendour like Vrihaspati in\r\nthe midst of the celestials. After they had sat themselves down, many\r\ngreat Rishis, viz., Satayupa and others, who were denizens of\r\nKurukshetra, came there. The illustrious and learned Vyasa, possessed of\r\ngreat energy, and reverenced by even the celestial Rishis, showed\r\nhimself, at the head of his numerous disciples, unto Yudhishthira. The\r\nKuru king Dhritarashtra, Kunti's son Yudhishthira of great energy, and\r\nBhimasena and others, stood up and advancing a few steps, saluted those\r\nguests. Approaching near, Vyasa, surrounded by Satayupa and others,\r\naddressed king Dhritarashtra, saying,--'Be thou seated.' The illustrious\r\nVyasa then took an excellent seat made of Kusa grass placed upon a black\r\ndeer-skin and covered with a piece of silken cloth. They had reserved\r\nthat seat for him. After Vyasa had been seated, all those foremost of\r\nregenerate persons, endued with abundant energy, sat themselves down,\r\nhaving received the permission of the Island-born sage.\""

Is thy mind, O king, pleased with thy\r\nresidence in the woods? Has the grief that was thine, born of the\r\nslaughter of thy sons in battle, disappeared from thy heart? Are all thy\r\nperceptions, O sinless one, now clear? Dost thou practise the ordinances\r\nof forest life after having made thy heart firm? Does my daughter-in-law,\r\nGandhari, allow herself to be overwhelmed by grief? She is possessed of\r\ngreat wisdom. Endued with intelligence, that queen understands both\r\nReligion and Wealth. She is well conversant with the truths that relate\r\nto both prosperity and adversity. Does she still grieve? Does Kunti, O\r\nking, who in consequence of her devotion to the service of her seniors,\r\nleft her children, attend to thy wants and serve thee with all humility?\r\nHave the high-minded and high-souled king, Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nDharma and Bhima and Arjuna and the twins been sufficiently comforted?\r\nDost thou feet delight at seeing them? Has thy mind become freed from\r\nevery stain? Has thy disposition, O king, become pure in consequence of\r\nthe increase of thy knowledge? This aggregate of three, O king, is the\r\nforemost of all concerns, O Bharata, viz., abstension from injury to any\r\ncreature, truth, and freedom from anger. Does thy forest life any longer\r\nprove painful to thee? Art thou able to earn with thy own exertions the\r\nproducts of the wilderness for thy food? Do fasts give thee any pain now?\r\nHast thou learnt, O king, how the high-souled Vidura, who was Dharma's\r\nself, left this world? Through the curse of Mandavya, the deity of\r\nRighteousness became born as Vidura. He was possessed of great\r\nintelligence. Endued with high penances, he was high-souled and\r\nhigh-minded. Even Vrihaspati among the celestials, and Sukra among the\r\nAsuras, was not possessed of such intelligence as that foremost of\r\npersons. The eternal deity of Righteousness was stupefied by the Rishi\r\nMandavya with an expenditure of his penances earned for a long time with\r\ngreat care.[45] At the command of the Grandsire, and through my own\r\nenergy, Vidura of great intelligence was procreated by me upon a soil\r\nowned by Vichitraviryya. A deity of deities, and eternal, he was, O king,\r\nthy brother. The learned know him to be Dharma in consequence of his\r\npractices of Dharana and Dhyana.[46] He grows with (the growth of) truth,\r\nself-restraint, tranquillity of heart, compassion, and gifts. He is\r\nalways engaged in penances, and is eternal. From that deity of\r\nRighteousness, through Yoga-puissance, the Kuru king Yudhishthira also\r\ntook his birth. Yudhishthira, therefore, O king, is Dharma of great\r\nwisdom and immeasurable intelligence. Dharma exists both here and\r\nhereafter, and is like fire or wind or water or earth or space. He is, O\r\nking of kings, capable of going everywhere and exists, pervading the\r\nwhole universe. He is capable of being beheld by only those that are the\r\nforemost of the deities and those that are cleansed of every sin and\r\ncrowned with ascetic success. He that is Dharma is Vidura; and he that is\r\nVidura is the (eldest) son of Pandu. That son of Pandu. O king, is\r\ncapable of being perceived by thee. He stays before thee as thy servitor.\r\nEndued with great Yoga-puissance, thy high-souled brother, that foremost\r\nof intelligent men, seeing the high-souled Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nKunti, has entered into his person. These also, O chief of Bharata's\r\nrace, I shall unite with great benefit. Know, O son, that I am come here\r\nfor dispelling thy doubts. Some feat that has never been accomplished\r\nbefore by any of the great Rishis, some wonderful effect of my\r\npenances,--I shall show thee.

O learned Brahmana, what that wonderful feat\r\nwas which the great Rishi Vyasa of high energy accomplished after his\r\npromise to the old king, made when Dhritarashtra, that lord of Earth,\r\nthat foremost one of Kuru's race, had taken up his abode in the forest,\r\nwith his wife and with his daughter-in-law Kunti; and after, indeed,\r\nVidura had left his own body and entered into Yudhishthira, and at the\r\ntime when all the sons of Pandu were staying in the ascetic retreat. For\r\nhow many days did the Kuru king Yudhishthira of unfading glory stay, with\r\nhis men, in the woods? On what food, O puissant one, did the high-souled\r\nPandavas support themselves, with their men, and wives, while they lived\r\nin the woods? O sinless one, do thou tell me this.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\r\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\r\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\r\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\r\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\r\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\r\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\r\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\r\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\r\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\r\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\r\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\r\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\r\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\r\nGandhari and Kunti and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, and other\r\nladies of the royal household also sat down. The conversation that then\r\narose was excellent and had reference to topics connected with piety, and\r\nthe Rishis of old, and the deities and the Asuras. At the close of that\r\nconversation Vyasa of great energy, that foremost of eloquent men, that\r\nfirst of all persons conversant with the Vedas, highly gratified,\r\naddressed the blind monarch and once more said,--'Burning as thou art\r\nwith grief on account of thy children, I know, O king of kings, what\r\nobject is cherished by thee in thy heart. The sorrow that always exists\r\nin the heart of Gandhari, that which exists in the heart of Kunti, and\r\nthat also which is cherished by Draupadi in her heart, and that burning\r\ngrief, on account of the death of her son, which Krishna's sister\r\nSubhadra also cherishes, are all known to me. Hearing of this meeting, O\r\nking, of thine with all these princes and princesses of thy house, I have\r\ncome here, O delighter of the Kauravas, for dispelling thy doubts. Let\r\nthe deities and Gandharvas, and all these great Rishis, behold today the\r\nenergy of those penances which I have acquired for these long years.\r\nTherefore, O king, tell me what wish of thine I shall grant today. I am\r\npuissant enough to grant thee a boon. Behold the fruit of my penances.'\r\nThus addressed by Vyasa of immeasurable understanding, king Dhritarashtra\r\nreflected for a moment and then prepared to speak. He said,--'I am\r\nexceedingly fortunate. Lucky am I in obtaining thy favour. My life is\r\ncrowned with success today,--since this meeting has happened between me\r\nand ye all of great piety. Today I shall attain to that highly happy goal\r\nwhich is reserved for me, since, ye ascetics endued with wealth of\r\npenances, ye who are equal to Brahma himself, I have succeeded in\r\nobtaining this meeting with you all. There is not the least doubt that\r\nthis sight that I have obtained of you all has cleansed me of every sin.\r\nYe sinless ones, I have no longer any fear in respect of my end in the\r\nnext world. Full as I am of love for my children, I always cherish their\r\nremembrance. My mind, however, is always tortured by the recollection of\r\nthe diverse acts of wrong which my wicked son of exceedingly evil\r\nunderstanding perpetrated. Possessed of a sinful understanding, he always\r\npersecuted the innocent Pandavas. Alas, the whole Earth has been\r\ndevastated by him, with her steeds, elephants and men. Many high-souled\r\nkings, rulers of diverse realms, came for siding my son and succumbed to\r\ndeath. Alas, leaving their beloved sires and wives and their very\r\nlife-breaths, all those heroes have become guests of the king of the\r\ndead. What end, O regenerate one, has been attained by those men who have\r\nbeen slain, for the sake of their friend, in battle? What end also has\r\nbeen attained by my sons and grandsons who have fallen in the fray? My\r\nheart is always pained at the thought of my having brought about the\r\nslaughter of the mighty Bhishma, the son of Santanu, and of Drona, that\r\nforemost of Brahmanas, through my foolish and sinful son who was an\r\ninjurer of his friends. Desirous of obtaining the sovereignty of the\r\nEarth, he caused the Kuru race, blazing with prosperity, to be\r\nannihilated. Reflecting on all this, I burn day and night with grief.\r\nDeeply afflicted with pain and grief, I am unable to obtain peace of\r\nmind. Indeed, O father, thinking of all this, I have no peace of mind.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these lamentations expressed in diverse\r\nways, of that royal sage, the grief, O Janamejaya, of Gandhari, became\r\nfresh. The grief also of Kunti, of the daughter of Drupada, of Subhadra,\r\nand of the other members, male and female, and the daughters-in-law, of\r\nthe Kuru race, became equally green. Queen Gandhari, with bandaged eyes,\r\njoining her hands, addressed her father-in-law. Deeply afflicted with\r\ngrief on account of the slaughter of her sons, she said,--'O foremost of\r\nascetics, sixteen years have passed over the head of this king grieving\r\nfor the death of his sons and divested of peace of mind. Afflicted with\r\ngrief on account of the slaughter of his children, this king\r\nDhritarashtra, always breathes heavily, and never sleeps at night. O\r\ngreat Rishi, through the power of thy penances thou art competent to\r\ncreate new worlds. What need I say then about showing this king his\r\nchildren who are now in the other world? This Krishna, the daughter of\r\nDrupada, hath lost all her kinsmen and children. For this, she who is the\r\ndearest of my daughters-in-law grieves exceedingly. The sister of\r\nKrishna, viz., Subhadra of sweet speech, burning with the loss of her\r\nson, grieves as deeply. This lady that is respected by all, that is the\r\nwife of Bhurisravas, afflicted with grief on account of the fate that has\r\novertaken her husband, always indulges in heart-rending lamentations. Her\r\nfather-in-law was the intelligent Valhika of Kuru's race. Alas, Somadatta\r\nalso was slain, along with his sire, in the great battle![47] Alas, a\r\ncentury of sons, heroes that never retreated from battle, belonging to\r\nthis son of thine, this king of great intelligence and great prosperity,\r\nhas been slain in battle. The hundred wives of those sons are all\r\ngrieving and repeatedly enhancing the grief of both the king and myself.\r\nO great ascetic, stricken by that great slaughter, they have gathered\r\nround me. Alas, those high-souled heroes, those great car warriors, my\r\nfathers-in-law, Somadatta and others,--alas, what end has been theirs, O\r\npuissant one? Through thy grace, O holy one, that will happen in\r\nconsequence of which this lord of Earth, myself, and this daughter-in-law\r\nof thine, viz., Kunti, shall all become freed from our grief. After\r\nGandhari had said so, Kunti, whose face had become wasted through\r\nobservance of many hard vows, began to think of her secret-born son\r\nendued with solar effulgence. The boon giving Rishi Vyasa, capable of\r\nboth beholding and hearing what happened at a remote distance, saw that\r\nthe royal mother of Arjuna was afflicted with grief. Unto her Vyasa\r\nsaid,--'Tell me, O blessed one, what is in thy mind. Tell me what thou\r\nwishest to say. At this, Kunti, bending her head unto her father-in-law,\r\nand overcome with bashfulness, said these words unto him, relating to the\r\noccurrences of the past.'\""

An ascetic named Durvasas, who is of the regenerate order and who\r\nis full of wrath, came to my father's house for eleemosynary charity. I\r\nsucceeded in gratifying him by the purity of my external behaviour and of\r\nmy mind, as also by refusing to notice the many wrongs he did. I did not\r\ngive way to wrath although there was much in his behaviour quite capable\r\nof exciting that passion. Served with care, the great ascetic became\r\nhighly pleased with me and disposed to grant me a boon. 'Thou must accept\r\nthe boon I shall give,' were his words to me. Fearing his curse, I\r\nanswered him, saying,--'So be it.' The regenerate Rishi once more said\r\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\r\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\r\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\r\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\r\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\r\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\r\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\r\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\r\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\r\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\r\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\r\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\r\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\r\nme.' Bowing unto him with my head, I asked him to leave me. He replied\r\nunto me, saying,--'I cannot bear the idea of coming to thee fruitlessly.\r\nI shall consume thee as also that Brahmana who gave thee the Mantra as a\r\nboon.' The Brahmana who had done no evil--I wished to protect from\r\nSurya's curse. I therefore, said--'Let me have a son like thee, O god.'\r\nThe deity of thousand rays then penetrated me with his energy and\r\nstupefied me completely. He then said unto me,--'Thou wilt have a son,'\r\nand then went back to the firmament. I continued to live in the inner\r\napartments and desirous of saying the honour of my sire, I cast into the\r\nwaters my infant son named Karna who thus came into the world secretly.\r\nWithout doubt, through the grace of that god, I once more became a\r\nvirgin, O regenerate one, even as the Rishi Durvasas had said unto me.\r\nFoolish that I am, although he knew me for his mother when he grew up, I\r\nyet made no effort to acknowledge him. This burns me, O regenerate Rishi,\r\nas is well-known to thee. Whether it is sinful or not so, I have told\r\nthee truth. It behoveth thee, O holy one, to gratify the craving I feel\r\nfor beholding that son of mine. O foremost of ascetics, let this king\r\nalso, O sinless one, obtain the fruition today of that wish of his which\r\nhe cherishes in his bosom and which has become known to thee.' Thus\r\naddressed by Kunti, Vyasa, that foremost of all persons, said unto her in\r\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\r\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\r\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\r\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\r\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\r\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\r\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\r\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\r\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\r\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\r\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\""

Kunti also shall behold Karna, and she of Yadu's race\r\nshall behold her son Abhimanyu. Draupadi shall behold her five sons, her\r\nsires, and her brothers also. Even before ye had asked me, this was the\r\nthought in my mind. I entertained this purpose when I was urged to that\r\neffect by the king, by thee, O Gandhari, and by Kunti. Thou shouldst not\r\ngrieve for those foremost of men. They met with death in consequence of\r\ntheir devotion to the established practices of Kshatriyas. O faultless\r\none, the work of the gods could not but be accomplished. It was for\r\naccomplishing that object that those heroes came down on Earth. They were\r\nall portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and\r\nGuhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals\r\ncrowned with success (of penances), celestial Rishis, deities and Danavas\r\nand heavenly Rishis of spotless character, met with death on the\r\nbattle-field of Kurukshetra.[49] It is heard that he that was the\r\nintelligent king of the Gandharvas, and named Dhritarashtra, took birth\r\nin the world of men as thy lord Dhritarashtra. Know that Pandu of\r\nunfading glory and distinguished above all others, sprung from the\r\nMaruts. Kshattri and Yudhishthira are both portions of the deity of\r\nRighteousness. Know that Duryodhana was Kali, and Sakuni was Dwapara. O\r\nthou of good features, know that Dussasana and others were all Rakshasas.\r\nBhimasena of great might, that chastiser of foes, is from the Maruts.\r\nKnow that this Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, is the ancient Rishi Nara.\r\nHrishikesa is Narayana, and the twins are the Aswins. The foremost of\r\nheat-giving ones, viz., Surya, having divided his body in twain,\r\ncontinued with one portion to give heat to the worlds and with another to\r\nlive (on Earth.) as Karna. He that took his birth as the son of Arjuna,\r\nthat gladdener of all, that heir to the possessions of the Pandavas, who\r\nwas slain by six great car-warriors (fighting together), was Soma. He was\r\nborn of Subhadra. Through Yoga-puissance he had divided himself in twain.\r\nDhrishtadyumna who sprung with Draupadi from the sacrificial fire, was an\r\nauspicious portion of the deity of fire. Sikhandin was a Rakshasa. Know\r\nthat Drona was a portion of Vrihaspati, and that Drona's son is born of a\r\nportion of Rudra. Know that Ganga's son Bhishma was one of the Vasus that\r\nbecame born as a human being. Thus, O thou of great wisdom, the deities\r\nhad taken birth as human beings, and after having accomplished their\r\npurposes have gone back to Heaven. That sorrow which is in the hearts of\r\nyou all, relating to the return of these to the other world, I shall\r\ntoday dispel. Do you all go towards the Bhagirathi.--You will then behold\r\nall those that have been slain on the field of battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'All the persons there present, having heard the\r\nwords of Vyasa, raised a loud leonine shout and then proceeded towards\r\nthe Bhagirathi. Dhritarashtra with all his ministers and the Pandavas, as\r\nalso with all those foremost of Rishis and Gandharvas that had come\r\nthere, set out as directed. Arrived at the banks of Ganga, that sea of\r\nmen took up their abode as pleased them. The king possessed of great\r\nintelligence, with the Pandavas, took up his abode in a desirable spot,\r\nalong with the ladies and the aged ones of his household. They passed\r\nthat day as if it were a whole year, waiting for the advent of the night\r\nwhen they would behold the deceased princes.

Gandharvas sang their praises, and bards waited on\r\nthem, chanting their deeds. Robed in celestial vestments and wearing\r\ncelestial garlands, each of them was waited upon by bands of Apsaras. At\r\nthat time, through the puissance of his penances, the great ascetic, the\r\nson of Satyavati, gratified with Dhritarashtra, gave him celestial\r\nvision. Endued with celestial knowledge and strength, Gandhari of great\r\nfame saw all her children as also all that had been slain in battle. All\r\npersons assembled there beheld with steadfast gaze and hearts filled with\r\nwonder that amazing and inconceivable phenomenon which made the hair on\r\ntheir bodies stand on its end. It looked like a high carnival of\r\ngladdened men and women. That wondrous scene looked like a picture\r\npainted on the canvas.

      "content": "\"Sauti said, 'Hearing this story of the re-appearance and departure of\r\nhis forefathers, king Janamejaya of great intelligence became highly\r\npleased. Filled with joy, he once more questioned Vaisampayana on the\r\nsubject of the reappearance of dead men, saying,--\"How is it possible for\r\npersons whose bodies have been destroyed to re-appear in those very\r\nforms?\" Thus asked, that foremost of regenerate persons, viz., the\r\ndisciple of Vyasa, that first of speakers, possessed of great energy,\r\nthus answered Janamejaya.\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'This is certain, viz., that acts are never destroyed\r\n(without their consequences being enjoyed or endured). Bodies, O king,\r\nare born of acts; so also are features. The great primal elements are\r\neternal (indestructible) in consequence of the union with them of the\r\nLord of all beings. They exist with what is eternal. Accordingly, they\r\nhave no destruction when the non-eternal are destroyed. Acts done without\r\nexertion are true and foremost, and bear real fruit. The soul, united\r\nhowever with such acts as require exertion for their accomplishment,\r\nenjoys pleasure and pain.[50] Though united so (that is, with pleasure\r\nand pain), yet it is a certain inference that the soul is never modified\r\nby them, like the reflection of creatures in a mirror. It is never\r\ndestroyed.[51] As long as one's acts are not exhausted (by enjoyment or\r\nendurance of their fruits good and bad), so long does one regard the body\r\nto be oneself. The man, however, whose acts have been exhausted, without\r\nregarding the body to be self, takes the self to be something\r\notherwise.[52] Diverse existent objects (such as the primal elements and\r\nthe senses, etc.) attaining to a body, become united as one. To men of\r\nknowledge who understand the difference (between the body and self),\r\nthose very objects become eternal.[53] In the Horse-sacrifice, this Sruti\r\nis heard in the matter of the slaying of the horse. Those which are the\r\ncertain possessions of embodied creatures, viz., their life-breaths (and\r\nthe senses, etc.), exist eternally even when they are borne to the other\r\nworld. I shall tell thee what is beneficial, if it be agreeable to thee,\r\nO king. Thou hast, while employed in thy sacrifices, heard of the paths\r\nof the deities. When preparations were made for any sacrifice of thine,\r\nthe deities became beneficially inclined to thee. When indeed, the\r\ndeities were thus disposed and came to thy sacrifices, they were lords in\r\nthe matter of the passage (from this to the next world) of the animals\r\nslain.[54] For this reason, the eternal ones (viz., Jivas), by adoring\r\nthe deities in sacrifices, succeed in attaining to excellent goals. When\r\nthe five primal elements are eternal, when the soul also is eternal, he\r\ncalled Purusha (viz., the soul invested with case) is equally so. When\r\nsuch is the case, he who beholds a creature as disposed to take diverse\r\nforms, is regarded as having an erroneous understanding. He who indulges\r\nin too much grief at separation is, I think, a foolish person. He who\r\nsees evil in separation should abandon union. By standing aloof, no\r\nunions are formed, and sorrow is cast off, for sorrow in the world is\r\nborn of separation.[55] Only he who understands the distinction between\r\nbody and self, and not another, becomes freed from the erroneous\r\nconviction. He that knows the other (viz., self) attains to the highest\r\nunderstanding and becomes freed from error.[56] As regards creatures.\r\nthey appear from an invisible state, and once more disappear into\r\ninvisibleness. I do not know him. He also does not know me. As regards\r\nmyself, renunciation is not yet mine.[57] He that is not possessed of\r\npuissance enjoys or endures the fruits of all his acts in those too dies\r\nin which he does them. If the act be a mental one, its consequences are\r\nenjoyed or endured mentally; if it be done with the body, its\r\nconsequences are to be enjoyed or endured in the body.'\"[58]"

I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\r\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\r\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\r\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\r\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\r\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\r\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\r\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\r\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\r\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\r\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\r\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\r\nrest. O mighty-armed one, do thou then depart either tomorrow or this\r\nvery day. Do not tarry, O son. O chief of Bharata's race, thou hast\r\nrepeatedly heard what the duties are of kings. I do not see what more I\r\ncan say unto thee. I have no longer any need with thee, O thou of great\r\npuissance.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto the (old) monarch who said so, king\r\nYudhishthira replied,--'O thou that art conversant with every rule of\r\nrighteousness, it behoveth thee, not to cast me off in this way. I am\r\nguilty of no fault. Let all my brothers and followers depart as they\r\nlike. With steadfast vows I shall wait upon thee and upon these two\r\nmothers of mine.' Unto him Gandhari then said,--'O son, let it not be so.\r\nListen, the race of Kuru is now dependant on thee. The obsequial cake\r\nalso of my father-in-law depends on thee. Depart then, O son. We have\r\nbeen sufficiently honoured and served by thee. Thou shouldst do what the\r\nking says. Indeed, O son, thou shouldst obey the behests of thy sire.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--'Thus addressed by Gandhari, King Yudhishthira,\r\nrubbing his eyes which were bathed in tears of affection, said these\r\nwords of lament. 'The king casts me off, as also Gandhari of great fame.\r\nMy heart, however, is bound to thee. How shall I, filled as I am with\r\ngrief, leave thee? I do not, however, at the same time, venture to\r\nobstruct thy penances, O righteous lady. There is nothing higher than\r\npenances. It is by penances that one attains to the Supreme. O queen, my\r\nheart no longer turns as of old towards kingdom. My mind is wholly set\r\nupon penances now. The whole Earth is empty now. O auspicious lady, she\r\ndoes not please me any longer. Our kinsmen have been reduced in number.\r\nOur strength is no longer what it was before. The Panchalas have been\r\nwholly exterminated. They exist in name only. O auspicious lady, I do not\r\nbehold any one that may assist as their re-establishment and growth. All\r\nof them have been consumed to ashes by Drona on the field of battle.\r\nThose that remained were slain by Drona's son at night. The Chedis and\r\nthe Matsyas, who were our friends, no longer exist. Only the tribes of\r\nthe Vrishnis are all that remain, Vasudeva having upheld them. Beholding\r\nonly the Vrishnis I wish to live. My desire of life, however, is due to\r\nmy wish of acquiring merit and not wealth or enjoyment. Do thou cast\r\nauspicious looks upon us all. To obtain thy sight will be difficult for\r\nus. The king will commence to practise the most austere and unbearable of\r\npenances.' Hearing these words, that lord of battle, the mighty-armed\r\nSahadeva, with eyes bathed in tears, addressed Yudhishthira, saying,--'O\r\nchief of Bharata's race, I dare not leave my mother. Do thou return to\r\nthe capital soon. I shall practise penances, O puissant one. Even here I\r\nshall emaciate my body by penances, engaged in serving the feet of the\r\nking and of these my mothers.' Unto that mighty-armed hero, Kunti, after\r\nan embrace, said--'Depart, O son. Do not say so. Do my bidding. Do all of\r\nyou go hence. Let peace be yours. Ye sons, let happiness be yours. By\r\nyour stay here, our penances will be obstructed. Bound by the ties of my\r\naffection for thee, I shall fall off from my high penances. Therefore, O\r\nson, leave us. Short is the period that we have of life, O thou of great\r\npuissance.' By these and diverse other speeches of Kunti, the minds of\r\nSahadeva and king Yudhishthira were composed. Those foremost ones of\r\nKuru's race, having received the permission of their mother as also of\r\nthe (old) monarch, saluted the latter and began to take his leave.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Gladdened by auspicious blessings, we shall return\r\nto the capital. Indeed, O king, having received thy permission, we shall\r\nleave this retreat, freed from every sin.' Thus addressed by the\r\nhigh-souled king Yudhishthira the just, that royal sage, viz.,\r\nDhritarashtra, blessed Yudhishthira and gave him permission. The king\r\ncomforted Bhima, that foremost of all persons endued with great strength.\r\nEndued with great energy and great intelligence, Bhima showed his\r\nsubmissiveness to the king. Embracing Arjuna and clasping those foremost\r\nof men, viz., the twins also, and blessing them repeatedly, the Kuru king\r\ngave them permission to depart. They worshipped the feet of Gandhari and\r\nreceived her blessings also. Their mother Kunti then smelt their heads,\r\nand dismissed them. They then circumambulated the king like calves, when\r\nprevented from sucking their dams. Indeed, they repeatedly walked round\r\nhim, looking steadfastly at him.[60] Then all the ladies of the Kaurava\r\nhousehold, headed by Draupadi, worshipped their father-in-law according\r\nto the rites laid down in the scriptures, and took his leave. Gandhari\r\nand Kunti embraced each of them, and blessing them bade them go. Their\r\nmothers-in-law instructed them as to how they should conduct themselves.\r\nObtaining leave, they then departed, with their husbands. Then loud\r\nsounds were heard, uttered by the charioteers that said,--'Yoke,\r\nyoke,'--as also of camels that grunted aloud and of steeds that neighed\r\nbriskly. King Yudhishthira, with his wives and troops and all his\r\nkinsmen, set out for Hastinapura.\"'"

      "content": "(Naradagamana Parva)\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'After two years had elapsed from the date of the\r\nreturn of the Pandavas (from the retreat of their sire), the celestial\r\nRishi, Narada, O king, came to Yudhishthira. The mighty-armed Kuru king,\r\nthat foremost of speakers, viz., Yudhishthira, having duly worshipped\r\nhim, caused him to take a seat. After the Rishi had rested awhile, the\r\nking asked him, saying,--'It is after a long time that I behold thy holy\r\nself arrived at my court. Art thou in peace and happiness, O learned\r\nBrahmana? What are those countries which thou hast passed through? What\r\nshall I do to thee? Do thou tell me. Thou art the foremost of regenerate\r\nones, and thou art our highest refuge.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada said, 'I have not seen thee for a long while. Hence it is that I\r\nhave come to thee from my ascetic retreat. I have seen many sacred\r\nwaters, and the sacred stream Ganga also, O king.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'People dwelling on the banks of Ganga report that\r\nthe high-souled Dhritarashtra is practising the austerest of penances.\r\nHast thou seen him there? Is that perpetuator of Kuru's race in peace?\r\nAre Gandhari and Pritha, and the Suta's son Sanjaya also, in peace? How,\r\nindeed, is it faring with that royal sire of mine? I desire to hear this,\r\nO holy one, if thou hast seen the king (and knowest of his condition).'\r\n\r\n\"Narada said, 'Listen, O king, with calmness to me as I tell thee what I\r\nhave heard and seen in that ascetic retreat. After thy return from\r\nKurukshetra, O delighter of the Kurus, thy sire, O king, proceeded\r\ntowards Gangadwara. That intelligent monarch took with him his (sacred)\r\nfire, Gandhari and his daughter-in-law Kunti, as also Sanjaya of the Suta\r\ncaste, and all the Yajakas. Possessed of wealth of penances, thy sire set\r\nhimself to the practice of severe austerities. He held pebbles of stone\r\nin his mouth and had air alone for his subsistence, and abstained\r\naltogether from speech. Engaged in severe penances, he was worshipped by\r\nall the ascetics in the woods. In six months the king was reduced only to\r\na skeleton. Gandhari subsisted on water alone, while Kunti took a little\r\nevery sixth day. The sacred fire, O monarch, (belonging to the Kuru king)\r\nwas duly worshipped by the sacrificing assistants that were with him,\r\nwith libations of clarified butter poured on it. They did this whether\r\nthe king saw the rite or not. The king had no fixed habitation. He became\r\na wanderer through those woods. The two queens, as also Sanjaya, followed\r\nhim. Sanjaya acted as the guide on even and uneven land. The faultless\r\nPritha, O king, became the eye of Gandhari. One day, that best of kings\r\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\r\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\r\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\r\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\r\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\r\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\r\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\r\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\r\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\r\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\r\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\r\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\r\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\r\nsuffer our bodies to be destroyed by this fire and attain to the highest\r\ngoal.' Unto him, Sanjaya, that foremost of speakers, said,--'O king, this\r\ndeath, brought on by a fire that is not sacred, will prove calamitous to\r\nthee. I do not, however, see any means by which thou canst escape from\r\nthis conflagration. That which should next be done should be indicated by\r\nthee.' Thus addressed by Sanjaya the king once more said,--'This death\r\ncannot be calamitous to us, for we have left our home of our own accord.\r\nWater, fire, wind, and abstention from food,[61] (as means of death), are\r\nlaudable for ascetics. Do thou, therefore, leave us, O Sanjaya, without\r\nany delay. Having said these words to Sanjaya, the king concentrated his\r\nmind. Facing the east, he sat down, with Gandhari and Kunti. Beholding\r\nhim in that attitude, Sanjaya walked round him. Endued with intelligence,\r\nSanjaya said,--'Do thou concentrate thy soul, O puissant one.' The son of\r\na Rishi, and himself possessed of great wisdom, the king acted as he was\r\ntold. Restraining all the senses, he remained like a post of wood. The\r\nhighly blessed Gandhari, and thy mother Pritha too, remained in the same\r\nattitude. Then thy royal sire was overtaken by the forest-conflagration.\r\nSanjaya, his minister, succeeded in escaping from that conflagration. I\r\nsaw him on the banks of Ganga in the midst of ascetics. Endued with great\r\nenergy and great intelligence, he bade them farewell and then started for\r\nthe mountains of Himavat. Even thus the high-souled Kuru king met with\r\nhis death, and it was even thus that Gandhari and Kunti, thy two mothers,\r\nalso met with death, O monarch. In course of my wanderings at will, I saw\r\nthe bodies of that king and those two queens, O Bharata. Many ascetics\r\ncame to that retreat, having heard of the end of king Dhritarashtra. They\r\ndid not at all grieve for that end of theirs. There, O best of men, I\r\nheard all the details of how the king and the two queens, O son of Pandu,\r\nhad been burnt. O king of kings, thou shouldst not grieve for him. The\r\nmonarch, of his own will, as also Gandhari and thy mother, obtained that\r\ncontact with fire.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--'Hearing of the exit of Dhritarashtra from this\r\nworld, the high-souled Pandavas all gave way to great grief. Loud sounds\r\nor wailing were heard within the inner apartments of the palace. The\r\ncitizens also, hearing of the end of the old king, uttered loud\r\nlamentations. 'O fie! cried king Yudhishthira in great agony, raising his\r\narms aloft. Thinking of his mother, he wept like a child. All his\r\nbrothers too, headed by Bhimasena, did the same. Hearing that Pritha had\r\nmet with such a fate, the ladies of the royal household tittered loud\r\nlamentations of grief. All the people grieved upon hearing that the old\r\nking, who had become childless, had been burnt to death and that the\r\nhelpless Gandhari too had shared his fate. When those sounds of wailing\r\nceased for a while, king Yudhishthira the just, stopping his tears by\r\nsummoning all his patience, said these words.\"'"

Alas, who would\r\nhave thought that the son of Vichitraviryya would thus be burnt to death.\r\nHe had a hundred sons each endued with mighty arms and possessed of great\r\nprosperity. The king himself had the strength of ten thousand elephants.\r\nAlas, even he has been burnt to death in a forest-conflagration! Alas, he\r\nwho had formerly been fanned with palm leaves by the fair hands of\r\nbeautiful women was fanned by vultures with their wings after he had been\r\nburnt to death in a forest-conflagration! He who was formerly roused from\r\nsleep every morning by bands of Sutas and Magadhas had to sleep on the\r\nbare ground through the acts of my sinful self. I do not grieve for the\r\nfamous Gandhari who had been deprived of all her children. Observing the\r\nsame vows as her husband, she has attained to those very regions which\r\nhave become his. I grieve, however, for Pritha who, abandoning the\r\nblazing prosperity of her sons, became desirous of residing in the woods.\r\nFie on this sovereignty of ours, fie on our prowess, fie on the practices\r\nof Kshatriyas! Though alive, we are really dead! O foremost of superior\r\nBrahmanas, the course of Time is very subtle and difficult to understand,\r\ninasmuch as Kunti, abandoning sovereignty, became desirous of taking up\r\nher abode in the forest. How is it that she who was the mother of\r\nYudhishthira, of Bhima, of Vijaya, was burnt to deathlike a helpless\r\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\r\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\r\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\r\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\r\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\r\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\r\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\r\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\r\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\r\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\r\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\r\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\r\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\r\nPritha, emaciated and reduced to a form in which all her nerves became\r\nvisible, must have trembled in fear and cried aloud, saying,--O son\r\nYudhishthira, and awaited the terrible approach of the conflagration. She\r\nmust have also said,--O Bhima, rescue me from this danger--when she, my\r\nmother, was surrounded on all sides by that terrible conflagration. Among\r\nall her sons, Sahadeva, was her darling. Alas, that heroic son of\r\nMadravati did not rescue her.' Hearing these lamentations of the king,\r\nthose persons that were present there began to weep, embracing each\r\nother. In fact, the five sons of Pandu were so stricken with grief that\r\nthey resembled living creatures at the time of the dissolution of the\r\nuniverse. The sound of lamentations uttered by those weeping heroes,\r\nfilling the spacious chambers of the palace, escaped therefrom and\r\npenetrated the very welkin.\"'"

      "content": "\"Narada said, 'The king has not been burnt to death by an unsanctified\r\nfire. I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\r\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\r\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\r\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\r\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\r\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\r\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\r\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\r\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\r\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\r\nbanks of Ganga. United with that (sacred) fire of his own, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, the king, as I have already said unto thee, met with death on\r\nthe banks of Ganga. O sinless one, this is what the ascetics have told\r\nme,--those, viz., whom I saw on the banks of the sacred Bhagirathi, O\r\nYudhishthira. Thus O lord of Earth, king Dhritarashtra, coming into\r\ncontact with his own sacred fire, departed from this world and attained\r\nto that high goal that has been his. Through service rendered by her to\r\nher seniors, thy mother, O lord of men, has attained to very great\r\nsuccess. There is not the slightest doubt of this. It behoveth thee, O\r\nking of kings, to now discharge the rites of water to their honour, with\r\nall thy brothers. Let, therefore, the necessary steps be taken towards\r\nthat end.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--'Then that lord of Earth, that foremost of men,\r\nthat upholder of the burthens of the Pandavas, went out, accompanied by\r\nall his brothers as well as the ladies of his household. The inhabitants\r\nof the city as also those of the provinces, impelled by their loyalty,\r\nalso went out. They all proceeded towards the banks of Ganga, every one\r\nclad in only single peace of raiment. Then all those foremost of men,\r\nhaving plunged into the stream, placed Yuyutsu at their head, and began\r\nto offer oblations of water unto the high-souled king. And they also gave\r\nsimilar oblations unto Gandhari and Pritha, naming each separately and\r\nmentioning their families. Having finished those rites that cleanse the\r\nliving, they came back but without entering their capital took up their\r\nresidence outside of it. They also despatched a number of trusted people\r\nwell conversant with the ordinances relating to the cremation of the\r\ndead, to Gangadwara where the old king had been burnt to death. The king,\r\nhaving rewarded those men beforehand, commanded them to accomplish those\r\nrites of cremation which the bodies of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari and\r\nKunti still awaited.[62] On twelfth day, the king, properly purified,\r\nduly performed the Sraddhas of his deceased relations, which were\r\ncharacterised by gifts in abundance. Referring to Dhritarashtra,\r\nYudhishthira made many gifts of gold and silver, of kine and costly beds.\r\nUttering the names of Gandhari and Pritha, the king, endued with great\r\nenergy, made many excellent gifts. Every man received what thing he\r\nwished and as much of it as he wished. Beds and food, and cars and\r\nconveyances, and jewels and gems, and other wealth were given away in\r\nprofusion. Indeed, the king referring to his two mothers, gave away cars\r\nand conveyances, robes and coverlets, various kinds of food, and female\r\nslaves adorned with diverse ornaments. Having thus made many kinds of\r\ngifts in profusion, that lord of Earth then entered his capital called\r\nafter the elephant. Those men who had gone to the banks of Ganga at the\r\ncommand of the king, having disposed of (by cremation) the remains of the\r\nking and two queens, returned to the city. Having duly honoured those\r\nremains with garlands and scents of diverse kinds and disposed of them,\r\nthey informed Yudhishthira of the accomplishment of their task. The great\r\nRishi Narada, having comforted king Yudhishthira of righteous soul, went\r\naway to where he liked. Even thus did king Dhritarashtra make his exit\r\nfrom this world after having passed three years in the forest and ten and\r\nfive years in the city. Having lost all his children in battle, he had\r\nmany gifts in honour of his kinsmen, relatives, and friends, his brethren\r\nand own people. King Yudhishthira after the death of his uncle, became\r\nvery cheerless. Deprived of his kinsmen and relatives, he somehow bore\r\nthe burthen of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nOne should listen with rapt attention to this Asramavasika Parvan, and\r\nhaving heard it recited, one should feed Brahmanas with Habishya,\r\nhonouring them with scents and garlands.\"'\r\n\r\nThe end of Asramavasika Parvan.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1. The derivation of Aralikas is explained by Nilakantha thus; Potherbs\r\ncut off with a kind of weapon called Ara are called Aralu. They who were\r\nexpert in cooking those potherbs were called Aralikas. Ragakhandava was\r\nmanufactured from piper longum, dry ginger, sugar, and the juice of\r\nPhaseolus Mango.\r\n\r\n2. It will be remembered, Earth, unable to bear her load of population,\r\nprayed to the Grandsire for lightening that load. The Grandsire urged\r\nVishnu to do the needful. Hence Vishnu incarnated himself as Krishna and\r\nbrought about a lightening of Earth's load.\r\n\r\n3. Mahadana implies such gifts as elephants, boats, cars, horses, etc.\r\nEverybody does not accept these gifts, for their acceptance causes a\r\nBrahmana to fall away from his status.\r\n\r\n4. Some of the Bengal texts read avimukham hatah for abhimukam hatah. The\r\nsense is the same.\r\n\r\n5. The king gets a sixth share of the penances performed by the Rishis\r\nliving under his protection. The demerit, again, of all evil deeds done\r\nwithin his realm is shared by the king, for such deeds become possible\r\nthrough absence of supervision by the king.\r\n\r\n6. Formerly kings and noblemen wore jewels and medicinal herbs on their\r\narms. The last were enclosed in drum-like capsules of gold, hermetically\r\nclosed on both sides. It was believed that jewels and medicinal herbs are\r\na great protection against many evils.\r\n\r\n7. The eight limbs of a kingdom are the law, the judge, the assessors,\r\nthe scribe, the astrologer, gold, fire, and water.\r\n\r\n8. Atta is explained by Nilakantha as the space kept for the soldiers to\r\ntread upon.\r\n\r\n9. Grass may conceal the spies of foes. The darkness of night also may do\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n10. Adanaruchi is a very civil way of indicating corrupt officials and\r\nthieves. Inflictors of severe punishments were looked upon as tyrants\r\ndeserving of being put down. Heavy fines were at one time interdicted in\r\nEngland. Sahasapriya is a doer of rash deeds, such as culpable homicide\r\nnot amounting to murder, to adopt the terminology of the Indian Penal\r\nCode.\r\n\r\n11. i.e., content to work on receiving their food only. Their wages\r\nshould not be higher that' what is needed to feed them.\r\n\r\n12. The word Mandala has been explained below in verse 5. The distinction\r\nbetween Udasinas and Madhyasthas, as explained by Nilakantha, is that the\r\nformer are neutrals, while the latter are those who cherish equal\r\nsentiments towards both the parties.\r\n\r\n13. The four kinds of foes, as explained by the commentator, are (1) foes\r\nproper, (2) allies of foes, (3) those that wish victory to both sides,\r\nand (4) those that wish defeat to both sides. As regards Atatayins, they\r\nare six, viz., (1) he that sets fire to one's house, (2) he that mixes\r\npoison with one's food, (3) he that advances, weapon in hand, with\r\nhostile intent, (4) he that robs one of one's wealth, (5) he that invades\r\none's fields, and (6) he that steals one's wife.\r\n\r\n14. The sixty are thus made up. Eight consisting of agriculture and the\r\nrest; twenty-eight consisting of forces and the rest; fourteen consisting\r\nof atheists and the rest and eighteen consisting of counsels and the rest.\r\n\r\n15. i.e., land that is fertile, gold that is pure, and men that are\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n16. The wards Kasyanchidapadi should be construed with what follows.\r\n\r\n17. The cane yields when pressure is directed towards it. In the Santi\r\nParva occurs the detailed conversation between the Ocean and the Rivers.\r\nThe former enquired why, when the Rivers washed down the largest trees,\r\nthey could not wash into the Ocean a single cane. The answer was that the\r\ncane was yielding; the trees were not so.\r\n\r\n18. War and peace are each of two kinds, i.e., war with a strong foe and\r\nthat with a weak foe: peace with a strong foe and that with a weak foe.\r\nThe Bengal texts wrongly read dividhopayam or vividhopayam.\r\n\r\n19. I expand this verse a little, following the commentator.\r\n\r\n20. Strength is of three kinds, as explained in the next verse.\r\n\r\n21. Utsaha is readiness or alacrity, of the forces to attack the foe:\r\nprabhusakti is the complete mastery of the king over his forces, i.e.,\r\nthrough discipline. By strength of counsels, in this connection, is meant\r\nwell-formed plans of attack and defence.\r\n\r\n22. Maulam is explained as the strength of money. In modern warfare also,\r\nmoney is called 'the sinews of war'. Atavivala or the force consisting of\r\nforesters, was, perhaps, the body of Irregulars that supported a regular\r\narmy of combatants. Bhritavala implies the regular army, drawing pay from\r\nthe state at all times. In India, standing armies have existed from\r\nremote times. Sreni-vala is, perhaps, the forces of artisans, mechanics,\r\nand engineers, who looked after the roads and the transport, as also of\r\ntraders who supplied the army with provision.\r\n\r\n23. A sakata array was an array after the form of a car. It is described\r\nin Sukraniti fully, and occurs in the Drona Parva, ante. The Padma is a\r\ncircular array with angular projections. It is the same with what is now\r\ncalled the starry with angular projections. It is the same what is now\r\ncalled the starry array, many modern forts being constructed on this\r\nplan. The Vajra is a wedge-like array. It penetrates into the enemy's\r\ndivisions like a wedge and goes out, routing the foe. It is otherwise\r\ncalled suchivyuha.\r\n\r\n24. i.e., meet the foe whether within his own kingdom or invade the foe's\r\nrealm and thus oblige the foe to fall back for resisting him there.\r\n\r\n25. i.e., for obtaining fame here and felicity hereafter.\r\n\r\n26. Those who die become at first what is called Preta. They remain so\r\nfor one year, till the Sapindikarana Sraddha is performed. They then\r\nbecome united with the Pitris. The gifts made in the first Sraddha as\r\nalso in the monthly ones, have the virtue of rescuing the Preta or\r\nbringing him an accession of merit. The gifts in annual Sraddhas also\r\nhave the same efficacy.\r\n\r\n27. The text in verse 2, where mention is made of thousands of years as\r\nembracing the rule of Yudhishthira, is evidently vitiated.\r\n\r\n28. The correct reading is jane and not kshane.\r\n\r\n29. 'It is difficult to imagine why the rider of the Sindhus, Jayadratha,\r\nonly should be regarded as a wrong-doer to the Pandavas. In the matter of\r\nthe slaying of Abhimanyu he played a very minor part, by only guarding\r\nthe entrance of the array against the Pandava warriors. It is true he had\r\nattempted to abduct Draupadi from the forest retreat of the Pandavas, but\r\neven in this, the wrong was not so great as that which Duryodhana and\r\nothers inflicted on the Pandavas by dragging Draupadi to the court of the\r\nKurus.\r\n\r\n30. The usual way in which gifts are made at the present day on occasions\r\nof Sraddhas and marriages or other auspicious rites very nearly resembles\r\nwhat is described here. Instead of dedicating each gift with mantras and\r\nwater and making it over to the receiver, all the articles in a heap are\r\ndedicated with the aid of mantras. The guests are then assembled, and are\r\ncalled up individually. The Adhyaksha or superintendent, according to a\r\nlist prepared, names the gifts to be made to the guest called up. The\r\ntellers actually make them over, the scribes noting them down.\r\n\r\n31. Each gift that was indicated by Dhritarashtra was multiplied ten\r\ntimes at the command of Yudhishthira.\r\n\r\n32. As Dhritarashtra was blind, his queen Gandhari, whose devotion to her\r\nlord was very great, had, from the days of her marriage, kept her eyes\r\nbandaged refusing to look on the world which her lord could not see.\r\n\r\n33. Nilakantha explains that as Dhritarashtra is Pandu's elder brother,\r\ntherefore, Kunti regards him as Pandu's father. Queen Gandhari therefore\r\nis Kunti's mother-in-law. The eldest brother is looked upon as a father.\r\n\r\n34. To live watching the faces of others is to live in dependence on\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n35. It has been pointed out before that mahadana means gifts of such\r\nthings as elephants, horses, cars and other vehicles, boats, etc. The\r\ngiver wins great merit by making them, but the receiver incurs demerit by\r\nacceptance, unless he happens to be a person of exceptional energy. To\r\nthis day, acceptors of such gifts are looked upon as fallen men.\r\n\r\n36. The words that Kunti spoke were just. The opposition her sons offered\r\nwas unreasonable. Hence, their shame.\r\n\r\n37. 'Brahmi night' implies a night in course of which sacred hymns are\r\nsung.\r\n\r\n38. Nakharaprasa-yodhina, Nilakantha explains, are those combatants who\r\nare armed with tiger-like claws made of iron and tied to their waists.\r\n\r\n39. Suradevata is like karivringhati or govalivardda.\r\n\r\n40. Ulupi is implied.\r\n\r\n41. Implying the unfair character of the fight, for one on the earth\r\nshould never be assailed by one on his car.\r\n\r\n42. Yudhishthira was Dharma's self, Vidura also was Dharma born as a\r\nSudra through the curse of the Rishi Animandavya. Both, therefore, were\r\nof the same essence. When Vidura left his human body, he entered the body\r\nof Yudhishthira and thus the latter felt himself strengthened greatly by\r\nthe accession.\r\n\r\n43. Nilakantha here implies the peacock and not the blue jay, for the\r\nword keka is applied to the notes of the peacock alone. Datyuhas are\r\ngallinules or a species of Chatakas whose cry resembles, Phatik\r\njal--phatik jal--phatik jal! repeated very distinctly, the second\r\nsyllable being lengthened greatly.\r\n\r\n44. Audumvaran is an adjective of kalasan. It means 'made of copper'.\r\nPraveni is a kutha or blanket. Sruk is a ladle having the cup like cavity\r\nat one extremity only. Sruv is a ladle having cup-like cavities at both\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n45. Whenever a Brahmana cursed another, his penances underwent a\r\ndiminution. Forgiveness was the highest virtue of the Brahmana. His power\r\nlay in forgiveness. Hence, when Mandavya cursed Dharma, he had to spend a\r\nportion of his hard-earned penances. Previously, the plea of minority or\r\nnon-age could not be urged in the court of Dharma. Mandavya forced Dharma\r\nto admit that plea in the matter of punishment for offences.\r\n\r\n46. Both Dharana and Dhyana are processes or, rather, stages of Yoga. The\r\nformer implies the fixing of the mind on one thing; the latter is the\r\nabstraction of the mind from surrounding objects.\r\n\r\n47. Valhika was the sire of Somadatta and the grandsire of Bhurisravas.\r\nValhika, therefore, was the grand-father-in-law of the lady mentioned by\r\nGandhari.\r\n\r\n48. The puissance here referred to is that of Anima, Laghima, etc. i.e.,\r\nthe capacity of becoming minute and subtile, etc.\r\n\r\n49. The sense is that those had been incarnated as human beings and\r\nfighting with one another met with death as regards their human existence.\r\n\r\n50. Nilakantha explains that anayasakritani karma implies the religion of\r\nNivritti, for the religion of Pravritti consists of acts that require\r\nayasa or exertion for their accomplishment. The religion of Nivritti or\r\nabstention from acts is said hereto be true and superior, and productive\r\nof real fruit, in the form, that is, of Emancipation. The soul, however,\r\nin the generality of cases, united with ebhih, by which is meant\r\nayasa-kritam karma, that is, the acts done in pursuance of the religion\r\nof Pravritti, becomes embodied and, therefore, enjoys happiness or\r\nendures misery as the case may be.\r\n\r\n51. The sense seems to be this--when a creature stands before a mirror,\r\nits image is formed in the mirror; such reflection, however, never\r\naffects the mirror in the least, for when the object leaves the vicinity\r\nof the mirror, the image or reflection vanishes away. The soul is like\r\nthe mirror. Pleasure and pain are like reflections in it. They come and\r\ngo away without the soul being at all modified by them in anyway.\r\nPleasure and pain are destructible, but not so the soul.\r\n\r\n52. The ordinary man thinks this conglomeration of diverse objects to be\r\nhis self. The man of wisdom who has exhausted his acts does not think so.\r\nHe is freed from the obligation of taking a body.\r\n\r\n53. The sense probably is this. En the case of ordinary men, the\r\ncomponent parts of the body dissolve away, while Yogins can keep such\r\nparts from dissolution as long as they like.\r\n\r\n54. The sense is, the deities bear away to the next world the animals\r\nslain in sacrifices Through the bodies of such animals are apparently\r\ndestroyed, yet their life-breaths and senses continue to exist.\r\n\r\n55. The sense is that as wives etc., when lost, are sources of sorrow,\r\nwise men should abstain from contracting such relations. They might then\r\nbe free from sorrow.\r\n\r\n56. Paraparajnah is one that understands the distinction between body and\r\nsell. Apara is, therefore, one that is not possessed of such knowledge;\r\nhence, as Nilakantha explains, it implies one who has not attained to\r\nJnana nishtha. What is said in the second line is that he that adores\r\nsaguna Brahma, succeeds afterwards, through such adoration, in reaching\r\nto nirguna Brahma.\r\n\r\n57. The sense seems to be this: we spring from the unmanifest and\r\ndisappear once more in the unmanifest. The Bengal texts read the first\r\nline incorrectly. It is adarsanalapatitah. The second line is\r\nunintelligible. Naham tam vedini is taken by Nilakantha as implying 'I do\r\nnot know him,' i.e., him that is Emancipate. Asau cha no vetti mam is\r\nexplained as a due to karanabhat. But who is asau? 'I have no\r\nrenunciation,' or 'renunciation is not yet mine,' implies that\r\nEmancipation, which directly flows from renunciation, is not mine.\r\n\r\n58. What is stated here is that if a man does an act that is bad, its\r\nconsequences he will have to endure in a human body. The same with regard\r\nto rewards. By doing a meritorious act in one's human form, one will\r\nenjoy its good consequences in one's human body. So acts done mentally\r\naffect the mind and those done with the body affect the body.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the whole of the above translation is offered\r\ntentatively. A verbal rendering has been attempted. The chain of\r\nreasoning is not at all clear. The commentator has done much to elucidate\r\nthe sense, but the original obscurities have scarcely been removed.\r\n\r\n59. The Bengal reading manah is incorrect. It should be punah.\r\n\r\n60. Nripam pradakshinam chakru is the construction. Nivarana has\r\nsnanapanat understood after it.\r\n\r\n61. Vikarshanam is emaciation of the body by abstention from all food.\r\n\r\n62. The verb anvacat from root sas can govern two objectives. Here the\r\ntwo objectives are purushan and krityani"
