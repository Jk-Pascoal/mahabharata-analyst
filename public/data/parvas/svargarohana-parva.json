Additional proofing and\r\nformatting at sacred-texts.com, by J. B. Hare, October 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nOm! Having bowed down into Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as\r\nalso to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \"Jaya\" be uttered.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Having attained to Heaven, what regions were\r\nrespectively attained by my grandsires of old, viz., the Pandavas and the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra? I desire to hear this. I think that thou art\r\nconversant with everything, having been taught by the great Rishi Vyasa\r\nof wonderful feats.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Listen now to what thy grandsires, Yudhishthira and\r\nothers, did after having attained to Heaven, that place of the deities.\r\nArrived at Heaven, king Yudhishthira the just, beheld Duryodhana endued\r\nwith prosperity and seated on an excellent seat. He blazed with\r\neffulgence like the sun and wore all those signs of glory which belong to\r\nheroes. And he was in the company of many deities of blazing effulgence\r\nand of Sadhyas of righteous deeds. Yudhishthira, beholding Duryodhana and\r\nhis prosperity, became suddenly filled with rage and turned back from the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"He loudly addressed his companions, saying, I do not desire to share\r\nregions of felicity with Duryodhana who was stained by cupidity and\r\npossessed of little foresight. It was for him that friends, and kinsmen,\r\nover the whole Earth were slaughtered by us whom he had afflicted greatly\r\nin the deep forest. It was for him that the virtuous princess of Pancala,\r\nDraupadi of faultless features, our wife, was dragged into the midst of\r\nthe assembly before all our seniors. Ye gods, I have no desire to even\r\nbehold Suyodhana. I wish to go there where my brothers are.\r\n\r\n\"Narada, smiling, told him, It should not be so, O king of kings. While\r\nresiding in Heaven, all enmities cease. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, do\r\nnot say so about king Duryodhana. Hear my words. Here is king Duryodhana.\r\nHe is worshipped with the gods by those righteous men and those foremost\r\nof kings who are now denizens of Heaven. By causing his body to be poured\r\nas a libation on the fire of battle, he has obtained the end that\r\nconsists in attainment of the region for heroes. You and your brothers,\r\nwho were veritable gods on Earth, were always persecuted by this one. Yet\r\nthrough his observance of Kshatriya practices he has attained to this\r\nregion. This lord of Earth was not terrified in a situation fraught with\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\"O son, thou shouldst not bear in mind the woes inflicted on thee on\r\naccount of the match at dice. It behoveth thee not to remember the\r\nafflictions of Draupadi. It behoveth thee not to remember the other woes\r\nwhich were yours in consequence of the acts of your kinsmen,the woes,\r\nviz., that were due to battle or to other situations. Do thou meet\r\nDuryodhana now according to the ordinances of polite intercourse. This is\r\nHeaven, O lord of men. There can be no enmities here.\r\n\r\n\"Though thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with\r\ngreat intelligence, enquired about his brothers and said, If these\r\neternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhanas, that unrighteous and\r\nsinful wight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole\r\nworld, that man for whose sake the entire Earth was devastated with all\r\nher horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we\r\nwere burnt with wrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs,\r\nI desire to see what regions have been attained by those high-souled\r\nheroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful\r\nin speech, and distinguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son\r\nof Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki,\r\nthe sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death\r\nin the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth,\r\nO Brahmana? I do not see them here, O Narada. I desire to see, O Narada,\r\nVirata and Drupada and the other great Kshatriyas headed by Dhrishtaketu,\r\nas also Shikhandi, the Pancala prince, the sons of Draupadi, and\r\nAbhimanyu, irresistible in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, Ye deities, I do not see here Radhas son of\r\nimmeasurable prowess, as also my high-souled brothers, and Yudhamanyu and\r\nUttamaujas, those great car-warriors that poured their bodies (as\r\nlibations) on the fire of battle, those kings and princes that met with\r\ndeath for my sake in battle. Where are those great car-warriors that\r\npossessed the prowess of tigers? Have those foremost of men acquired this\r\nregion? If those great car-warriors have obtained these regions, then\r\nonly do you know, ye gods, that I shall reside here with those\r\nhigh-souled ones. If this auspicious and eternal region has not been\r\nacquired by those kings, then know, ye gods, that without those brothers\r\nand kinsmen of mine, I shall not live here. At the time of performing the\r\nwater rites (after the battle), I heard my mother say, Do thou offer\r\noblations of water unto Karna. Since hearing those words of my mother, I\r\nam burning with grief. I grieve also incessantly at this, ye gods, that\r\nwhen I marked the resemblance between the feet of my mother and those of\r\nKarna of immeasurable soul, I did not immediately place myself under\r\norders of that afflicter of hostile ranks. Ourselves joined with Karna,\r\nShakra himself would have been unable to vanquish in battle. Wherever may\r\nthat child of Surya be, I desire to see him. Alas, his relationship with\r\nus being unknown, I caused him to be slain by Arjuna. Bhima also of\r\nterrible prowess and dearer to me than my life-breaths, Arjuna too,\r\nresembling Indra himself, the twins also that resembled the Destroyer\r\nhimself in prowess, I desire to behold. I wish to see the princess of\r\nPancala, whose conduct was always righteous. I wish not to stay here. I\r\ntell you the truth. Ye foremost ones among the deities, what is Heaven to\r\nme if I am dissociated from my brothers? That is Heaven where those\r\nbrothers of mine are. This, in my opinion, is not Heaven.\r\n\r\n\"The gods said, If thou longest to be there, go then, O son, without\r\ndelay. At the command of the chief of the deities, we are ready to do\r\nwhat is agreeable to thee.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: Having said so, the gods then ordered the\r\ncelestial messenger, O scorcher of foes, saying, Do thou show unto\r\nYudhishthira his friends and kinsmen. Then the royal son of Kunti and the\r\ncelestial messenger proceeded together, O foremost of kings, to that\r\nplace where those chiefs of men (whom Yudhishthira had wished to see)\r\nwere. The celestial messenger proceeded first, the king followed him\r\nbehind. The path was inauspicious and difficult and trodden by men of\r\nsinful deeds. It was enveloped in thick darkness, and covered with hair\r\nand moss forming its grassy vesture. Polluted with the stench of sinners,\r\nand miry with flesh and blood, it abounded with gadflies and stinging\r\nbees and gnats and was endangered by the inroads of grisly bears. Rotting\r\ncorpses lay here and there. Overspread with bones and hair, it was\r\nnoisome with worms and insects. It was skirted all along with a blazing\r\nfire. It was infested by crows and other birds and vultures, all having\r\nbeaks of iron, as also by evil spirits with long mouths pointed like\r\nneedles. And it abounded with inaccessible fastnesses like the Vindhya\r\nmountains. Human corpses were scattered over it, smeared with fat and\r\nblood, with arms and thighs cut off, or with entrails torn out and legs\r\nsevered.\r\n\r\n\"Along that path so disagreeable with the stench of corpses and awful\r\nwith other incidents, the righteous-souled king proceeded, filled with\r\ndiverse thoughts. He beheld a river full of boiling water and, therefore,\r\ndifficult to cross, as also a forest of trees whose leaves were sharp\r\nswords and razors. There were plains full of fine white sand exceedingly\r\nheated, and rocks and stones made of iron. There were many jars of iron\r\nall around, with boiling oil in them. Many a Kuta-salmalika was there,\r\nwith sharp thorns and, therefore, exceedingly painful to the touch. The\r\nson of Kunti beheld also the tortures inflicted upon sinful men.\r\n\r\n\"Beholding that inauspicious region abounding with every sort of\r\nfoulness, Yudhishthira asked the celestial messenger, saying, How far\r\nshall we proceed along a path like this? It behoveth thee to tell me\r\nwhere those brothers of mine are. I desire also to know what region is\r\nthis of the gods?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the just, the celestial\r\nmessenger stopped in his course and replied, saying, Thus far is your\r\nway. The denizens of Heaven commanded me that having come thus far, I am\r\nto stop. If thou art tired, O king of kings, thou mayst return with me.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira, however, was exceedingly disconsolate and stupefied by the\r\nfoul odour. Resolved to return, O Bharata, he retraced his steps.\r\nAfflicted by sorrow and grief, the righteous-souled monarch turned back.\r\nJust at that moment he heard piteous lamentations all around, O son of\r\nDharma, O royal sage, O thou of sacred origin, O son of Pandu, do thou\r\nstay a moment for favouring us. At thy approach, O invincible one, a\r\ndelightful breeze hath begun to blow, bearing the sweet scent of thy\r\nperson. Great hath been our relief at this. O foremost of kings,\r\nbeholding thee, O first of men, great hath been our happiness. O son of\r\nPritha, let that happiness last longer through thy stay here, for a few\r\nmoments more. Do thou remain here, O Bharata, for even a short while. As\r\nlong as thou art here, O thou of Kurus race, torments cease to afflict\r\nus. These and many similar words, uttered in piteous voices by persons in\r\npain, the king heard in that region, wafted to his ears from every side.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing those words of beings in woe, Yudhishthira of compassionate\r\nheart exclaimed aloud, Alas, how painful! And the king stood still. The\r\nspeeches of those woe-begone and afflicted persons seemed to the son of\r\nPandu to be uttered in voices that he had heard before although he could\r\nnot recognise them on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Unable to recognise voices, Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, enquired, saying,\r\nWho are you? Why also do you stay here?\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed, they answered him from all sides, saying, I am Karna! I\r\nam Bhimasena! I am Arjuna! I am Nakula! I am Sahadeva! I am\r\nDhrishtadyumna! I am Draupadi! We are the sons of Draupadi! Even thus, O\r\nking, did those voices speak.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing those exclamations, O king, uttered in voices of pain suitable\r\nto that place, the royal Yudhishthira asked himself What perverse destiny\r\nis this? What are those sinful acts which were committed by those\r\nhigh-souled beings, Karna and the sons of Draupadi, and the\r\nslender-waisted princess of Pancala, so that their residence has been\r\nassigned in this region of foetid smell and great woe? I am not aware of\r\nany transgression that can be attributed to these persons of righteous\r\ndeeds. What is that act by doing which Dhritarashtras son, king\r\nSuyodhana, with all his sinful followers, has become invested with such\r\nprosperity? Endued with prosperity like that of the great Indra himself,\r\nhe is highly adored. What is that act through the consequence of which\r\nthese (high-souled ones) have fallen into Hell? All of them were\r\nconversant with every duty, were heroes, were devoted to truth and the\r\nVedas; were observant of Kshatriya practices; were righteous in their\r\nacts; were performers of sacrifices; and givers of large presents unto\r\nbrahmanas. Am I asleep or awake? Am I conscious or unconscious? Or, is\r\nall this a mental delusion due to disorders of the brain?\r\n\r\n\"Overwhelmed by sorrow and grief, and with his senses agitated by\r\nanxiety, king Yudhishthira indulged in such reflections for a long time.\r\nThe royal son of Dharma then gave way to great wrath. Indeed,\r\nYudhishthira then censured the gods, as also Dharma himself. Afflicted by\r\nthe very foul odour, he addressed the celestial messenger, saying, Return\r\nto the presence of those whose messenger thou art. Tell them that I shall\r\nnot go back to where they are, but shall stay even here, since, in\r\nconsequence of my companionship, these afflicted brothers of mine have\r\nbecome comforted. Thus addressed by the intelligent son of Pandu, the\r\ncelestial messenger returned to the place where the chief of the deities\r\nwas, viz., he of a hundred sacrifices. He represented unto him the acts\r\nof Yudhishthira. Indeed, O ruler of men, he informed Indra of all that\r\nDharmas son had said!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had\r\nnot stayed there for more than a moment when, O thou of Kurus race, all\r\nthe gods with Indra at their head came to that spot. The deity of\r\nRighteousness in his embodied form also came to that place where the Kuru\r\nking was, for seeing that monarch. Upon the advent of those deities of\r\nresplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had\r\noverwhelmed that region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone\r\nby beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The river Vaitarani, the\r\nthorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to\r\nbehold, also vanished from sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also,\r\nwhich the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a\r\nbreeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and\r\ndelightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow on that spot in consequence\r\nof the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the\r\ntwin Ashvinis, the Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas, and the other\r\ndenizens of Heaven, as also the Siddhas and the great Rishis, all came\r\nthere where Dharmas royal son of great energy was.\r\n\r\n\"Then Shakra, the lord of the deities, endued with blazing prosperity,\r\naddressed Yudhishthira and comforting him, said, O Yudhishthira of mighty\r\narms, come, come, O chief of men. These illusions have ended, O puissant\r\none. Success has been attained by thee, O mighty-armed one, and eternal\r\nregions (of felicity) have become thine. Thou shouldst not yield to\r\nwrath. Listen to these words of mine. Hell, O son, should without doubt\r\nbe beheld by every king. Of both good and bad there is abundance, O chief\r\nof men. He who enjoys first the fruits of his good acts must afterwards\r\nendure Hell. He, on the other hand, who first endures Hell, must\r\nafterwards enjoy Heaven. He whose sinful acts are many enjoys Heaven\r\nfirst. It is for this, O king, that desirous of doing thee good, I caused\r\nthee to be sent for having a view of Hell. Thou hadst, by a pretence,\r\ndeceived Drona in the matter of his son. Thou hast, in consequence\r\nthereof, been shown Hell by an act of deception. After the manner of\r\nthyself, Bhima and Arjuna, and Draupadi, have all been shown the place of\r\nsinners by an act of deception. Come, O chief of men, all of them have\r\nbeen cleansed of their sins. All those kings who had aided thee and who\r\nhave been slain in battle, have all attained to Heaven. Come and behold\r\nthem, O foremost one of Bharatas race.\r\n\r\n\"Karna, the mighty bowman, that foremost of all wielders of weapons for\r\nwhom thou art grieving, has also attained to high success. Behold, O\r\npuissant one, that foremost of men, viz., the son of Surya. He is in that\r\nplace which is his own, O mighty-armed one. Kill this grief of thine, O\r\nchief of men. Behold thy brothers and others, those kings, that is, who\r\nhad espoused thy side. They have all attained to their respective places\r\n(of felicity). Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled. Having endured a\r\nlittle misery first, from this time, O son of Kurus race, do thou sport\r\nwith me in happiness, divested of grief and all thy ailments dispelled. O\r\nmighty-armed one, do thou now enjoy, O king, the rewards of all thy deeds\r\nof righteousness of those regions which thou hast acquired thyself by thy\r\npenances and of all thy gifts. Let deities and Gandharvas, and celestial\r\nApsaras, decked in pure robes and excellent ornaments, wait upon and\r\nserve thee for thy happiness. Do thou, O mighty-armed one, enjoy now\r\nthose regions (of felicity) which have become thine through the Rajasuya\r\nsacrifice performed by thee and whose felicities have been enhanced by\r\nthe sacrificial scimitar employed by thee. Let the high fruits of thy\r\npenances be enjoyed by thee. Thy regions, O Yudhishthira, are above,\r\nthose of kings. They are equal to those of Hariscandra, O son of Pritha.\r\nCome, and sport there in bliss. There where the royal sage Mandhatri is,\r\nthere where king Bhagiratha is, there where Dushmantas son Bharata is,\r\nthere wilt thou sport in bliss. Here is the celestial river, sacred and\r\nsanctifying the three worlds. It is called Heavenly Ganga. Plunging into\r\nit, thou wilt go to thy own regions. Having bathed in this stream, thou\r\nwilt be divested of thy human nature. Indeed, thy grief dispelled, thy\r\nailments conquered, thou wilt be freed from all enmities.\r\n\r\n\"While, O Kuru king, the chief of the gods was saying so unto\r\nYudhishthira, the deity of Righteousness, in his embodied form, then\r\naddressed his own son and said, O king, I am greatly pleased, O thou of\r\ngreat wisdom, with thee, O son, by thy devotion to me, by thy\r\ntruthfulness of speech, and forgiveness, and self-restraint. This,\r\nindeed, is the third test, O king, to which I put thee. Thou art\r\nincapable, O son of Pritha, of being swerved from thy nature or reason.\r\nBefore this, I had examined thee in the Dwaita woods by my questions,\r\nwhen thou hadst come to that lake for recovering a couple of fire sticks.\r\nThou stoodst it well. Assuming the shape of a dog, I examined thee once\r\nmore, O son, when thy brothers with Draupadi had fallen down. This has\r\nbeen thy third test; thou hast expressed thy wish to stay at Hell for the\r\nsake of thy brothers. Thou hast become cleansed, O highly blessed one.\r\nPurified of sin, be thou happy.\r\n\r\nO son of Pritha, thy brothers, O king, were not such as to deserve Hell.\r\nAll this has been an illusion created by the chief of the gods. Without\r\ndoubt, all kings, O son, must once behold Hell. Hence hast thou for a\r\nlittle while been subjected to this great affliction. O king, neither\r\nArjuna, nor Bhima, nor any of those foremost of men, viz., the twins, nor\r\nKarna, ever truthful in speech and possessed of great courage, could be\r\ndeserving of Hell for a long time. The princess Krishna too, O\r\nYudhishthira, could not be deserving of that place of sinners. Come,\r\ncome, O foremost one of the Bharatas, behold Ganga who spreads her\r\ncurrent over the three worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed, that royal sage, viz., thy grandsire, proceeded with\r\nDharma and all the other gods. Having bathed in the celestial river\r\nGanga, sacred and sanctifying and ever adored by the Rishis, he cast off\r\nhis human body. Assuming then a celestial form, king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, in consequence of that bath, became divested of all his enmities\r\nand grief. Surrounded by the deities, the Kuru king Yudhishthira then\r\nproceeded from that spot. He was accompanied by Dharma, and the great\r\nRishis uttered his praises. Indeed, he reached that place where those\r\nforemost of men, those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras,\r\nfreed from (human) wrath, were enjoying each his respective status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"King Yudhishthira, thus praised by the gods, the\r\nMaruts and the Rishis, proceeded to that place where those foremost ones\r\nof Kurus race were. He beheld Govinda endued with his Brahma-form. It\r\nresembled that form of his which had been seen before and which,\r\ntherefore, helped the recognition. Blazing forth in that form of his, he\r\nwas adorned with celestial weapons, such as the terrible discus and\r\nothers in their respective embodied forms. He was being adored by the\r\nheroic Phalguna, who also was endued with a blazing effulgence. The son\r\nof Kunti beheld the slayer of Madhu also in his own form. Those two\r\nforemost of Beings, adored by all the gods, beholding Yudhishthira,\r\nreceived him with proper honours.\r\n\r\n\"In another place, the delighter of the Kurus beheld Karna, that foremost\r\none among all wielders of weapons, resembling a dozen Suryas in\r\nsplendour. In another part he beheld Bhimasena of great puissance,\r\nsitting in the midst of the Maruts, and endued with a blazing form. He\r\nwas sitting by the side of the God of Wind in his embodied form. Indeed,\r\nhe was then in a celestial form endued with great beauty, and had\r\nattained to the highest success. In place belonging to the Ashvinis, the\r\ndelighter of the Kurus beheld Nakula and Sahadeva, each blazing with his\r\nown effulgence.\r\n\r\n\"He also beheld the princess of Pancala, decked in garlands of lotuses.\r\nHaving attained to Heaven, she was sitting there, endued with a form\r\npossessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to\r\nquestion her. Then the illustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to\r\nhim, This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth,\r\nas the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any\r\nmothers womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with agreeable perfume and capable\r\nof delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the\r\nwielder of the trident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was\r\nenjoyed by you all. These five highly blessed Gandharvas endued with the\r\neffulgence of fire, and possessed of great energy, were, O king, the sons\r\nof Draupadi and yourself.\r\n\r\n\"Behold Dhritarashtra, the king of the Gandharvas, possessed of great\r\nwisdom. Know that this one was the eldest brother of thy sire. This one\r\nis thy eldest brother, the son of Kunti, endued with effulgence of fire.\r\nThe son of Surya, thy eldest brother, the foremost of men, even this one\r\nwas known as the son of Radha. He moves in the company of Surya. Behold\r\nthis foremost of Beings. Among the tribes of the Saddhyas, the gods, the\r\nViswedevas, and the Maruts, behold, O king of kings, the mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, viz., those heroes having\r\nSatyaki for their first, and those mighty ones among the Bhojas. Behold\r\nthe son of Subhadra, invincible in battle, now staying with Soma. Even he\r\nis the mighty bowman Abhimanyu, now endued with the gentle effulgence of\r\nthe great luminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now\r\nunited with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire frequently comes to me on his\r\nexcellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the\r\nmidst of the Vasus. Know that this one by the side of Brihaspati is thy\r\npreceptor Drona. These and other kings, O son of Pandu, who had warred on\r\nthy side now walk with the Gandharvas or Yakshas or other sacred beings.\r\nSome have attained to the status of Guhyakas, O king. Having cast off\r\ntheir bodies, they have conquered Heaven by the merit they had acquired\r\nthrough word, thought and deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Bhishma and Drona, those two high-souled persons, king\r\nDhritarashtra, and Virata and Drupada, and Sankha and Uttara.\r\nDhrishtaketu and Jayatsena and king Satyajit, the sons of Duryodhana, and\r\nShakuni the son of Subala, Karnas sons of great prowess, king Jayadratha,\r\nGhatotkaca and others whom thou hast not mentioned, the other heroic\r\nkings of blazing formstell me for what period they remained in Heaven. O\r\nforemost of regenerate persons, was theirs an eternal place in Heaven?\r\nWhat was the end attained to by those foremost of men when their acts\r\ncame to an end? I desire to hear this, O foremost of regenerate persons,\r\nand therefore have I asked thee. Through thy blazing penances thou seest\r\nall things.\r\n\r\nSauti said: Thus questioned, that regenerate Rishi, receiving the\r\npermission of the high-souled Vyasa, set himself to answer the question\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Every one, O king of men, is not capable of\r\nreturning to his own nature at the end of his deeds. Whether this is so\r\nor not, is, indeed a good question asked by thee. Hear, O king, this\r\nwhich is a mystery of the gods, O chief of Bharatas race. It was\r\nexplained (to us) by Vyasa of mighty energy, celestial vision and great\r\nprowess, that ancient ascetic, O Kauravya, who is the son of Parasara and\r\nwho always observes high vows, who is of immeasurable understanding, who\r\nis omniscient, and who, therefore knows the end attached to all acts.\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of\r\nthe Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of Bharatas race, are now seen. Drona\r\nentered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasas descendants.\r\nHridikas son Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara\r\nwhence he had issued. Dhritarashtra obtained the regions, so difficult of\r\nacquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari\r\nobtained the same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two\r\nwives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great Indra. Both Virata and\r\nDrupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva,\r\nBhanukampa, and Viduratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and\r\nKansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost of men, with\r\nhis brother Sankhaall these foremost of persons entered the deities.\r\nSomas son of great prowess, named Varchas of mighty energy, became\r\nAbhimanyu, the son of Phalguna, that lion among men. Having fought,\r\nagreeably to Kshatriya practices, with bravery such as none else had ever\r\nbeen able to show, that mighty-armed and righteous-souled being entered\r\nSoma. Slain on the field of battle, O foremost of men, Karna entered\r\nSurya. Shakuni obtained absorption into Dwapara, and Dhrishtadyumna into\r\nthe deity of fire. The sons of Dhritarashtra were all Rakshasas of fierce\r\nmight. Sanctified by death caused by weapons, those high-souled beings of\r\nprosperity all succeeded in attaining to Heaven. Both Kshattri and king\r\nYudhishthira entered into the god of Righteousness. The holy and\r\nillustrious Ananta (who had taken birth as Balarama) proceeded to the\r\nregion below the Earth. Through the command of the Grandsire, he, aided\r\nby his Yoga power, supported the Earth. Vasudeva was a portion of that\r\neternal god of gods called Narayana. Accordingly, he entered into\r\nNarayana. 16,000 women had been married to Vasudeva as his wives. When\r\nthe time came, O Janamejaya, they, plunged into the Sarasvati. Casting\r\noff their (human) bodies there, they re-ascended to Heaven. Transformed\r\ninto Apsaras, they approached the presence of Vasudeva. Those heroic and\r\nmighty car-warriors, Ghatotkaca and others, who were slain in the great\r\nbattle, attained to the status, some of gods and some of Yakshas. Those\r\nthat had fought on the side of Duryodhana are said to have been\r\nRakshasas. Gradually, O king, they have all attained to excellent regions\r\nof felicity. Those foremost of men have proceeded, some to the abode of\r\nIndra, some to that of Kuvera of great intelligence, and some to that of\r\nVaruna. I have now told thee, O thou of great splendour, everything about\r\nthe acts, O Bharata, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas.\r\n\r\nSauti said: Hearing this, ye foremost of regenerate ones, at the\r\nintervals of sacrificial rites, king Janamejaya became filled with\r\nwonder. The sacrificial priests then finished the rites that remained to\r\nbe gone through. Astika, having rescued the snakes (from fiery death),\r\nbecame filled with joy. King Janamejaya then gratified all the Brahmanas\r\nwith copious presents. Thus worshipped by the king, they returned to\r\ntheir respective abodes. Having dismissed those learned Brahmanas, king\r\nJanamejaya came back from Takshasila to the city named after the elephant.\r\n\r\nI have now told everything that Vaishampayana narrated, at the command of\r\nVyasa, unto the king at his snake sacrifice. Called a history, it is\r\nsacred, sanctifying and excellent. It has been composed by the ascetic\r\nKrishna, O Brahmana, of truthful speech. He is omniscient, conversant\r\nwith all ordinances, possessed of a knowledge of all duties, endued with\r\npiety, capable of perceiving what is beyond the ken of the senses, pure,\r\nhaving a soul cleansed by penances, possessed of the six high attributes,\r\nand devoted to Sankhya Yoga. He has composed this, beholding everything\r\nwith a celestial eye that has been cleansed (strengthened) by varied\r\nlore. He has done this, desiring to spread the fame, throughout the\r\nworld, of the high-souled Pandavas, as also of other Kshatriyas possessed\r\nof abundant wealth of energy.\r\n\r\nThat learned man who recites this history of sacred days in the midst of\r\na listening auditory becomes cleansed of every sin, conquers Heaven, and\r\nattains to the status of Brahma. Of that man who listens with rapt\r\nattention to the recitation of the whole of this Veda composed by (the\r\nIsland-born) Krishna, a million sins, numbering such grave ones as\r\nBrahmanicide and the rest, are washed off. The Pitris of that man who\r\nrecites even a small portion of this history at a Sraddha, obtain\r\ninexhaustible food and drink. The sins that one commits during the day by\r\nones senses or the mind are all washed off before evening by reciting a\r\nportion of the Mahabharata. Whatever sins a Brahmana may commit at night\r\nin the midst of women are all washed off before dawn by reciting a\r\nportion of the Mahabharata.\r\n\r\nThe high race of the Bharatas is its topic. Hence it is called Bharata.\r\nAnd because of its grave import, as also of the Bharatas being its topic,\r\nit is called Mahabharata. He who is versed in interpretations of this\r\ngreat treatise, becomes cleansed of every sin. Such a man lives in\r\nrighteousness, wealth, and pleasure, and attains to Emancipation also, O\r\nchief of Bharatas race.\r\n\r\nThat which occurs here occurs elsewhere. That which does not occur here\r\noccurs nowhere else. This history is known by the name of Jaya. It should\r\nbe heard by every one desirous of Emancipation. It should be read by\r\nBrahmanas, by kings, and by women quick with children. He that desires\r\nHeaven attains to Heaven; and he that desires victory attains to victory.\r\nThe woman quick with child gets either a son or a daughter highly\r\nblessed. The puissant Island-born Krishna, who will not have to come\r\nback, and who is Emancipation incarnate, made an abstract of the Bharata,\r\nmoved by the desire of aiding the cause of righteousness. He made another\r\ncompilation consisting of sixty lakhs of verses. Thirty lakhs of these\r\nwere placed in the region of the deities. In the region of the Pitris\r\nfifteen lakhs, it should be known, are current; while in that of the\r\nYakshas fourteen lakhs are in vogue. One lakh is current among human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nNarada recited the Mahabharata to the gods; Asita-Devala to the Pitris;\r\nSuka to the Rakshasas and the Yakshas; and Vaishampayana to human beings.\r\nThis history is sacred, and of high import, and regarded as equal to the\r\nVedas. That man, O Saunaka, who hears this history, placing a Brahmana\r\nbefore him, acquires both fame and the fruition of all his wishes. He\r\nwho, with fervid devotion, listens to a recitation of the Mahabharata,\r\nattains (hereafter) to high success in consequence of the merit that\r\nbecomes his through understanding even a very small portion thereof. All\r\nthe sins of that man who recites or listens to this history with devotion\r\nare washed off.\r\n\r\nIn former times, the great Rishi Vyasa, having composed this treatise,\r\ncaused his son Suka to read it with him, along with these four Verses.\r\nThousands of mothers and fathers, and hundreds of sons and wives arise in\r\nthe world and depart from it. Others will (arise and) similarly depart.\r\nThere are thousands of occasions for joy and hundreds of occasions for\r\nfear. These affect only him that is ignorant but never him that is wise.\r\nWith uplifted arms I am crying aloud but nobody hears me. From\r\nRighteousness is Wealth as also Pleasure. Why should not Righteousness,\r\ntherefore, be courted? For the sake neither of pleasure, nor of fear, nor\r\nof cupidity should any one cast off Righteousness. Indeed, for the sake\r\nof even life one should not cast off Righteousness. Righteousness is\r\neternal. Pleasure and Pain are not eternal. Jiva is eternal. The cause,\r\nhowever, of Jivas being invested with a body is not so.\r\n\r\nThat man who, waking up at dawn, reads this Savittri of the Bharata,\r\nacquires all the rewards attached to a recitation of this history and\r\nultimately attains to the highest Brahma. As the sacred Ocean, as the\r\nHimavat mountain, are both regarded as mines of precious gems, even so is\r\nthis Bharata (regarded as a mine of precious gems). The man of learning,\r\nby reciting to others this Veda or Agama composed by (the Island-born)\r\nKrishna, earns wealth. There is no doubt in this that he who, with rapt\r\nattention, recites this history called Bharata, attains to high success.\r\nWhat need has that man of a sprinkling of the waters of Pushkara who\r\nattentively listens to this Bharata, while it is recited to him? It\r\nrepresents the nectar that fell from the lips of the Island-born. It is\r\nimmeasurable, sacred, sanctifying, sin-cleansing, and auspicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"O holy one, according to what rites should the learned\r\nlisten to the Bharata? What are the fruits (acquirable by hearing it)?\r\nWhat deities are to be worshipped during the several paranas? What should\r\nbe the gifts that one should make, O holy one, at every parva or sacred\r\nday (during the continuance of the recitation)? What should be the\r\nqualification of the reciter to be engaged? Tell me all this!\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hear, O king, what the procedure is, and what the\r\nfruits, O Bharata, are that will spring from ones listening (to a\r\nrecitation of the Bharata). Even this, O king of kings, is what thou\r\naskest me. The deities of Heaven, O ruler of Earth, came to this world\r\nfor sport. Having achieved their task, they ascended once more to Heaven.\r\nListen to what I shall tell thee in brief. In the Mahabharata is to be\r\nfound the births of Rishis and deities on the Earth. In this treatise,\r\ncalled Bharata, O foremost one of Bharatas race, are to be seen in one\r\nplace the eternal Rudras, the Saddhyas, and the Viswedevas; the Adityas,\r\nthe two deities named the Ashvinis, the regents of the World, the great\r\nRishis, the Guhyakas, the Gandharvas, the Nagas, the Vidyadharas, the\r\nSiddhas, the diverse deities, the Self-born visible in a body, with many\r\nascetics; the Hills and Mountains, Oceans and Seas and Rivers, the\r\ndiverse tribes of Apsaras; the Planets, the Years, the Half-years, and\r\nthe Seasons; and the whole universe of mobile and immobile entities, with\r\nall the gods and Asuras.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing their celebrity, and in consequence of a recitation of their\r\nnames and achievements, a man that has committed even terrible sins, will\r\nbe cleansed. Having, with a concentrated soul and cleansed body, heard\r\nthis history duly, from the beginning, and having reached its end, one\r\nshould make Sraddha offerings, O Bharata, unto those (foremost of persons\r\nwho have been mentioned in it). Unto the Brahmanas also, O chief of\r\nBharatas race, should, with due devotion and according to ones power, be\r\nmade large gifts and diverse kinds of gems, and kine, and vessels of\r\nwhite brass for milking kine, and maidens decked with every ornament, and\r\npossessed of every accomplishment suited to enjoyment, as also diverse\r\nkinds of conveyances, beautiful mansions, plots of land, and cloths.\r\nAnimals also should be given, such as horses and elephants in rage, and\r\nbeds, and covered conveyances borne on the shoulders of men, and\r\nwell-decked cars. Whatever objects occur in the house, of the foremost\r\nkind, whatever wealth of great value occurs in it, should be given away\r\nunto Brahmanas. Indeed, one should give away ones own self, wives, and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\"One desirous of hearing the Bharata, should hear it without a doubting\r\nheart, with cheerfulness and joy; and as, he proceeds listening to its\r\nrecitation, he should according to the extent of his power, make gifts\r\nwith great devotion.\r\n\r\n\"Hear how a person that is devoted to truth and sincerity, that is\r\nself-restrained, pure (in mind), and observant of those acts which lead\r\nto purity of body, that is endued with faith, and that has subjugated\r\nwrath, attains to success (in the matter of a recitation of the Bharata).\r\nHe should appoint as reciter one that is pure (of body), that is endued\r\nwith good and pious conduct, that should be robed in white, that should\r\nhave a complete mastery over his passions, that is cleansed of all\r\noffences, that is conversant with every branch of learning, that is\r\nendued with faith, that is free from malice, that is possessed of\r\nhandsome features, that is blessed, self-restrained, truthful, and with\r\npassions under control, and that is beloved of all for the gifts he makes\r\nand the honours of which he is the possessor.\r\n\r\n\"The reciter, seated at his ease, free from all bodily complaints, and\r\nwith rapt attention, should recite the text without too much slowness,\r\nwithout a labouring voice, without being fast or quick, quietly, with\r\nsufficient energy, without confusing the letters and words together, in a\r\nsweet intonation and with such accent and emphasis as would indicate the\r\nsense giving full utterance to the three and sixty letters of the\r\nalphabet from the eight places of their formation. Bowing unto Narayana,\r\nand to Nara, that foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati,\r\nshould the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Listening to the Bharata, O king, when recited, O thou of Bharatas race,\r\nby a reader of this kind, the listener, observant of vows all the while\r\nand cleansed by purificatory rites, acquires valuable fruits. When the\r\nfirst Parana is reached, the hearer should gratify Brahmanas with\r\npresents of all desirable objects. By doing this, one obtains the fruits\r\nof the Agnishtoma sacrifice. He acquires a large (celestial) car teeming\r\nwith diverse orders of Apsaras (that wait upon him). With a glad heart,\r\nand with the deities in his company, he proceeds to Heaven, his heart\r\nrapt (in felicity).\r\n\r\n\"When the second Parana is reached, the hearer acquires the fruits of the\r\nAtiratra vow. Indeed, he ascends a celestial car made entirely of\r\nprecious gems. Wearing celestial garlands and robes, and decked with\r\ncelestial unguents and always shedding a celestial fragrance around, he\r\nreceives high honours in Heaven.\r\n\r\n\"When the third Parana is reached, he acquires the fruits of the\r\nDwadasaha vow. Indeed be resides in Heaven for myriads of years, like a\r\ngod.\r\n\r\n\"At the fourth Parana he acquires the fruits of the Vajapeya sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"At the fifth, twice those fruits are his. Ascending a celestial car that\r\nresembles the rising sun or a blazing fire, and with the deities for his\r\ncompanions, he goes to Heaven and sports in felicity for myriads of years\r\nin the abode of Indra.\r\n\r\n\"At the sixth Parana, twice, and at the seventh, thrice those fruits\r\nbecome his. Ascending a celestial car that resembles the summit of the\r\nKailasa mountains (in beauty), that is equipt with an altar made of\r\nstones of lapis lazuli and other precious gems, that is surrounded by\r\nbeautiful objects of diverse kinds, that is decked with gems and corals,\r\nthat moves at the will of the rider, and that teems with waiting Apsaras,\r\nhe roves through all the regions of felicity, like a second deity of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\n\"At the eight Parana, he acquires the fruits of the Rajasuya sacrifice.\r\nHe ascends a car as beautiful as the rising moon, and unto which are\r\nyoked steeds white as the rays of the moon and endued with the speed of\r\nthought. He is served by women of the foremost beauty and whose faces are\r\nmore charming than the moon. He hears the music of the garlands that\r\nencircle their waists and the Nupuras encircling their ankles. Sleeping\r\nwith his head resting on the laps of women of transcendent beauty, he\r\nawakes greatly refreshed.\r\n\r\n\"At the ninth Parana, he acquires, O Bharata, the fruits of that foremost\r\nof sacrifices, viz., the Horse-sacrifice. Ascending on a car equipt with\r\na chamber consisting of a top supported by columns of gold, furnished\r\nwith a seat made of stones of lapis lazuli, with windows on all sides\r\nmade of pure gold, and teeming with waiting Apsaras and Gandharvas and\r\nother celestials, he blazes forth in splendour. Wearing celestial\r\ngarlands and robes, and decked with celestial unguents, he sports in\r\nbliss, with deities for his companions, in Heaven, like a second deity\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Reaching the tenth Parana and gratifying Brahmanas, he acquires a car\r\nwhich tinkles with innumerable bells, which is decked with flags and\r\nbanners, which is equipt with a seat made of precious gems, which has\r\nmany arches made of lapis lazuli, which has a net-work of gold all round,\r\nwhich has turrets made of corals, which is adorned with Gandharvas and\r\nApsaras well-skilled in singing, and which is fit for the residence of\r\nthe Righteous. Crowned with a diadem of the complexion of fire, decked\r\nwith ornaments of gold, his person smeared with celestial sandalpaste,\r\ngarnished with celestial wreaths, he roves through all celestial regions,\r\nenjoying all celestial objects of enjoyment, and endued with great\r\nsplendour, through the grace of the deities.\r\n\r\n\"Thus accoutred, he receives high honours in Heaven for many long years.\r\nWith Gandharvas in his company, for full 21,000 years, he sports in bliss\r\nwith Indra himself in abode of Indra. He roves at pleasure every day\r\nthrough the diverse regions of the gods, riding on celestial cars and\r\nconveyances, and surrounded by celestial damsels of transcendent beauty.\r\nHe is able to go to the abode of the solar deity, of the lunar deity, and\r\nof Siva, O king. Indeed, he succeeds in living in the same region with\r\nVishnu himself. It is even so, O monarch. There is no doubt in this. A\r\nperson listening with faith, becomes even so. My preceptor has said this.\r\nUnto the reciter should be given all such objects as he may wish.\r\nElephants and steeds and cars and conveyances, especially animals and the\r\nvehicles they draw, a bracelet of gold, a pair of ear-rings, sacred\r\nthreads, beautiful robes, and perfumes in especial (should be given). By\r\nworshipping him as a deity one attains to the regions of Vishnu.\r\n\r\n\"After this I shall declare what should be given away, as each parva is\r\nreached of the Bharata in course of its recitation, unto brahmanas, after\r\nascertaining their birth, country, truthfulness, and greatness, O chief\r\nof Bharatas race, as also their inclination for piety, and unto\r\nkshatriyas too, O king, after ascertainment of similar particulars.\r\nCausing the Brahmanas to utter benedictions, the business of recitation\r\nshould be begun. When a parva is finished, the brahmanas should be\r\nworshipped to the best of ones power. At first, the reciter, clad in good\r\nrobes and smeared with perfumed paste, should, O king, be duly fed with\r\nhoney and frumenty of the best kind.\r\n\r\n\"When the Astika-parva is being recited, brahmanas should be entertained\r\nwith fruits and roots, and frumenty, and honey and clarified butter, and\r\nrice boiled with raw sugar.\r\n\r\n\"When the Sabha-parva is being recited, brahmanas should be fed with\r\nhabisya along with apupas and pupas and modakas, O king.\r\n\r\n\"When the Aranyaka-parva is being recited, superior brahmanas should be\r\nfed with fruits and roots.\r\n\r\n\"When the Arani-parva is reached, water-pots full of water should be\r\ngiven away. Many superior kinds of delicious food, also rice and fruits\r\nand roots, and food possessed of every agreeable attribute, should be\r\npresented unto the brahmanas.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Virata-parva diverse kinds of robes should\r\nbe given away; and during that of the Udyoga-parva, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, the twice-born ones, after being decked with perfumes and\r\ngarlands, should be entertained with food possessed of every agreeable\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Bhishma-parva, O king of kings, after\r\ngiving them excellent cars and conveyances, food should be given that is\r\npure and well-cooked and possessed of every desirable attribute.\r\n\r\n\"During the Drona-parva food of very superior kind should be given to\r\nlearned brahmanas, as also beds, O monarch, and bows and good swords.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Karna-parva, food of the foremost kind,\r\nbesides being pure and well-cooked, should be presented unto the\r\nbrahmanas by the house-holder with rapt mind.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Shalya-parva, O king of kings, food with\r\nconfectionery and rice boiled with raw sugar, as also cakes of wheat and\r\nsoothing and nutritive viands and drinks should be presented.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Gada-parva, brahmanas should be entertained\r\nwith food mixed with mudga.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Stri-parva, foremost of brahmanas should be\r\nentertained with gems and precious stones; and during the recitation of\r\nthe Aishika-parva, rice boiled in ghee should first be given, and then\r\nfood pure and well-cooked, and possessed of every desirable quality,\r\nshould be presented.\r\n\r\n\"During the recitation of the Shanti-parva, the brahmanas should be fed\r\nwith havisya.\r\n\r\n\"When the Asvamedhika-parva is reached, food possessed of every agreeable\r\nquality should be given; and when the Asramvasika is reached, brahmanas\r\nshould be entertained with havisya.\r\n\r\n\"When the Mausala is reached, scents and garlands possessed of agreeable\r\nqualities should be given away.\r\n\r\n\"During the Mahaprasthanika, similar presents should be made, possessed\r\nof every quality of an agreeable kind.\r\n\r\n\"When the Svarga-parva is reached, the brahmanas should be fed with\r\nhavisya.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the conclusion of the Harivansa, a 1,000 brahmanas should be fed.\r\nUnto each of them should be presented a cow accompanied with a piece of\r\ngold. Half of this should be presented to each poor man, O king.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the conclusion of all the Parvas, the house-holder of wisdom should\r\ngive unto the reciter a copy of the Mahabharata with a piece of gold.\r\nWhen the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with\r\nfrumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the\r\nParvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing\r\ngarlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a\r\ncopy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece\r\nof silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and\r\ngarlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of\r\nthis treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated\r\nmind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and\r\ngarlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold\r\nand other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should\r\nthen be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,\r\nadorning the persons of some foremost of Brahmanas with scents and\r\ngarlands, they should be gratified with diverse kinds of gifts of\r\nenjoyable and very superior or costly articles. By doing this, one\r\nattains to the merits of the Atiratra sacrifice. Indeed, at each\r\nsuccessive Parva, he acquires the merits that attach to the performance\r\nof a sacrifice. The reciter, O chief of the Bharatas, should be possessed\r\nof learning and endued with a good voice and a clear utterance respecting\r\nboth letters and words. Even such a man should, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\nrecite the Bharata. After entertaining a number of foremost Brahmanas,\r\npresents should be made unto them according to the ordinances. The\r\nreciter also, O chief of the Bharatas, should be decked with ornaments\r\nand fed sumptuously. The reciter being gratified, the house-holder\r\nattains to an excellent and auspicious contentment. If the Brahmanas are\r\ngratified, all the deities are gratified. After this, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, Brahmanas should be duly entertained with diverse kinds of\r\nenjoyable articles and superior things.\r\n\r\n\"I have thus indicated the ordinances, O foremost of men, (about the\r\nmanner of reciting these scriptures) in answer to thy enquiries. Thou\r\nshouldst observe them with faith. In listening to a recitation of the\r\nBharata and at each Parana, O best of kings, one that desires to attain\r\nto the highest good should listen with the greatest care and attention.\r\nOne should listen to the Bharata every day. One should proclaim the\r\nmerits of the Bharata every day. One in whose house the Bharata occurs,\r\nhas in his hands all those scriptures which are known by the name of\r\nJaya. The Bharata is cleansing and sacred. In the Bharata are diverse\r\ntopics. The Bharata is worshipped by the very gods. The Bharata is the\r\nhighest goal. The Bharata, O chief of the Bharatas, is the foremost of\r\nall scriptures. One attains to Emancipation through the Bharata. This\r\nthat I tell thee is certain truth. One that proclaims the merits of this\r\nhistory called the Mahabharata, of the Earth, of the cow, of Sarasvati\r\n(the goddess of speech), of Brahmanas, and of Keshava, has never to\r\nlanguish.\r\n\r\n\"In the Vedas, in the Ramayana, and in the sacred Bharata, O chief of\r\nBharatas race, Hari is sung in the beginning, the middle, and at the end.\r\nThat in which occur excellent statements relating to Vishnu, and the\r\neternal Srutis, should be listened to by men desirous of attaining to the\r\nhighest goal. This treatise is sanctifying. This is the highest indicator\r\nas regards duties; this is endued with every merit. One desirous of\r\nprosperity should listen to it. Sins committed by means of the body, by\r\nmeans of words, and by means of the mind, are all destroyed (through\r\nlistening to the Bharata) as Darkness at sunrise. One devoted to Vishnu\r\nacquires (through this) that merit which is acquired by listening to the\r\neighteen Puranas. There is no doubt in this. Men and women (by listening\r\nto this) would certainly attain to the status of Vishnu. Women desirous\r\nof having children should certainly listen to this which proclaims the\r\nfame of Vishnu. One desirous of attaining to the fruits that attach to a\r\nrecitation of the Bharata should, according to ones power, give unto the\r\nreciter Dakshina, as also an honorarium in gold. One desirous of ones own\r\ngood should give unto the reciter a Kapila cow with horns cased in gold\r\nand accompanied by her calf, covered with a cloth. Ornaments, O chief of\r\nBharatas race, for the arms, as also those for the ears, should be given.\r\nBesides these, other kinds of wealth should be presented. Unto the\r\nreciter, O king of men, gift of land should be made. No gift like that of\r\nland could ever be or will be. The man that listens (to the Bharata) or\r\nthat recites it to other people, becomes cleansed of all his sins and\r\nattains at last to the status of Vishnu. Such a man rescues his ancestors\r\nto the eleventh degree, as also himself with his wives and sons, O chief\r\nof Bharatas race. After concluding a recitation of the Bharata, one\r\nshould, O king, perform a Homa with all its ten parts.\r\n\r\n\"I have thus, O chief of men, told everything in thy presence. He that\r\nlistens with devotion to this Bharata from the beginning becomes cleansed\r\nof every sin even if he be guilty of Brahmanicide or the violation of his\r\npreceptors bed, or even if he be a drinker of alcohol or a robber of\r\nother peoples wares, or even if he be born in the Chandala order.\r\nDestroying all his sins like the maker of day destroying darkness, such a\r\nman, without doubt, sports in felicity in the region of Vishnu like\r\nVishnu himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe End of the Svargarohanika-parva\r\n\r\nThe Eighteen parvas of the Mahabharata are thus complete\r\n"
