Having bowed down unto Narayana and Nara, the most exalted of male\r\nbeings, and the goddess Sarasvati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"After Karna had thus been slain in battle by Savyasaci,\r\nwhat did the small (unslaughtered) remnant of the Kauravas do, O\r\nregenerate one? Beholding the army of the Pandavas swelling with might\r\nand energy, what behaviour did the Kuru prince Suyodhana adopt towards\r\nthe Pandavas, thinking it suitable to the hour? I desire to hear all\r\nthis. Tell me, O foremost of regenerate ones, I am never satiated with\r\nlistening to the grand feats of my ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After the fall of Karna, O king, Dhritarashtra's son\r\nSuyodhana was plunged deep into an ocean of grief and saw despair on\r\nevery side. Indulging in incessant lamentations, saying, 'Alas, oh Karna!\r\nAlas, oh Karna!' he proceeded with great difficulty to his camp,\r\naccompanied by the unslaughtered remnant of the kings on his side.\r\nThinking of the slaughter of the Suta's son, he could not obtain peace of\r\nmind, though comforted by those kings with excellent reasons inculcated\r\nby the scriptures. Regarding destiny and necessity to be all-powerful,\r\nthe Kuru king firmly resolved on battle. Having duly made Shalya the\r\ngeneralissimo of his forces, that bull among kings, O monarch, proceeded\r\nfor battle, accompanied by that unslaughtered remnant of his forces.\r\nThen, O chief of Bharata's race, a terrible battle took place between the\r\ntroops of the Kurus and those of the Pandavas, resembling that between\r\nthe gods and the Asuras. Then Shalya, O monarch, having made a great\r\ncarnage in battle at last lost a large number of his troops and was slain\r\nby Yudhishthira at midday. Then king Duryodhana, having lost all his\r\nfriends and kinsmen, fled away from the field of battle and penetrated\r\ninto the depths of a terrible lake from fear of his enemies. On the\r\nafternoon of that day, Bhimasena, causing the lake to be encompassed by\r\nmany mighty car-warriors, summoned Duryodhana and having obliged him to\r\ncome out, slew him speedily, putting forth his strength. After\r\nDuryodhana's slaughter, the three car-warriors (of the Kuru side) that\r\nwere still unslain (Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma), filled with\r\nrage, O monarch, slaughtered the Pancala troops in the night. On the next\r\nmorning Sanjaya, having set out from the camp, entered the city (the Kuru\r\ncapital), cheerless and filled with grief and sorrow. Having entered the\r\ncity, the Suta Sanjaya, raising his arms in grief, and with limbs\r\ntrembling, entered the palace of the king. Filled with grief, O tiger\r\namong men, he wept aloud, saying, 'Alas, O king! Alas, all of us are\r\nruined by the slaughter of that high-souled monarch. Alas, Time is\r\nall-powerful, and crooked in his course, since all our allies, endued\r\nwith might equal to that of Shakra himself, have been slain by the\r\nPandavas.' Seeing Sanjaya come back to the city, O king, in that\r\ndistressful plight, all the people, O best of kings, filled with great\r\nanxiety, wept loudly, saying, 'Alas, O king! The whole city, O tiger\r\namong men, including the very children, hearing of Duryodhana's death,\r\nsent forth notes of lamentation from every side. We then beheld all the\r\nmen and women running about, deeply afflicted with grief, their senses\r\ngone, and resembling people that are demented.' The Suta Sanjaya then,\r\ndeeply agitated, entered the abode of the king and beheld that foremost\r\nof monarchs, that lord of men, having wisdom for his eyes. Beholding the\r\nsinless monarch, that chief of Bharata's race, seated, surrounded by his\r\ndaughters-in-law and Gandhari and Vidura and by other friends and kinsmen\r\nthat were always his well-wishers, and engaged in thinking on that very\r\nsubject--the death of Karna--the Suta Sanjaya, with heart filled with\r\ngrief, O Janamejaya, weepingly and in a voice choked with tears, said\r\nunto him, 'I am Sanjaya, O tiger among men. I bow to thee, O bull of\r\nBharata's race. The ruler of the Madras, Shalya, hath been slain.\r\nSimilarly, Subala's son Shakuni, and Uluka, O tiger among men, that\r\nvaliant son of the gamester (Shakuni), have been slain. All the\r\nSamsaptakas, the Kambojas together with the Sakas, the Mlecchas, the\r\nMountaineers, and the Yavanas, have also been slain. The Easterners have\r\nbeen slain, O monarch, and all the Southerners. The Northerners have all\r\nbeen slain, as also the Westerners, O ruler of men. All the kings and all\r\nthe princes have been slain, O monarch. King Duryodhana also has been\r\nslain by the son of Pandu after the manner he had vowed. With his thighs\r\nbroken, O monarch, he lieth now on the dust, covered with blood.\r\nDhrishtadyumna also hath been slain, O king, as also the vanquished\r\nShikhandi. Uttamauja and Yudhamanyu, O king, and the Prabhadrakas, and\r\nthose tiger among men, the Pancalas, and the Cedis, have been destroyed.\r\nThe sons have all been slain as also the (five) sons of Draupadi, O\r\nBharata. The heroic and mighty son of Karna, Vrishasena, hath been slain.\r\nAll the men that had been assembled have been slain. All the elephants\r\nhave been destroyed. All the car-warriors, O tiger among men, and all the\r\nsteeds, have fallen in battle. Very few are alive on thy side, O lord. In\r\nconsequence of the Pandavas and the Kauravas having encountered each\r\nother, the world, stupefied by Time, now consists of only women. On the\r\nside of the Pandavas seven are alive, they are the five Pandava brothers,\r\nand Vasudeva, and Satyaki and amongst the Dhartarashtras three are so,\r\nKripa, Kritavarma, and Drona's son, that foremost of victors. These three\r\ncar-warriors, O monarch, are all that survive, O best of kings, of all\r\nthe akshauhinis mustered on thy side, O ruler of men. These are the\r\nsurvivors, O monarch, the rest have perished. Making Duryodhana and his\r\nhostility (towards the Pandavas) the cause, the world, it seems, hath\r\nbeen destroyed, O bull of Bharata's race, by Time.'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing these cruel words, Dhritarashtra, that\r\nruler of men, fell down, O monarch, on the earth, deprived of his senses.\r\nAs soon as the king fell down, Vidura also, of great fame, O monarch,\r\nafflicted with sorrow on account of the king's distress, fell down on the\r\nearth. Gandhari also, O best of kings, and all the Kuru ladies, suddenly\r\nfell down on the ground, hearing those cruel words. That entire conclave\r\nof royal persons remained lying on the ground, deprived of their senses\r\nand raving deliriously, like figures painted on a large piece of canvas.\r\nThen king Dhritarashtra, that lord of earth, afflicted with the calamity\r\nrepresented by the death of his sons, slowly and with difficulty regained\r\nhis life-breaths. Having recovered his senses, the king, with trembling\r\nlimbs and sorrowful heart, turned his face on every side, and said these\r\nwords unto Kshattri (Vidura). 'O learned Kshattri, O thou of great\r\nwisdom, thou, O bull of Bharata's race, art now my refuge. I am lordless\r\nand destitute of all my sons.' Having said this, he once more fell down,\r\ndeprived of his senses. Beholding him fallen, all his kinsmen that were\r\npresent there sprinkled cold water over him and fanned him with fans.\r\nComforted after a long while, that lord of earth, afflicted with sorrow\r\non account of the death of his sons, remained silent, sighing heavily, O\r\nmonarch, like a snake put into a jar. Sanjaya also wept aloud, beholding\r\nthe king so afflicted. All the ladies too, with Gandhari of great\r\ncelebrity, did the same. After a long while, O best of men,\r\nDhritarashtra, having repeatedly swooned, addressed Vidura, saying, 'Let\r\nall the ladies retire, as also Gandhari of great fame, and all these\r\nfriends. My mind hath become greatly unsettled.' Thus addressed, Vidura,\r\nrepeatedly trembling, slowly dismissed the ladies, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace. All those ladies retired, O chief of the Bharatas, as also all\r\nthose friends, beholding the king deeply afflicted. Then Sanjaya\r\ncheerlessly looked at the king, O scorcher of foes, who, having recovered\r\nhis senses, was weeping in great affliction. With joined hands, Vidura\r\nthen, in sweet words, comforted that ruler of men who was sighing\r\nincessantly.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After the ladies had been dismissed, Dhritarashtra,\r\nthe son of Ambika, plunged into grief greater than that which had\r\nafflicted him before, began, O monarch, to indulge in lamentations,\r\nexhaling breaths that resembled smoke, and repeatedly waving his arms,\r\nand reflecting a little, O monarch, he said these words.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Alas, O Suta, the intelligence is fraught with\r\ngreat grief that I hear from thee, that the Pandavas are all safe and\r\nhave suffered no loss in battle. Without doubt, my hard heart is made of\r\nthe essence of thunder, since it breaketh not upon hearing of the fall of\r\nmy sons. Thinking of their ages, O Sanjaya, and of their sports in\r\nchildhood, and learning today that all of them have perished, my heart\r\nseems to break into pieces. Although in consequence of my blindness I\r\nnever saw their forms, still I cherished a great love for them in\r\nconsequence of the affection one feels for his children. Hearing that\r\nthey had passed out of childhood and entered the period of youth and then\r\nof early manhood, I became exceedingly glad, O sinless one. Hearing today\r\nthat have been slain and divested of prosperity and energy, I fail to\r\nobtain peace of mind, being overwhelmed with grief on account of the\r\ndistress that has overtaken them. Come, come, O king of kings\r\n(Duryodhana) to me that am without a protector now! Deprived of thee, O\r\nmighty-armed one, what will be my plight? Why, O sire, abandoning all the\r\nassembled kings dost thou lie on the bare ground, deprived of life, like\r\nan ordinary and wretched king? Having been, O monarch, the refuge of\r\nkinsmen and friends, where dost thou go now, O hero, abandoning me that\r\nam blind and old? Where now, O king, is that compassion of thine, that\r\nlove, and that respectfulness? Invincible as thou wert in battle, how,\r\nalas, hast thou been slain by the Parthas? Who will now, after I will\r\nhave waked from sleep at the proper hour, repeatedly address me in such\r\nendearing and respectful words as, \"O father, O father,\" \"O great king,\"\r\n\"O Lord of the world\" and affectionately clasping my neck with moistened\r\neyes, will seek my orders, saying, \"Command me, O thou of Kuru's race.\"\r\nAddress me, O son, in that sweet language once more. O dear child, I\r\nheard even these words from thy lips, \"This wide earth is as much ours as\r\nit is of Pritha's son. Bhagadatta and Kripa and Shalya and the two\r\nprinces of Avanti and Jayadratha and Bhurishrava and Sala and Somadatta\r\nand Bahlika and Ashvatthama and the chief of the Bhojas and the mighty\r\nprince of Magadha and Vrihadvala and the ruler of the Kasi and Shakuni\r\nthe son of Subala and many thousands of Mlecchas and Sakas and Yavanas,\r\nand Sudakshina the ruler of the Kambojas and the king of the Trigartas\r\nand the grandsire Bhishma and Bharadwaja's son and Gotama's son (Kripa)\r\nand Srutayush and Ayutayush and Satayush of great energy, and Jalasandha\r\nand Rishyasringa's son and the Rakshasa Alayudha, and the mighty-armed\r\nAlambusa and the great car-warrior Subala--these and numerous other\r\nkings, O best of monarchs, have taken up arms for my sake, prepared to\r\ncast away their very lives in great battle, stationed on the field amidst\r\nthese, and surrounded by my brothers, I will fight against all the\r\nParthas and the Pancalas and the Cedis, O tiger among kings, and the sons\r\nof Draupadi and Satyaki and Kunti-Bhoja and the rakshasa Ghatotkaca. Even\r\none amongst these, O king, excited with rage, is able to resist in battle\r\nthe Pandavas rushing towards him. What need I say then of all these\r\nheroes, every one of whom has wrong to avenge on the Pandavas, when\r\nunited together? All these, O monarch, will fight with the followers of\r\nthe Pandavas and will slay them in battle. Karna alone, with myself, will\r\nslay the Pandavas. All the heroic kings will then live under my sway. He,\r\nwho is their leader, the mighty Vasudeva, will not, he has told me, put\r\non mail for them, O king.\" Even in this way, O Suta, did Duryodhana often\r\nuse to speak to me. Hearing what he said, I believed that the Pandavas\r\nwould be slain in battle. When, however, my sons stationed in the midst\r\nof those heroes and exerting themselves vigorously in battle have all\r\nbeen slain, what can it be but destiny? When that lord of the world, the\r\nvaliant Bhishma, having encountered Shikhandi, met with his death like a\r\nlion meeting with his at the hands of a jackal, what can it be but\r\ndestiny? When the Brahmana Drona, that master of all weapons offensive\r\nand defensive, has been slain by the Pandavas in battle, what can it be\r\nbut destiny? When Bhurishrava has been slain in battle, as also Somadatta\r\nand king Bahlika, what can it be but destiny? When Bhagadatta, skilled in\r\nfight from the backs of elephants, has been slain, and when Jayadratha\r\nhath been slain, what can it be but destiny? When Sudakshina has been\r\nslain, and Jalasandha of Puru's race, as also Srutayush, and Ayutayush,\r\nwhat can it be but destiny? When the mighty Pandya, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons, has been slain in battle by the Pandavas, what can\r\nit be but destiny? When Vrihadvala has been slain and the mighty king of\r\nthe Magadhas, and the valiant Ugrayudha, that type of all bowmen; when\r\nthe two princes of Avanti (Vinda and Anuvinda) have been slain, and the\r\nruler also of the Trigartas, as also numerous Samsaptakas, what can it be\r\nbut destiny? When king Alambusa, and the Rakshasas Alayudha, and\r\nRishyasringa's son, have been slain, what can it be but destiny? When the\r\nNarayanas have been slain, as also the Gopalas, those troops that were\r\ninvincible in battle, and many thousands of Mlecchas, what can it be but\r\ndestiny? When Shakuni, the son of Subala, and the mighty Uluka, called\r\nthe gamester's son, that hero at the head of his forces, have been slain,\r\nwhat can it be but destiny? When innumerable high-souled heroes,\r\naccomplished in all kinds of weapons offensive and defensive and endued\r\nwith prowess equal to that of Shakra himself, have been slain, O Suta,\r\nwhen Kshatriyas hailing from diverse realms, O Sanjaya, have all been\r\nslain in battle, what can it be but destiny? Endued with great might, my\r\nsons and grandsons have been slain, as also my friends and brethren, what\r\ncan it be but destiny? Without doubt, man takes his birth, subject to\r\ndestiny. That man who is possessed of good fortune meets with good. I am\r\nbereft of good fortune, and, therefore, am deprived of my children, O\r\nSanjaya. Old as I am, how shall I now submit to the sway of enemies? I do\r\nnot think anything other than exile into the woods to be good for me, O\r\nlord. Deprived of relatives and kinsmen as I am, I will go into the\r\nwoods. Nothing other than an exile into the woods can be better for me\r\nwho am fallen into this plight and who am shorn of my wings, O Sanjaya.\r\nWhen Duryodhana had been slain, when Shalya has been slain, when\r\nDuhshasana and Vivingsati and the mighty Vikarna have been slain, how\r\nshall I be able to bear the roars of that Bhimasena who hath alone slain\r\na hundred sons of mine in battle? He will frequently speak of the\r\nslaughter of Duryodhana in my hearing. Burning with grief and sorrow, I\r\nshall not be able to bear his cruel words.'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Even thus that king, burning with grief and\r\ndeprived of relatives and kinsmen, repeatedly swooned, overwhelmed with\r\nsorrow on account of the death of his sons. Having wept for a long while,\r\nDhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, breathed heavy and hot sighs at the\r\nthought of his defeat. Overwhelmed with sorrow, and burning with grief,\r\nthat bull of Bharata's race once more enquired of his charioteer Sanjaya,\r\nthe son of Gavalgana, the details of what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Bhishma and Drona had been slain, and the\r\nSuta's son also overthrown, whom did my warriors make their\r\ngeneralissimo? The Pandavas are slaying without any delay everyone whom\r\nmy warriors are making their generalissimo in battle. Bhishma was slain\r\nat the van of battle by the diadem-decked Arjuna in the very sight of all\r\nof you. Even thus was Drona slain in the sight of all of you. Even thus\r\nwas the Suta's son, that valiant Karna, slain by Arjuna in the sight of\r\nall the kings. Long before, the high-souled Vidura had told me that\r\nthrough the fault of Duryodhana the population of the Earth would be\r\nexterminated. There are some fools that do not see things even though\r\nthey cast their eyes on them. Those words of Vidura have been even so\r\nunto my foolish self. What Vidura of righteous soul, conversant with\r\nattributes of everything, then said, hath turned out exactly, for the\r\nwords he uttered were nothing but the truth. Afflicted by fate, I did not\r\nthen act according to those words. The fruits of that evil course have\r\nnow manifested themselves. Describe them to me, O son of Gavalgana, once\r\nmore! Who became the head of our army after Karna's fall? Who was that\r\ncar-warrior who proceeded against Arjuna and Vasudeva? Who were they that\r\nprotected the right wheel of the ruler of the Madras in battle? Who\r\nprotected the left wheel of that hero when he went to battle? Who also\r\nguarded his rear? How, when all of you were together, could the mighty\r\nking of the Madras, as also my son, be slain, O Sanjaya, by the Pandavas?\r\nTell me the details of the great destruction of the Bharatas. Tell me how\r\nmy son Duryodhana fell in battle. Tell me how all the Pancalas with their\r\nfollowers, and Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the five sons of\r\nDraupadi, fell. Tell me how the (five) Pandavas and the two Satwatas\r\n(Krishna and Satyaki), and Kripa and Kritavarma and Drona's son, have\r\nescaped with life. I desire to hear everything about the manner in which\r\nthe battle occurred and the kind of battle it was. Thou art skilled, O\r\nSanjaya, in narration. Tell me everything.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with attention, how that great carnage of\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas occurred when they encountered each other.\r\nAfter the Suta's son had been slain by the illustrious son of Pandu, and\r\nafter thy troops had been repeatedly rallied and had repeatedly fled\r\naway, and after a terrible carnage had taken place, O foremost of men, of\r\nhuman beings in battle subsequent to Karna's death, Partha began to utter\r\nleonine roars. At that time a great fear entered the hearts of thy sons.\r\nIndeed, after Karna's death, there was no warrior in thy army who could\r\nset his heart upon rallying the troops or displaying his prowess. They\r\nthen looked like ship-wrecked merchants on the fathomless ocean without a\r\nraft to save themselves. When their protector was slain by the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, they were like persons on the wide sea desirous of\r\nreaching some shore of safety. Indeed, O king, after the slaughter of the\r\nSuta's son, thy troops, struck with panic and mangled with arrows, were\r\nlike unprotected men desirous of a protector or like a herd of deer\r\nafflicted by a lion. Vanquished by Savyasaci, they retired in the evening\r\nlike bulls with broken horns or snakes shorn of their fangs. Their\r\nforemost of heroes slain, themselves thrown into confusion and mangled\r\nwith keen arrows, thy sons, O king, upon the slaughter of the Suta's son,\r\nfled away in fear. Deprived of weapons and coats of mail, all of them\r\nlost their senses and knew not in which direction to fly. Casting their\r\neyes on all sides in fear, many of them began to slaughter one another.\r\nMany fell down or became pale, thinking, \"It is me whom Vibhatsu is\r\npursuing!\" \"It is me whom Vrikodara is pursuing!\" Some riding on fleet\r\nsteeds, some on fleet cars, and some on fleet elephants, many great\r\ncar-warriors fled away from fear, abandoning the foot-soldiers. Cars were\r\nbroken by elephants, horsemen were crushed by great car-warriors, and\r\nbands of foot-soldiers were smashed and slain by bodies of horses as\r\nthese fled away from the field. After the fall of the Suta's son, thy\r\ntroops became like stragglers from a caravan in a forest abounding with\r\nrobbers and beasts of prey. Some elephants whose riders had been slain,\r\nand others whose trunks had been cut off, afflicted with fear, beheld the\r\nwhole world to be full of Partha. Beholding his troops flying away\r\nafflicted with the fear of Bhimasena Duryodhana then, with cries of \"Oh!\"\r\nand \"Alas!\" addressed his driver, saying, \"If I take up my post at the\r\nrear of the army, armed with my bow, Partha then will never be able to\r\ntransgress me. Urge the steeds, therefore, with speed. When I will put\r\nforth my valour in battle, Dhananjaya the son of Kunti will not venture\r\nto transgress me like the ocean never venturing to transgress its\r\ncontinents. Today, slaying Arjuna with Govinda, and the proud Vrikodara,\r\nand the rest of my foes, I will free myself from the debt I owe to\r\nKarna.\" Hearing these words of the Kuru king, so becoming a hero and an\r\nhonourable man, his driver slowly urged those steeds adorned with\r\ntrappings of gold. At that time many brave warriors deprived of elephants\r\nand steeds and cars, and 25,000 foot-soldiers, O sire, proceeded slowly\r\n(for battle). Then Bhimasena, filled with wrath, and Dhrishtadyumna the\r\nson of Prishata, encompassing those troops with the assistance of four\r\nkinds of forces, destroyed them with shafts. All of them fought\r\nvigorously with Bhima and Prishata's son. Many amongst them challenged\r\nthe two Pandava heroes, mentioning their names. Surrounded by them in\r\nbattle, Bhima became enraged with them. Quickly descending from his car,\r\nhe began to fight, armed with his mace. Relying on the might of his own\r\narms, Vrikodara the son of Kunti, who was on his car, observant of the\r\nrules of fair fight, did not fight with those foes who were on the\r\nground. Armed then with that heavy mace of his that was made entirely of\r\niron and adorned with gold and equipped with a sling, and that resembled\r\nthe Destroyer himself as he becomes at the end of Yuga, Bhima slew them\r\nall like Yama slaughtering creatures with his club. Those foot-soldiers,\r\nexcited with great rage, having lost their friends and kinsmen, were\r\nprepared to throw away their lives, and rushed in that battle towards\r\nBhima like insects towards a blazing fire. Indeed, those warriors, filled\r\nwith rage and invincible in battle, approaching Bhimasena, suddenly\r\nperished like living creatures at the glance of the Destroyer. Armed with\r\nsword and mace, Bhima careered like a hawk and slaughtered those 25,000\r\nwarriors of thine. Having slain that brave division, the mighty Bhima, of\r\nprowess incapable of being baffled, once more stood, with Dhrishtadyumna\r\nbefore him. Meanwhile, Dhananjaya of great energy proceeded towards the\r\ncar-division (of the Kurus). The twin sons of Madri and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki, all endued with great strength, cheerfully rushed\r\nagainst Shakuni with great speed from desire of slaying him. Having slain\r\nwith keen shafts the numerous cavalry of Shakuni, those Pandava heroes\r\nquickly rushed against Shakuni himself, whereupon a fierce battle was\r\nfought there. Then Dhananjaya, O king, penetrated into the midst of the\r\ncar-division of the Kauravas, stretching his bow Gandiva celebrated over\r\nthe three worlds. Beholding that car having white steeds yoked unto it\r\nand owning Krishna for its driver coming towards them, with Arjuna as the\r\nwarrior on it, thy troops fled away in fear. Deprived of cars and steeds\r\nand pierced with shafts from every side, 25,000 foot-soldiers proceeded\r\ntowards Partha and surrounded him. Then that mighty car-warrior amongst\r\nthe Pancalas (Dhrishtadyumna) with Bhimasena at his head, speedily slew\r\nthat brave division and stood triumphant. The son of the Pancala king,\r\nthe celebrated Dhrishtadyumna, was a mighty bowman possessed of great\r\nbeauty and a crusher of large bands of foes. At sight of Dhrishtadyumna\r\nunto whose car were yoked steeds white as pigeons and whose standard was\r\nmade of a lofty Kovidara, the troops fled away in fear. The celebrated\r\nsons of Madri, with Satyaki among them, engaged in the pursuit of the\r\nGandhara king who was quick in the use of weapons, speedily appeared to\r\nour view. Chekitana and the (five) sons of Draupadi, O sire, having slain\r\na large number of thy troops, blew their conchs. Beholding all the troops\r\nflying away with their faces from the field, those (Pandava) heroes\r\npursued and smote them like bulls pursuing vanquished bulls. Then the\r\nmighty Savyasaci, the son of Pandu, beholding a remnant of thy army still\r\nkeeping their ground, became filled with rage, O king. Suddenly, O\r\nmonarch, he shrouded that remnant of thy forces with arrows. The dust,\r\nhowever, that was then raised enveloped the scene, in consequence of\r\nwhich we could not see anything. Darkness also spread over the scene, and\r\nthe field of battle was covered with arrows. Thy troops, O monarch, then\r\nfled away in fear on all sides. When his army was thus broken, the Kuru\r\nking, O monarch, rushed against both friends and foes. Then Duryodhana\r\nchallenged all the Pandavas to battle, O chief of Bharata's race, like\r\nthe Asura Vali in days of yore challenging all the celestials. The\r\nPandavas then, uniting together and filled with rage, upbraiding him\r\nrepeatedly and shooting diverse weapons, rushed against the roaring\r\nDuryodhana. The latter, however, fearlessly smote his foes with shafts.\r\nThe prowess that we then saw of thy son was exceedingly wonderful, since\r\nall the Pandavas together were unable to transgress him. At this time\r\nDuryodhana beheld, staying at a little distance from him, his troops,\r\nexceedingly mangled with shafts, and prepared to fly away. Rallying them\r\nthen, O monarch, thy son, resolved on battle and desirous of gladdening\r\nthem, addressed those warriors, saying, \"I do not see that spot on plain\r\nor mountain whither, if you fly, the Pandavas will not slay you. What is\r\nthe use then in flight? The Pandava army hath now been reduced to a small\r\nremnant. The two Krishnas have been exceedingly mangled. If all of us\r\nmake a stand here, we are certain to have victory. If, however, you fly\r\naway, breaking your array, the Pandavas, pursuing your sinful selves,\r\nwill slay all of you. Death in battle, therefore, is for our good. Death\r\nin the field of battle while engaged in fight according to Kshatriya\r\npractices is pleasant. Such death produces no kind of grief. By\r\nencountering such a death, a person enjoys eternal happiness in the other\r\nworld. Let all the Kshatriyas assembled here listen to me. It were better\r\nthat they should even submit to the power of the angry Bhimasena than\r\nthat they should abandon the duties practised by them from the days of\r\ntheir ancestors. There is no act more sinful for a Kshatriya than flight\r\nfrom battle. You Kauravas, there is not a better path to heaven than the\r\nduty of battle. The warrior acquires in a day regions of bliss (in the\r\nother world) that take many long years for others to acquire.\" Fulfilling\r\nthose words of the king, the great Kshatriya car-warriors once more\r\nrushed against the Pandavas, unable to endure their defeat and firmly\r\nresolved to put forth their prowess. Then commenced a battle once more,\r\nthat was exceedingly fierce, between thy troops and the enemy, and that\r\nresembled the one between the gods and the Asuras. Thy son Duryodhana\r\nthen, O monarch, with all his troops, rushed against the Pandavas headed\r\nby Yudhishthira.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the fallen boxes of cars, as also the cars of\r\nhigh-souled warriors, and the elephants and foot-soldiers, O sire, slain\r\nin battle, seeing the field of battle assume an aspect as awful as that\r\nof the sporting ground of Rudra, observing the inglorious end obtained by\r\nhundreds and thousands of kings, witnessing also the prowess of Partha\r\nafter the retreat of thy son with grief-stricken heart and when thy\r\ntroops, filled with anxiety and fallen into great distress, O Bharata,\r\nwere deliberating as to what they should next do, hearing also the loud\r\nwails of the Kaurava warriors that were being crushed, and marking the\r\ndisplayed and disordered tokens of great kings, the Kuru leader Kripa of\r\ngreat energy, possessed of years and good conduct and filled with\r\ncompassion, and endued with eloquence, approached king Duryodhana, and\r\nangrily said these words unto him, \"O Duryodhana, listen, O Bharata, to\r\nthese words that I will say unto thee. Having heard them, O monarch, do\r\nthou act according to them, O sinless one, if it pleases thee. There is\r\nno path, O monarch, that is better than the duty of battle. Having\r\nrecourse to that path, Kshatriyas, O bull of the Kshatriya order, engage\r\nin battle. He who lives in the observance of Kshatriya practices fights\r\nwith son, sire, brother, sister's son, and maternal uncle, and relatives,\r\nand kinsmen. If he is slaughtered in battle, there is great merit in it.\r\nSimilarly, there is great sin in it if he flies from the field. It is for\r\nthis that the life of a person desirous of living by the adoption of\r\nKshatriya duties is exceedingly terrible. Unto thee, as regards this, I\r\nwill say a few beneficial words. After the fall of Bhishma and Drona and\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Karna, after the slaughter of Jayadratha and thy\r\nbrothers, O sinless one, and thy son Lakshmana, what is there now for us\r\nto do? They upon whom we had rested all burdens of sovereignty we had\r\nbeen enjoying, have all gone to regions of blessedness attainable by\r\npersons conversant with Brahma, casting off their bodies. As regards\r\nourselves, deprived of those great car-warriors possessed of numerous\r\naccomplishments, we shall have to pass our time in grief, having caused\r\nnumerous kings to perish. When all those heroes were alive, even then\r\nVibhatsu could not be vanquished. Having Krishna, for his eyes, that\r\nmighty-armed hero is incapable of being defeated by the very gods. The\r\nvast (Kaurava) host, approaching his Ape-bearing standard that is lofty\r\nas an Indra's pole (set up in the season of spring) and that is effulgent\r\nas Indra's bow, hath always trembled in fear. At the leonine roars of\r\nBhimasena and the blare of Panchajanya and the twang of Gandiva, our\r\nheart will die away within us. Moving like flashes of lightning, and\r\nblinding our eyes, Arjuna's Gandiva is seen to resemble a circle of fire.\r\nDecked with pure gold, that formidable bow as it is shaken, looks\r\nlightning's flash moving about on every side. Steeds white in hue and\r\npossessed of great speed and endued with the splendour of the Moon or the\r\nKasa grass, and that run devouring the skies, are yoked unto his car.\r\nUrged on by Krishna, like the masses of clouds driven by the wind, and\r\ntheir limbs decked with gold, they bear Arjuna to battle. That foremost\r\nof all persons conversant with arms, Arjuna, burned that great force of\r\nthine like a swelling conflagration consuming dry grass in the forest in\r\nthe season of winter. Possessed of the splendour of Indra himself, while\r\npenetrating into our ranks, we have seen Dhananjaya to look like an\r\nelephant with four tusks. While agitating thy army and inspiring the\r\nkings with fear, we have seen Dhananjaya to resemble an elephant\r\nagitating a lake overgrown with lotuses. While terrifying all the\r\nwarriors with the twang of his bow, we have again seen the son of Pandu\r\nto resemble a lion inspiring smaller animals with dread. Those two\r\nforemost of bowmen in all the worlds, those two bulls among all persons\r\narmed with the bow, the two Krishnas, clad in mail, are looking\r\nexceedingly beautiful. Today is the seventeenth day of this awful battle,\r\nO Bharata, of those that are being slaughtered in the midst of this\r\nfight. The diverse divisions of thy army are broken and dispersed like\r\nautumnal clouds dispersed by the wind. Savyasaci, O monarch, caused thy\r\narmy to tremble and reel like a tempest-tossed boat exposed on the bosom\r\nof the ocean. Where was the Suta's son, where was Drona with all his\r\nfollowers, where was I, where wert thou, where was Hridika's son, where\r\nthy brother Duhshasana accompanied by his brothers (when Jayadratha was\r\nslain)? Upon beholding Jayadratha and finding him within the range of his\r\narrows, Arjuna, putting forth his process upon all thy kinsmen and\r\nbrothers and allies and maternal uncles, and placing his feet upon their\r\nheads, slew king Jayadratha in the very sight of all. What then is there\r\nfor us to do now? Who is there among thy troops now that would vanquish\r\nthe son of Pandu? That high-souled warrior possesses diverse kinds of\r\ncelestial weapons. The twang, again, of Gandiva robbeth us of our\r\nenergies. This army of thine that is now without a leader is like a night\r\nwithout the Moon, or like a river that is dried up with all the trees on\r\nits banks broken by elephants. The mighty-armed Arjuna of white steeds\r\nwill, at his pleasure, career amid this thy masterless host, like a\r\nblazing conflagration amid a heap of grass. The impetuosity of those two,\r\nSatyaki and Bhimasena, would split all the mountains or dry up all the\r\noceans. The words that Bhima spoke in the midst of the assembly have all\r\nbeen nearly accomplished by him, O monarch. That which remains\r\nunaccomplished will again be accomplished by him. While Karna was\r\nbattling before it, the army of the Pandavas, difficult to be defeated,\r\nwas vigorously protected by the wielder of Gandiva. You have done many\r\nfoul wrongs, without any cause, unto the righteous Pandavas. The fruits\r\nof those acts have now come. For the sake of thy own objects thou hadst,\r\nwith great care, mustered together a large force. That vast force, as\r\nalso thyself, O bull of Bharata's race, have fallen into great danger.\r\nPreserve thy own self now, for self is the refuge of everything. If the\r\nrefuge is broken, O sire, everything inhering thereto is scattered on\r\nevery side. He that is being weakened should seek peace by conciliation.\r\nHe that is growing should make war. This is the policy taught by\r\nBrihaspati. We are now inferior to the sons of Pandu as regards the\r\nstrength of our army. Therefore, O lord, I think, peace with the Pandavas\r\nis for our good. He that does not know what is for his good, or (knowing)\r\ndisregards what is for his good, is soon divested of his kingdom and\r\nnever obtains any good. If, by bowing unto king Yudhishthira sovereignty\r\nmay still remain to us, even that would be for our good, and not, O king,\r\nto sustain through folly defeat (at the hands of the Pandavas).\r\nYudhishthira is compassionate. At the request of Vichitravirya's son and\r\nof Govinda, he will allow you to continue as king. Whatever Hrishikesa\r\nwill say unto the victorious king Yudhishthira and Arjuna and Bhimasena,\r\nall of them will, without doubt, obey. Krishna will not, I think, be able\r\nto transgress the words of Dhritarashtra of Kuru's race, nor will the son\r\nof Pandu be able to transgress those of Krishna. A cessation of\r\nhostilities with the sons of Pritha is what I consider to be for thy\r\ngood. I do not say this unto thee from any mean motives nor for\r\nprotecting my life. I say, O king, that which I regard to be beneficial.\r\nThou wilt recollect these words when thou wilt be on the point of death\r\n(if thou neglectest them now).\" Advanced in years, Kripa the son of\r\nSaradwat said these words weepingly. Breathing long and hot breaths, he\r\nthen gave way to sorrow and almost lost his senses.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by the celebrated grandson of Gotama, the\r\nking (Duryodhana), breathing long and hot breaths, remained silent, O\r\nmonarch. Having reflected for a little while, the high-souled son of\r\nDhritarashtra, that scorcher of foes, then said these words unto\r\nSaradwat's son Kripa, \"Whatever a friend should say, thou hast said unto\r\nme. Thou hast also, whilst battling, done everything for me, without\r\ncaring for thy very life. The world has seen thee penetrate into the\r\nmidst of the Pandava divisions and fight with the mighty car-warriors of\r\nthe Pandavas endued with great energy. That which should be said by a\r\nfriend hast been said by thee. Thy words, however, do not please me, like\r\nmedicine that ill pleases the person that is on the point of death. These\r\nbeneficial and excellent words, fraught with reason, that thou, O\r\nmighty-armed one, hast said do not seem acceptable to me, O foremost of\r\nBrahmanas. Deprived by us of his kingdom (on a former occasion), why will\r\nthe son of Pandu repose his trust on us? That mighty king was once\r\ndefeated by us at dice. Why will he again believe my words? So also,\r\nKrishna, ever engaged in the good of the Parthas, when he came to us as\r\nan envoy, was deceived by us. That act of ours was exceedingly\r\nill-judged. Why then, O regenerate one, will Hrishikesa trust my words?\r\nThe princess Krishna, while standing in the midst of the assembly, wept\r\npiteously. Krishna will never forget that act of ours, nor that act, the\r\ndeprivation of Yudhishthira by us of his kingdom. Formerly, it was heard\r\nby us that the two Krishnas have the same heart between them and are\r\nfirmly united with each other. Today, O lord, we have seen it with our\r\neyes. Having heard of the slaughter of his sister's son, Keshava passeth\r\nhis nights in sorrow. We have offended him highly. Why will he forgive us\r\nthen? Arjuna also, in consequence of Abhimanyu's death, hath become very\r\nmiserable. Even if solicited, why will he strike for my good? The second\r\nson of Pandu, the mighty Bhimasena, is exceedingly fierce. He has made a\r\nterrible vow. He will break but not bend. The heroic twins, breathing\r\nanimosity against us, when clad in mail and armed with their swords,\r\nresemble a pair of Yamas. Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi have drawn their\r\nswords against me. Why will those two, O best of Brahmanas, strive for my\r\ngood? While clad in a single raiment and in her season, the princess\r\nKrishna was treated cruelly by Duhshasana in the midst of the assembly\r\nand before the eyes of all. Those scorchers of foes, the Pandavas, who\r\nstill remember the naked Draupadi plunged into distress, can never be\r\ndissuaded from battle.\r\n\r\n\"'\"Then again, Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, is in sorrow, undergoing\r\nthe austerest of penances for my destruction and the success of the\r\nobjects cherished by her husbands, and sleepeth every day on the bare\r\nground, intending to do so till the end of the hostilities is attained.\r\nAbandoning honour and pride, the uterine sister of Vasudeva (Subhadra) is\r\nalways serving Draupadi as veritable waiting woman. Everything,\r\ntherefore, hath flamed up. That fire can never be quenched. Peace with\r\nthem hath become impossible in consequence of the slaughter of Abhimanyu.\r\nHaving also enjoyed the sovereignty of this earth bounded by the ocean,\r\nhow shall I be able to enjoy, under favour of the Pandavas, a kingdom in\r\npeace? Having shone like the Sun upon the heads of all the kings, how\r\nshall I walk behind Yudhishthira like a slave? Having enjoyed all\r\nenjoyable articles and shown great compassion, how shall I lead a\r\nmiserable life now, with miserable men as my companions? I do not hate\r\nthose mild and beneficial words that thou hast spoken. I, however, do not\r\nthink that this is the time for peace. To fight righteously is, O\r\nscorcher of foes, what I regard to be good policy. This is not the time\r\nfor acting like a eunuch. On the other hand, that is time for the battle.\r\nI have performed many sacrifices. I have given away Dakshinas to\r\nBrahmanas, I have obtained the attainment of all my wishes. I have\r\nlistened to Vedic recitations. I have walked upon the heads of my foes.\r\nMy servants have all been wellcherished by me. I have relieved people in\r\ndistress. I dare not, O foremost of regenerate ones, address such humble\r\nwords to the Pandavas. I have conquered foreign kingdoms. I have properly\r\ngoverned my own kingdom. I have enjoyed diverse kinds of enjoyable\r\narticles. Religion and profit and pleasure I have pursued. I have paid\r\noff my debt to the Pitris and to Kshatriya duty. Certainly, there is no\r\nhappiness here. What becomes of kingdom, and what of good name? Fame is\r\nall that one should acquire here. That fame can be obtained by battle,\r\nand by no other means. The death that a Kshatriya meets with at home is\r\ncensurable. Death on one's bed at home is highly sinful. The man who\r\ncasts away his body in the woods or in battle after having performed\r\nsacrifices, obtains great glory. He is no man who dies miserably weeping\r\nin pain, afflicted by disease and decay, in the midst of crying kinsmen.\r\nAbandoning diverse objects of enjoyment, I shall now, by righteous\r\nbattle, proceed to the regions of Shakra, obtaining the companionship of\r\nthose that have attained to the highest end. Without doubt, the\r\nhabitation of heroes of righteous behaviour, who never retreat from\r\nbattle, who are gifted with intelligence and devoted to truth, who are\r\nperformers of sacrifices, and who have been sanctified in the sacrifice\r\nof weapons, is in heaven. The diverse tribes of Apsaras, without doubt,\r\njoyfully gaze at such heroes when engaged in battle. Without doubt, the\r\nPitris behold them worshipped in the assembly of the gods and rejoicing\r\nin heaven, in the company of Apsaras. We will now ascend the path that is\r\ntrod by the celestials and by heroes unreturning from battle, that path\r\nwhich has been taken by our venerable grandsire, by the preceptor endued\r\nwith great intelligence, by Jayadratha, by Karna, and by Duhshasana. Many\r\nbrave kings, who had exerted themselves vigorously for my sake in this\r\nbattle, have been slain. Mangled with arrows and their limbs bathed in\r\nblood, they lie now on the bare Earth. Possessed of great courage and\r\nconversant with excellent weapons, those kings, who had, again, performed\r\nsacrifices as ordained in the scriptures, having cast off their life\r\nbreaths in the discharge of their duties, have now become the denizens of\r\nIndra's abode. They have paved the way (to that blessed region). That\r\nroad will once more be difficult in consequence of the crowds of heroes\r\nthat will hurry along it for reaching that blessed goal. Remembering with\r\ngratitude the feats of those heroes that have died for me, I desire to\r\npay off the debt I owe them, instead of fixing my heart upon kingdom. If,\r\nhaving caused my friends and brothers and grandsires to be slain, I save\r\nmy own life, the world will without doubt, censure me. What kind of\r\nsovereignty will that be which I will enjoy, destitute of kinsmen and\r\nfriends and well-wishers, and bowing down unto the son of Pandu? I, who\r\nhave lorded it over the universe in that way, will now acquire heaven by\r\nfair fight. It will not be otherwise.\" Thus addressed by Duryodhana, all\r\nthe Kshatriyas there applauded that speech and cheered the king, saying,\r\n\"Excellent, Excellent.\" Without at all grieving for their defeat, and\r\nfirmly resolved upon displaying their prowess, all of them, being\r\ndetermined to fight, became filled with enthusiasm. Having groomed their\r\nanimals, the Kauravas, delighting at the prospect of battle, took up\r\ntheir quarters (for the night) at a spot a little less than two Yojanas\r\ndistant from the field. Having reached the Sarasvati of red waters on the\r\nsacred and beautiful table-land at the foot of Himavat, they bathed in\r\nthat water and quenched their thirst with it. Their spirits raised by thy\r\nson, they continued to wait (on their resting ground). Once more rallying\r\ntheir own selves as well as one another, all those Kshatriyas, O king,\r\nurged by fate, waited (in their encampment).'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'On that table land at the foot of Himavat, those\r\nwarriors, O monarch, delighting at the prospect of battle and assembled\r\ntogether, passed the night. Indeed, Shalya and Chitrasena and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Shakuni and Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma of the\r\nSatwata race, and Sushena and Arishtasena and Dhritasena of great energy\r\nand Jayatsena and all these kings passed the night there. After the\r\nheroic Karna had been slain in battle, thy sons, inspired with fright by\r\nthe Pandavas desirous of victory, failed to obtain peace anywhere else\r\nthan on the mountains of Himavat. All of them then, O king, who were\r\nresolved on battle, duly worshipped the king and said unto him, in the\r\npresence of Shalya, these words, \"It behoveth thee to fight with the\r\nenemy, after having made some one the generalissimo of thy army,\r\nprotected by whom in battle we will vanquish our foes.\" Then Duryodhana,\r\nwithout alighting from his car (proceeded towards) that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, that hero conversant with all the rules of battle\r\n(Ashvatthama), who resembled the Destroyer himself in battle. Possessed\r\nof beautiful limbs, of head well covered, of a neck adorned with three\r\nlines like those in a conch shell, of sweet speech, of eyes resembling\r\nthe petals of a full blown lotus, and of a face like that of the dignity\r\nof Meru, resembling the bull of Mahadeva as regards neck, eyes, tread,\r\nand voice, endued with arms that were large, massive, and well-joined,\r\nhaving a chest that was broad and well-formed, equal unto Garuda or the\r\nwind in speed and might, gifted with a splendour like that of the rays of\r\nthe Sun, rivalling Usanas himself in intelligence and the Moon in beauty\r\nand form and charms of face, with a body that seemed to be made of a\r\nnumber of golden lotuses, with well-made joints, of well-formed thighs\r\nand waist and hips, of beautiful fingers, and beautiful nails, he seemed\r\nto have been made by the Creator with care after collecting one after\r\nanother all the beautiful and good attributes of creation. Possessed of\r\nevery auspicious mark, and clever in every act, he was an ocean of\r\nlearning. Ever vanquishing his foes with great speed, he was incapable of\r\nbeing forcibly vanquished by foes. He knew, in all its details, the\r\nscience of weapons consisting of four padas and ten angas. He knew also\r\nthe four Vedas with all their branches, and the Akhyanas as the fifth.\r\nPossessed of great ascetic merit, Drona, himself not born of woman,\r\nhaving worshipped the Three-eyed deity with great attention and austere\r\nvows, begat him upon a wife not born of woman. Approaching that personage\r\nof unrivalled feats, that one who is unrivalled in beauty on Earth, that\r\none who has mastered all branches of learning, that ocean of\r\naccomplishments, that faultless Ashvatthama, thy son told him these\r\nwords, \"Thou, O preceptor's son, art today our highest refuge. Tell us,\r\ntherefore, who is to be the generalissimo of my forces now, placing whom\r\nat our head, all of us, united together, may vanquish the Pandavas?\"\r\n\r\n\"'(Thus addressed), the son of Drona answered, \"Let Shalya become the\r\nleader of our army. In descent, in prowess, in energy, in fame, in beauty\r\nof person, and in every other accomplishment, he is superior. Mindful of\r\nthe services rendered to him, he has taken up our side, having abandoned\r\nthe sons of his own sister. Owning a large force of his own, that\r\nmighty-armed one is like a second (Kartikeya, the) celestial\r\ngeneralissimo. Making that king the commander of our forces, O best of\r\nmonarchs, we will be able to gain victory, like the gods, after making\r\nthe unvanquished Skanda their commander.\" After Drona's son had said\r\nthese words, all the kings stood, surrounding Shalya, and cried victory\r\nto him. Having made up their minds for battle, they felt great joy. Then\r\nDuryodhana, alighting from his car, joined his hands and addressing\r\nShalya, that rival of Drona and Bhishma in battle, who was on his car,\r\nsaid these words, \"O thou that art devoted to friends, that time has now\r\ncome for thy friends when intelligent men examine persons in the guise of\r\nfriends as to whether they are true friends or otherwise. Brave as thou\r\nart, be thou our generalissimo at the van of our army. When thou wilt\r\nproceed to battle, the Pandavas, with their friends, will become\r\ncheerless, and the Pancalas will be depressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya answered, \"I will, O king of the Kurus, accomplish that which\r\nthou askest me to accomplish. Everything I have--my life breath, my\r\nkingdom, my wealth--is at thy service.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"I solicit thee with offer of the leadership of my\r\narmy, O maternal uncle. O foremost of warriors, protect us incomparably,\r\neven as Skanda protected the gods in battle. O foremost of kings, thyself\r\ncause thy own self to be installed in the command as Pavaka's son\r\nKartikeya in the command of (the forces of) the celestials. O hero, slay\r\nour foes in battle like Indra slaying the Danavas.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the (Kuru) king, the valiant\r\nmonarch (Shalya), O king, said these words unto Duryodhana in reply, \"O\r\nmighty-armed Duryodhana, listen to me, O foremost of eloquent men. Thou\r\nregardest the two Krishnas, when on their car, to be the foremost of\r\ncar-warriors. They are not, however, together equal to me in might of\r\narms. What need I say of the Pandavas? When angry, I can fight, at the\r\nvan of battle, with the whole world consisting of gods, Asuras, and men,\r\nrisen up in arms. I will vanquish the assembled Parthas and the Somakas\r\nin battle. Without doubt, I will become the leader of thy troops. I will\r\nform such an array that our enemies will not be able to overmaster it. I\r\nsay this to thee, O Duryodhana. There is no doubt in this.\" Thus\r\naddressed (by Shalya), king Duryodhana cheerfully poured sanctified\r\nwater, without losing any time, O best of the Bharatas, on the ruler of\r\nthe Madras, in the midst of his troops, according to the rites ordained\r\nin the scriptures, O monarch. After Shalya had been invested with the\r\ncommand, loud leonine roars arose among thy troops and diverse musical\r\ninstruments also, O Bharata, were beat and blown. The Kaurava warriors\r\nbecame very cheerful, as also the mighty car-warriors among the Madrakas.\r\nAnd all of them praised the royal Shalya, that ornament of battle,\r\nsaying, \"Victory to thee, O king. Long life to thee! Slay all the\r\nassembled foes! Having obtained the might of thy arms, let the\r\nDhartarashtras endued with great strength, rule the wide Earth without a\r\nfoe. Thou art capable of vanquishing in battle the three worlds\r\nconsisting of the gods, the Asuras, what need be said of the Somakas and\r\nthe Srinjayas that are mortal?\" Thus praised, the mighty king of the\r\nMadrakas obtained great joy that is unattainable by persons of unrefined\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n\"'Shalya said, \"Today, O king, I will either slay all the Pancalas with\r\nthe Pandavas in battle, or, slain by them, proceed to heaven. Let the\r\nworld behold me today careering (on the field of battle) fearlessly.\r\nToday let all the sons of Pandu, and Vasudeva, and Satyaki, and the sons\r\nof Draupadi, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and all the Prabhadrakas,\r\nbehold my prowess and the great might of my bow, and my quickness, and\r\nthe energy of my weapons, and the strength of my arms, in battle. Let the\r\nParthas, and all the Siddhas, with the Charanas behold today the strength\r\nthat is in my arms and the wealth of weapons I possess. Beholding my\r\nprowess today, let the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, desirous of\r\ncounteracting it, adopt diverse courses of action. Today I will rout the\r\ntroops of the Pandavas on all sides. Surpassing Drona and Bhishma and the\r\nSuta's son, O lord, in battle, I will career on the field, O Kauravas,\r\nfor doing what is agreeable to thee.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'After Shalya had been invested with the command, O\r\ngiver of honours, no one among thy troops, O bull of Bharata's race, any\r\nlonger felt any grief on account of Karna. Indeed, the troops became\r\ncheerful and glad. They regarded the Parthas as already slain and brought\r\nunder the power of the ruler of the Madras. Having obtained great joy,\r\nthy troops, O bull of Bharata's race, slept that night happily and became\r\nvery cheerful. Hearing those shouts of thy army, king Yudhishthira,\r\naddressing him of Vrishni's race, said these words, in the hearing of all\r\nthe Kshatriyas, \"The ruler of the Madras, Shalya, that great bowman who\r\nis highly regarded by all the warriors hath, O Madhava, been made the\r\nleader of his forces by Dhritarashtra's son. Knowing this that has\r\nhappened, do, O Madhava, that which is beneficial. Thou art our leader\r\nand protector. Do that which should next be done.\" Then Vasudeva, O\r\nmonarch, said unto that king, \"I know Artayani, O Bharata, truly. Endued\r\nwith prowess and great energy, he is highly illustrious. He is\r\naccomplished, conversant with all the modes of warfare, and possessed of\r\ngreat lightness of hand. I think that the ruler of the Madras is in\r\nbattle equal to Bhishma or Drona or Karna, or perhaps, superior to them.\r\nI do not, O ruler of men, even upon reflection, find the warrior who may\r\nbe a match for Shalya while engaged in fight. In battle, he is superior\r\nin might to Shikhandi and Arjuna and Bhima and Satyaki and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O Bharata. The king of the Madras, O monarch, endued with\r\nthe prowess of a lion or an elephant, will career fearlessly in battle\r\nlike the Destroyer himself in wrath amongst creatures at the time of the\r\nuniversal destruction. I do not behold a match for him in battle save\r\nthee, O tiger among men, that art possessed of prowess equal to that of a\r\ntiger. Save thee there is no other person in either heaven or the whole\r\nof this world, who, O son of Kuru's race, would be able to slay the ruler\r\nof the Madras while excited with wrath in battle. Day after day engaged\r\nin fight, he agitates thy troops. For this, slay Shalya in battle, like\r\nMaghavat slaying Samvara. Treated with honour by Dhritarashtra's son,\r\nthat hero is invincible in battle. Upon the fall of the ruler of the\r\nMadras in battle, thou art certain to have victory. Upon his slaughter,\r\nthe vast Dhartarashtra host will be slain. Hearing, O monarch, these\r\nwords of mine now, proceed, O Partha, against that mighty car-warrior,\r\nthe ruler of the Madras. Slay that warrior, O thou of mighty arms, like\r\nVasava slaying the Asura Namuchi. There is no need of showing any\r\ncompassion here, thinking that this one is thy maternal uncle. Keeping\r\nthe duties of a Kshatriya before thee, slay the ruler of the Madras.\r\nHaving crossed the fathomless oceans represented by Bhishma and Drona and\r\nKarna, do not sink, with thy followers, in the print of a cow's hoof\r\nrepresented by Shalya. Display in battle the whole of thy ascetic power\r\nand thy Kshatriya energy. Slay that car-warrior.\" Having said these\r\nwords, Keshava, that slayer of hostile heroes, proceeded to his tent in\r\nthe evening, worshipped by the Pandavas. After Keshava had gone, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, dismissing all his brothers and the Somakas,\r\nhappily slept that night, like an elephant from whose body the darts have\r\nbeen plucked out. All those great bowmen of the Pancalas and Pandavas,\r\ndelighted in consequence of the fall of Karna, slept that night happily.\r\nIts fever dispelled, the army of the Pandavas, abounding with great\r\nbowmen and mighty car-warriors having reached the shore as it were,\r\nbecame very happy that night, in consequence of the victory, O sire, it\r\nhad won by the slaughter of Karna.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After that night had passed away, king Duryodhana then,\r\naddressing all thy soldiers, said, \"Arm, you mighty car-warriors!\"\r\nHearing the command of the king, the warriors began to put on their\r\narmour. Some began to yoke their steeds to their cars quickly, others ran\r\nhither and thither. The elephants began to be equipped. The foot-soldiers\r\nbegan to arm. Others, numbering thousands, began to spread carpets on the\r\nterraces of cars. The noise of musical instruments, O monarch, arose\r\nthere, for enhancing the martial enthusiasm of the soldiers. Then all the\r\ntroops, placed in their proper posts, were seen, O Bharata, to stand,\r\nclad in mail and resolved to make death their goal. Having made the ruler\r\nof the Madras their leader, the great car-warriors of the Kauravas,\r\ndistributing their troops, stood in divisions. Then all thy warriors,\r\nwith Kripa and Kritavarma and Drona's son and Shalya and Subala's son and\r\nthe other kings that were yet alive, met thy son, and arrived at this\r\nunderstanding, that none of them would individually and alone fight with\r\nthe Pandavas. And they said, \"He amongst us that will fight, alone and\r\nunsupported, with the Pandavas, or he that will abandon a comrade engaged\r\nin fight, will be stained with the five grave sins and all the minor\r\nsins.\" And they said, \"All of us, united together, will fight with the\r\nfoe.\" Those great car-warriors, having made such an understanding with\r\none another placed the ruler of the Madras at their head and quickly\r\nproceeded against their foes. Similarly, all the Pandavas, having arrayed\r\ntheir troops in great battle, proceeded against the Kauravas, O king, for\r\nfighting with them on every side. Soon, O chief of the Bharatas, that\r\nhost, whose noise resembled that of the agitated ocean, and which seemed\r\nto be wonderful in consequence of its cars and elephants, presented the\r\naspect of the vast deep swelling with its surges.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have heard of the fall of Drona, of Bhishma and\r\nof the son of Radha. Tell me now of the fall of Shalya and of my son.\r\nHow, indeed, O Sanjaya, was Shalya slain by king Yudhishthira the just?\r\nAnd how was my son Duryodhana slain by Bhimasena of great might?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with patience, of the destruction of human\r\nbodies and the loss of elephants and steeds, as I describe (to thee) the\r\nbattle. The hope became strong, O king, in the breasts of thy sons that,\r\nafter Drona and Bhishma and the Suta's son had been overthrown, Shalya, O\r\nsire, would slay all the Parthas in battle. Cherishing that hope in his\r\nheart, and drawing comfort from it, O Bharata, thy son Duryodhana,\r\nrelying in battle upon that mighty car-warrior, the ruler of the Madras,\r\nregarded himself as possessed of a protector. When after Karna's fall the\r\nParthas had uttered leonine roars, a great fear, O king, had possessed\r\nthe hearts of the Dhartarashtras. Assuring him duly, the valiant king of\r\nthe Madras, having formed, O monarch, a grand array whose arrangements\r\nwere auspicious in every respect, proceeded against the Parthas in\r\nbattle. And the valiant king of the Madras proceeded, shaking his\r\nbeautiful and exceedingly strong bow capable of imparting a great\r\nvelocity to the shafts sped from it. And that mighty car-warrior was\r\nmounted upon the foremost of vehicles, having horses of the Sindhu breed\r\nyoked unto it. Riding upon his car, his driver made the vehicle look\r\nresplendent. Protected by that car, that hero, that brave crusher of foes\r\n(Shalya), stood, O monarch, dispelling the fears of thy sons. The king of\r\nthe Madras, clad in mail, proceeded at the head of the array, accompanied\r\nby the brave Madrakas and the invincible sons of Karna. On the left was\r\nKritavarma, surrounded by the Trigartas. On the right was Gautama (Kripa)\r\nwith the Sakas and the Yavanas. In the rear was Ashvatthama surrounded by\r\nthe Kambojas. In the centre was Duryodhana, protected by the foremost of\r\nthe Kuru warriors. Surrounded by a large force of cavalry and other\r\ntroops, Subala's son Shakuni, as also the mighty car-warrior Uluka,\r\nproceeded with the others. The mighty bowmen amongst the Pandavas, those\r\nchastisers of foes, dividing themselves, O monarch, into three bodies,\r\nrushed against thy troops. Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki proceeded with great speed against the army of\r\nShalya. Then king Yudhishthira, accompanied by his troops, rushed against\r\nShalya alone, from desire of slaughtering him, O bull of Bharata's race.\r\nArjuna, that slayer of large bands of foes, rushed with great speed\r\nagainst that great bowman Kritavarma and the Samsaptakas. Bhimasena and\r\nthe great car-warriors among the Somakas rushed, O monarch, against\r\nKripa, desirous of slaughtering their foes in battle. The two sons of\r\nMadri, accompanied by their troops, proceeded against Shakuni and the\r\ngreat car-warrior Uluka at the head of their forces. Similarly, thousands\r\nupon thousands of warriors of thy army, armed with diverse weapons and\r\nfilled with rage, proceeded against the Pandavas in that battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After the fall of the mighty bowmen Bhishma and\r\nDrona and the great car-warrior Karna, and after both the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas had been reduced in numbers, and when, indeed, the Parthas,\r\npossessed of great prowess, became once more angry in battle, what, O\r\nSanjaya, was the strength of each of the armies?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, how we and the enemy both stood for battle\r\non that occasion and what was then the strength of the two armies. 11,000\r\ncars, O bull of Bharata's race, 10,700 elephants, and full 200,000\r\nhorses, and three millions of foot, composed the strength of thy army.\r\n6,000 cars, 6,000 elephants, 10,000 horses, and one million of foot, O\r\nBharata, were all that composed the remnant of the Pandava force in the\r\nbattle. These, O bull of Bharata's race, encountered each other for\r\nbattle. Having distributed their forces in this way, O monarch,\r\nourselves, excited with wrath and inspired with desire of victory,\r\nproceeded against the Pandavas, having placed ourselves under the command\r\nof the ruler of the Madras. Similar, the brave Pandavas, those tigers\r\namong men, desirous of victory, and the Pancalas possessed of great fame,\r\ncame to battle. Even thus, O monarch, all those tigers among men,\r\ndesirous of slaughtering their foes, encountered one another at dawn of\r\nday, O lord. Then commenced a fierce and terrible battle between thy\r\ntroops and the enemy, the combatants being all engaged in striking and\r\nslaughtering one another.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then commenced the battle between the Kurus and the\r\nSrinjayas, O monarch, that was as fierce and awful as the battle between\r\nthe gods and the Asuras. Men and crowds of cars and elephants, and\r\nelephant-warriors and horsemen by thousands, and steeds, all possessed of\r\ngreat prowess, encountered one another. The loud noise of rushing\r\nelephants of fearful forms was then heard there resembling the roars of\r\nthe clouds in the welkin, in the season of rains. Some car-warriors,\r\nstruck by elephants, were deprived of their cars. Routed by those\r\ninfuriate animals other brave combatants ran on the field. Well-trained\r\ncar-warriors, O Bharata, with their shafts, despatched large bodies of\r\ncavalry and the footmen that urged and protected the elephants, to the\r\nother world. Well-trained horsemen, O king, surrounding great\r\ncar-warriors, careered on the field, striking and slaying the latter with\r\nspears and darts and swords. Some combatants armed with bows,\r\nencompassing great car-warriors, despatched them to Yama's abode, the\r\nmany unitedly battling against individual ones. Other great car-warriors,\r\nencompassing elephants and foremost warriors of their own class, slew\r\nsome mighty one amongst that fought on the field, careering all around.\r\nSimilarly, O king, elephants, encompassing individual car-warriors\r\nexcited with wrath and scattering showers of shafts, despatched them to\r\nthe other world. Elephant-warrior rushing against elephant-warrior and\r\ncar-warrior against car-warrior in that battle slew each other with darts\r\nand lances and cloth-yard shafts, O Bharata. Cars and elephants and\r\nhorses, crushing foot-soldiers in the midst of battle, were seen to make\r\nconfusion worse confounded. Adorned with yak-tails, steeds rushed on all\r\nsides, looking like the swans found on the plains at the foot of Himavat.\r\nThey rushed with such speed that they seemed ready to devour the very\r\nEarth. The field, O monarch, indented with the hoofs of those steeds,\r\nlooked beautiful like a beautiful woman bearing the marks of (her\r\nlover's) nails on her person. With the noise made by the tread of heroes,\r\nthe wheels of cars, the shouts of foot-soldiers, the grunts of elephants,\r\nthe peal of drums and other musical instruments, and the blare of conchs,\r\nthe Earth began to resound as if with deafening peals of thunder. In\r\nconsequence of twanging bows and flashing sabres and the glaring armour\r\nof the combatants, all became so confused there, that nothing could be\r\ndistinctly marked. Invulnerable arms, lopped off from human bodies, and\r\nlooking like the tusks of elephants, jumped up and writhed and moved\r\nfuriously about. The sound made, O monarch, by heads falling on the field\r\nof battle, resembled that made by the falling fruits of palmyra trees.\r\nStrewn with those fallen heads that were crimson with blood, the Earth\r\nlooked resplendent as if adorned with gold-coloured lotuses in their\r\nseason. Indeed, with those lifeless heads with upturned eyes, that were\r\nexceedingly mangled (with shafts and other weapons), the field of battle,\r\nO king, looked resplendent as if strewn with full blown lotuses. With the\r\nfallen arms of the combatants, smeared with sandal and adorned with\r\ncostly Keyuras, the earth looked bright as if strewn with the gorgeous\r\npoles set up in Indra's honour. The field of battle became covered with\r\nthe thighs of kings, cut off in that battle and looking like the tapering\r\ntrunks of elephants. Teeming with hundreds of headless trunk and strewn\r\nwith umbrellas and yak-tails, that vast army looked beautiful like a\r\nflowering forest. Then, on the field of battle, O monarch, warriors\r\ncareered fearlessly, their limbs bathed in blood and therefore looking\r\nlike flowering Kinsukas. Elephants also, afflicted with arrows and\r\nlances, fell down here and there like broken clouds dropped from the\r\nskies. Elephant divisions, O monarch, slaughtered by high-souled\r\nwarriors, dispersed in all directions like wind-tossed clouds. Those\r\nelephants, looking like clouds, fell down on the Earth, like mountains\r\nriven with thunder, O lord, on the occasion of the dissolution of the\r\nworld at the end of the Yuga. Heaps upon heaps, looking like mountains,\r\nwere seen, lying on the ground, of fallen steeds with their riders. A\r\nriver appeared on the field of battle, flowing towards the other world.\r\nBlood formed its waters and cars its eddies. Standards formed its trees,\r\nand bones its pebbles. The arms (of combatants) were its alligators, bows\r\nits current, elephants its large rocks, and steeds its smaller ones. Fat\r\nand marrow formed its mire, umbrellas its swans, and maces its rafts.\r\nAbounding with armour and head-gears, banners constituted its beautiful\r\ntrees. Teeming with wheels that formed its swarms of Chakravakas, it was\r\ncovered with Trivenus and Dandas. Inspiring the brave with delight and\r\nenhancing the fears of the timid, that fierce river set in, whose shores\r\nabounded with Kurus and Srinjayas. Those brave warriors, with arms\r\nresembling spiked bludgeons, by the aid of their vehicles and animals\r\nserving the purposes of rafts and boats, crossed that awful river which\r\nran towards the region of the dead. During the progress of that battle, O\r\nmonarch, in which no consideration was shown by anybody for anyone, and\r\nwhich, fraught with awful destruction of the four kinds of forces,\r\ntherefore, resembled the battle between the gods and the Asuras in days\r\nof old, some among the combatants, O scorcher of foes, loudly called upon\r\ntheir kinsmen and friends. Some, called upon by crying kinsmen, returned,\r\nafflicted with fear. During the progress of that fierce and awful battle,\r\nArjuna and Bhimasena stupefied their foes. That vast host of thine, O\r\nruler of men, thus slaughtered, swooned away on the field, like a woman\r\nunder the influence of liquor. Having stupefied that army, Bhimasena and\r\nDhananjaya blew their conchs and uttered leonine roars. As soon as they\r\nheard that loud peal, Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi, placing king\r\nYudhishthira at their head, rushed against the ruler of the Madras.\r\nExceedingly wonderful and terrible, O monarch, was the manner in which\r\nthose heroes, unitedly and as separate bodies, then fought with Shalya.\r\nThe two sons of Madri, endued with great activity, accomplished in\r\nweapons, and invincible in battle, proceeded with great speed against thy\r\nhost, inspired with desire of victory. Then thy army, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, mangled in diverse ways with shafts by the Pandavas eager for\r\nvictory, began to fly away from the field. That host, thus struck and\r\nbroken by firm bowmen, O monarch, fled away on all sides in the very\r\nsight of thy sons. Loud cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" O Bharata, arose from\r\namong thy warriors, while some illustrious Kshatriyas among the routed\r\ncombatants, desirous of victory, cried out saying, \"Stop, stop!\" For all\r\nthat, those troops of thine, broken by the Pandavas, fled away, deserting\r\non the field their dear sons and brothers and maternal, uncles and\r\nsister's sons and relatives by marriage and other kinsmen. Urging their\r\nsteeds and elephants to greater speed, thousands of warriors fled away, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, bent only upon their own safety.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the army broken, the valiant king of the\r\nMadras, addressed his driver, saying, \"Quickly urge these steeds endued\r\nwith the fleetness of thought. Yonder stays king Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nPandu, looking resplendent with the umbrella held over his head. Take me\r\nthither with speed, O driver, and witness my might. The Parthas are\r\nunable to stand before me in battle.\" Thus addressed, the driver of the\r\nMadra king proceeded to that spot where stood king Yudhishthira the just\r\nof true aim. Shalya fell suddenly upon the mighty host of the Pandavas.\r\nAlone, he checked it like the continent checking the surging sea. Indeed,\r\nthe large force of the Pandavas, coming against Shalya, O sire, stood\r\nstill in that battle, like the rushing sea upon encountering a mountain.\r\nBeholding the ruler of the Madras standing for battle on the field, the\r\nKauravas returned, making death their goal. After they had returned, O\r\nking, and separately taken up their positions in well-formed array, an\r\nawful battle set in, in which blood flowed freely like water.\r\n\r\n\"'The invincible Nakula encountered Chitrasena. These two heroes, both of\r\nwhom were excellent bowmen, approaching, drenched each other with showers\r\nof arrows in that battle, like two pouring clouds risen in the welkin on\r\nthe south and the north. I could not mark any difference between the son\r\nof Pandu and his antagonist. Both of them were accomplished in weapons,\r\nboth endued with might, and both conversant with the practices of\r\ncar-warriors. Each bent upon slaying the other, they carefully looked for\r\neach other's lapses. Then Chitrasena, O monarch, with a broad-headed\r\nshaft, well-tempered and sharp, cut off Nakula's bow at the handle.\r\nFearlessly then the son of Karna struck the bowless Nakula at the\r\nforehead with three shafts equipped with wings of gold and whetted on\r\nstone. With a few other keen arrows he then despatched Nakula's steeds to\r\nYama's abode. Next, he felled both the standard and the driver of his\r\nantagonist, each with three arrows. With those three arrows sped from the\r\narms of his foe sticking to his fore-head, Nakula, O king, looked\r\nbeautiful like a mountain with three crests. Deprived of his bow and his\r\ncars, the brave Nakula, taking up a sword, jumped down from his vehicle\r\nlike a lion from a mountain-summit. As, however, he rushed on foot, his\r\nantagonist poured a shower of arrows upon him. Possessed of active\r\nprowess, Nakula received that arrowy shower on his shield. Getting at the\r\ncar then of Chitrasena, the mighty-armed hero, the son of Pandu,\r\nconversant with all modes of warfare and incapable of being tired with\r\nexertion, ascended it in the very sight of all the troops. The son of\r\nPandu then cut off from Chitrasena's trunk his diadem-decked head adorned\r\nwith ear-rings, and graced with a beautiful nose and a pair of large\r\neyes. At this, Chitrasena, endued with the splendour of the sun, fell\r\ndown on the terrace of his car. Beholding Chitrasena slain, all the great\r\ncar-warriors there uttered loud cries of praise and many leonine roars.\r\nMeanwhile, the two sons of Karna, Sushena and Satyasena, both of whom\r\nwere great car-warriors, beholding their brother slain, shot showers of\r\nkeen shafts. Those foremost of car-warriors rushed with speed against the\r\nson of Pandu like a couple of tigers, O king, in the deep forest rushing\r\nagainst an elephant from desire of slaying him. Both of them poured their\r\nkeen shafts upon the mighty car-warrior Nakula. Indeed, as they poured\r\nthose shafts, they resembled two masses of clouds pouring rain in\r\ntorrents. Though pierced with arrows all over, the valiant and heroic son\r\nof Pandu cheerfully took up another bow after ascending on another car,\r\nand stood in battle like the Destroyer himself in rage. Then those two\r\nbrothers, O monarch, with their straight shafts, cut off Nakula's car\r\ninto fragments. Then Nakula, laughing, smote the four steeds of Satyasena\r\nwith four whetted and keen shafts in that encounter. Aiming a long shaft\r\nequipped with wings of gold, the son of Pandu then cut off, O monarch,\r\nthe bow of Satyasena. At this, the latter, mounting on another car and\r\ntaking up another bow, as also his brother Sushena, rushed against the\r\nson of Pandu. The valiant son of Madri fearlessly pierced each of them, O\r\nmonarch, with couple of shafts at the van of battle. Then the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Sushena, filled with wrath, cut off in that battle, laughing\r\nthe while, the formidable bow of Pandu's son with a razor-headed arrow.\r\nThen Nakula, insensate with rage, took up another bow and pierced Sushena\r\nwith five arrows and struck his standard with one. Without losing a\r\nmoment, he then cut off the bow and the leathern fence of Satyasena also,\r\nO sire, at which all the troops there uttered a loud shout. Satyasena,\r\ntaking up another foe-slaying bow that was capable of bearing a great\r\nstrain, shrouded the son of Pandu with arrows from every side. Baffling\r\nthose arrows, Nakula, that slayer of hostile heroes, pierced each of his\r\nantagonists with a couple of shafts. Each of the latter separately\r\npierced the son of Pandu in return with many straight-coursing shaft.\r\nNext they pierced Nakula's driver also with many keen shafts. The valiant\r\nSatyasena then, endued with great lightness of hand, cut off without his\r\nbrother's help the shafts of Nakula's car and his bow with a couple of\r\narrows. The Atiratha Nakula, however, staying on his car, took up a dart\r\nequipped with a golden handle and a very keen point, and steeped in oil\r\nand exceedingly bright. It resembled, O lord, a she-snake of virulent\r\npoison, frequently darting out her tongue. Raising that weapon he hurled\r\nit at Satyasena in that encounter. That dart, O king, pierced the heart\r\nof Satyasena in that battle and reduced it into a hundred fragments.\r\nDeprived of his senses and life, he fell down upon the Earth from his\r\ncar. Beholding his brother slain, Sushena, insensate with rage, suddenly\r\nmade Nakula carless in that battle. Without losing a moment, he poured\r\nhis arrows over the son of Pandu fighting on foot. Seeing Nakula carless,\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Sutasoma, the son of Draupadi, rushed to that spot\r\nfor rescuing his sire in battle. Mounting then upon the car of Sutasoma,\r\nNakula, that hero of Bharata's race, looked beautiful like a lion upon a\r\nmountain. Then taking up another bow, he fought with Sushena. Those two\r\ngreat car-warriors, approaching each other, and shooting showers of\r\narrows, endeavoured to encompass each other's destruction. Then Sushena,\r\nfilled with rage, struck the son of Pandu with three shafts and Sutasoma\r\nwith twenty in the arms and the chest. At this, the impetuous Nakula, O\r\nmonarch, that slayer of hostile heroes, covered all the points of the\r\ncompass with arrows. Then taking up a sharp shaft endued with great\r\nenergy and equipped with a semi-circular head, Nakula sped it with great\r\nforce at Karna's son in that battle. With that arrow, O best of kings,\r\nthe son of Pandu cut off from Sushena's trunk the latter's head in the\r\nvery sight of all the troops. That feat seemed exceedingly wonderful.\r\nThus slain by the illustrious Nakula, Karna's son fell down like a lofty\r\ntree on the bank of a river thrown down by the current of the stream.\r\nBeholding the slaughter of Karna's sons and the prowess of Nakula, thy\r\narmy, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in fear. Their commander,\r\nhowever, the brave and valiant ruler of the Madras, that chastiser of\r\nfoes, then protected, O monarch, those troops in that battle. Rallying\r\nhis host, O king, Shalya stood fearlessly in battle, uttering loud\r\nleonine roars and causing his bow to twang fiercely. Then thy troops, O\r\nking, protected in battle by that firm bowman, cheerfully proceeded\r\nagainst the foe once more from every side. Those high-souled warriors,\r\nsurrounding that great bowman, the ruler of the Madras, stood, O king,\r\ndesirous of battling on every side. Then Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and\r\nthose two Pandavas, the twin sons of Madri, placing that chastiser of\r\nfoes and abode of modesty, Yudhishthira, at their head, and surrounding\r\nhim on all sides in that battle, uttered leonine roars. And those heroes\r\nalso caused a loud whizz with the arrows they shot and frequently\r\nindulged in diverse kinds of shouts. Smilingly, all thy warriors, filled\r\nwith rage, speedily encompassed the ruler of the Madras and stood from\r\ndesire of battle. Then commenced a battle, inspiring the timid with fear,\r\nbetween thy soldiers and the enemy, both of whom made death their goal.\r\nThat battle between fearless combatants, enhancing the population of\r\nYama's kingdom, resembled, O monarch, that between the gods and the\r\nAsuras in days of yore. Then the ape-bannered son of Pandu, O king,\r\nhaving slaughtered the Samsaptakas in battle, rushed against that portion\r\nof the Kaurava army. Smiling, all the Pandavas, headed by Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nrushed against the same division, shooting showers of keen arrows.\r\nOverwhelmed by the Pandavas, the Kaurava host became stupefied. Indeed,\r\nthose divisions then could not discern the cardinal point from the\r\nsubsidiary points of the compass. Covered with keen arrows sped by the\r\nPandavas, the Kaurava army, deprived of its foremost warriors, wavered\r\nand broke on all sides. Indeed, O Kaurava, that host of thine began to be\r\nslaughtered by the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas. Similarly, the\r\nPandava host, O king, began to be slaughtered in hundreds and thousands\r\nin that battle by thy sons on every side with their arrows. While the two\r\narmies, exceedingly excited, were thus slaughtering each other, they\r\nbecame much agitated like two streams in the season of rains. During the\r\nprogress of that dreadful battle, O monarch, a great fear entered the\r\nhearts of thy warriors as also those of the Pandavas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"When the troops, slaughtered by one another, were thus\r\nagitated, when many of the warriors fled away and the elephants began to\r\nutter loud cries, when the foot-soldiers in that dreadful battle began to\r\nshout and wail aloud, when the steeds, O king, ran in diverse directions,\r\nwhen the carnage became awful, when a terrible destruction set in of all\r\nembodied creatures, when weapons of various kinds fell or clashed with\r\none another, when cars and elephants began to be mangled together, when\r\nheroes felt great delight and cowards felt their fears enhanced, when\r\ncombatants encountered one another from desire of slaughter, on that\r\nawful occasion of the destruction of life, during the progress of that\r\ndreadful sport, that is, of that awful battle that enhanced the\r\npopulation of Yama's kingdom, the Pandavas slaughtered thy troops with\r\nkeen shafts, and, after the same manner, thy troops slew those of the\r\nPandavas.\r\n\r\nDuring that battle inspiring the timid with terror, indeed, during the\r\nprogress of the battle as it was fought on that morning about the hour of\r\nsunrise, the Pandava heroes of good aim, protected by the high-souled\r\nYudhishthira, fought with thy forces, making death itself their goal. The\r\nKuru army, O thou of the race of Kuru, encountering the proud Pandavas\r\nendued with great strength, skilled in smiting, and possessed of sureness\r\nof aim, became weakened and agitated like a herd of she-deer frightened\r\nat a forest conflagration.\r\n\r\nBeholding that army weakened and helpless like a cow sunk in mire,\r\nShalya, desirous of rescuing it, proceeded against the Pandava army.\r\nFilled with rage, the ruler of the Madras, taking up an excellent bow,\r\nrushed for battle against the Pandava foes. The Pandavas also, O monarch,\r\nin that encounter, inspired with desire of victory, proceeded against the\r\nruler of the Madras and pierced him with keen shafts. Then the ruler of\r\nthe Madras, possessed of great strength, afflicted that host with showers\r\nof keen arrows in the very sight of king Yudhishthira the just.\r\n\r\nAt that time diverse portents appeared to the view. The Earth herself,\r\nwith her mountains, trembled, making a loud noise. Meteors, with keen\r\npoints bright as those of lances equipped with handles, piercing the air,\r\nfell upon the Earth from the firmament. Deer and buffaloes and birds, O\r\nmonarch, in large numbers, placed thy army to their right, O king. The\r\nplanets Venus and Mars, in conjunction with Mercury, appeared at the rear\r\nof the Pandavas and to the front of all the (Kaurava) lords of Earth.\r\nBlazing flames seemed to issue from the points of weapons, dazzling the\r\neyes (of the warriors). Crows and owls in large numbers perched upon the\r\nheads of the combatants and on the tops of their standards. Then a fierce\r\nbattle took place between the Kaurava and the Pandava combatants,\r\nassembled together in large bodies. Then, O king, the Kauravas, mustering\r\nall their divisions, rushed against the Pandava army. Of soul incapable\r\nof being depressed, Shalya then poured dense showers of arrows on\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti like the thousand-eyed Indra pouring rain\r\nin torrents. Possessed of great strength, he pierced Bhimasena, and the\r\nfive sons of Draupadi and Dhristadyumna, the two sons of Madri by Pandu,\r\nand the grandson of Sini, and Shikhandi also, each with ten arrows\r\nequipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone. Indeed, he began to\r\npour his arrows like Maghavat (Indra) pouring rain at the close of the\r\nsummer season. Then the Prabhadrakas, O king, and the Somakas, were seen\r\nfelled or falling by thousands, in consequence of Shalya's arrows.\r\nMultitudinous as swarms of bees or flights of locusts, the shafts of\r\nShalya were seen to fall like thunderbolts from the clouds. Elephants and\r\nsteeds and foot-soldiers and car-warriors, afflicted with Shalya's\r\narrows, fell down or wandered or uttered loud wails. Infuriate with rage\r\nand prowess, the ruler of the Madras shrouded his foes in that battle\r\nlike Destroyer at the end of the Yuga. The mighty ruler of the Madras\r\nbegan to roar aloud like the clouds. The Pandava army, thus slaughtered\r\nby Shalya, ran towards Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti (for protection).\r\nPossessed of great lightness of hand, Shalya, having in that battle\r\ncrushed them with whetted arrows, began to afflict Yudhishthira with a\r\ndense shower of shafts. Beholding Shalya impetuously rushing towards him\r\nwith horsemen and foot-soldiers, king Yudhishthira, filled with wrath,\r\nchecked him with keen shafts, even as an infuriate elephant is checked\r\nwith iron-hooks. Then Shalya sped a terrible arrow at Yudhishthira that\r\nresembled a snake of virulent poison. Piercing through the high-souled\r\nson of Kunti, that arrow quickly fell down upon the Earth. Then\r\nVrikodara, filled with wrath, pierced Shalya with seven arrows, and\r\nSahadeva pierced him with five, and Nakula with ten. The (five) sons of\r\nDraupadi poured upon that foe-slaying hero, the impetuous Artayani\r\n(Shalya), showers of arrows like a mass of clouds pouring rain upon a\r\nmountain. Beholding Shalya struck by the Parthas on every side, both\r\nKritavarma and Kripa rushed in wrath towards that spot. Uluka also of\r\nmighty energy, and Shakuni the son of Subala, and the mighty car-warrior\r\nAshvatthama with smiles on his lips, and all thy sons protected Shalya by\r\nevery means in that battle. Piercing Bhimasena with three arrows,\r\nKritavarma, shooting a dense shower of shafts, checked that warrior who\r\nthen seemed to be the embodiment of wrath. Excited with rage, Kripa\r\nstruck Dhrishtadyumna with many arrows. Shakuni proceeded against the\r\nsons of Draupadi, and Ashvatthama against the twins. That foremost of\r\nwarriors, Duryodhana, possessed of fierce energy, proceeded, in that\r\nbattle, against Keshava and Arjuna, and endued with might, he struck them\r\nboth with many arrows. Thus hundreds of combats, O monarch, that were\r\nfierce and beautiful, took place between thy men and the enemy, on\r\ndiverse parts of the field. The chief of the Bhojas then slew the brown\r\nsteeds of Bhimasena's car in that encounter. The steedless son of Pandu,\r\nalighting from his car, began to fight with his mace, like the Destroyer\r\nhimself with his uplifted bludgeon. The ruler of the Madras then slew the\r\nsteeds of Sahadeva before his eyes. Then Sahadeva slew Shalya's son with\r\nhis sword. The preceptor Gautama (Kripa) once more fearlessly fought with\r\nDhrishtadyumna, both exerting themselves with great care. The preceptor's\r\nson Ashvatthama, without much wrath and as if smiling in that battle,\r\npierced each of the five heroic sons of Draupadi with ten arrows. Once\r\nmore the steeds of Bhimasena were slain in that battle. The steedless son\r\nof Pandu, quickly alighting from his car, took up his mace like the\r\nDestroyer taking his bludgeon. Excited with wrath, that mighty hero\r\ncrushed the steeds and the car of Kritavarma. Jumping down from his\r\nvehicle, Kritavarma then fled away. Shalya also, excited with rage, O\r\nking, slaughtered many Somakas and Pandavas, and once more afflicted\r\nYudhishthira with many keen shafts. Then the valiant Bhima, biting his\r\nnether lip, and infuriate with rage, took up his mace in that battle, and\r\naimed it at Shalya for the latter's destruction. Resembling the very\r\nbludgeon of Yama, impending (upon the head of the foe) like kala-ratri\r\n(Death Night), exceedingly destructive of the lives of elephants and\r\nsteeds and human beings, twined round with cloth of gold, looking like a\r\nblazing meteor, equipped with a sling, fierce as a she-snake, hard as\r\nthunder, and made wholly of iron, smeared with sandal-paste and other\r\nunguents like a desirable lady, smutted with marrow and fat and blood,\r\nresembling the very tongue of Yama, producing shrill sounds in\r\nconsequence of the bells attached to it, like unto the thunder of Indra,\r\nresembling in shape a snake of virulent poison just freed from its\r\nslough, drenched with the juicy secretions of elephants, inspiring\r\nhostile troops with terror and friendly troops with joy, celebrated in\r\nthe world of men, and capable of riving mountain summits, that mace, with\r\nwhich the mighty son of Kunti had in Kailasa challenged the enraged Lord\r\nof Alaka, the friend of Maheshvara, that weapon with which Bhima, though\r\nresisted by many, had in wrath slain a large number of proud Guhyakas\r\nendued with powers of illusion on the breasts of Gandhamadana for the\r\nsake of procuring Mandara flowers for doing what was agreeable to\r\nDraupadi, uplifting that mace which was rich with diamonds and jewels and\r\ngems and possessed of eight sides and celebrated as Indra's thunder, the\r\nmighty-armed son of Pandu now rushed against Shalya. With that mace of\r\nawful sound, Bhima, skilled in battle, crushed the four steeds of Shalya\r\nthat were possessed of great fleetness. Then the heroic Shalya, excited\r\nwith wrath in that battle, hurled a lance at the broad chest of Bhima and\r\nuttered a loud shout. That lance, piercing through the armour of Pandu's\r\nson, presented into his body. Vrikodara, however, fearlessly plucking out\r\nthe weapon, pierced therewith the driver of Shalya in the chest. His\r\nvitals pierced, the driver, vomiting blood, fell down with agitated\r\nheart. At this, the ruler of the Madras came down from his car and\r\ncheerlessly gazed at Bhima. Beholding his own feat thus counteracted,\r\nShalya became filled with wonder. Of tranquil soul, the ruler of the\r\nMadras took up his mace and began to cast his glances upon his foe.\r\nBeholding that terrible feat of his in battle, the Parthas, with cheerful\r\nhearts, worshipped Bhima who was incapable of being tired with exertion.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Seeing his driver fallen, Shalya, O king, quickly took up\r\nhis mace made wholly of iron and stood immovable as a bull. Bhima,\r\nhowever, armed with his mighty mace, rushed impetuously towards Shalya\r\nwho then looked like the blazing Yuga-fire, or the Destroyer armed with\r\nthe noose, or the Kailasa mountain with its formidable crest, or Vasava\r\nwith his thunder, or Mahadeva with his trident, or an infuriate elephant\r\nin the forest. At that time the blare of thousands of conchs and trumpets\r\nand loud leonine roars arose there, enhancing the delight of heroes. The\r\ncombatants of both armies, looking at those two foremost of warriors from\r\nevery side, applauded them both, saying, \"Excellent, Excellent! Save the\r\nruler of the Madras, or Rama, that delighter of the Yadus, there is none\r\nelse that can venture to endure the impetuosity of Bhima in battle.\r\nSimilarly, save Bhima, there is no other warrior that can venture to\r\nendure the force of the mace of the illustrious king of the Madras in\r\nbattle.\" Those two combatants then, Vrikodara and the ruler of the\r\nMadras, roaring like bulls, careered in circles, frequently jumping up in\r\nthe air. In that encounter between those two lions among men, no\r\ndifference could be noticed between them either in respect of their\r\ncareering in circles or of their wielding the mace. The mace of Shalya,\r\nwrapped round with a resplendent cloth of gold that looked like a sheet\r\nof fire, inspired the spectators with dread. Similarly, the mace of the\r\nhigh-souled Bhima, as the latter careered in circles, looked like\r\nlightning in the midst of the clouds. Struck by the ruler of the Madras\r\nwith his mace, the mace of Bhima, O king, produced sparks of fire in the\r\nwelkin which thereupon seemed to be ablaze. Similarly, struck by Bhima\r\nwith his mace, the mace of Shalya produced a shower of blazing coals\r\nwhich seemed exceedingly wonderful. Like two gigantic elephants striking\r\neach other with their tusks, or two huge bulls striking each other with\r\ntheir horns, those two heroes began to strike each other with their\r\nforemost of maces, like a couple of combatants striking each other with\r\niron bound clubs. Their limbs being struck with each other's mace, they\r\nsoon became bathed in blood and looked handsomer in consequence like two\r\nflowering Kinsukas. Struck by the ruler of the Madras on both his left\r\nand right, the mighty-armed Bhimasena stood immovable like a mountain.\r\nSimilarly, though struck repeatedly with the force of Bhima's mace,\r\nShalya, O king, moved not, like a mountain assailed by an elephant with\r\nhis tusks. The noise made by the blows of the maces of those two lions\r\namong men was heard on all sides like successive peals of thunder. Having\r\nceased for a moment, those two warriors of great energy once more began,\r\nwith uplifted maces, to career in closer circles. Once more the clash\r\ntook place between those two warriors of superhuman feats, each having\r\nadvanced towards the other by eight steps, and each assailing the other\r\nwith his uplifted iron club. Then, wishing to get at each other, they\r\nonce more careered in circles. Both accomplished (in the use of the mace)\r\nthey began to display their superiority of skill. Uplifting their\r\nterrible weapons, they then again struck each other like mountains\r\nstriking each other with their crests at the time of an earthquake.\r\nExceedingly crushed with each other's mace in consequence of each other's\r\nstrength, both those heroes fell down at the same time like a couple of\r\npoles set up for Indra's worship. The brave combatants then of both\r\narmies, at that sight, uttered cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" Struck with\r\ngreat force in their vital limbs, both of them had become exceedingly\r\nagitated. Then the mighty Kripa, taking up Shalya, that bull among the\r\nMadras, on his own car, quickly bore him away from the field of battle.\r\nWithin, however, the twinkling of an eye, Bhimasena, rising up, and still\r\nreeling as if drunk, challenged, with uplifted mace, the ruler of the\r\nMadras. Then the heroic warriors of thy army, armed with diverse weapons,\r\nfought with the Pandavas, causing diverse musical instruments to be blown\r\nand beat. With uplifted arms and weapons and making a loud noise, O\r\nmonarch, thy warriors headed by Duryodhana rushed against the Pandavas.\r\nBeholding the Kaurava host, the sons of Pandu, with leonine roars, rushed\r\nagainst those warriors headed by Duryodhana. Then thy son, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, singling out Chekitana amongst those rushing heroes,\r\npierced him deeply with a lance in the chest. Thus assailed by thy son,\r\nChekitana fell down on the terrace of his car, covered with blood, and\r\novercome with a deep swoon. Beholding Chekitana slain, the great\r\ncar-warriors among the Pandavas incessantly poured their arrowy showers\r\n(upon the Kauravas). Indeed, the Pandavas, inspired with desire of\r\nvictory, O monarch, careered beautifully on all sides amongst thy\r\ndivisions. Kripa, and Kritavarma, and the mighty son of Subala, placing\r\nthe ruler of the Madras before them, fought with king Yudhishthira the\r\njust. Duryodhana, O monarch, fought with Dhrishtadyumna, the slayer of\r\nBharadwaja's son, that hero endued with abundant energy and prowess.\r\n3,000 cars, O king, despatched by thy son and headed by Drona's son,\r\nbattled with Vijaya (Arjuna). All those combatants, O king, had firmly\r\nresolved to win victory and had cast off fear with life itself. Indeed, O\r\nking, thy warriors penetrated into the midst of the Pandava army like\r\nswans into a large lake. A fierce battle then took place between the\r\nKurus and the Pandavas, the combatants being actuated with the desire of\r\nslaughtering one another and deriving great pleasure from giving and\r\nreceiving blows. During the progress, O king, of that battle which was\r\ndestructive of great heroes, an earthly dust, terrible to behold, was\r\nraised by the wind. From only the names we heard (of the Pandava\r\nwarriors) that were uttered in course of that battle and from those (of\r\nthe Kuru warriors) that were uttered by the Pandavas, we knew the\r\ncombatants that fought with one another fearlessly. That dust, however, O\r\ntiger among men, was soon dispelled by the blood that was shed, and all\r\nthe points of the compass became once more clear when that dusty darkness\r\nwas driven away. Indeed, during the progress of that terrible and awful\r\nbattle, no one among either thy warriors or those of the foe, turned his\r\nback. Desirous of attaining to the regions of Brahman and longing for\r\nvictory by fair fight, the combatants displayed their prowess, inspired\r\nwith the hope of heaven. For paying off the debt they owed to their\r\nmasters on account of the sustenance granted by the latter, or firmly\r\nresolved to accomplish the objects of their friends and allies, the\r\nwarriors, with hearts fixed on heaven, fought with one another on that\r\noccasion. Shooting and hurling weapons of diverse kinds, great\r\ncar-warriors roared at or smote one another. \"Slay, pierce, seize,\r\nstrike, cut off!\" These were the words that were heard in that battle,\r\nuttered by the warriors and those of the foe. Then Shalya, O monarch,\r\ndesirous of slaying him, pierced king Yudhishthira the just, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior with many sharp arrows. Conversant with what are the vital\r\nlimbs of the body, the son of Pritha, however, O monarch, with the\r\ngreatest ease, struck the ruler of the Madras with four and ten\r\ncloth-yard shafts, aiming at the latter's vital limbs. Resisting the son\r\nof Pandu with his shafts, Shalya of great fame, filled with rage and\r\ndesirous of slaying his adversary, pierced him in that battle with\r\ninnumerable arrows equipped with Kanka feathers. Once more, O monarch, he\r\nstruck Yudhishthira with a straight shaft in the very sight of all the\r\ntroops. King Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great fame and filled\r\nwith rage, pierced the ruler of the Madras with many keen arrows equipped\r\nwith feathers of Kankas and peacocks. The mighty car-warrior then pierced\r\nCandrasena with seventy arrows and Shalya's driver with nine, and\r\nDrumasena with four and sixty. When the two protectors of his car-wheels\r\nwere (thus) slain by the high-souled son of Pandu, Shalya, O king, slew\r\nfive and twenty warriors among the Cedis. And he pierced Satyaki with\r\nfive and twenty keen arrows, and Bhimasena with seven, and the two sons\r\nof Madri with a hundred, in that battle. While Shalya was thus careering\r\nin that battle, that best of kings, the son of Pritha, sped at him many\r\nshafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison. With a broad-headed\r\narrow, Yudhishthira the son of Kunti then cut off from his car the\r\nstandard top of his adversary as the latter stood in his front. We saw\r\nthe standard of Shalya, which was thus cut off by the son of Pandu in\r\nthat great battle, fall down like a riven mountain summit. Seeing his\r\nstandard fallen and observing the son of Pandu standing before him, the\r\nruler of the Madras became filled with rage and shot showers of shafts.\r\nThat bull amongst Kshatriyas, Shalya of immeasurable soul, poured over\r\nthe Kshatriyas in that battle dense showers of arrows like the deity of\r\nthe clouds pouring torrents of rain. Piercing Satyaki and Bhimasena and\r\nthe twin sons of Madri by Pandu, each with five arrows, he afflicted\r\nYudhishthira greatly. We then, O monarch, beheld a net of arrows spread\r\nbefore the chest of Pandu's son like a mass of risen clouds. The mighty\r\ncar-warrior Shalya, in that battle, filled with rage, shrouded\r\nYudhishthira with straight shafts. At this, king Yudhishthira afflicted\r\nwith those showers of shafts, felt himself deprived of his prowess, even\r\nas the Asura Jambha had become before the slayer of Vritra.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'When king Yudhishthira the just was thus afflicted by the\r\nruler of Madras, Satyaki and Bhimasena and the two sons of Madri by\r\nPandu, encompassing Shalya with their cars, began to afflict him in that\r\nbattle. Beholding the unsupported Shalya thus afflicted by those great\r\ncar-warriors (and seeing him successfully repel those attacks), loud\r\nsounds of applause were heard, and the Siddhas (who witnessed the\r\nencounter) became filled with delight. The ascetics, assembled together\r\n(for witnessing the battle), declared it to be wonderful. Then Bhimasena\r\nin that encounter, having pierced Shalya who had become (as his name\r\nimplied) an irresistible dart in prowess, with one arrow, next pierced\r\nhim with seven. Satyaki, desirous of rescuing the son of Dharma, pierced\r\nShalya with a hundred arrows and uttered a loud leonine roar. Nakula\r\npierced him with five arrows, and Sahadeva with seven; the latter then\r\nonce more pierced him with as many. The heroic ruler of the Madras,\r\nstruggling carefully in that battle, thus afflicted by those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, drew a formidable bow capable of bearing a great strain and\r\nof imparting great force to the shafts sped from it, and pierced Satyaki,\r\nO sire, with five and twenty shafts and Bhima with three and seventy and\r\nNakula with seven. Then cutting off with a broad-headed arrow the bow,\r\nwith shaft fixed on the string of Sahadeva, he pierced Sahadeva himself,\r\nin that battle, with three and seventy shafts. Sahadeva then, stringing\r\nanother bow, pierced his maternal uncle of great splendour with five\r\nshafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison or blazing fire. Filled\r\nwith great rage, he then struck his adversary's driver with a straight\r\nshaft in that battle and then Shalya himself once more with three. Then\r\nBhimasena pierced the ruler of the Madras with seventy arrows, and\r\nSatyaki pierced him with nine, and king Yudhishthira with sixty. Thus\r\npierced, O monarch, by those mighty car-warriors, blood began to flow\r\nfrom Shalya's body, like crimson streams, running down the breast of a\r\nmountain of red chalk. Shalya, however, quickly pierced in return each of\r\nthose great bowmen with five arrows, O king, which feat seemed\r\nexceedingly wonderful. With another broad-headed arrow, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior then, O sire, cut off the stringed bow of Dharma's son in\r\nthat encounter. Taking up another bow, that great car-warrior, the son of\r\nDharma, covered Shalya, his steeds, and driver, and standard, and car,\r\nwith many arrows. Thus shrouded in that battle by the son of Dharma with\r\nhis shafts, Shalya struck the former with ten keen arrows. Then Satyaki,\r\nfilled with rage upon beholding the son of Dharma thus afflicted with\r\nshafts, checked the heroic ruler of the Madras with clouds of arrows. At\r\nthis, Shalya cut off with a razor-faced arrow the formidable bow of\r\nSatyaki, and pierced each of the other Pandava warriors with three\r\narrows. Filled with rage, O monarch, Satyaki of unbaffled prowess then\r\nhurled at Shalya a lance equipped with a golden staff and decked with\r\nmany jewels and gems. Bhimasena sped at him a cloth-yard shaft that\r\nlooked like a blazing snake; Nakula hurled at him a dart, Sahadeva an\r\nexcellent mace, and the son of Dharma a Sataghni impelled by the desire\r\nof despatching him. The ruler of the Madras, however, quickly baffled in\r\nthat battle all those weapons, hurled from the arms of those five\r\nwarriors at him, as these coursed towards his car. With a number of\r\nbroad-headed arrows Shalya cut off the lance hurled by Satyaki. Possessed\r\nof valour and great lightness of hand, he cut off into two fragments the\r\ngold-decked shaft sped at him by Bhima. He then resisted with clouds of\r\nshafts the terrible dart, equipped with a golden handle, that Nakula had\r\nsped at him and the mace also that Sahadeva had thrown. With a couple of\r\nother arrows, O Bharata, he cut off the Sataghni sped at him by the king,\r\nin the very sight of the sons of Pandu, and uttered a loud leonine roar.\r\nThe grandson of Sini, however, could not endure the defeat of his weapon\r\nin that battle. Insensate with rage, Satyaki took up another bow and\r\npierced the ruler of the Madras with two shafts and his driver with\r\nthree. At this, Shalya, O monarch, excited with rage, deeply pierced all\r\nof them with ten arrows, like persons piercing mighty elephants with\r\nsharp-pointed lances. Thus checked in that battle by the ruler of the\r\nMadras, O Bharata, those slayers of foes became unable to stay in front\r\nof Shalya. King Duryodhana, beholding the prowess of Shalya, regarded the\r\nPandavas, the Pancalas, and the Srinjayas as already slain. Then, O king,\r\nthe mighty-armed Bhimasena, possessed of great prowess and mentally\r\nresolved to cast off his life-breaths, encountered the ruler of the\r\nMadras. Nakula and Sahadeva and Satyaki of great might, encompassing\r\nShalya, shot their arrows at him from every side. Though encompassed by\r\nthose four great bowmen and mighty car-warriors among the Pandavas, the\r\nvaliant ruler of the Madras still fought with them. Then, O king, the\r\nroyal son of Dharma, in that dreadful battle, quickly cut off with a\r\nrazor-headed arrow one of the protectors of Shalya's car-wheels. When\r\nthat brave and mighty car-warrior, that protector of Shalya's car-wheel,\r\nwas thus slain, Shalya of great strength covered the Pandava troops with\r\nshowers of arrows. Beholding his troops shrouded with arrows, O monarch,\r\nin that battle, king Yudhishthira the just began to reflect in this\r\nstrain, \"Verily, how shall those grave words of Madhava become true? I\r\nhope, the rider of the Madras, excited with rage, will not annihilate my\r\narmy in battle.' Then the Pandavas, O elder brother of Pandu\r\n(Dhritarashtra), with cars and elephants and steeds, approached the ruler\r\nof the Madras and began to afflict him from every side. Like the wind\r\ndispersing mighty masses of clouds, the king of the Madras, in that\r\nbattle, dispersed that risen shower of arrows and diverse other kinds of\r\nweapons in profusion. We then beheld the downpour of gold-winged arrows\r\nshot by Shalya coursing through the welkin like a flight of locusts.\r\nIndeed, those arrows shot by the ruler of the Madras from the van of\r\nbattle were seen to fall like swarms of birds. With the gold-decked\r\nshafts that issued from the bow of the Madra king, the welkin, O monarch,\r\nbecame so filled that there was not an inch of empty space. When a thick\r\ngloom appeared, caused by the arrows shot by the mighty ruler of the\r\nMadras owing to his extreme lightness of hands in that dreadful battle,\r\nand when they beheld the vast host of the Pandavas thus agitated by that\r\nhero, the gods and the Gandharvas became filled with great wonder.\r\nAfflicting with vigour all the Pandava warriors with his shafts from\r\nevery side, O sire, Shalya shrouded king Yudhishthira the just and roared\r\nrepeatedly like a lion. The mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, thus\r\nshrouded by Shalya in that battle, became unable to proceed against that\r\ngreat hero for fighting with him. Those, however, amongst the Pandavas,\r\nthat had Bhimasena at their head and that were led by king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, did not fly away from that ornament of battle, the brave\r\nShalya.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Arjuna, in that battle, pierced with many\r\narrows by the son of Drona as also by the latter's followers, the heroic\r\nand mighty car-warriors among the Trigartas, pierced Drona's son in\r\nreturn with three shafts, and each of the other warriors with two. Once\r\nagain, the mighty-armed Dhananjaya covered his enemies with showers of\r\nshafts. Though struck with keen arrows and though they looked like\r\nporcupines in consequence of those arrows sticking to their limbs, still\r\nthy troops, O bull of Bharata's race, fled not from Partha in that\r\nbattle. With Drona's son at their head, they encompassed that mighty\r\ncar-warrior and fought with him, shooting showers of shafts. The\r\ngold-decked arrows, O king, shot by them, speedily filled the terrace of\r\nArjuna's car. Beholding those two great bowmen, those two foremost of all\r\nwarriors, the two Krishnas, covered with arrows, those invincible\r\n(Kaurava) combatants became filled with delight. Indeed, at that time,\r\nthe Kuvara, the wheels, the shaft, the traces, the yoke, and the\r\nAnukarsha, O lord, of Arjuna's car, became entirely enveloped with\r\narrows. The like of what thy warriors then did unto Partha had never\r\nbefore, O king, been either seen or heard. That car looked resplendent\r\nwith those keen arrows of beautiful wings like a celestial vehicle\r\nblazing with hundreds of torches dropped on the Earth. Then Arjuna, O\r\nmonarch, covered that hostile division with showers of straight shafts\r\nlike a cloud pouring torrents of rain on a mountain. Struck in that\r\nbattle with arrows inscribed with Partha's name, those warriors,\r\nbeholding that state of things, regarded the field of battle to be full\r\nof Parthas. Then the Partha-fire, having for its wonderful flames and the\r\nloud twang of Gandiva for the wind that fanned it, began to consume the\r\nfuel constituted by thy troops. Then, O Bharata, heaps of fallen wheels\r\nand yokes, of quivers, of banners and standards, with the vehicles\r\nthemselves that bore them, of shafts and Anukarshas and Trivenus, of\r\naxles and traces and goads, of heads of warriors decked with earrings and\r\nheadgears, of arms, O monarch, and thighs in thousands of umbrellas along\r\nwith fans, and of diadems and crowns, were seen along the tracks of\r\nPartha's car. Indeed, along the track of the angry Partha's car, O\r\nmonarch, the ground, miry with blood, became impassable, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, like the sporting ground of Rudra. The scene inspired the timid\r\nwith fear and the brave with delight. Having destroyed 2,000 cars with\r\ntheir fences, that scorcher of foes, Partha, looked like a smokeless fire\r\nwith blazing flames. Indeed, even as the illustrious Agni when he blazes\r\nforth (at the end of the Yuga) for destroying the mobile and the immobile\r\nuniverse, even so looked, O king, the mighty car-warrior Partha.\r\nBeholding the prowess of Pandu's son in that battle, the son of Drona, on\r\nhis car equipped with many banners, endeavoured to check him. Those two\r\ntigers among men, both having white steeds yoked unto their vehicles and\r\nboth regarded as the foremost of car-warriors, quickly encountered each\r\nother, each desirous of slaying the other. The arrowy showers shot by\r\nboth became exceedingly terrible and were as dense, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, as the torrents of rain poured by two masses of clouds at the close\r\nof summer. Each challenging the other, those two warriors mangled each\r\nother with straight shafts in that battle, like a couple of bulls tearing\r\neach other with their horns. The battle between them, O king, was fought\r\nequally for a long while. The clash of weapons became terrific. The son\r\nof Drona then, O Bharata, pierced Arjuna with a dozen gold-winged arrows\r\nof great energy and Vasudeva with ten. Having shown for a short while\r\nsome regard for the preceptor's son in that great battle, Vibhatsu then,\r\nsmiling the while, stretched his bow Gandiva with force. Soon, however,\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Savyasaci (Arjuna) made his adversary steedless\r\nand driverless and carless, and without putting forth much strength\r\npierced him with three arrows. Staying on that steedless car, Drona's\r\nson, smiling the while, hurled at the son of Pandu a heavy mallet that\r\nlooked like a dreadful mace with iron-spikes. Beholding that weapon,\r\nwhich was decked with cloth of gold, coursing towards him, the heroic\r\nPartha, that slayer of foes, cut it off into seven fragments. Seeing his\r\nmallet cut off, Drona's son of great wrath took up a terrible mace\r\nequipped with iron spikes and looking like a mountain summit.\r\nAccomplished in battle, the son of Drona hurled it then at Partha.\r\nBeholding that spiked mace coursing towards him like the Destroyer\r\nhimself in rage, Pandu's son Arjuna quickly cut it off with five\r\nexcellent shafts. Cut off with Partha's shafts in that great battle, that\r\nweapon fell down on the Earth, riving the hearts, as it were, O Bharata,\r\nof the (hostile) kings. The son of Pandu then pierced Drona's son with\r\nthree other shafts. Though deeply pierced by the mighty Partha, Drona's\r\nson, however, of great might, relying upon his own manliness, showed no\r\nsign of fear or agitation. That great car-warrior, the son of Drona,\r\nthen, O king, shrouded Suratha (the Pancala) with showers of shafts\r\nbefore the eyes of all the Kshatriyas. At this, Suratha, that great\r\ncar-warrior among the Pancalas, in that battle, riding upon his car whose\r\nrattle was as deep as the roar of the clouds rushed against the son of\r\nDrona. Drawing his foremost of bows, firm and capable of bearing a great\r\nstrain, the Pancala hero covered Ashvatthama with arrows that resembled\r\nflames of fire or snakes of virulent poison. Seeing the great car-warrior\r\nSuratha rushing towards him in wrath, the son of Drona became filled with\r\nrage like a snake struck with a stick. Furrowing his brow into three\r\nlines, and licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue, he looked at\r\nSuratha in rage and then rubbed his bow-string and sped a keen cloth-yard\r\nshaft that resembled the fatal rod of Death. Endued with great speed,\r\nthat shaft pierced the heart of Suratha and passing out entered the\r\nEarth, riving her through, like the thunderbolt of Shakra hurled from the\r\nsky. Struck with that shaft, Suratha fell down on the Earth like a\r\nmountain summit riven with thunder. After the fall of that hero, the\r\nvaliant son of Drona, that foremost of car-warriors speedily mounted upon\r\nthe vehicle of his slain foe. Then, O monarch, that warrior, invincible\r\nin battle, the son of Drona, well-equipped with armour and weapons, and\r\nsupported by the Samsaptakas, fought with Arjuna. That battle, at the\r\nhour of noon, between one and the many, enhancing the population of\r\nYama's domains, became exceedingly fierce. Wonderful was the sight that\r\nwe then beheld, for, noticing the prowess of all those combatants,\r\nArjuna, alone and unsupported, fought with his foes at the same time. The\r\nencounter was exceedingly fierce that thus took place between Arjuna and\r\nhis enemies, resembling that between Indra, in days of yore, and the vast\r\nhost of the Asuras.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Duryodhana, O king, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of\r\nPrishata, fought a fierce battle, using arrows and darts in profusion.\r\nBoth of them, O monarch, shot showers of arrows like showers of rain\r\npoured by the clouds in the rainy season. The (Kuru) king, having pierced\r\nwith five arrows the slayer of Drona, Prishata's son of fierce shafts,\r\nonce more pierced him with seven arrows. Endued with great might and\r\nsteady prowess, Dhrishtadyumna, in that battle, afflicted Duryodhana with\r\nseventy arrows. Beholding the king thus afflicted, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, his uterine brothers, accompanied by a large force, encompassed the\r\nson of Prishata. Surrounded by those Atirathas on every side, the Pancala\r\nhero, O king, careered in that battle, displaying his quickness in the\r\nuse of weapons. Shikhandi, supported by the Prabhadrakas, fought with two\r\nKuru bowmen, Kritavarma and the great car-warrior Kripa. Then also, O\r\nmonarch, that battle became fierce and awful since the warriors were all\r\nresolved to lay down their lives and since all of them fought, making\r\nlife the stake. Shalya, shooting showers of shafts on all sides,\r\nafflicted the Pandavas with Satyaki and Vrikodara amongst them. With\r\npatience and great strength, O monarch, the king of the Madras at the\r\nsame time fought with the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), each of whom\r\nresembled the Destroyer himself in prowess. The great car-warriors among\r\nthe Pandavas who were mangled in that great battle with the shafts of\r\nShalya, failed to find a protector. Then the heroic Nakula, the son of\r\nMadri, seeing king Yudhishthira the just greatly afflicted, rushed with\r\nspeed against his maternal uncle. Shrouding Shalya in that battle (with\r\nmany arrows), Nakula, that slayer of hostile heroes, smiling the while,\r\npierced him in the centre of the chest with ten arrows, made entirely of\r\niron, polished by the hands of the smith, equipped with wings of gold,\r\nwhetted on stone, and propelled from his bow with great force. Afflicted\r\nby his illustrious nephew, Shalya afflicted his nephew in return with\r\nmany straight arrows. Then king Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena, and Satyaki,\r\nand Sahadeva, the son of Madri, all rushed against the ruler of the\r\nMadras. The vanquisher of foes, the generalissimo of the Kuru army,\r\nreceived in that battle all those heroes that rushed towards him quickly,\r\nfilling the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass with the\r\nrattle of their cars and causing the Earth to tremble therewith. Piercing\r\nYudhishthira with three arrows and Bhima with seven, Shalya pierced\r\nSatyaki with a hundred arrows in that battle and Sahadeva with three.\r\nThen the ruler of the Madras, O sire, cut off, with a razor-headed arrow,\r\nthe bow with arrow fixed on it of the high-souled Nakula. Struck with\r\nShalya's shafts, that bow broke into pieces. Taking up another bow,\r\nMadri's son, that great car-warrior quickly covered the ruler of the\r\nMadras with winged arrows. Then Yudhishthira and Sahadeva, O sire, each\r\npierced the ruler of the Madras with ten arrows in the chest. Bhimasena\r\nand Satyaki, rushing at the ruler of the Madras, both struck him with\r\narrows winged with Kanka feathers, the former with sixty, and the latter\r\nwith nine. Filled with rage at this, the ruler of the Madras pierced\r\nSatyaki with nine arrows and once again with seventy straight shafts.\r\nThen, O sire, he cut off at the handle the bow, with arrow fixed on it,\r\nof Satyaki and then despatched the four steeds of the latter to Yama's\r\nabode. Having made Satyaki carless, that mighty car-warrior, the ruler of\r\nthe Madras, struck him with a hundred arrows from every side. He next\r\npierced two angry sons of Madri, and Bhimasena the son of Pandu, and\r\nYudhishthira, O thou of Kuru's race, with ten arrows each. The prowess\r\nthat we then beheld of the ruler of the Madras was exceedingly wonderful,\r\nsince the Parthas, even unitedly, could not approach him in that battle.\r\nRiding then upon another car, the mighty Satyaki, of prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, beholding the Pandavas afflicted and succumbing to the\r\nruler of the Madras, rushed with speed against him. That ornament of\r\nassemblies, Shalya, on his car, rushed against the car of Satyaki, like\r\none infuriate elephant against another. The collision that then took\r\nplace between Satyaki and the heroic ruler of the Madras, became fierce\r\nand wonderful to behold, even like that which had taken place in days of\r\nyore between the Asura Samvara and the chief of the celestials. Beholding\r\nthe ruler of the Madras staying before him in that battle, Satyaki\r\npierced him with ten arrows and said, \"Wait, Wait!\" Deeply pierced by\r\nthat high-souled warrior, the ruler of the Madras pierced Satyaki in\r\nreturn with sharp shafts equipped with beautiful feathers. Those great\r\nbowmen then, the Parthas, beholding the king of the Madras assailed by\r\nSatyaki, quickly rushed towards him from desire of slaying that maternal\r\nuncle of theirs. The encounter then that took place between those\r\nstruggling heroes, marked by a great flow of blood, became exceedingly\r\nawful, like that which takes place between a number of roaring lions. The\r\nstruggle, O monarch, that took between them resembled that which takes\r\nplace between a number of roaring lions fighting with each other for\r\nmeat. With the dense showers of shafts shot by them, the Earth became\r\nentirely enveloped, and the welkin also suddenly became one mass of\r\narrows. All around the field a darkness was caused by those arrows.\r\nIndeed, with the shafts shot by those illustrious warriors, a shadow as\r\nthat of the clouds was caused there. Then, O king, with those blazing\r\nshafts sped by the warriors, that were equipped with wings of gold and\r\nthat looked like snakes just freed from their sloughs, the points of the\r\ncompass seemed to be ablaze. That slayer of foes, Shalya, then achieved\r\nthe most wonderful feat, since that hero alone, and unsupported,\r\ncontended with many heroes in that battle. The Earth became shrouded with\r\nthe fierce shafts, equipped with feathers of Kankas and peacocks, that\r\nfell, sped from the arms of the ruler of the Madras. Then, O king, we\r\nbeheld the car of Shalya careering in that dreadful battle like the car\r\nof Shakra in days of yore on the occasion of the destruction of the\r\nAsuras.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Then, O lord, thy troops, with Shalya at their head, once\r\nmore rushed against the Parthas in that battle with great impetuosity.\r\nAlthough afflicted, still these troops of thine, who were fierce in\r\nbattle, rushing against the Parthas, very soon agitated them in\r\nconsequence of their superior numbers. Struck by the Kurus, the Pandava\r\ntroops, in the very sight of the two Krishnas, stayed not on the field,\r\nthough sought to be checked by Bhimasena. Filled with rage at this,\r\nDhananjaya covered Kripa and his followers, as also Kritavarma, with\r\nshowers of shafts. Sahadeva checked Shakuni with all his forces. Nakula\r\ncast his glances on the ruler of the Madras from one of his flanks. The\r\n(five) sons of Draupadi checked numerous kings (of the Kuru army). The\r\nPancala prince Shikhandi resisted the son of Drona. Armed with his mace,\r\nBhimasena held the king in check, and Kunti's son Yudhishthira resisted\r\nShalya at the head of his forces. The battle then commenced once more\r\nbetween those pairs as they stood, among thy warriors and those of the\r\nenemy, none of whom had ever retreated from fight. We then beheld the\r\nhighly wonderful feat that Shalya achieved, since, alone, he fought with\r\nthe whole Pandava army. Shalya then, as he stayed in the vicinity of\r\nYudhishthira in that battle, looked like the planet Saturn in the\r\nvicinity of the Moon. Afflicting the king with shafts that resembled\r\nsnakes of virulent poison, Shalya rushed against Bhima, covering him with\r\nshowers of arrows. Beholding that lightness of hand and that mastery over\r\nweapons displayed by Shalya the troops of both the armies applauded him\r\nhighly. Afflicted by Shalya the Pandavas, exceedingly mangled, fled away,\r\nleaving the battle, and disregarding the cries of Yudhishthira commanding\r\nthem to stop. While his troops were thus being slaughtered by the ruler\r\nof the Madras, Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira the just, became filled\r\nwith rage. Relying upon his prowess, that mighty car-warrior began to\r\nafflict the ruler of the Madras, resolved to either win the battle or\r\nmeet with death. Summoning all his brothers and also Krishna of Madhu's\r\nrace, he said unto them, \"Bhishma, and Drona, and Karna, and the other\r\nkings, that put forth their prowess for the sake of the Kauravas, have\r\nall perished in battle. You all have exerted your valour according to\r\nyour courage and in respect of the shares allotted to you. Only one\r\nshare--mine--that is constituted by the mighty car-warrior Shalya,\r\nremains. I desire to vanquish that ruler of the Madras today in battle.\r\nWhatever wishes I have regarding the accomplishment of that task I will\r\nnow tell you. These two heroes, the two sons of Madravati, will become\r\nthe protectors of my wheels. They are counted as heroes incapable of\r\nbeing vanquished by Vasava himself. Keeping the duties of a Kshatriya\r\nbefore them, these two that are deserving of every honour and are firm in\r\ntheir vows, will fight with their maternal uncle. Either Shalya will slay\r\nme in battle or I will slay him. Blessed be ye. Listen to these true\r\nwords, you foremost of heroes in the world. Observant of Kshatriya\r\nduties, I will fight with my maternal uncle, you lords of Earth, firmly\r\nresolved to either obtain victory or be slain. Let them that furnish cars\r\nquickly supply my vehicle, according to the rules of science, with\r\nweapons and all kinds of implements in a larger measure than Shalya's.\r\nThe grandson of Sini will protect my right wheel, and Dhrishtadyumna my\r\nleft. Let Pritha's son Dhananjaya guard my rear today. And let Bhima,\r\nthat foremost of all wielders of weapons, fight in my front. I shall thus\r\nbe superior to Shalya in the great battle that will occur.\" Thus\r\naddressed by the king, all his well-wishers did as they were requested.\r\nThen the Pandava troops once more became filled with joy, especially the\r\nPancalas, the Somakas and the Matsyas. Having made that vow, the king\r\nproceeded against the ruler of the Madras. The Pancalas then blew and\r\nbeat innumerable conchs and drums and uttered leonine roars. Endued with\r\ngreat activity and filled with rage, they rushed, with loud shouts of\r\njoy, against the ruler of the Madras, that bull among the Kurus. And they\r\ncaused the Earth to resound with the noise of the elephants' bells, and\r\nthe loud blare of conchs and trumpets. Then thy son and the valiant ruler\r\nof the Madras, like the Udaya and the Asta hills, received those\r\nassailants. Boasting of his prowess in battle, Shalya poured a shower of\r\narrows on that chastiser of foes, king Yudhishthira the just, like\r\nMaghavat pouring rain. The high-souled king of the Kurus also having\r\ntaken up his beautiful bow displayed those diverse kinds of lessons that\r\nDrona had taught him. And he poured successive showers of arrows\r\nbeautifully, quickly, and with great skill. As he careered in battle,\r\nnone could mark any lapses in him. Shalya and Yudhishthira, both endued\r\nwith great prowess in battle, mangled each other, like a couple of tigers\r\nfighting for a piece of meat. Bhima was engaged with thy son, that\r\ndelighter in battle. The Pancala prince (Dhrishtadyumna), Satyaki, and\r\nthe two sons of Madri by Pandu, received Shakuni and the other Kuru\r\nheroes around. In consequence of thy evil policy, O king, there again\r\noccurred in that spot an awful battle between thy warriors and those of\r\nthe foe, all of whom were inspired with the desire of victory. Duryodhana\r\nthen, with a straight shaft, aiming at the gold-decked standard of Bhima,\r\ncut off in that battle. The beautiful standard of Bhimasena, adorned with\r\nmany bells, fell down, O giver of honours. Once more the king, with a\r\nsharp razor-faced arrow, cut off the beautiful bow of Bhima that looked\r\nlike the trunk of an elephant. Endued with great energy, the bowless\r\nBhima then, putting forth his prowess pierced the chest of thy son with a\r\ndart. At this, thy son sat down on the terrace of his car. When\r\nDuryodhana swooned away, Vrikodara once more, with razor-faced shaft, cut\r\noff the head of his driver from his trunk. The steeds of Duryodhana's\r\ncar, deprived of their driver, ran wildly on all sides, O Bharata,\r\ndragging the car after them, at which loud wails arose (in the Kuru\r\narmy). Then the mighty car-warrior Ashvatthama, and Kripa and Kritavarma,\r\nfollowed that car, desirous of rescuing thy son. The (Kaurava) troops (at\r\nsight of this) became exceedingly agitated. The followers of Duryodhana\r\nbecame terrified. At that time, the wielder of Gandiva, drawing his bow,\r\nbegan to slay them with his arrows. Then Yudhishthira, excited with rage,\r\nrushed against the ruler of the Madras, himself urging his steeds white\r\nas ivory and fleet as thought. We then saw something that was wonderful\r\nin Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, for though very mild and soft, he then\r\nbecame exceedingly fierce. With eyes opened wide and body trembling in\r\nrage, the son of Kunti cut off hostile warriors in hundreds and thousands\r\nby means of his sharp shafts. Those amongst the soldiers against whom the\r\neldest Pandava proceeded, were overthrown by him, O king, like mountain\r\nsummits riven with thunder. Felling cars with steeds and drivers and\r\nstandards and throwing down car-warriors in large numbers, Yudhishthira,\r\nwithout any assistance, began to sport there like a mighty wind\r\ndestroying masses of clouds. Filled with rage, he destroyed steeds with\r\nriders and steeds without riders and foot-soldiers by thousands in that\r\nbattle, like Rudra destroying living creatures (at the time of the\r\nuniversal dissolution). Having made the field empty by shooting his\r\nshafts on all sides, Yudhishthira rushed against the ruler of the Madras\r\nand said, \"Wait, Wait!\" Beholding the feats then of that hero of terrible\r\ndeeds, all thy warriors became inspired with fear. Shalya, however,\r\nproceeded against him. Both of them filled with rage, blew their conchs.\r\nReturning and challenging each other, each then encountered the other.\r\nThen Shalya covered Yudhishthira with showers of arrows. Similarly, the\r\nson of Kunti covered the ruler of the Madras with showers of arrows. Then\r\nthose two heroes, the ruler of the Madras and Yudhishthira, mangled in\r\nthat battle with each other's arrows and bathed in blood, looked like a\r\nSalmali and a Kinsuka tree decked with flowers. Both possessed of\r\nsplendour and both invincible in battle, those two illustrious warriors\r\nuttered loud roars. Beholding them both, the soldiers could not conclude\r\nwhich of them would be victorious. Whether the son of Pritha would enjoy\r\nthe Earth, having slain Shalya, or whether Shalya having slain the son of\r\nPandu would bestow the Earth on Duryodhana, could not be ascertained, O\r\nBharata, by the warriors present there. King Yudhishthira, in course of\r\nthat battle, placed his foes to his right. Then Shalya shot a hundred\r\nforemost of arrows at Yudhishthira. With another arrow of great\r\nsharpness, he cut off the latter's bow. Taking up another bow,\r\nYudhishthira pierced Shalya with three hundred shafts and cut off the\r\nlatter's bow with a razor-faced arrow. The son of Pandu then slew the\r\nfour steeds of his antagonist with some straight arrows. With two other\r\nvery sharp shafts, he then cut off the two Parshni drivers of Shalya.\r\nThen with another blazing, well-tempered and sharp shaft, he cut off the\r\nstandard of Shalya staying in his front. Then, O chastiser of foes, the\r\narmy of Duryodhana broke. The son of Drona, at this time, speedily\r\nproceeded towards the ruler of the Madras who had been reduced to that\r\nplight, and quickly taking him up on his own car, fled away quickly.\r\nAfter the two had proceeded for a moment, they heard Yudhishthira roar\r\naloud. Stopping, the ruler of the Madras then ascended another car that\r\nhad been equipped duly. That best of cars had a rattle deep as the roar\r\nof the clouds. Well furnished with weapons and instruments and all kinds\r\nof utensils, that vehicle made the hair of foes stand on end.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Taking up another bow that was very strong and much\r\ntougher, the ruler of the Madras pierced Yudhishthira and roared like a\r\nlion. Then that bull amongst Kshatriyas, of immeasurable soul, poured\r\nupon all the Kshatriyas showers of arrows, even like the deity of the\r\nclouds pouring rain in torrents. Piercing Satyaki with ten arrows and\r\nBhima with three and Sahadeva with as many, he afflicted Yudhishthira\r\ngreatly. And he afflicted all the other great bowmen with their steeds\r\nand cars and elephants with many shafts like hunters afflicting elephants\r\nwith blazing brands. Indeed, that foremost of car-warriors destroyed\r\nelephants and elephant-riders, horses and horsemen and cars and\r\ncar-warriors. And he cut off the arms of combatants with weapons in grasp\r\nand the standards of vehicles, and caused the Earth to be strewn with\r\n(slain) warriors like the sacrificial altar with blades of Kusa grass.\r\nThen the Pandus, the Pancalas, and the Somakas, filled with rage,\r\nencompassed that hero who was thus slaughtering their troops like\r\nall-destroying Death. Bhimasena, and the grandson of Sini, and those two\r\nforemost of men, the two sons of Madri, encompassed that warrior while he\r\nwas fighting with the (Pandava) king of terrible might. And all of them\r\nchallenged him to battle. Then those heroes, O king, having obtained the\r\nruler of the Madras, that foremost of warriors, in battle, checked that\r\nfirst of men in that encounter and began to strike him with winged arrows\r\nof fierce energy. Protected by Bhimasena, and by the two sons of Madri,\r\nand by him of Madhu's race, the royal son of Dharma struck the ruler of\r\nthe Madras in the centre of the chest with winged arrows of fierce\r\nenergy. Then the car-warriors and other combatants of thy army, clad in\r\nmail and equipped with weapons, beholding the ruler of the Madras\r\nexceedingly afflicted with arrows in that battle, surrounded him on all\r\nsides, at the command of Duryodhana. The ruler of the Madras at this time\r\nquickly pierced Yudhishthira with seven arrows in that battle. The\r\nhigh-souled son of Pritha, O king, in return, pierced his foe with nine\r\narrows in that dreadful encounter. Those two great car-warriors, the\r\nruler of the Madras and Yudhishthira, began to cover each other with\r\narrows, washed in oil and shot from their bowstrings stretched to their\r\nears. Those two best of kings, both endued with great strength, both\r\nincapable of being defeated by foes, and both foremost of car-warriors,\r\nwatchful of each other's lapses, quickly and deeply pierced each other\r\nwith each other's shafts. The loud noise of their bows, bowstrings, and\r\npalms resembled that of Indra's thunder as those high-souled warriors,\r\nthe brave ruler of the Madras and the heroic Pandava, showered upon each\r\nother their numberless arrows. They careered on the field of battle like\r\ntwo young tigers in the deep forest fighting for a piece of meat.\r\nSwelling with pride of prowess, they mangled each other like a couple of\r\ninfuriate elephants equipped with powerful tusks. Then the illustrious\r\nruler of the Madras, endued with fierce impetuosity, putting forth his\r\nvigour, pierced the heroic Yudhishthira of terrible might in the chest\r\nwith shaft possessed of the splendour of fire or the sun. Deeply pierced,\r\nO king, that bull of Kuru's race, the illustrious Yudhishthira, then\r\nstruck the ruler of the Madras with a well-shot shaft and became filled\r\nwith joy. Recovering his senses within a trice, that foremost of kings\r\n(Shalya), possessed of prowess equal to that of him of a 1,000 eyes, with\r\neyes red in wrath, quickly struck the son of Pritha with a hundred\r\narrows. At this, the illustrious son of Dharma filled with rage, quickly\r\npierced Shalya's chest and then, without losing a moment, struck his\r\ngolden mail with six shafts. Filled with joy, the ruler of the Madras\r\nthen, drawing his bow and having shot many arrows, at last cut off, with\r\na pair of razor-faced shafts, the bow of his royal foe, that bull of\r\nKuru's race. The illustrious Yudhishthira then, taking a new and more\r\nformidable bow in that battle, pierced Shalya with many arrows of keen\r\npoints from every side like Indra piercing the Asura Namuchi. The\r\nillustrious Shalya then, cutting off the golden coats of mail of both\r\nBhima and king Yudhishthira with nine arrows, pierced the arms of both of\r\nthem. With another razor-faced arrow endued with the splendour of fire or\r\nthe sun, he then cut off the bow of Yudhishthira. At this time Kripa,\r\nwith six arrows, slew the king's driver who thereupon fell down in front\r\nof the car. The ruler of the Madras then slew with four shafts the four\r\nsteeds of Yudhishthira. Having slain the steeds of the king, the\r\nhigh-souled Shalya then began to slay the troops of the royal son of\r\nDharma. When the (Pandava) king had been brought to that plight, the\r\nillustrious Bhimasena, quickly cutting off the bow of the Madra king with\r\nan arrow of great impetuosity, deeply pierced the king himself with a\r\ncouple of arrows. With another arrow he severed the head of Shalya's\r\ndriver from his trunk, the middle of which was encased in mail.\r\nExceedingly excited with rage, Bhimasena next slew, without a moment's\r\ndelay, the four steeds also of his foe. That foremost of all bowmen,\r\nBhima, then covered with a hundred arrows that hero (Shalya), who, endued\r\nwith great impetuosity, was careering alone in that battle. Sahadeva, the\r\nson of Madri, also did the same. Beholding Shalya stupefied with those\r\narrows, Bhima cut off his armour with other shafts. His armour having\r\nbeen cut off by Bhimasena, the high-souled ruler of the Madras, taking up\r\na sword and a shield decked with a 1,000 stars, jumped down from his car\r\nand rushed towards the son of Kunti. Cutting off the shaft of Nakula's\r\ncar, Shalya of terrible strength rushed towards Yudhishthira. Beholding\r\nShalya rushing impetuously towards the king, even like the Destroyer\r\nhimself rushing in rage, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi and the (five) sons\r\nof Draupadi and the grandson of Sini suddenly advanced towards him. Then\r\nthe illustrious Bhima cut off with ten arrows the unrivalled shield of\r\nthe advancing hero. With another broad-headed arrow he cut off the sword\r\nalso of that warrior at the hilt. Filled with joy at this, he roared\r\naloud in the midst of the troops. Beholding that feat of Bhima, all the\r\nforemost car-warriors among the Pandavas became filled with joy. Laughing\r\naloud, they uttered fierce roars and blew their conchs white as the moon.\r\nAt that terrible noise the army protected by thy heroes became cheerless,\r\ncovered with sweat, bathed in blood, exceedingly melancholy and almost\r\nlifeless. The ruler of the Madras assailed by those foremost of Pandava\r\nwarriors headed by Bhimasena, proceeded (regardless of them) towards\r\nYudhishthira, like a lion proceeding for seizing a deer. King\r\nYudhishthira the just, steedless and driverless, looked like a blazing\r\nfire in consequence of the wrath with which he was then excited.\r\nBeholding the ruler of the Madras before him, he rushed towards that foe\r\nwith great impetuosity. Recollecting the words of Govinda, he quickly set\r\nhis heart on the destruction of Shalya. Indeed, king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, staying on his steedless and driverless car, desired to take up a\r\ndart. Beholding that feat of Shalya and reflecting upon the fact that the\r\nhero who had been allotted to him as his share still remained unslain,\r\nthe son of Pandu firmly set his heart upon accomplishing that which\r\nIndra's younger brother had counselled him to achieve. King Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, took up a dart whose handle was adorned with gold and gems and\r\nwhose effulgence was as bright as that of gold. Rolling his eyes that\r\nwere wide open, he cast his glances on the ruler of the Madras, his heart\r\nfilled with rage. Thus looked at, O god among men, by that king of\r\ncleansed soul and sins all washed away, the ruler of the Madras was not\r\nreduced to ashes. This appeared to us to be exceedingly wonderful, O\r\nmonarch. The illustrious chief of the Kurus then hurled with great force\r\nat the king of the Madras that blazing dart of beautiful and fierce\r\nhandle and effulgent with gems and corals. All the Kauravas beheld that\r\nblazing dart emitting sparks of fire as it coursed through the welkin\r\nafter having been hurled with great force, even like a large meteor\r\nfalling from the skies at the end of the Yuga. King Yudhishthira the\r\njust, in that battle, carefully hurled that dart which resembled\r\nkala-ratri (the Death Night) armed with the fatal noose or the\r\nfoster-mother of fearful aspect of Yama himself, and which like the\r\nBrahmana's curse, was incapable of being baffled. Carefully the sons of\r\nPandu had always worshipped that weapon with perfumes and garlands and\r\nforemost of seats and the best kinds of viands and drinks. That weapon\r\nseemed to blaze like Samvartaka-fire and was as fierce as a rite\r\nperformed according to the Atharvan of Agnirasa. Created by Tvashtri (the\r\ncelestial artificer) for the use of Ishana, it was a consumer of the\r\nlife-breaths and the bodies of all foes. It was capable of destroying by\r\nits force the Earth and the welkin and all the receptacles of water and\r\ncreatures of every kind. Adorned with bells and banners and gems and\r\ndiamonds and decked with stones of lapis lazuli and equipped with a\r\ngolden handle, Tvashtri himself had forged it with great care after\r\nhaving observed many vows. Unerringly fatal, it was destructive of all\r\nhaters of Brahma. Having carefully inspired it with many fierce mantras,\r\nand endued it with terrible velocity by the exercise of great might and\r\ngreat care, king Yudhishthira hurled it along the best of tracks for the\r\ndestruction of the ruler of the Madras. Saying in a loud voice the words,\r\n\"Thou art slain, O wretch!\" the king hurled it, even as Rudra had, in\r\ndays of yore, shot his shaft for the destruction of the asura Andhaka,\r\nstretching forth his strong (right) arm graced with a beautiful hand, and\r\napparently dancing in wrath.\r\n\r\nShalya, however, roared aloud and endeavoured to catch that excellent\r\ndart of irresistible energy hurled by Yudhishthira with all his might,\r\neven as a fire leaps forth for catching a jet of clarified butter poured\r\nover it. Piercing through his very vitals and his fair and broad chest,\r\nthat dart entered the Earth as easily as it would enter any water without\r\nthe slightest resistance and bearing away (with it) the world-wide fame\r\nof the king (of the Madras). Covered with the blood that issued from his\r\nnostrils and eyes and ears and mouth, and that which flowed from his\r\nwound, he then looked like the Krauncha mountain of gigantic size when it\r\nwas pierced by Skanda. His armour having been cut off by that descendant\r\nof Kuru's race, the illustrious Shalya, strong as Indra's elephant,\r\nstretching his arms, fell down on the Earth, like a mountain summit riven\r\nby thunder. Stretching his arms, the ruler of the Madras fell down on the\r\nEarth, with face directed towards king Yudhishthira the just, like a tall\r\nbanner erected to the honour of Indra falling down on the ground. Like a\r\ndear wife advancing to receive her dear lord about to fall on her breast,\r\nthe Earth then seemed, from affection, to rise a little for receiving\r\nthat bull among men as he fell down with mangled limbs bathed in blood.\r\nThe puissant Shalya, having long enjoyed the Earth like a dear wife, now\r\nseemed to sleep on the Earth's breast, embracing her with all his limbs.\r\nSlain by Dharma's son of righteous soul in fair fight, Shalya seemed to\r\nassume the aspect of a goodly fire lying extinguished on the sacrificial\r\nplatform. Though deprived of weapons and standard, and though his heart\r\nhad been pierced, beauty did not yet seem to abandon the lifeless ruler\r\nof the Madras. Then Yudhishthira, taking up his bow whose splendour\r\nresembled that of Indra's bow, began to destroy his foes in that battle\r\nlike the prince of birds destroying snakes. With the greatest speed he\r\nbegan to cut off the bodies of his enemies with his keen shafts. With the\r\nshowers of shafts that the son of Pritha then shot, thy troops became\r\nentirely shrouded. Overcome with fear and with eyes shut, they began to\r\nstrike one another (so stupefied were they then). With blood issuing from\r\ntheir bodies, they became deprived of their weapons of attack and defence\r\nand divested of their life-breaths. Upon the fall of Shalya, the youthful\r\nyounger brother of the king of the Madras, who was equal to his\r\n(deceased) brother in every accomplishment, and who was regarded as a\r\nmighty car-warrior, proceeded against Yudhishthira. Invincible in battle\r\ndesirous of paying the last dues of his brother, that foremost of men\r\nquickly pierced the Pandava with very many shafts. With great speed king\r\nYudhishthira the just pierced him with six arrows. With a couple of\r\nrazor-faced arrows, he then cut off the bow and the standard of his\r\nantagonist. Then with a blazing and keen arrow of great force and broad\r\nhead, he struck off the head of his foe staying before him. I saw that\r\nhead adorned with earrings fall down from the car like a denizen of\r\nheaven falling down on the exhaustion of his merits. Beholding his\r\nheadless trunk, bathed all over with blood, fallen down from the car, the\r\nKaurava troops broke. Indeed, upon the slaughter of the younger brother\r\nof the Madras clad in beautiful armour, the Kurus, uttering cries of\r\n\"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" fled away with speed. Beholding Shalya's younger\r\nbrother slain, thy troops, hopeless of their lives, were inspired with\r\nthe fear of the Pandavas and fled, covered with dust. The grandson of\r\nSini then, Satyaki, O bull of Bharata's race, shooting his shafts,\r\nproceeded against the frightened Kauravas while the latter were flying\r\naway. Then Hridika's son, O king, quickly and fearlessly received that\r\ninvincible warrior, that irresistible and mighty bowman, as he advanced\r\n(against the beaten army). Those two illustrious and invincible heroes of\r\nVrishni's race, Hridika's son and Satyaki, encountered each other like\r\ntwo furious lions. Both resembling the sun in effulgence, they covered\r\neach other with arrows of blazing splendour that resembled the rays of\r\nthe sun. The arrows of those two lions of Vrishni's race, shot forcibly\r\nfrom their bows, we saw, looked like swiftly coursing insects in the\r\nwelkin. Piercing Satyaki with ten arrows and his steeds with three, the\r\nson of Hridika cut off his bow with a straight shaft. Laying aside his\r\nbest of bows which was thus cut off, that bull of Sini's race, quickly\r\ntook up another that was tougher than the first. Having taken up that\r\nforemost of bows, that first of bowmen pierced the son of Hridika with\r\nten arrows in the centre of the chest. Then cutting off his car and the\r\nshaft also of that car with many well-shot arrows, Satyaki quickly slew\r\nthe steeds of his antagonist as also his two Parshni drivers. The valiant\r\nKripa then, the son of Saradwat, O lord, beholding Hridika's son made\r\ncarless, quickly bore him away, taking him up on his car. Upon the\r\nslaughter of the king of the Madras and upon Kritavarma having been made\r\ncarless, the entire army of Duryodhana once more turned its face from the\r\nbattle. At this time the army was shrouded with a dusty cloud. We could\r\nnot see anything. The greater portion, however, of thy army fell. They\r\nwho remained alive had turned away their faces from battle. Soon it was\r\nseen that that cloud of earthy dust which had arisen became allayed, O\r\nbull among men, in consequence of the diverse streams of blood that\r\ndrenched it on every side. Then Duryodhana, seeing from a near point his\r\narmy broken, alone resisted all the Parthas advancing furiously.\r\nBeholding the Pandavas on their cars as also Dhrishtadyumna the son of\r\nPrishata and the invincible chief of the Anartas (Satyaki), the Kuru king\r\ncovered all of them with sharp arrows. The enemy (at that time)\r\napproached him not, like mortal creatures fearing to approach the\r\nDestroyer standing before them. Meanwhile the son of Hridika, riding upon\r\nanother car, advanced to that spot. The mighty car-warrior Yudhishthira\r\nthen quickly slew the four steeds of Kritavarma with four shafts, and\r\npierced the son of Gotama with six broad-headed arrows of great force.\r\nThen Ashvatthama, taking up on his car the son of Hridika who had been\r\nmade steedless and carless by the (Pandava) king, bore him away from\r\nYudhishthira's presence. The son of Saradwat pierced Yudhishthira in\r\nreturn with eight arrows and his steeds also with eight keen shafts.\r\nThus, O monarch, the embers of that battle began to glow here and there,\r\nin consequence, O king, of the evil policy of thyself and thy son, O\r\nBharata. After the slaughter of that foremost of bowmen on the field of\r\nbattle by that bull of Kuru's race, the Parthas, beholding Shalya slain,\r\nunited together, and filled with great joy, blew their conchs. And all of\r\nthem applauded Yudhishthira in that battle, even as the celestials in\r\ndays of yore, had applauded Indra after the slaughter of Vritra. And they\r\nbeat and blew diverse kinds of musical instruments, making the Earth\r\nresound on every side with that noise.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the slaughter of Shalya, O king, the followers of\r\nthe Madra king, numbering seventeen hundred heroic car-warriors,\r\nproceeded for battle with great energy. Duryodhana riding upon an\r\nelephant gigantic as a hill, with an umbrella held over his head, and\r\nfanned the while with yak-tails, forbade the Madraka warriors, saying,\r\n\"Do not proceed, Do not proceed!\" Though repeatedly forbidden by\r\nDuryodhana, those heroes, desirous of slaying Yudhishthira, penetrated\r\ninto the Pandava host. Those brave combatants, O monarch, loyal to\r\nDuryodhana, twanging their bows loudly, fought with the Pandavas.\r\nMeanwhile, hearing that Shalya had been slain and that Yudhishthira was\r\nafflicted by the mighty car-warriors of the Madrakas devoted to the\r\nwelfare of the Madraka king, the great car-warrior Partha came there,\r\nstretching his bow Gandiva, and filling the Earth with the rattle of his\r\ncar. Then Arjuna, and Bhima, and the two sons of Madri by Pandu, and that\r\ntiger among men, Satyaki, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and the Pancalas and the Somakas, desirous\r\nof rescuing Yudhishthira, surrounded him on all sides. Having taken their\r\nplaces around the king, the Pandavas, those bulls among men, began to\r\nagitate the hostile force like Makaras agitating the ocean. Indeed, they\r\ncaused thy army to tremble like a mighty tempest shaking the trees. Like\r\nthe great river Ganges agitated by a hostile wind, the Pandava host, O\r\nking, once more became exceedingly agitated. Causing that mighty host to\r\ntremble, the illustrious and mighty car-warriors (the Madrakas), all\r\nshouted loudly, saying, \"Where is that king Yudhishthira? Why are not his\r\nbrave brothers, the Pandavas, to be seen here? What has become of the\r\nPancalas of great energy as also of the mighty car-warrior Shikhandi?\r\nWhere are Dhrishtadyumna and the grandson of Sini and those great\r\ncar-warriors, the (five) sons of Draupadi?\" At this, those mighty\r\nwarriors, the sons of Draupadi, began to slaughter the followers of the\r\nMadra king who were uttering those words and battling vigorously. In that\r\nbattle, some amongst thy troops were seen slain by means of their lofty\r\nstandards. Beholding, however, the heroic Pandavas, the brave warriors of\r\nthy army, O Bharata, though forbidden by thy son, still rushed against\r\nthem. Duryodhana, speaking softly, sought to prevent those warriors from\r\nfighting with the foe. No great car-warrior, however, amongst them obeyed\r\nhis behest. Then Shakuni, the son of the Gandhara king, possessed of\r\neloquence, O monarch, said unto Duryodhana these words, \"How is this that\r\nwe are standing here, while the Madraka host is being slaughtered before\r\nour eyes? When thou, O Bharata, art here, this does not look well! The\r\nunderstanding made was that all of us should fight unitedly! Why then, O\r\nking, dost thou tolerate our foes when they are thus slaying our troops?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"Though forbidden by me before, they did not obey my\r\nbehest. Unitedly have these men penetrated in the Pandava host!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shakuni said, \"Brave warriors, when excited with rage in battle, do not\r\nobey the command of their leaders. It does not behove thee to be angry\r\nwith those men. This is not the time to stand indifferently. We shall,\r\ntherefore, all of us, united together with our cars and horses and\r\nelephants, proceed, for rescuing those great bowmen, the followers of the\r\nMadra king! With great care, O king, we shall protect one another.\"\r\nThinking after the manner of Shakuni, all the Kauravas then proceeded to\r\nthat place where the Madras were. Duryodhana also, thus addressed (by his\r\nmaternal uncle) proceeded, encompassed by a large force, against the foe,\r\nuttering leonine shouts and causing the Earth to resound with that noise.\r\n\"Slay, pierce, seize, strike, cut off!\" These were the loud sounds that\r\nwere heard then, O Bharata, among those troops. Meanwhile the Pandavas,\r\nbeholding in that battle the followers of the Madra king assailing them\r\nunitedly, proceeded against them, arraying themselves in the form called\r\nMadhyama. Fighting hand to hand, O monarch, for a short while those\r\nheroic warriors, the followers of the Madra king, were seen to perish.\r\nThen, whilst we were proceeding, the Pandavas, united together and endued\r\nwith great activity, completed the slaughter of the Madrakas, and, filled\r\nwith delight, uttered joyous shouts. Then headless forms were seen to\r\narise all around. Large meteors seemed to fall down from the sun's disc.\r\nThe Earth became covered with cars and broken yokes and axles and slain\r\ncar-warriors and lifeless steeds. Steeds fleet as the wind, still\r\nattached to yokes of cars (but without drivers to guide them) were seen\r\nto drag car-warriors, O monarch, hither and thither on the field of\r\nbattle. Some horses were seen to drag cars with broken wheels, while some\r\nran on all sides, bearing after them portions of broken cars. Here and\r\nthere also were seen steeds that were hampered in their motions by their\r\ntraces. Car-warriors, while falling down from their cars, were seen to\r\ndrop down like denizens of heaven on the exhaustion of their merits. When\r\nthe brave followers of the Madra king were slain, the mighty car-warriors\r\nof the Parthas, those great smiters, beholding a body of horse advancing\r\ntowards them, rushed towards it with speed from desire of victory.\r\nCausing their arrows to whiz loudly and making diverse other kinds of\r\nnoise mingled with the blare of their conchs, those effectual smiters\r\npossessed of sureness of aim, shaking their bows, uttered leonine roars.\r\nBeholding then that large force of the Madra king exterminated and seeing\r\nalso their heroic king slain in battle, the entire army of Duryodhana\r\nonce more turned away from the field. Struck, O monarch, by those firm\r\nbowmen, the Pandavas, the Kuru army fled away on all sides, inspired with\r\nfear.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of that great king and mighty car-warrior,\r\nthat invincible hero (Shalya) in battle, thy troops as also thy sons\r\nalmost all turned away from the fight. Indeed, upon the slaughter of that\r\nhero by the illustrious Yudhishthira, thy troops were like ship-wrecked\r\nmerchants on the vast deep without a raft to cross it. After the fall of\r\nthe Madra king, O monarch, thy troops, struck with fear and mangled with\r\narrows, were like masterless men desirous of a protector or a herd of\r\ndeer afflicted by a lion. Like bulls deprived of their horns or elephants\r\nwhose tusks have been broken, thy troops, defeated by Ajatasatru, fled\r\naway at midday. After the fall of Shalya, O king, none amongst thy troops\r\nset his heart on either rallying the army or displaying his prowess. That\r\nfear, O king, and that grief, which had been ours upon the fall of\r\nBhishma, of Drona, and of the Suta's son, O Bharata, now became ours once\r\nmore, O monarch. Despairing of success upon the fall of the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Shalya, the Kuru army, with its heroes slain and exceedingly\r\nconfused, began to be cut down with keen shafts. Upon the slaughter of\r\nthe Madra king, O monarch, thy warriors all fled away in fear. Some on\r\nhorse-back, some on elephants, some on cars, great car-warriors with\r\ngreat speed, and foot-soldiers also fled away in fear. 2,000 elephants,\r\nlooking like hills, and accomplished in smiting fled away, after Shalya's\r\nfall, urged on with hooks and toes. Indeed, O chief of the Bharatas, thy\r\nsoldiers fled on all sides. Afflicted with arrows, they were seen to run,\r\nbreathing hard. Beholding them defeated and broken and flying away in\r\ndejection, the Pancalas and the Pandavas, inspired with desire of\r\nvictory, pursued then hotly. The whiz of arrows and other noises, the\r\nloud leonine roars, and the blare of conchs of heroic warriors, became\r\ntremendous. Beholding the Kaurava host agitated with fear and flying\r\naway, the Pancalas and the Pandavas addressed one another, saying, \"Today\r\nking Yudhishthira, firm in truth, hath vanquished his enemies. Today\r\nDuryodhana hath been divested of his splendour and kingly prosperity.\r\nToday, hearing of his sons' death, let Dhritarashtra, that king of men,\r\nstupefied and prostrate on the Earth, feel the most poignant anguish. Let\r\nhim know today that the son of Kunti is possessed of great might among\r\nall bowmen. Today that sinful and wicked-hearted king will censure his\r\nown self. Let him recollect today the time and beneficial words of\r\nVidura. Let him from this day wait upon the Parthas as their slave. Let\r\nthat king today experience the grief that had been felt by the sons of\r\nPandu. Let that king know today the greatness of Krishna. Let him hear\r\ntoday the terrible twang of Arjuna's bow in battle, as also the strength\r\nof all his weapons, and the might of his arms in fight. Today he will\r\nknow the awful might of the high-souled Bhima when Duryodhana will be\r\nslain in battle even as the Asura Vali was slain by Indra. Save Bhima of\r\nmighty strength, there is none else in this world that can achieve that\r\nwhich was achieved by Bhima himself at the slaughter of Duhshasana.\r\nHearing of the slaughter of the ruler of the Madras who was incapable of\r\ndefeat by the very gods, that king will know the prowess of the eldest\r\nson of Pandu. After the slaughter of the heroic son of Subala and all the\r\nGandharas he will know the strength, in battle, of the two sons of Madri\r\nby Pandu. Why will not victory be theirs that have Dhananjaya for their\r\nwarrior, as also Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of\r\nPrishata, and the five sons of Draupadi, and the two sons of Madri, and\r\nthe mighty bowman Shikhandi, and king Yudhishthira? Why will not victory\r\nbe theirs that have for their protector Krishna, otherwise called\r\nJanardana, that protector of the universe? Why will not victory be theirs\r\nthat have righteousness for their refuge? Who else than Yudhishthira the\r\nson of Pritha, who hath Hrishikesa, the refuge of righteousness and fame,\r\nfor his protector, is competent to vanquish in battle Bhishma and Drona\r\nand Karna and the ruler of the Madras and the other kings by hundreds and\r\nthousands?\" Saying these words and filled with joy, the Srinjayas pursued\r\nthy troops in that battle who had been exceedingly mangled with shafts.\r\nThen Dhananjaya of great valour proceeded against the car-division of the\r\nfoe. The two sons of Madri and the mighty carwarrior Satyaki proceeded\r\nagainst Shakuni. Beholding them all flying with speed in fear of\r\nBhimasena, Duryodhana as if smiling the while, addressed his driver,\r\nsaying, \"Partha, stationed there with his bow, is transgressing me. Take\r\nmy steeds to the rear of the whole army. Like the ocean that cannot\r\ntransgress its continents, Kunti's son Dhananjaya will never venture to\r\ntransgress me, if I take up my stand in the rear. Behold, O driver, this\r\nvast host that is pursued by the Pandavas. Behold this cloud of dust that\r\nhas arisen on all sides in consequence of the motion of the troops. Hear\r\nthose diverse leonine roars that are so awful and loud! Therefore, O\r\ndriver, proceed slowly and take up thy position in the rear. If I stay in\r\nbattle and fight the Pandavas, my army, O driver, will rally and come\r\nback with vigour to battle.\" Hearing these words of thy son that were\r\njust those of a hero and man of honour, the driver slowly urged those\r\nsteeds in trappings of gold. 21,000 foot-soldiers, deprived of elephants\r\nand steeds and car-warriors, and who were ready to lay down their lives,\r\nstill stood for battle. Born in diverse countries and hailing from\r\ndiverse towns, those warriors maintained their ground, desirous of\r\nwinning great fame. The clash of those rushing warriors filled with joy\r\nbecame loud and exceedingly terrible. Then Bhimasena, O king, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata resisted them with four kinds of\r\nforces. Other foot-soldiers proceeded against Bhima, uttering loud shouts\r\nand slapping their armpits, all actuated by the desire of going to\r\nheaven. Those Dhartarashtra combatants, filled with rage and invincible\r\nin battle, having approached Bhimasena, uttered furious shouts. They then\r\nspoke not to one another. Encompassing Bhima in that battle, they began\r\nto strike him from all sides. Surrounded by that large body of warriors\r\non foot and struck by them in that battle, Bhima did not stir from where\r\nhe stood fixed like Mainaka mountain. His assailants, meanwhile, filled\r\nwith rage, O monarch, endeavoured to afflict that mighty car-warrior of\r\nthe Pandavas and checked other combatants (that tried to rescue him).\r\nEncountered by those warriors, Bhima became filled with fury. Quickly\r\nalighting from his car, he proceeded on foot against them. Taking up his\r\nmassive mace adorned with gold, he began to slay thy troops like the\r\nDestroyer himself armed with his club. The mighty Bhima, with his mace,\r\ncrushed those 21,000 foot-soldiers who were without cars and steeds and\r\nelephants. Having slain that strong division, Bhima, of prowess incapable\r\nof being baffled, showed himself with Dhrishtadyumna in his front. The\r\nDhartarashtra foot-soldiers, thus slain, lay down on the ground, bathed\r\nin blood, like Karnikaras with their flowery burthens laid low by a\r\ntempest. Adorned with garlands made of diverse kinds of flowers, and\r\ndecked with diverse kinds of earrings, those combatants of diverse races,\r\nwho had hailed from diverse realms, lay down on the field, deprived of\r\nlife. Covered with banners and standards, that large host of\r\nfoot-soldiers, thus cut down, looked fierce and terrible and awful as\r\nthey lay down on the field. The mighty car-warriors, with their\r\nfollowers, that fought under Yudhishthira's lead, all pursued thy\r\nillustrious son Duryodhana. Those great bowmen, beholding thy troops turn\r\naway from the battle, proceeded against Duryodhana, but they could not\r\ntransgress him even as the ocean cannot transgress its continents. The\r\nprowess that we then beheld of thy son was exceedingly wonderful, since\r\nall the Parthas, united together, could not transgress his single self.\r\nThen Duryodhana, addressing his own army which had not fled far but\r\nwhich, mangled with arrows, had set its heart on flight, said these\r\nwords, \"I do not see the spot on plain or mountain, whither, if ye fly,\r\nthe Pandavas will not pursue and slay ye! What is the use then of flight?\r\nThe army of the Pandavas hath been reduced in numbers. The two Krishnas\r\nare exceedingly mangled. If all of us make a stand, victory will be\r\ncertainly ours! If you fly away, losing all order, the sinful Pandavas,\r\npursuing you will slay you all! If, on the other hand, we make a stand,\r\ngood will result to us! Listen, all you Kshatriyas that are assailed\r\nhere! When the Destroyer always slays heroes and cowards, what man is\r\nthere so stupid that, calling himself a Kshatriya, will not fight? Good\r\nwill result to us if we stay in the front of the angry Bhimasena! Death\r\nin battle, while struggling according to Kshatriya practices, is fraught\r\nwith happiness! Winning victory, one obtains happiness here. If slain,\r\none obtains great fruits in the other world! You Kauravas, there is no\r\nbetter path to heaven than that offered by battle! Slain in battle, you\r\nmay, without delay, obtain all those regions of blessedness.\" Hearing\r\nthese words of his, and applauding them highly, the (Kuru) kings once\r\nmore rushed against the Pandavas for battling with them. Seeing them\r\nadvancing with speed, the Parthas, arrayed in order of battle, skilled in\r\nsmiting, excited with rage, and inspired with desire of victory, rushed\r\nagainst them. The valiant Dhananjaya, stretching his bow Gandiva\r\ncelebrated over the three worlds, proceeded on his car against the foe.\r\nThe two sons of Madri, and Satyaki, rushed against Shakuni, and the other\r\n(Pandava) heroes, smiling, rushed impetuously against thy forces.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the (Kuru) army had been rallied, Shalva, the ruler\r\nof the Mlecchas, filled with rage, rushed against the large force of the\r\nPandavas, riding on a gigantic elephant, with secretions issuing from the\r\nusual limbs, looking like a hill, swelling with pride, resembling\r\nAiravata himself, and capable of crushing large bands of foes. Shalva's\r\nanimal sprung from a high and noble breed. It was always worshipped by\r\nDhritarashtra's son. It was properly equipped and properly trained for\r\nbattle, O king, by persons well-conversant with elephant-lore. Riding on\r\nthat elephant, that foremost of kings looked like the morning sun at the\r\nclose of summer. Mounting on that foremost of elephants, O monarch, he\r\nproceeded against the Pandavas and began to pierce them on all sides with\r\nkeen and terrible shafts that resembled Indra's thunder in force. While\r\nhe shot his arrows in that battle and despatched hostile warriors to\r\nYama's abode, neither the Kauravas nor the Pandavas could notice any\r\nlapses in him, even as the Daityas, O king, could not notice any in\r\nVasava, the wielder of the thunder, in days of yore, while the latter was\r\nemployed in crushing their divisions. The Pandavas, the Somakas, and the\r\nSrinjayas, beheld that elephant looking like a 1,000 elephants careering\r\naround them, even as the foes of the gods had in days of yore beheld the\r\nelephant of Indra in battle. Agitated (by that animal), the hostile army\r\nlooked on every side as if deprived of life. Unable to stand in battle,\r\nthey then fled away in great fear, crushing one another as they ran. Then\r\nthe vast host of the Pandavas, broken by king Salwa, suddenly fled on all\r\nsides, unable to endure the impetuosity of that elephant. Beholding the\r\nPandava host broken and flying away in speed, all the foremost of\r\nwarriors of thy army worshipped king Salwa and blew their conchs white as\r\nthe moon. Hearing the shouts of the Kauravas uttered in joy and the blare\r\nof their conchs, the commander of the Pandava and the Srinjaya forces,\r\nthe Pancala prince (Dhrishtadyumna) could not, from wrath, endure it. The\r\nillustrious Dhrishtadyumna then, with great speed, proceeded for\r\nvanquishing the elephant, even as the Asura Jambha had proceeded against\r\nAiravata, the prince of elephants that Indra rode in the course of his\r\nencounter with Indra. Beholding the ruler of the Pandavas impetuously\r\nrushing against him, Salwa, that lion among kings, quickly urged his\r\nelephants, O king, for the destruction of Drupada's son. The latter,\r\nseeing the animal approaching with precipitancy, pierced it with three\r\nforemost of shafts, polished by the hands of the smith, keen, blazing,\r\nendued with fierce energy, and resembling fire itself in splendour and\r\nforce. Then that illustrious hero struck the animal at the frontal globes\r\nwith five other whetted and foremost of shafts. Pierced therewith, that\r\nprince of elephants, turning away from the battle, ran with great speed.\r\nSalwa, however, suddenly checking that foremost of elephants which had\r\nbeen exceedingly mangled and forced to retreat, caused it to turn back,\r\nand with hooks and keen lances urged it forward against the car of the\r\nPancala king, pointing it out to the infuriate animal. Beholding the\r\nanimal rushing impetuously at him, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, taking up a\r\nmace, quickly jumped down on the Earth from his car, his limbs stupefied\r\nwith fear. That gigantic elephant, meanwhile, suddenly crushing that\r\ngold-decked car with its steeds and driver, raised it up in the air with\r\nhis trunk and then dashed it down on the Earth. Beholding the driver of\r\nthe Pancala king thus crushed by that foremost of elephants, Bhima and\r\nShikhandi and the grandson of Sini rushed with great speed against that\r\nanimal. With their shafts they speedily checked the impetuosity of the\r\nadvancing beast. Thus received by those car-warriors and checked by them\r\nin battle, the elephant began to waver. Meanwhile, king Salwa began to\r\nshoot his shafts like the sun shedding his rays on all sides. Struck with\r\nthose shafts, the (Pandava) car-warriors began to fly away. Beholding\r\nthat feat of Salwa, the Pancalas, the Srinjayas, and the Matsyas, O king,\r\nuttered loud cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" in that battle, all those\r\nforemost of men, however, encompassed the animal on all sides. The brave\r\nPancala king then, taking up his mace which resembled the lofty crest of\r\na mountain, appeared there. Fearlessly, O king, that hero, that smiter of\r\nfoes, rushed with speed against the elephant. Endued with great activity,\r\nthe prince of the Pancalas approached and began to strike with his mace\r\nthat animal which was huge as a hill and which shed its secretions like a\r\nmighty mass of pouring clouds. Its frontal globes suddenly split open,\r\nand it uttered a loud cry; and vomiting a profuse quantity of blood, the\r\nanimal, huge as a hill, suddenly fell down, even as a mountain falling\r\ndown during an earthquake. While that prince of elephants was falling\r\ndown, and while the troops of thy son were uttering wails of woe at the\r\nsight, that foremost of warriors among the Sinis cut off the head of king\r\nSalwa with a sharp and broad-headed arrow. His head having been cut off\r\nby the Satwata hero, Salwa fell down on the Earth along with his prince\r\nof elephants, even like a mountain summit suddenly riven by the\r\nthunderbolt hurled by the chief of the celestials.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the heroic Salwa, that ornament of assemblies, had\r\nbeen slain, thy army speedily broke like a mighty tree broken by the\r\nforce of the tempest. Beholding the army broken, the mighty car-warrior\r\nKritavarma, possessed by heroism and great strength, resisted the hostile\r\nforce in that battle. Seeing the Satwata hero, O king, standing in battle\r\nlike a hill pierced with arrows (by the foes), the Kuru heroes, who had\r\nfled away, rallied and came back. Then, O monarch, a battle took place\r\nbetween the Pandavas and the returned Kurus who made death itself their\r\ngoal. Wonderful was that fierce encounter which occurred between the\r\nSatwata hero and his foes, since he resisted the invincible army of the\r\nPandavas. When friends were seen to accomplish the most difficult feats,\r\nfriends, filled with delight, uttered leonine shouts that seemed to reach\r\nthe very heavens. At those sounds the Pancalas, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nbecame inspired with fear. Then Satyaki, the grandson of Sini, approached\r\nthat spot. Approaching king Kshemakirti of great strength, Satyaki\r\ndespatched him to Yama's abode, with seven keen shafts. Then the son of\r\nHridika, of great intelligence, rushed with speed against that bull of\r\nSini's race, that mighty armed warrior, as the latter came, shooting his\r\nwhetted shafts. Those two bowmen, those two foremost of car-warriors,\r\nroared like lions and encountered each other with great force, both being\r\narmed with foremost of weapons. The Pandavas, the Pancalas, and the other\r\nwarriors, became spectators of that terrible encounter between the two\r\nheroes. Those two heroes of the Vrishni-Andhaka race, like two elephants\r\nfilled with delight, struck each other with long arrows and shafts\r\nequipped with calf-toothed heads. Careering in diverse kinds of tracks,\r\nthe son of Hridika and that bull of Sini's race soon afflicted each other\r\nwith showers of arrows. The shafts sped with great force from the bows of\r\nthe two Vrishni lions were seen by us in the welkin to resemble flights\r\nof swiftly coursing insects. Then the son of Hridika, approaching Satyaki\r\nof true prowess, pierced the four steeds of the latter with four keen\r\nshafts. The long-armed Satyaki, enraged at this, like an elephant struck\r\nwith a lance, pierced Kritavarma with eight foremost of arrows. Then\r\nKritavarma pierced Satyaki with three arrows whetted on stone and sped\r\nfrom his bow drawn to its fullest and then cut off his bow with another\r\narrow. Laying aside his broken bow, that bull of Sini's race quickly took\r\nup another with arrow fixed on it. Having taken up that foremost of bows\r\nand stringed it, that foremost of all bowmen, that Atiratha of mighty\r\nenergy and great intelligence and great strength, unable to endure the\r\ncutting of his bow by Kritavarma, and filled with fury, quickly rushed\r\nagainst the latter. With ten keen shafts that bull of Sini's race then\r\nstruck the driver, the steeds, and the standard of Kritavarma. At this, O\r\nking, the great bowman and mighty car-warrior Kritavarma, beholding his\r\ngold-decked car made driverless and steedless, became filled with rage.\r\nUplifting a pointed lance, O sire, he hurled it with all the force of his\r\narm at that bull of Sini's race, desirous of slaying him. Satyaki,\r\nhowever, of the Satwata race, striking that lance with many keen arrows,\r\ncut it off into fragments and caused it to fall down, stupefying\r\nKritavarma of Madhu's race (with his activity and prowess). With another\r\nbroad-headed arrow he then struck Kritavarma in the chest. Made steedless\r\nand driverless in that battle by Yuyudhana, skilled in weapons,\r\nKritavarma came down on the Earth. The heroic Kritavarma having been\r\ndeprived of his car by Satyaki in that single combat, all the (Kaurava)\r\ntroops became filled with great fear. A great sorrow afflicted the heart\r\nof thy sons, when Kritavarma was thus made steedless and driverless and\r\ncarless. Beholding that chastiser of foes made steedless and driverless,\r\nKripa, O king, rushed at that bull of Sini's race, desirous of\r\ndespatching him to Yama's abode. Taking Kritavarma upon his car in the\r\nvery sight of all the bowmen, the mighty-armed Kripa bore him away from\r\nthe press of battle. After Kritavarma had been made carless and the\r\ngrandson of Sini had become powerful on the field, the whole army of\r\nDuryodhana once more turned away from the fight. The enemy, however, did\r\nnot see it, for the (Kuru) army was then shrouded with a dusty cloud. All\r\nthy warriors fled, O monarch, except king Duryodhana. The latter,\r\nbeholding from a near point that his own army was routed, quickly\r\nrushing, assailed the victorious enemy, alone resisting them all.\r\nFearlessly that invincible warrior, filled with rage, assailed with keen\r\narrows all the Pandus, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishta, and\r\nShikhandi, and the sons of Draupadi, and the large bands of the Pancalas,\r\nand the Kaikeyas, O sire, and the Somakas! With firm determination thy\r\nmighty son stood in battle, even as a blazing and mighty fire on the\r\nsacrificial platform, sanctified with mantras. Even thus, king Duryodhana\r\ncareered all over the field, in that battle. His foes could not approach\r\nhim then, like living creatures unable to approach the Destroyer. Then\r\nthe son of Hridika came there, riding on another car.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'That foremost of car-warriors, O monarch, thy son, riding\r\non his car and filled with the courage of despair, looked resplendent in\r\nthat battle like Rudra himself of great valour. With the thousands of\r\nshafts shot by him, the Earth became completely covered. Indeed, he\r\ndrenched his enemies with showers of arrows like the clouds pouring rain\r\non mountain breasts. There was then not a man amongst the Pandavas in\r\nthat great battle, or a steed, or an elephant, or a car, that was not\r\nstruck with Duryodhana's arrows. Upon whomsoever amongst the warriors I\r\nthen cast my eyes, O monarch, I beheld that every one, O Bharata, was\r\nstruck by thy son with his arrows. The Pandava army was then covered with\r\nthe shafts of that illustrious warrior, even as a host is covered with\r\nthe dust it raises while marching or rushing to battle. The Earth then, O\r\nlord of Earth, seemed to me to be made one entire expanse of arrows by\r\nthy son Duryodhana, that bowman possessed of great lightness of hands.\r\nAmongst those thousands upon thousands of warriors on the field,\r\nbelonging to thy side or that of the enemy, it seemed to me that\r\nDuryodhana was then the only man. The prowess that we then beheld of thy\r\nson seemed to be exceedingly wonderful, since the Parthas, even uniting\r\ntogether, could not approach his single self. He pierced Yudhishthira, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, with a hundred arrows, and Bhimasena with\r\nseventy, and Sahadeva with seven. And he pierced Nakula with four and\r\nsixty, and Dhrishtadyumna with five, and the sons of Draupadi with seven,\r\nand Satyaki with three arrows. With a broad-headed arrow, he then, O\r\nsire, cut off the bow of Sahadeva. Laying aside that broken bow, the\r\nvaliant son of Madri, took up another formidable bow, and rushing against\r\nking Duryodhana, pierced him with ten shafts in that battle. The great\r\nbowman Nakula, possessed of courage, then pierced the king with nine\r\nterrible arrows and uttered a loud roar. Satyaki struck the king with a\r\nsingle straight shaft; the sons of Draupadi struck him with three and\r\nseventy and king Yudhishthira struck him with five. And Bhimasena\r\nafflicted the king with eighty shafts. Though pierced thus from every\r\nside with numerous arrows by these illustrious warriors, Duryodhana\r\nstill, O monarch, did not waver, in the presence of all the troops who\r\nstood there as spectators. The quickness, the skill, and the prowess of\r\nthat illustrious warrior were seen by all the men there to exceed those\r\nof every creature. Meanwhile the Dhartarashtras, O monarch, who had not\r\nfled far from that spot, beholding the king, rallied and returned there,\r\nclad in mail. The noise made by them when they came back became\r\nexceedingly awful, like the roar of the surging ocean in the season of\r\nrains. Approaching their unvanquished king in that battle, those great\r\nbowmen proceeded against the Pandavas for fight. The son of Drona\r\nresisted in that battle the angry Bhimasena. With the arrows, O monarch,\r\nthat were shot in that battle, all the points of the compass became\r\ncompletely shrouded, so that the brave combatants could not distinguish\r\nthe cardinal from the subsidiary points of the compass. As regards\r\nAshvatthama and Bhimasena, O Bharata, both of them were achievers of\r\ncruel feats. Both of them were irresistible in battle. The arms of both\r\ncontained many cicatrices in consequence of both having repeatedly drawn\r\nthe bow-string. Counteracting each other's feats, they continued to fight\r\nwith each other, frightening the whole Universe. The heroic Shakuni\r\nassailed Yudhishthira in that battle. The mighty son of Subala, having\r\nslain the four steeds of the king, uttered a loud roar, causing all the\r\ntroops to tremble with fear. Meanwhile, the valiant Sahadeva bore away\r\nthe heroic and vanquished king on his car from that battle. Then king\r\nYudhishthira the just, riding upon another car (came back to battle), and\r\nhaving pierced Shakuni at first with nine arrows, once more pierced him\r\nwith five. And that foremost of all bowmen then uttered a loud roar. That\r\nbattle, O sire, awful as it was, became wonderful to behold. It filled\r\nthe spectators with delight and was applauded by the Siddhas and the\r\nCharanas. Uluka of immeasurable soul rushed against the mighty bowman\r\nNakula, in that battle, shooting showers of arrows from every side. The\r\nheroic Nakula, however, in that battle, resisted the son of Shakuni with\r\na thick shower of arrows from every side. Both those heroes were\r\nwell-born and both were mighty car-warriors. They were seen to fight with\r\neach other, each highly enraged with the other. Similarly Kritavarma, O\r\nking, fighting with the grandson of Sini, that scorcher of foes, looked\r\nresplendent, like Shakra battling with the Asura Vala. Duryodhana, having\r\ncut off Dhrishtadyumna's bow in that battle, pierced his bowless\r\nantagonist with keen shafts. Dhrishtadyumna then, in that encounter,\r\nhaving taken up a formidable bow, fought with the king in the sight of\r\nall the bowmen. The battle between those two heroes became exceedingly\r\nfierce, O bull of Bharata's race, like the encounter between two wild and\r\ninfuriate elephants with juicy secretions trickling down their limbs. The\r\nheroic Gautama, excited with rage in that battle, pierced the mighty sons\r\nof Draupadi with many straight shafts. The battle that took place between\r\nhim and those five, resembled that which takes place between an embodied\r\nbeing and his (five) senses. It was awful and exceedingly fierce, and\r\nneither side showed any consideration for the other. The (five) sons of\r\nDraupadi afflicted Kripa like the (five) senses afflicting a foolish man.\r\nHe, on the other hand, fighting with them, controlled them with vigour.\r\nEven such and so wonderful, O Bharata, was that battle between him and\r\nthem. It resembled the repeated combats, O lord, between embodied\r\ncreatures and their senses. Men fought with men, elephants with\r\nelephants, steeds with steeds and car-warriors with car-warriors. Once\r\nmore, O monarch, that battle became general and awful. Here an encounter\r\nwas beautiful, there another was awful, and there another was exceedingly\r\nfierce, O lord! Many and awful, O monarch, were the encounters that took\r\nplace in course of that battle. Those chastisers of foes (belonging to\r\nboth armies), encountering one another, pierced and slew one another in\r\nthat dreadful engagement. A dense cloud of dust was then seen there,\r\nraised by the vehicles and the animals of the warriors. Thick also, O\r\nking, was the dust raised by the running steeds, a dust that was carried\r\nfrom one place to another by the wind. Raised by the wheels of cars and\r\nthe breaths of the elephants, the dust, thick as an evening cloud, rose\r\ninto the welkin. That dust having been raised and the sun himself having\r\nbeen dimmed therewith, the Earth became shrouded, and the heroic and\r\nmighty car-warriors could not be seen. Anon that disappeared and\r\neverything became clear when the Earth, O best of the Bharatas, became\r\ndrenched with the blood of heroes. Indeed, that dense and awful cloud of\r\ndust was allayed. Then, O Bharata, I could once more see the diverse\r\nsingle combats that the combatants fought at noon of day, each according\r\nto his strength and his rank, all of which were exceedingly fierce. The\r\nblazing splendour of those feats, O monarch, appeared full in view. Loud\r\nbecame the noise of falling shafts in that battle, resembling that made\r\nby a vast forest of bamboo while burning on every side.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that terrible and awful battle,\r\nthe army of thy son was broken by the Pandavas. Rallying their great\r\ncar-warriors, however, with vigorous efforts, thy sons continued to fight\r\nwith the Pandava army. The (Kuru) warriors, desirous of thy son's\r\nwelfare, suddenly returned. Upon their return, the battle once more\r\nbecame exceedingly fierce between thy warriors and those of the foe,\r\nresembling that between the gods and the Asuras in days of old. Neither\r\namongst the enemies nor amongst thine was there a single combatant that\r\nturned away from that battle. The warriors fought, aided by guess and by\r\nthe names they uttered. Great was the destruction that occurred as they\r\nthus fought with one another. Then king Yudhishthira, filled with great\r\nwrath and becoming desirous of vanquishing the Dhartarashtras and their\r\nking in that battle, pierced the son of Saradwat with three arrows winged\r\nwith gold and whetted on stone, and next slew with four others the four\r\nsteeds of Kritavarma. Then Ashvatthama bore away the celebrated son of\r\nHridika. Saradwat's son pierced Yudhishthira in return with eight arrows.\r\nThen king Duryodhana despatched seven hundred cars to the spot where king\r\nYudhishthira was battling. Those cars ridden by excellent warriors and\r\nendued with speed of the wind or thought, rushed in that battle against\r\nthe car of Kunti's son. Encompassing Yudhishthira on every side, they\r\nmade him invisible with their shafts like clouds hiding the sun from the\r\nview. Then the Pandava heroes headed by Shikhandi, beholding king\r\nYudhishthira the just assailed in that way by the Kauravas, became filled\r\nwith rage and were unable to put up with it. Desirous of rescuing\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, they came to that spot upon their cars\r\npossessed of great speed and adorned with rows of bells. Then commenced\r\nan awful battle, in which blood flowed as water, between the Pandavas and\r\nthe Kurus, that increased the population of Yama's domains. Slaying those\r\nseven hundred hostile car-warriors of the Kuru army, the Pandavas and the\r\nPancalas once more resisted (the whole Kuru army). There a fierce battle\r\nwas fought between thy son and the Pandavas. We had never before seen or\r\nheard of its like. During the progress of that battle in which no\r\nconsideration was showed by anybody for anybody, and while the warriors\r\nof thy army and those of the foe were falling fast, and the combatants\r\nwere all shouting and blowing their conchs, and the bowmen were roaring\r\nand uttering loud noises of diverse kinds, while, indeed, the battle was\r\nraging fiercely and the very vitals of the combatants were being struck,\r\nand the troops, O sire, desirous of victory, were rushing with speed,\r\nwhile, verily, everything on Earth seemed to be undergoing a woeful\r\ndestruction, during that time when innumerable ladies of birth and beauty\r\nwere being made widows, during, indeed, the progress of that fierce\r\nengagement in which the warriors behaved without any consideration for\r\nfriends and foes, awful portents appeared, presaging the destruction of\r\neverything. The Earth, with her mountains and forests, trembled, making a\r\nloud noise. Meteors like blazing brands equipped with handles dropped\r\nfrom the sky, O king, on every side on the Earth as if from the solar\r\ndisc. A hurricane arose, blowing on all sides, and bearing away hard\r\npebbles along its lower course. The elephants shed copious tears and\r\ntrembled exceedingly. Disregarding all these fierce and awful portents,\r\nthe Kshatriyas, taking counsel with one another, cheerfully stood on the\r\nfield for battle again, on the beautiful and sacred field called after\r\nKuru, desirous of obtaining heaven. Then Shakuni, the son of the Gandhara\r\nking, said, \"Fight all of ye in front! I, however, will slay the Pandavas\r\nfrom behind.\" Then the Madraka warriors, endued with great activity,\r\namongst those on our side that were advancing, became filled with joy and\r\nuttered diverse sounds of delight. Others too did the same. The\r\ninvincible Pandavas, however, possessed of sureness of aim, once more\r\ncoming against us, shook their bows and covered us with showers of\r\narrows. The forces of the Madrakas then were slain by the foe. Beholding\r\nthis, the troops of Duryodhana once more turned away from the battle. The\r\nmighty king of the Gandharvas, however, once more said these words,\r\n\"Stop, ye sinful ones! Fight (with the foe)! What use is there of\r\nflight?\" At that time, O bull of Bharata's race, the king of the\r\nGandharas had full 10,000 horse-men capable of fighting with bright\r\nlances. During the progress of that great carnage, Shakuni, aided by that\r\nforce, put forth his valour and assailed the Pandava army at the rear,\r\nslaughtering it with his keen shafts. The vast force of the Pandus then,\r\nO monarch, broke even as a mass of clouds is dispersed on all sides by a\r\nmighty wind. Then Yudhishthira, beholding from a near point his own army\r\nrouted, coolly urged the mighty Sahadeva, saying, \"Yonder the son of\r\nSubala, afflicting our rear, stayeth, clad in mail! He slaughtereth our\r\nforces! Behold that wicked wight, O son of Pandu! Aided by the son of\r\nDraupadi, proceed towards him and slay Shakuni, the son of Subala!\r\nSupported by the Pancalas, O sinless one, I will meanwhile destroy the\r\ncar force of the enemy! Let all the elephants and all the horse and 3,000\r\nfoot, proceed with thee! Supported by these, slay Shakuni!\" At this, 700\r\nelephants ridden by combatants armed with the bow, and 5,000 horses, and\r\nthe valiant Sahadeva, and 3,000 foot-soldiers, and the sons of Draupadi\r\nall rushed against Shakuni difficult of defeat in battle. Subala's son,\r\nhowever, of great valour, O king, prevailing over the Pandavas and\r\nlonging for victory, began to slay their forces from the rear. The\r\nhorsemen, infuriate with rage, belonging to the Pandavas endued with\r\ngreat activity, penetrated the division of Subala's son, prevailing over\r\nthe latter's car-warriors. Those heroic horsemen, staying in the midst of\r\ntheir own elephants, covered the large host of Subala's son with showers\r\nof shafts. In consequence of thy evil counsels, O king, dreadful was the\r\nbattle that then ensued in which maces and lances were used and in which\r\nheroes only took part. The twang of bow-string was no longer heard there,\r\nfor all the car-warriors stood as spectators of that fight. At that time\r\nno difference could be seen between the contending parties. Both the\r\nKurus and the Pandavas, O bull of Bharata's race, beheld the darts hurled\r\nfrom heroic arms course like meteors through the welkin. The entire\r\nwelkin, O monarch, shrouded with falling swords of great brightness,\r\nseemed to become exceedingly beautiful. The aspect presented, O chief of\r\nthe Bharatas, by the lances hurled all around, became like that of swarms\r\nof locusts in the welkin. Steeds, with limbs bathed in blood in\r\nconsequence of wounds inflicted by horsemen themselves wounded with\r\narrows, dropped down on all sides in hundreds and thousands. Encountering\r\none another and huddled together, many of them were seen to be mangled\r\nand many to vomit blood from their mouths. A thick darkness came there\r\nwhen the troops were covered with a dusty cloud. When that darkness\r\nshrouded everything, O king, we beheld those brave combatants, steeds and\r\nmen, move away from that spot. Others were seen to fall down on the\r\nEarth, vomiting blood in profusion. Many combatants, entangled with one\r\nanother by their locks, could not stir. Many, endued with great strength,\r\ndragged one another from the backs of their horses, and encountering one\r\nanother thus, slew one another like combatants in a wrestling match. Many\r\ndeprived of life, were borne away on the backs of the steeds. Many men,\r\nproud of their valour and inspired with desire of victory, were seen to\r\nfall down on the Earth. The Earth became strewn over with hundreds and\r\nthousands of combatants bathed in blood, deprived of limbs, and divested\r\nof hair. In consequence of the surface of the Earth being covered with\r\nelephant-riders and horsemen and slain steeds and combatants with\r\nblood-stained armour and others armed with weapons and others who had\r\nsought to slay one another with diverse kinds of terrible weapons, all\r\nlying closely huddled together in that battle fraught with fearful\r\ncarnage, no warrior could proceed far on his horse. Having fought for a\r\nlittle while, Shakuni, the son of Subala, O monarch, went away from that\r\nspot with the remnant of his cavalry numbering 6,000. Similarly, the\r\nPandava force, covered with blood, and its animals fatigued, moved away\r\nfrom that spot with its remnant consisting of 6,000 horses. The\r\nblood-stained horsemen of the Pandava army then, with hearts intent on\r\nbattle and prepared to lay down their lives, said, \"It is no longer\r\npossible to fight here on cars; how much more difficult then to fight\r\nhere on elephants! Let cars proceed against cars, and elephants against\r\nelephants! Having retreated, Shakuni is now within his own division. The\r\nroyal son of Subala will not again come to battle.\" Then the sons of\r\nDraupadi and those infuriate elephants proceeded to the place where the\r\nPancala prince Dhrishtadyumna, that great car-warrior, was. Sahadeva\r\nalso, when that dusty cloud arose, proceeded alone to where king\r\nYudhishthira was. After all those had gone away, Shakuni, the son of\r\nSubala, excited with wrath, once more fell upon Dhrishtadyumna's division\r\nand began to strike it. Once more a dreadful battle took place, in which\r\nthe combatants were all regardless of their lives, between thy soldiers\r\nand those of the foe, all of whom were desirous of slaying one another.\r\nIn that encounter of heroes, the combatants first eyed one another\r\nsteadfastly, and then rushed, O king, and fell upon one another in\r\nhundreds and thousands. In that destructive carnage, heads severed with\r\nswords fell down with a noise like that of falling palmyra fruits. Loud\r\nalso became the noise, making the very hair to stand on end, of bodies\r\nfalling down on the ground, divested of armour and mangled with weapons\r\nand of falling weapons also, O king, and of arms and thighs severed from\r\nthe trunk. Striking brothers and sons and even sires with keen weapons,\r\nthe combatants were seen to fight like birds, for pieces of meat. Excited\r\nwith rage, thousands of warriors, falling upon one another, impatiently\r\nstruck one another in that battle. Hundreds and thousands of combatants,\r\nkilled by the weight of slain horsemen while falling down from their\r\nsteeds, fell down on the field. Loud became the noise of neighing steeds\r\nof great fleetness, and of shouting men clad in mail, and of the falling\r\ndarts and swords, O king, of combatants desirous of piercing the vitals\r\nof one another in consequence, O monarch, of thy evil policy. At that\r\ntime, thy soldiers, overcome with toil, spent with rage, their animals\r\nfatigued, themselves parched with thirst mangled with keen weapons, began\r\nto turn away from the battle. Maddened with the scent of blood, many\r\nbecame so insensate that they slew friends and foes alike, in fact, every\r\none they got at. Large numbers of Kshatriyas, inspired with desire of\r\nvictory, were struck down with arrows, O king, and fell prostrate on the\r\nEarth. Wolves and vultures and jackals began to howl and scream in glee\r\nand make a loud noise. In the very sight of thy son, thy army suffered a\r\ngreat loss. The Earth, O monarch, became strewn with the bodies of men\r\nand steeds, and covered with streams of blood that inspired the timid\r\nwith terror. Struck and mangled repeatedly with swords and battle axes\r\nand lances, thy warriors, as also the Pandavas, O Bharata, ceased to\r\napproach one another. Striking one another according to the measure of\r\ntheir strength, and fighting to the last drop of their blood, the\r\ncombatants fell down vomiting blood from their wounds. Headless forms\r\nwere seen, seizing the hair of their heads (with one hand) and with\r\nuplifted swords dyed with blood (in the other). When many headless forms,\r\nO king, had thus risen up, when the scent of blood had made the\r\ncombatants nearly senseless, and when the loud noise had somewhat\r\nsubsided, Subala's son (once more) approached the large host of the\r\nPandavas, with the small remnant of his horse. At this, the Pandavas,\r\ninspired with desires of victory and endued with foot-soldiers and\r\nelephants and cavalry, all with uplifted weapons, desirous of reaching\r\nthe end of the hostilities, the Pandavas, forming a wall, encompassed\r\nShakuni on all sides, and began to strike him with diverse kinds of\r\nweapons. Beholding those troops of thine assailed from every side, the\r\nKauravas, with horsemen, foot-soldiers, elephants, and cars, rushed\r\ntowards the Pandavas. Some foot-soldiers of great courage, destitute of\r\nweapons, attacked their foes in that battle, with feet and fists, and\r\nbrought them down. Car-warriors fell down from cars, and elephant-men\r\nfrom elephants, like meritorious persons falling down from their\r\ncelestial vehicles upon the exhaustion of their merits. Thus the\r\ncombatants, engaged with one another in that great battle, slew sires and\r\nfriends and sons. Thus occurred that battle, O best of the Bharatas, in\r\nwhich no consideration was shown by anybody for anyone, and in which\r\nlances and swords and arrows fell fast, on every side and made the scene\r\nexceedingly terrible to behold.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'When the loud noise of battle had somewhat subsided and\r\nthe Pandavas had slain large numbers of their foes, Subala's son (once\r\nmore) came for fight with the remnant of his horsemen numbering seven\r\nhundred. Quickly approaching his own soldiers and urging them to battle,\r\nhe repeatedly said, \"You chastisers of foes, fight cheerfully!\" And he\r\nasked the Kshatriyas present there, saying, \"Where is the king, that\r\ngreat car-warrior?\" Hearing these words of Shakuni, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, they answered saying, \"Yonder stayeth that great car-warrior, the\r\nKuru king, there where that large umbrella of splendour equal to that of\r\nthe full moon, is visible--there where those car-warriors, clad in mail,\r\nare staying--there where that loud noise, deep as the roar of clouds, is\r\nbeing heard! Proceed quickly thither, O king, and thou wilt then see the\r\nKuru monarch!\" Thus addressed by those brave warriors, Subala's son\r\nShakuni, O king, proceeded to that spot where thy son was staying,\r\nsurrounded on all sides by unretreating heroes. Beholding Duryodhana\r\nstationed in the midst of that car-force, Shakuni, gladdening all those\r\ncar-warriors of thine, O king cheerfully said these words unto\r\nDuryodhana. Indeed, he said the following words in a manner which showed\r\nthat he regarded all his purposes to have been already achieved. \"Slay, O\r\nking, the car-divisions (of the Pandavas)! All their horses have been\r\nvanquished by me! Yudhishthira is incapable of being conquered in battle\r\nunless one is prepared to lay down his life! When that car-force,\r\nprotected by the son of Pandu, will have been destroyed, we shall then\r\nslay all those elephants and foot-soldiers and others!\" Hearing these\r\nwords of his, thy warriors, inspired with desire of victory, cheerfully\r\nrushed towards the Pandava army. With quivers on their backs and bows in\r\ntheir hands, all of them shook their bows and uttered leonine roars. Once\r\nmore, O king, the fierce twang of bows and the slapping of palms and the\r\nwhiz of arrows shot with force was heard. Beholding those Kuru combatants\r\napproach the Pandava army with uplifted bows, Kunti's son Dhananjaya said\r\nunto the son of Devaki these words, \"Urge the steeds fearlessly and\r\npenetrate this sea of troops! With my keen shafts I shall today reach the\r\nend of these hostilities! Today is the eighteenth day, O Janardana, of\r\nthis great battle that is raging between the two sides! The army of those\r\nhigh-souled heroes, which was literally numberless, hath been nearly\r\ndestroyed! Behold the course of Destiny! The army of Dhritarashtra's son,\r\nO Madhava, which was vast as the ocean, hath, O Achyuta, become, after\r\nencountering ourselves, even like the indent caused by a cow's hoof! If\r\npeace had been made after Bhishma's fall, O Madhava, everything would\r\nhave been well! The foolish Duryodhana of weak understanding, however,\r\ndid not make peace! The words that were uttered by Bhishma, O Madhava,\r\nwere beneficial and worthy of adoption. Suyodhana, however, who had lost\r\nhis understanding, did not act according to them. After Bhishma had been\r\nstruck and thrown down on the Earth, I do not know the reason why the\r\nbattle proceeded! I regard the Dhartarashtras to be foolish and of weak\r\nunderstanding in every way, since they continued the battle even after\r\nthe fall of Santanu's son! After that when Drona, that foremost of all\r\nutterers of Brahma, fell, as also the son of Radha, and Vikarna, the\r\ncarnage did not still cease! Alas, when a small remnant only of the\r\n(Kaurava) army remained after the fall of that tiger among men, Karna,\r\nwith his sons, the carnage did not still cease! After the fall of even\r\nthe heroic Srutayush, of also Jalasandha of Puru's race, and of king\r\nSrutayudha, the carnage did not still cease! After the fall of\r\nBhurishrava, of Shalya, O Janardana, and of the Avanti heroes, the\r\ncarnage did not still cease! After the fall of Jayadratha, of the\r\nRakshasa Alayudha, of Bahlika, and of Somadatta, the carnage did not\r\nstill cease! After the fall of heroic Bhagadatta, of the Kamboja chief\r\nSadakshina, and of Duhshasana, the carnage did not still cease! Beholding\r\neven diverse heroic and mighty kings, each owning extensive territories,\r\nslain in battle, the carnage, O Krishna, did not still cease! Beholding\r\neven a full Akshauhini of troops slain by Bhimasena in battle, the\r\ncarnage did not still cease, in consequence of either the folly or the\r\ncovetousness of the Dhartarashtras! What king born in a noble race, a\r\nrace especially like that of Kuru, save of course the foolish Duryodhana,\r\nwould thus fruitlessly wage such fierce hostilities? Who is there,\r\npossessed of reason and wisdom and capable of discriminating good from\r\nevil, that would thus wage war, knowing his foes to be superior to him in\r\nmerit, strength, and courage? How could he listen to the counsels of\r\nanother, when, indeed, he could not make up his mind to make peace with\r\nthe Pandavas in obedience to the words uttered by thee? What medicine can\r\nbe acceptable to that person today who disregarded Bhishma the son of\r\nSantanu, and Drona, and Vidura, while they urged him to make peace? How\r\ncan he accept good counsels, who from folly, O Janardana, insolently\r\ndisregarded his own aged sire as also his own well-meaning mother while\r\nspeaking beneficial words unto him? It is evident, O Janardana, that\r\nDuryodhana took his birth for exterminating his race! His conduct and his\r\npolicy, it is seen, point to that line, O lord! He will not give us our\r\nkingdom yet! This is my opinion, O Achyuta! The high-souled Vidura, O\r\nsire, told me many a time that as long as life remained in\r\nDhritarashtra's son, he would never give us our share of the kingdom!\r\nVidura further told me, 'As long also as Dhritarashtra will live, O giver\r\nof honours, even that sinful wight will act sinfully towards you! Ye will\r\nnever succeed in vanquishing Duryodhana without battle!' Even thus, O\r\nMadhava, did Vidura of true foresight often speak to me! All the acts of\r\nthat wicked-souled wight, I now find to be exactly as the high-souled\r\nVidura had said! That person of wicked understanding who, having listened\r\nto the beneficial and proper words of Jamadagni's son, disregarded them,\r\nshould certainly be held as standing in the face of destruction. Many\r\npersons crowned with ascetic success said as soon as Duryodhana was born,\r\nthat the entire Kshatriya order would be exterminated in consequence of\r\nthat wretch. Those words of the sages, O Janardana, are now being\r\nrealised, since the Kshatriyas are undergoing almost entire extermination\r\nin consequence of Duryodhana's acts! I shall, O Madhava, slay all the\r\nwarriors today! After all the Kshatriyas will have been slain and the\r\n(Kaurava) camp made empty, Duryodhana will then desire battle with us for\r\nhis own destruction. That will end these hostilities! Exercising my\r\nreason, O Madhava, and reflected in my own mind, O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace, thinking of Vidura's words, and taking into account the acts of the\r\nwicked-souled Duryodhana himself, I have come to this conclusion!\r\nPenetrate the Bharata army, O hero, for I shall slay the wicked-souled\r\nDuryodhana and his army today with my keen shafts! Slaying this weak army\r\nin the very sight of Dhritarashtra's son, I shall today do what is for\r\nYudhishthira's good!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Savyasaci, he of Dasarha's race,\r\nreins in hand, fearlessly penetrated that vast hostile force for battle.\r\nThat was a terrible forest of bows (which the two heroes entered). Darts\r\nconstituted its prickles. Maces and spiked bludgeons were its paths. Cars\r\nand elephants were its mighty trees. Cavalry and infantry were its\r\ncreepers. And the illustrious Keshava, as he entered that forest on that\r\ncar decked with many banners and pennons, looked exceedingly resplendent.\r\nThose white steeds, O king, bearing Arjuna in battle, were seen careering\r\neverywhere, urged by him of Dasarha's race! Then that scorcher of foes,\r\nSavyasaci, proceeded on his car, shooting hundreds of keen shafts like a\r\ncloud pouring showers of rain. Loud was the noise produced by those\r\nstraight arrows, as also by those combatants that were covered with them\r\nin that battle by Savyasaci. Showers of shafts, piercing through the\r\narmour of the combatants, fell down on the Earth. Impelled from Gandiva,\r\narrows, whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, striking men and\r\nelephants and horses, O king, fell in that battle with a noise like that\r\nof winged insects. Everything was shrouded with those shafts shot from\r\nGandiva. In that battle, the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, could not be distinguished. The whole world seemed to be\r\nfilled with gold-winged shafts, steeped in oil, polished by the hands of\r\nthe smith, and marked with Partha's name. Struck with those keen shafts,\r\nand burnt therewith by Partha even as a herd of elephants is burnt with\r\nburning brands, the Kauravas became languid and lost their strength.\r\nArmed with bow and arrows, Partha, resembling the blazing sun, burnt the\r\nhostile combatants in that battle like a blazing fire consuming a heap of\r\ndry grass. As a roaring fire of blazing flames and great energy (arising\r\nfrom embers) cast away on the confines of a forest by its denizens, fire\r\nconsumes those woods abounding with trees and heaps of dry creepers, even\r\nso that hero possessed of great activity and fierce energy and endued\r\nwith prowess of weapons, and having shafts for his flames, quickly burnt\r\nall the troops of thy son from wrath. His gold-winged arrows, endued with\r\nfatal force and shot with care, could not be baffled by any armour. He\r\nhad not to shoot a second arrow at man, steed, or elephant of gigantic\r\nsize. Like the thunder-wielding Indra striking down the Daityas, Arjuna,\r\nalone, entering that division of mighty car-warriors, destroyed it with\r\nshafts of diverse forms.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Dhananjaya, with his Gandiva, frustrated the purpose of\r\nthose unreturning heroes struggling in battle and striking their foes.\r\nThe shafts shot by Arjuna, irresistible and endued with great force and\r\nwhose touch was like that of the thunder, were seen to resemble torrents\r\nof rain poured by a cloud. That army, O chief of the Bharatas, thus\r\nstruck by Kiritin, fled away in the very sight of thy son. Some deserted\r\ntheir sires and brothers, others deserted their comrades. Some\r\ncar-warriors were deprived of their animals. Others lost their drivers.\r\nSome had their poles or yokes or wheels broken, O king! The arrows of\r\nsome were exhausted. Some were seen afflicted with arrows. Some, though\r\nunwounded, fled in a body, afflicted with fear. Some endeavoured to\r\nrescue their sons, having lost all their kinsmen and animals. Some loudly\r\ncalled upon their sires, some upon their comrades and followers. Some\r\nfled, deserting their kinsmen, O tiger among men, and brothers and other\r\nrelatives, O monarch! Many mighty car-warriors, struck with Partha's\r\nshafts and deeply pierced therewith, were seen to breathe hard, deprived\r\nof their senses. Others, taking them upon their own cars, and soothing\r\nthem for a while, and resting them and dispelling their thirst by\r\noffering them drink, once more proceeded to battle. Some, incapable of\r\nbeing easily defeated in battle, deserting the wounded, once more\r\nadvanced to battle, desirous of obeying the behests of thy son. Some,\r\nhaving slaked their thirst or groomed their animals, and some, wearing\r\n(fresh) armour, O chief of the Bharatas, and some, having comforted their\r\nbrothers and sons and sires, and placed them in camp, once more came to\r\nbattle. Some, arraying their cars in the order, O king, of superiors and\r\ninferiors, advanced against the Pandavas once more for battle. Those\r\nheroes (on their cars) covered with rows of bells, looked resplendent\r\nlike Daityas and Danavas intent on the conquest of the three worlds.\r\nSome, advancing with precipitancy on their vehicles decked with gold,\r\nfought with Dhrishtadyumna amid the Pandava divisions. The Pancala prince\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and the great car-warrior Shikhandi, and Satanika, the\r\nson of Nakula, fought with the car-force of the enemy. The Pancala\r\nprince, then, filled with rage and supported by a large army, rushed\r\nagainst thy angry troops from desire of slaying them. Then thy son, O\r\nruler of men, sped many showers of arrows, O Bharata, at the Pancala\r\nprince thus rushing at him. Then, O king, Dhrishtadyumna was quickly\r\npierced with many arrows in his arms and chest by thy son fighting with\r\nhis bow. Deeply pierced therewith like an elephant with pointed lances,\r\nthat great bowman then despatched with his shafts the four steeds of\r\nDuryodhana to the regions of death. With another broad-headed arrow he\r\nnext cut off from his trunk the head of his enemy's driver. Then that\r\nchastiser of foes, king Duryodhana, having thus lost his car, rode on\r\nhorse-back and retreated to a spot not remote. Beholding his own army\r\ndestitute of prowess, thy son, the mighty Duryodhana, O king, proceeded\r\nto the place where Subala's son was. When the Kaurava cars were broken,\r\n3,000 gigantic elephants encompassed those car-warriors, the five\r\nPandavas. Encompassed by that elephant force, O Bharata, the five\r\nbrothers looked beautiful, O tiger among men, like the planets surrounded\r\nby the clouds. Then the mighty-armed and white-steeded Arjuna, O king, of\r\nsureness of aim and having Krishna for his charioteer, advanced on his\r\ncar. Surrounded by those elephants huge as hills, he began to destroy\r\nthose animals with his keen and polished arrows. Each slain with a single\r\narrow, we beheld those huge elephants fallen or falling down, mangled by\r\nSavyasaci. The mighty Bhimasena, himself like an infuriated elephant,\r\nbeholding those elephants, took up his formidable mace and rushed at\r\nthem, quickly jumping down from his car, like the Destroyer armed with\r\nhis club. Seeing that great car-warrior of the Pandavas with uplifted\r\nmace, thy soldiers became filled with fright and passed urine and\r\nexcreta. The whole army became agitated upon beholding Bhimasena armed\r\nwith mace. We then beheld those elephants, huge as hills, running hither\r\nand thither, with their frontal globes split open by Bhima with his mace\r\nand all their limbs bathed in blood. Struck with Bhima's mace, those\r\nelephants, running off from him, fell down with cries of pain, like\r\nwingless mountains. Beholding those elephants, many in number, with their\r\nfrontal globes split open, running hither and thither or falling down,\r\nthy soldiers were inspired with fear. Then Yudhishthira also, filled with\r\nwrath, and the two sons of Madri, began to slay those elephant-warriors\r\nwith arrows equipped with vulturine wings. Dhrishtadyumna, after the\r\ndefeat of the (Kuru) king in battle, and after the flight of the latter\r\nfrom that spot on horse-back, saw that the Pandavas had all been\r\nsurrounded by the (Kaurava) elephants. Beholding this, O monarch,\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the son of the Pancala king, proceeded towards those\r\nelephants, from desire of slaughtering them. Meanwhile, not seeing\r\nDuryodhana in the midst of the car-force. Ashvatthama and Kripa, and\r\nKritavarma of the Satwata race, asked all the Kshatriyas there, saying,\r\n'Where has Duryodhana gone?' Not seeing the king in that carnage, those\r\ngreat car-warriors all thought thy son to have been slain. Hence, with\r\nsorrowful faces, they enquired after him. Some persons told them that\r\nafter the fall of his driver, he had gone to Subala's son. Other\r\nKshatriyas, present there, who had been exceedingly mangled with wounds,\r\nsaid, \"What need is there with Duryodhana? See if he is yet alive! Do you\r\nall fight unitedly? What will the king do to you?\" Other Kshatriyas, who\r\nwere exceedingly mangled, who had lost many of their kinsmen, and who\r\nwere still being afflicted with the arrows of the enemy, said these words\r\nin indistinct tones, \"Let us slay these forces by whom we are\r\nencompassed! Behold, the Pandavas are coming hither, after having slain\r\nthe elephants!\" Hearing these words of theirs, the mighty Ashvatthama,\r\npiercing through that irresistible force of the Pancala king, proceeded\r\nwith Kripa and Kritavarma to the spot where Subala's son was. Indeed,\r\nthose heroes, those firm bowmen, leaving the car-force, repaired (in\r\nsearch of Duryodhana). After they had gone away, the Pandavas, headed by\r\nDhrishtadyumna, advanced, O king, and began to slay their enemies.\r\nBeholding those valiant and heroic and mighty car-warriors cheerfully\r\nrushing towards them, thy troops, amongst whom the faces of many had\r\nturned pale, became hopeless of their lives. Seeing those soldiers of\r\nours almost deprived of weapons and surrounded (by the foe). I myself, O\r\nking, having only two kinds of forces, and becoming reckless of life,\r\njoined the five leaders of our army, and fought with the forces of the\r\nPancala prince, posting our men on that spot where Saradwat's son was\r\nstationed. We had been afflicted with the shafts of Kiritin.\r\nNevertheless, a fierce battle took place between us and the division of\r\nDhrishtadyumna. At last, vanquished by the latter, all of us retreated\r\nfrom that encounter. I then beheld the mighty car-warrior Satyaki rushing\r\nagainst us. With four hundred cars that hero pursued me in battle. Having\r\nescaped with difficulty from Dhrishtadyumna whose steeds had been tired,\r\nI fell among the forces of Madhava even as a sinner falleth into hell.\r\nThere a fierce and terrible battle took place for a short while. The\r\nmighty-armed Satyaki, having cut off my armour, became desirous of taking\r\nme alive. He seized me while I lay down on the ground insensible. Then\r\nwithin a short while that elephant-force was destroyed by Bhimasena with\r\nhis mace and Arjuna with his arrows. In consequence of those mighty\r\nelephants, huge as hills, falling down on every side with crushed limbs,\r\nthe Pandava warriors found their way almost entirely blocked up. Then the\r\nmighty Bhimasena, O monarch, dragging away those huge elephants, made a\r\nway for the Pandavas to come out. Meanwhile, Ashvatthama and Kripa and\r\nKritavarma of the Satwata race, not seeing that chastiser of foes,\r\nDuryodhana, amid the car-division, sought for thy royal son, Abandoning\r\nthe prince of the Pancalas, they proceeded to the spot where Subala's son\r\nwas anxious to have a sight of the king during that terrible carnage.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After that elephant-division had been destroyed, O\r\nBharata, by the son of Pandu, and while thy army was being thus\r\nslaughtered by Bhimasena in battle, beholding the latter, that chastiser\r\nof foes, careering like the all-killing Destroyer himself in rage armed\r\nwith his club, the remnant of thy unslaughtered sons, those uterine\r\nbrothers, O king, united together at that time when he of Kuru's race,\r\nthy son Duryodhana, could not be seen, and rushed against Bhimasena. They\r\nwere Durmarshana and Srutanta and Jaitra and Bhurivala and Ravi, and\r\nJayatsena and Sujata and that slayer of foes, Durvishaha, and he called\r\nDurvimochana, and Dushpradharsha and the mighty-armed Srutarvan. All of\r\nthem were accomplished in battle. Those sons of thine, uniting together,\r\nrushed against Bhimasena and shut him up on all sides. Then Bhima, O\r\nmonarch, once more mounting on his own car, began to shoot keen shafts at\r\nthe vital limbs of thy sons. Those sons of thine, covered with arrows by\r\nBhimasena in that dreadful battle, began to drag that warrior like men\r\ndragging an elephant from off a cross-way. Excited with rage, Bhimasena,\r\nquickly cutting off the head of Durmarshana with a razor-headed arrow,\r\nfelled it on the Earth. With another broad-headed arrow capable of\r\npenetrating every armour, Bhima next slew that mighty car-warrior, thy\r\nson Srutanta. Then with the greatest ease, piercing Jayatsena with a\r\ncloth-yard shaft, that chastiser of foes, the son of Pandu, felled that\r\nscion of Kuru's race from his car. The prince, O king, fell down and\r\nimmediately expired. At this, thy son Srutarvan, excited with rage,\r\npierced Bhima with a hundred straight arrows winged with vulturine\r\nfeathers. Then Bhima, inflamed with rage, pierced Jaitra and Ravi and\r\nBhurivala, those three, with three shafts resembling poison or fire.\r\nThose mighty car-warriors, thus struck, fell down from their cars, like\r\nKinsukas variegated with flowers in the season of spring cut down (by the\r\naxe-man). Then that scorcher of foes, with another broad-headed arrow of\r\ngreat keenness, struck Durvimochana and despatched him to Yama's abode.\r\nThus struck, that foremost of carwarriors fell down on the ground from\r\nhis car, like a tree growing on the summit of a mountain when broken by\r\nthe wind. The son of Pandu next struck thy other two sons at the head of\r\ntheir forces, Dushpradharsha and Sujata, each with a couple of arrows in\r\nthat battle. Those two foremost of car-warriors, pierced with those\r\nshafts, fell down. Beholding next another son of thine, Durvishaha,\r\nrushing at him, Bhima pierced him with a broad-headed arrow in that\r\nbattle. That prince fell down from his car in the very sight of all the\r\nbowmen. Beholding so many of his brothers slain by the singlehanded Bhima\r\nin that battle, Srutarvan, under the influence of rage, rushed at Bhima,\r\nstretching his formidable bow decked with gold and shooting a large\r\nnumber of arrows that resembled poison or fire in energy. Cutting off the\r\nbow of Pandu's son in that dreadful battle, the Kuru prince pierced the\r\nbowless Bhima with twenty arrows. Then Bhimasena, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, taking up another bow, shrouded thy son with arrows and\r\naddressing him, said, \"Wait, Wait!' The battle that took place between\r\nthe two was beautiful and fierce, like that which had occurred in days of\r\nyore between Vasava and the Asura Jambha, O lord! With the keen shafts,\r\nresembling the fatal rods of Yama, sped by those two warriors, the Earth,\r\nthe sky, and all the points of the compass, became shrouded. Then\r\nSrutarvan, filled with rage, took up his bow and struck Bhimasena in that\r\nbattle, O king, with many arrows on his arms and chest. Deeply pierced, O\r\nmonarch, by thy son armed with the bow, Bhima became exceedingly agitated\r\nlike the ocean at the full or the new moon. Filled with wrath, Bhima\r\nthen, O sire, despatched with his arrows the driver and the four steeds\r\nof thy son to Yama's abode. Beholding him carless, Pandu's son of\r\nimmeasurable soul, displaying the lightness of his hands, covered him\r\nwith winged arrows. The carless Srutarvan then, O king, took up a sword\r\nand shield. As the prince, however, careered with his sword and bright\r\nshield decked with a hundred moons, the son of Pandu struck off his head\r\nfrom his trunk with a razor-headed arrow and felled it on the Earth. The\r\ntrunk of that illustrious warrior, rendered headless by means of that\r\nrazor-headed arrow, fell down from his car, filling the Earth with a loud\r\nnoise. Upon the fall of that hero, thy troops, though terrified, rushed\r\nin that battle against Bhimasena from desire of fighting with him. The\r\nvaliant Bhimasena, clad in mail, received those warriors rushing quickly\r\nat him from among the unslain remnant of that ocean of troops.\r\nApproaching him, those warriors encompassed that hero on all sides. Thus\r\nsurrounded by those warriors of thine, Bhima began to afflict them all\r\nwith keen shafts like him of a 1,000 eyes afflicting the Asuras. Having\r\ndestroyed five hundred great cars with their fences, he once more slew\r\nseven hundred elephants in that battle. Slaying next 10,000 foot-soldiers\r\nwith his mighty shafts, as also 800 steeds, the son of Pandu looked\r\nresplendent. Indeed, Bhimasena, the son of Kunti, having slain thy sons\r\nin battle, regarded his object achieved, O lord, and the purpose of his\r\nbirth accomplished. Thy troops, at that time, O Bharata, ventured to even\r\ngaze at that warrior who was battling in that fashion and slaying thy men\r\nin that way. Routing all the Kurus and slaying those followers of theirs,\r\nBhima then slapped his armpits, terrifying the huge elephants with the\r\nnoise he produced. Then thy army, O monarch, which had lost a very large\r\nnumber of men, and which then consisted of a very few soldiers, became\r\nexceedingly cheerless, O king!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Duryodhana, O king, and thy son Sudarsa, the only two of\r\nthy children yet unslain, were at that time in the midst of the (Kaurava)\r\ncavalry. Beholding Duryodhana staying in the midst of the cavalry,\r\nDevaki's son (Krishna) said unto Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, \"A large\r\nnumber of our foes, kinsmen that had received our protection, have been\r\nslain. There, that bull of Sini's race is returning, having taken Sanjaya\r\ncaptive! Both Nakula and Sahadeva, O Bharata, are fatigued, having fought\r\nwith the wretched Dhartarashtras and their followers! Those three, Kripa\r\nand Kritavarma and the mighty car-warrior Ashvatthama, have left\r\nDuryodhana's side and taken up their position elsewhere! Having slain\r\nDuryodhana's troops, the Pancala prince stayeth yonder, endued with great\r\nbeauty, in the midst of the Prabhadrakas. There, O Partha, Duryodhana\r\nstayeth in the midst of his cavalry, with the umbrella held over his head\r\nand himself flinging his glances all around! Having rearrayed the\r\n(remnant of his) army, he stayeth in the midst of his forces. Slaying\r\nthis one with thy keen shafts, thou mayst achieve all thy objects! As\r\nlong as these troops do not fly away beholding thee, in their midst and\r\nwitnessing also the destruction of their elephant-force, do thou, O\r\nchastiser of foes, endeavour to slay Duryodhana! Let somebody go to the\r\nPancala prince and ask him to come hither. The (Kaurava) troops are all\r\ntired, O sire! The sinful Duryodhana will never succeed in escaping!\r\nHaving slain a large number of thy troops in battle, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra wears a proud aspect as if he believes that the Pandavas\r\nhave been vanquished! Beholding his own troops afflicted and slain by the\r\nPandavas, the Kuru king will certainly come to battle for his own\r\ndestruction!\" Thus addressed by Krishna, Phalguna replied unto him,\r\nsaying. \"Almost all the sons of Dhritarashtra, O giver of honours, have\r\nbeen slain by Bhima! Only these two are yet alive! They, however, O\r\nKrishna, shall also meet with destruction today! Bhishma hath been slain,\r\nDrona hath been slain, Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, hath been\r\nslain! Shalya, the king of the Madras, hath been slain, and Jayadratha\r\nalso, O Krishna, hath been slain! Only five hundred horses from the\r\nremnant of the troops of Shakuni, the son of Subala, and of cars, only\r\ntwo hundred still remain, O Janardana! Of elephants there remain only a\r\nhundred that are formidable, and of foot only 3,000! There remain also\r\nAshvatthama and Kripa and the ruler of the Trigartas and Uluka and\r\nKritavarma of the Satwata race. These, O Madhava, form the remnant of\r\nDuryodhana's force! Truly, there is no escape from death for anybody on\r\nEarth! Although such a tremendous carnage hast taken place, behold,\r\nDuryodhana is still alive! Today king Yudhishthira, however, will be\r\nfreed from all his foes! None amongst the enemy will escape me, I ween!\r\nEven if they be more than men, O Krishna, I shall yet slay all those\r\nwarriors today, however, furious in battle, if only they do not fly away\r\nfrom the field! Filled with wrath in today's battle, I shall, by slaying\r\nthe prince of Gandhara with my keen shafts, dispel that sleeplessness\r\nwhich the king has suffered from for a long time! I shall win back all\r\nthose valuable possessions which Subala's son, of wicked conduct, won\r\nfrom us at the gambling match in the assembly! Hearing of the slaughter\r\nof their husbands and sons at the hands of the Pandavas in battle, all\r\nthe ladies of the city called after the elephant will utter loud wails!\r\nToday, O Krishna, our task will be ended! Today Duryodhana shall abandon\r\nall his blazing prosperity, as also his life-breath. Thou mayest take the\r\nfoolish son of Dhritarashtra to be dead, O thou of Vrishni's race, if, O\r\nKrishna, he does not today fly away from the battle to be waged by me!\r\nThose steeds are incapable of enduring the twang of my bow and the slaps\r\nof my palms! Proceed thither, O Krishna, for I will slay them!\" Thus\r\naddressed by Pandu's son of great force of mind, he of Dasarha's race\r\nurged his steeds, O king, towards the division of Duryodhana. Beholding\r\nthat force (within which Duryodhana was), three mighty car-warriors\r\nprepared themselves for assailing it, for Bhimasena and Arjuna and\r\nSahadeva, O sire, together proceeded against it with loud leonine roars\r\nfrom desire of slaying Duryodhana. Beholding those three warriors rushing\r\nquickly together with uplifted bows, Subala's son proceeded towards that\r\nspot against those Pandava foes. Thy son Sudarsana rushed against\r\nBhimasena. Susarman and Shakuni encountered Kiritin. Thy son Duryodhana\r\non horse-back proceeded against Sahadeva. Then thy son, O ruler of men,\r\nwith great speed and care, forcibly struck Sahadeva's head with a lance.\r\nThus assailed by thy son, Sahadeva sat down on the terrace of his car,\r\nall his limbs bathed in blood and himself sighing like a snake. Regaining\r\nhis senses then, O king, Sahadeva, filled with rage, covered Duryodhana\r\nwith keen arrows. Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, otherwise called Partha,\r\nputting forth his prowess, cut off the heads of many brave combatants on\r\nhorse-back. Indeed, Partha, with many arrows, destroyed that (cavalry)\r\ndivision. Having felled all the steeds, he then proceeded against the\r\ncars of the Trigartas. At this, the great car-warriors of the Trigartas,\r\nuniting together, covered Arjuna and Vasudeva with showers of shafts.\r\nAssailing Satyakarman with a razor-headed arrow, the son of Pandu,\r\npossessed of great fame, cut off his adversary's car-shafts. With another\r\nrazor-headed arrow, O lord, whetted on stone, that celebrated hero,\r\nsmiling the while, cut off his antagonist's head adorned with bright\r\ngold. He next attacked Satyeshu in the sight of all the warriors, like a\r\nhungry lion, O king, in the forest, attacking a deer. Having slain him,\r\nPartha pierced Susarman with three arrows and then slew all those\r\ncar-warriors adorned with ornaments of gold. He then proceeded against\r\nSusarman the ruler of Prashthala with great speed, vomiting the virulent\r\npoison of his wrath cherished for many long years. Covering him first, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, with a hundred arrows, Arjuna then slew all the\r\nsteeds of that bowman. Fixing then on his bowstring a mighty arrow that\r\nresembled the rod of Yama, Partha, smiling the while, quickly sped it at\r\nSusarman, aiming it at him. Sped by that bowman blazing with wrath, that\r\narrow, reaching Susarman, pierced through his heart in that battle.\r\nDeprived of life, O monarch, Susarman fell down on the Earth, gladdening\r\nall the Pandavas and paining all thy warriors. Having slain Susarman in\r\nthat battle, Partha then, with his shafts, despatched the five and thirty\r\nsons of that king, all of whom were great car-warriors, to Yama's abode.\r\nSlaying next all the followers of Susarman with his keen arrows, the\r\nmighty car-warrior, Arjuna, proceeded against the remnant of the Bharata\r\nhost. Bhima, in that battle, filled with rage, O ruler of men, made thy\r\nson Sudarsana invisible with his arrows, and smiling the while, cut off\r\nfrom his antagonist's trunk his head with a razor-headed arrow of great\r\nsharpness. Deprived of life, the prince fell down on the Earth. Upon the\r\nfall of that (Kuru) hero, his followers encompassed Bhima in that battle,\r\nshooting showers of whetted arrows at him. Vrikodara, however, with his\r\nkeen arrows, whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, covered that\r\nforce around him. Within a very short time, Bhima slew them all, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race! Whilst they were being thus exterminated, many Kaurava\r\nleaders of great might, O Bharata, approached Bhima and began to fight\r\nwith him. The son of Pandu, O king, covered all of them with his arrows.\r\nSimilarly, thy warriors, O monarch, covered the great car-warriors of the\r\nPandavas with dense showers of arrows from every side. All the warriors\r\nthen, of both sides, thus engaged in battle with one another, became\r\nexceedingly agitated. Struck by one another, the combatants of both\r\narmies, O king, began to fall down, wailing aloud for their (deceased)\r\nkinsmen.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that battle which was so\r\ndestructive of men and steeds and elephants, Subala's son, Shakuni, O\r\nking, rushed against Sahadeva. The valiant Sahadeva, as Shakuni rushed\r\nquickly towards him, sped showers of swift arrows at that warrior as\r\nnumerous as a flight of insects. At that time, Uluka also encountered\r\nBhima and pierced him with ten arrows, Shakuni, meanwhile, O monarch,\r\nhaving pierced Bhima with three arrows, covered Sahadeva with ninety.\r\nIndeed, those heroes, O king, encountering one another in that battle,\r\npierced one another with many keen arrows equipped with Kanka and peacock\r\nfeathers, winged with gold, whetted on stone, and sped from bow-strings\r\ndrawn to their ears. Those showers of arrows sped from their bows and\r\narms, O monarch, shrouded all the points of the compass like a thick\r\nshower of rain poured from the clouds. Then Bhima, filled with rage, and\r\nSahadeva of great valour, both endued with great might, careered in that\r\nbattle, making an immense carnage. That army, O Bharata, was covered with\r\nhundreds of arrows by those two warriors. In consequence thereof, the\r\nwelkin on many parts of the field became shrouded with darkness. In\r\nconsequence, O monarch, of steeds, covered with arrows, dragging after\r\nthem, as they ran, a large number of slain combatants, the tracks on many\r\nparts of the field became entirely blocked up. Covered with steeds slain\r\nwith their riders, with broken shields and lances, O monarch, and with\r\nswords and darts and spears all around, the Earth looked variegated as if\r\nstrewn with flowers. The combatants, O king, encountering one another,\r\ncareered in battle, filled with wrath and taking one another's life. Soon\r\nthe field became strewn with heads, beautiful as the filaments of the\r\nlotus, adorned with earrings and graced with faces set with eyes upturned\r\nin wrath and lips bit in rage. Covered also, O monarch, with the severed\r\narms of warriors that resembled the trunks of huge elephants, that were\r\nadorned with Angadas and cased in leathern fences, and that still held\r\nswords and lances and battle-axes, and with headless bodies risen on\r\ntheir feet and bleeding and dancing on the field, and swarming with\r\ncarnivorous creatures of diverse kinds, the Earth, O lord, presented a\r\nfrightful aspect! After the Bharata army had been reduced to a small\r\nremnant, the Pandavas, filled with delight in that dreadful battle began\r\nto despatch the Kauravas to Yama's abode. Meanwhile, the heroic and\r\nvaliant son of Subala's son very forcibly struck Sahadeva on the head\r\nwith a lance. Exceedingly agitated, O monarch, in consequence of the\r\nblow, Sahadeva sat down on the terrace of his car. Beholding Sahadeva in\r\nthat plight, the valiant Bhima, filled with rage, O Bharata, held the\r\nwhole Kuru army in check. With his cloth-yard shaft he pierced hundreds\r\nand thousands of hostile warriors, and having pierced them so, that\r\nchastier of foes uttered a leonine roar. Frightened at that roar, all the\r\nfollowers of Shakuni, with their steeds and elephants, precipitately fled\r\naway in fear. Beholding them broken, king Duryodhana said unto them,\r\n\"Stop, ye Kshatriyas, unacquainted with morality! Fight! What is the use\r\nof flight? That hero, who, without showing his back casteth away his life\r\nbreath in battle, achieveth fame here and enjoyeth regions of bliss\r\nhereafter!\" Thus exhorted by the king, the followers of Subala's son once\r\nmore advanced against the Pandavas, making death their goal. Awful, O\r\nmonarch, was the noise made by those rushing warriors, resembling that of\r\nthe agitated ocean. At this, the field of battle became agitated all\r\naround. Beholding those followers of Subala's son thus advancing in\r\nbattle, the victorious Pandavas, O monarch, proceeded against them.\r\nComforted a little, the invincible Sahadeva, O monarch, pierced Shakuni\r\nwith ten arrows and his steeds with three. With the greatest ease he then\r\ncut off the bow of Subala's son with a number of other arrows. Invincible\r\nin battle, Shakuni, however, took up another bow and pierced Nakula with\r\nsixty arrows and then Bhimasena with seven. Uluka also, O king, desirous\r\nof rescuing his sire in that engagement, pierced Bhima with seven arrows\r\nand Sahadeva with seventy. Bhimasena in that encounter pierced Uluka with\r\nmany keen arrows and Shakuni with four and sixty, and each of the other\r\nwarriors who fought around them, with three arrows. Struck by Bhimasena\r\nwith shafts steeped in oil, the Kauravas, filled with rage in that\r\nbattle, covered Sahadeva with showers of arrows like lightning-charged\r\nclouds pouring rain on a mountain-breast. The heroic and valiant Sahadeva\r\nthen, O monarch, cut off, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of Uluka as\r\nthe latter advanced against him. Slain by Sahadeva, Uluka, gladdening the\r\nPandavas in that battle, fell down on the earth from his car, all his\r\nlimbs bathed in blood. Beholding his son slain, Shakuni, O Bharata, with\r\nvoice choked with tears and drawing deep breaths, recollected the words\r\nof Vidura. Having reflected for a moment with tearful eyes, Shakuni,\r\nbreathing heavily, approached Sahadeva and pierced him with three arrows.\r\nBaffling those arrows sped by Subala's son with showers of shafts, the\r\nvaliant Sahadeva, O monarch, cut off his antagonist's bow in that battle.\r\nSeeing his bow cut off, O king, Shakuni, the son of Subala, took up a\r\nformidable scimitar and hurled it at Sahadeva. The latter, however, with\r\nthe greatest ease, O monarch, cut off in twain that terrible scimitar of\r\nSubala's son as it coursed towards him in that encounter. Beholding his\r\nsword cut in twain, Shakuni took up a formidable mace and hurled it at\r\nSahadeva. That mace also, unable to achieve its object, fell down on the\r\nEarth. After this, Subala's son, filled with rage, hurled at the son of\r\nPandu an awful dart that resembled an impending death night. With the\r\ngreatest ease Sahadeva, in that encounter, cut off, with his gold-decked\r\nshafts, into three fragments, that dart as it coursed swiftly towards\r\nhim. Cut off into fragments, that dart adorned with gold fell down on the\r\nearth like a blazing thunderbolt from the firmament, diverging into many\r\nflashes. Beholding that dart baffled and Subala's son afflicted with\r\nfear, all thy troops fled away in fright. Subala's son himself joined\r\nthem. The Pandavas then, eager for victory, uttered loud shouts. As\r\nregards the Dhartarashtras, almost all of them turned away from the\r\nfight. Seeing them so cheerless, the valiant son of Madri, with many\r\n1,000 shafts, checked them in that battle. Then Sahadeva came upon\r\nSubala's son as the latter, who was still expectant of victory, was\r\nflying away, protected by the excellent cavalry of the Gandharas.\r\nRecollecting, O king, that Shakuni, who had fallen to his share, was\r\nstill alive, Sahadeva, on his car adorned with gold, pursued that\r\nwarrior. Stringing his formidable bow and drawing it with great force,\r\nSahadeva, filled with rage, pursued the son of Subala and vigorously\r\nstruck him with many shafts equipped with vulturine feathers and whetted\r\non stone, even like a person striking a mighty elephant with pointed\r\nlances. Endued with great energy of mind, Sahadeva, having afflicted his\r\nfoe thus, addressed him, as if for calling back to mind (his past\r\nmisdeeds), in these words, 'Adhering to the duties of a Kshatriya, fight\r\n(with me) and be a man! Thou hadst, O fool, rejoiced greatly in the midst\r\nof the assembly, while gambling with dice! Receive now, O thou of wicked\r\nunderstanding, the fruit of that act! All those wicked-souled ones that\r\nhad ridiculed us then have perished! Only that wretch of his race,\r\nDuryodhana, is still alive, and thyself, his maternal uncle! Today I\r\nshall slay thee, striking off thy head with a razor-headed arrow like a\r\nperson plucking a fruit from a tree with a stick!\" Saying these words, O\r\nmonarch, Sahadeva of great strength, that tiger among men, filled with\r\nrage, rushed impetuously against Shakuni. Approaching his enemy, the\r\ninvincible Sahadeva, that foremost of warriors, forcibly drawing his bow\r\nand as if burning his foe with wrath, pierced Shakuni with ten arrows and\r\nhis steeds with four. Then cutting off his umbrella and standard and bow,\r\nhe roared like a lion. His standard and bow and umbrella thus cut off by\r\nSahadeva, Subala's son was pierced with many arrows in all his vital\r\nlimbs. Once again, O monarch, the valiant Sahadeva sped at Shakuni an\r\nirresistible shower of arrows. Filled with rage, the son of Subala then,\r\nsingle-handed, rushed with speed against Sahadeva in that encounter,\r\ndesirous of slaying the latter with a lance adorned with gold. The son of\r\nMadri, however, with three broad-headed arrows, simultaneously cut off,\r\nwithout losing a moment, that uplifted lance as also the two well-rounded\r\narms of his enemy at the van of battle, and then uttered a loud roar.\r\nEndued with great activity, the heroic Sahadeva then, with a broad-headed\r\narrow, made of hard iron, equipped with wings of gold, capable of\r\npenetrating every armour, and sped with great force and care, cut off\r\nfrom his trunk his enemy's head. Deprived of his head by the son of Pandu\r\nwith that gold-decked arrow of great sharpness and splendour like the\r\nsun's, Subala's son fell down on the earth in that battle. Indeed, the\r\nson of Pandu, filled with rage, struck off that head which was the root\r\nof the evil policy of the Kurus, with that impetuous shaft winged with\r\ngold and whetted on stone. Beholding Shakuni lying headless on the ground\r\nand all his limbs drenched with gore, thy warriors, rendered powerless\r\nwith fear, fled away on all sides with weapons in their hands. At that\r\ntime, thy sons, with cars, elephants, horse and foot entirely broken,\r\nheard the twang of Gandiva and fled away with colourless faces, afflicted\r\nwith fear and deprived of their senses. Having thrown down Shakuni from\r\nhis car, the Pandavas, O Bharata, became filled with delight. Rejoicing\r\nwith Keshava among them, they blew their conchs in that battle,\r\ngladdening their troops. All of them, with glad hearts, worshipped\r\nSahadeva, and said, \"By good luck, O hero, Shakuni of wicked soul, that\r\nman of evil course, hath, with his son, been slain by thee!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\n(Hrada-pravesa Parva)\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After this, the followers of Subala's son, O monarch,\r\nbecame filled with rage. Prepared to lay down their lives in that\r\ndreadful battle, they began to resist the Pandavas. Resolved to aid\r\nSahadeva in his victory, Arjuna, as also Bhimasena possessed of great\r\nenergy and resembling an angry snake of virulent poison in aspect,\r\nreceived those warriors. With his Gandiva, Dhananjaya baffled the purpose\r\nof those warriors, who, armed with darts and swords and lances, desired\r\nto slay Sahadeva. Vibhatsu, with his broad-headed arrows, cut off the\r\nsteeds, the heads, and the arms, with weapons in grasp of those rushing\r\ncombatants. The steeds of those foremost of heroes endued with activity,\r\nstruck by Savyasaci, fell down on the earth, deprived of their lives.\r\nKing Duryodhana, beholding that carnage of his own troops, O lord, became\r\nfilled with rage. Assembling together the remnant of his cars which still\r\nnumbered many hundreds, as also his elephants and horse and foot, O\r\nscorcher of foes, thy son said these words unto those warriors,\r\n\"Encountering all the Pandavas with their friends and allies, in this\r\nbattle, and the prince of Pancala also with his own troops, and slaying\r\nthem quickly, turn back from the fight!\" Respectfully accepting that\r\ncommand of his, those warriors, difficult of defeat in battle, proceeded\r\nonce more against the Parthas in that battle, at the behest of thy son.\r\nThe Pandavas, however, covered with their arrows resembling snakes of\r\nvirulent poison, all those warriors, forming the remnant of the Kaurava\r\narmy, that thus rushed quickly against them in that dreadful battle. That\r\narmy, O chief of the Bharatas, as it came to battle, was in a moment\r\nexterminated by those high-souled warriors, for it failed to obtain a\r\nprotector. In consequence of the (Kaurava) steeds running hither and\r\nthither that were all covered with the dust raised by the army, the\r\ncardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass could not be\r\ndistinguished. Many warriors, issuing out of the Pandava array, O\r\nBharata, slew thy troops in a moment in that battle. Eleven Akshauhinis,\r\nO Bharata, of troops had been assembled for thy son! All those, O lord,\r\nwere slain by the Pandus and the Srinjayas! Amongst those thousands upon\r\nthousands of high-souled kings on thy side, only Duryodhana now, O\r\nmonarch, exceedingly wounded, was seen to be alive, casting his eyes on\r\nall sides, and seeing the earth empty, himself destitute of all his\r\ntroops while the Pandavas, filled with joy in that battle, were roaring\r\naloud in consequence of the accomplishment of all their objects.\r\nDuryodhana, O monarch, unable to endure the whiz of the shafts shot by\r\nthose high-souled heroes, became stupefied! Destitute of troops and\r\nanimals, he set his heart on retreat from the field.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When my troops were slain and our camp made\r\nentirely empty, what was the strength, O Suta, of the troops that still\r\nremained to the Pandavas? I desire to know this. Therefore, tell me, O\r\nSanjaya, for thou art skilled (in narration). Tell me also, O Sanjaya,\r\nthat which was done by my son, the wicked Duryodhana, that lord of the\r\nearth, the sole survivor of so many men, when he saw his army\r\nexterminated.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, '2,000 cars, 700 elephants, 5,000 horse, and 10,000\r\nfoot, this was the remnant, O monarch, of the mighty host of the\r\nPandavas. Taking care of this force, Dhrishtadyumna waited in that\r\nbattle. Meanwhile, O chief of the Bharatas, king Duryodhana, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, saw not in that battle a single warrior on his\r\nside. Beholding his enemies roaring aloud and witnessing the\r\nextermination of his own army, that lord of the earth, Duryodhana,\r\nwithout a companion, abandoned his slain steed, and fled from the field\r\nwith face turned eastwards. That lord of eleven Akshauhinis, thy son\r\nDuryodhana, of great energy, taking up his mace, fled on foot towards a\r\nlake. Before he had proceeded far on foot, the king recalled the words of\r\nthe intelligent and virtuous Vidura. Without doubt, this had been\r\nforeseen by Vidura of great wisdom, this great carnage of Kshatriyas and\r\nof ourselves in battle. Reflecting on this, the king, with heart burning\r\nin grief at having witnessed the extermination of his army, desired to\r\npenetrate into the depths of that lake. The Pandavas, O monarch, with\r\nDhrishtadyumna at their head, filled with rage, rushed against (the small\r\nremnant of) thy army. With his Gandiva, Dhananjaya baffled the purpose of\r\nthe (Kaurava) troops, who, armed with darts and swords and lances, were\r\nuttering loud roars. Having with his sharp shafts slain those troops with\r\ntheir allies and kinsmen, Arjuna, as he stood on his car having white\r\nsteeds yoked unto it, looked exceedingly beautiful. Upon the fall of\r\nSubala's son along with horse, cars and elephants, thy army looked like a\r\nlarge forest laid low (by the wind). In Duryodhana's army then, O\r\nmonarch, which had numbered many hundred thousands of warriors, not\r\nanother great car-warrior was seen to be alive, save the heroic son of\r\nDrona, and Kritavarma, and Kripa the son of Gotama, O monarch, and that\r\nlord of the earth, thy son! Dhrishtadyumna, seeing me, laughingly\r\naddressed Satyaki, saying, 'What is the use of seizing this one? Nothing\r\nwill be gained by keeping him alive.' Hearing these words of\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the grandson of Sini, that great car-warrior, uplifting\r\nhis sharp sword, prepared to slay me. Just at that juncture, the\r\nIsland-born Krishna of great wisdom (Vyasa), coming there, said, \"Let\r\nSanjaya be dismissed alive! By no means should he be slain!\" Hearing\r\nthese words of the Island-born, the grandson of Sini, joined his hands,\r\nand then, setting me free said unto me, \"Peace to thee, O Sanjaya, thou\r\nmayest go hence!\" Permitted by him, I myself then, putting off my armour\r\nand making over my weapons, set out on the evening on the road leading to\r\nthe city, my limbs bathed in blood. After I had come about two miles, O\r\nmonarch, I beheld Duryodhana, standing alone, mace in hand, and\r\nexceedingly mangled. His eyes were full of tears and therefore he could\r\nnot see me. I stood cheerlessly before him. He looked accordingly at me\r\nwithout recognising me. Beholding him standing alone on the field and\r\nindulging in grief, I also, overwhelmed with sorrow, succeeded not for a\r\nlittle while to speak a single word. Then I said unto him everything\r\nabout my own capture and my release through the grace of the Island-born.\r\nHaving reflected for a moment, and regained his senses, he enquired of me\r\nabout his brothers and his troops. I had seen everything with my eyes and\r\ntherefore told him everything, that his brothers had all been slain and\r\nthat all his troops had been exterminated. I told the king that we had at\r\nthat time only three car-warriors left alive, for the Island-born had\r\nsaid so unto me when I set out (from the place where the Pandavas were).\r\nDrawing deep breaths and looking repeatedly at me, thy son touched me\r\nwith his hand and said, \"Except thee, O Sanjaya, there is none else that\r\nliveth, amongst those engaged in this battle! I do not see another (on my\r\nside), while the Pandavas have their allies living! Say, O Sanjaya, unto\r\nthat lord, the blind king Dhritarashtra, that his son Duryodhana hath\r\nentered the depths of a lake! Destitute of friends such as those (I\r\nlately had), deprived of sons and brothers, and seeing his kingdom taken\r\nby the Pandavas, who is there like me that would desire to live? Say all\r\nthis unto the king and tell him further that I have escaped with life\r\nfrom that dreadful battle, and that, alive, though exceedingly wounded, I\r\nshall rest within the depths of this lake.\" Having said these words unto\r\nme, O monarch, the king entered that lake. That ruler of men, by his\r\npower of illusion, then charmed the waters of that lake, making a space\r\nfor him within them. After he had entered that lake, I myself, without\r\nanybody on my side, saw those three car-warriors (of our army) coming\r\ntogether to that spot with their tired animals. They were Kripa, the son\r\nof Saradwat, and the heroic Ashvatthama, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nand Kritavarma of Bhoja's race. Mangled with shafts, all of them came\r\ntogether to that spot. Beholding me, they all urged their steeds to\r\ngreater speed and coming up to me, said, \"By good luck, O Sanjaya, thou\r\nlivest yet!\" All of them then enquired after thy son, that ruler of men,\r\nsaying, 'Is our king Duryodhana still alive, O Sanjaya?' I then told them\r\nthat the king was well in body. I also told them everything that\r\nDuryodhana had said unto me. I also pointed out to them the lake that the\r\nking had entered. Then Ashvatthama, O king, having heard those words from\r\nme, cast his eyes on that extensive lake and began to wail in grief,\r\nsaying, \"Alas, alas, the king knows not that we are still alive! With him\r\namongst us, we are still quite able to fight with our foes!\" Those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, having wept there for a long time, fled away at sight of\r\nthe sons of Pandu. Those three car-warriors that formed the remnant of\r\nour army took me up on the well-adorned car of Kripa, and then proceeded\r\nto the Kuru camp. The sun had set a little before. The troops forming the\r\noutposts of the camp, learning that all thy sons had been slain, wept\r\naloud. Then, O monarch, the old men that had been appointed to look after\r\nthe ladies of the royal household proceeded towards the city, taking the\r\nprincesses after them. Loud were the wails uttered by those weeping\r\nladies when they heard of the destruction of the whole army. The women, O\r\nking, crying ceaselessly, caused the earth to resound with their voices\r\nlike a flight of she-ospreys. They tore their bodies with nails and\r\nstruck their heads with their hands, and untied their braids, indulging\r\nall the while in loud cries. Filling the air with sounds such as \"Oh!\"\r\nand \"Alas!\" and beating their breasts, they cried aloud and wept and\r\nuttered loud shrieks, O monarch! Then the friends of Duryodhana, deeply\r\nafflicted and made voiceless by their tears, set out for the city, taking\r\nthe ladies of the royal household with them. The camp-guards quickly fled\r\ntowards the city, taking with them many white beds overlaid with costly\r\ncoverlets. Others, placing their wives on cars drawn by mules, proceeded\r\ntowards the city. Those ladies, O monarch, who, while in their houses\r\ncould not be seen by the very sun, were now, as they proceeded towards\r\nthe city, exposed to the gaze of the common people. Those women, O chief\r\nof the Bharata's race, who were very delicate, now proceeded with speed\r\ntowards the city, having lost their near ones and kinsmen. The very\r\ncow-herds and shepherds and common men, filled with panic and afflicted\r\nwith the fear of Bhimasena, fled towards the city. Even these were filled\r\nwith a great fear of the Parthas. Looking at one another, all of them\r\nfled towards the city. During the progress of that general flight\r\nattended with such circumstances of fear, Yuyutsu, deprived of his senses\r\nby grief, thought upon what he should do in view of the emergency that\r\nhad come. \"Duryodhana hath been vanquished in battle by the Pandavas of\r\nterrible prowess! He had eleven Akshauhinis of troops under him! All his\r\nbrothers have been slain! All the Kauravas, headed by Bhishma and Drona,\r\nhave perished! Through the influence of Destiny, only I have been saved!\r\nAll those that were in the Kuru camp have fled! Alas, they are flying on\r\nall sides, deprived of energy and destitute of protectors! Such a sight\r\nhad never been seen before! Afflicted with sorrow, with eyes anxious in\r\nfear, they are flying away on all sides like a herd of deer, looking at\r\none another! Those amongst the counsellors of Duryodhana that are yet\r\nalive have fled towards the city, taking with them the ladies of the\r\nroyal household! I think, O lord, that the time hath come when I also\r\nshould enter the city with them, after taking the permission of\r\nYudhishthira and Vasudeva!\" For this purpose that mighty-armed prince\r\npresented himself before both those heroes. King Yudhishthira, who is\r\nalways compassionate, became highly pleased with him. The mighty-armed\r\nPandava embraced that child of a Vaisya mother and dismissed him\r\naffectionately. Riding upon his own car, he urged his steeds to great\r\nspeed. He then supervised the removal of the ladies of the royal\r\nhousehold to the city. The sun was setting. With those ladies, Yuyutsu\r\nentered the city of Hastinapura, with tearful eyes and with voice choked\r\nin grief. He then saw Vidura of great wisdom, sitting with tearful eyes.\r\nHe had come away from Dhritarashtra, his heart having been afflicted with\r\ngreat sorrow. Bowing down unto Vidura, he stood before him. Devoted to\r\ntruth, Vidura addressed him, saying, \"By good luck, O son, thou livest\r\namid this general destruction of the Kurus! Why, however, hast thou come\r\nwithout king Duryodhana in thy company? Tell me in detail the cause of\r\nthis!\" Yuyutsu then said, \"After the fall of Shakuni, O sire, with all\r\nhis kinsmen and friends, king Duryodhana abandoning the steed he rode,\r\nfled away, in fear towards the east. After the king had fled away, all\r\nthe people in the (Kaurava) encampment, agitated with fear, fled towards\r\nthe city. Then the protectors of the ladies, placing the wives of the\r\nking, as also those of his brothers, on vehicles, fled away in fear.\r\nObtaining the permission of king Yudhishthira and Keshava, I set out for\r\nHastinapura, for protecting the people thus flying away!' Hearing these\r\nwords spoken by the son of Dhritarashtra's Vaisya wife, Vidura of\r\nimmeasurable soul, conversant with every usage and feeling that was\r\nproper at that hour, applauded the eloquent Yuyutsu. And he said, 'Thou\r\nhast acted properly, having regard for what has come, in view of this\r\ndestruction of all the Bharatas of which thou art speaking! Thou hast\r\nalso, from compassion, maintained the honour of thy race! By good luck,\r\nwe behold thee come back with life from this terrible battle that is so\r\ndestructive of heroes, like creatures beholding the sun possessed of\r\nblazing glory! Thou, O son, are now in every way the sole staff of the\r\nblind monarch, bereft of foresight, afflicted with calamity, struck by\r\nDestiny, and who, though repeatedly dissuaded, could not abstain from\r\npursuing his evil policy. Take rest here for this day! Tomorrow thou\r\nmayst return to Yudhishthira!\" Having said these words, Vidura, with\r\ntearful eyes, took leave of Yuyutsu and entered the abode of the king,\r\nwhich resounded with cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Alas!\" uttered by citizens and\r\nvillagers afflicted with woe. The cheerless mansion seemed to have lost\r\nall its beauty; comfort and happiness seemed to have deserted it. It was\r\nall empty and pervaded by disorder. Already filled with sorrow, Vidura's\r\ngrief increased at that sight. Conversant with every duty, Vidura, with a\r\nsorrowful heart, entered the palace, drawing deep breaths. As regards\r\nYuyutsu, he passed that night in his own abode. Afflicted with woe, he\r\nfailed to obtain any joy at the panegyrics with which he was greeted. He\r\npassed the time, thinking of the terrible destruction of the Bharatas at\r\none another's hands.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After all the Kaurava troops had been slain by the\r\nsons of Pandu on the field of battle, what did those survivors of my\r\narmy, Kritavarma and Kripa and the valiant son of Drona do? What also did\r\nthe wicked-souled king Duryodhana then do?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After the flight of the ladies of those high-souled\r\nKshatriyas, and after the (Kaurava) camp had become entirely empty, the\r\nthree car-warriors (thou hast mentioned) became filled with anxiety.\r\nHearing the shouts of the victorious sons of Pandu, and beholding the\r\ncamp deserted towards the evening, those three warriors of our side,\r\ndesirous of rescuing the king, and unable to stay on the field, proceeded\r\ntowards the lake. Yudhishthira, of virtuous soul, with his brothers in\r\nthat battle, felt great joy and wandered over the field from desire of\r\nstaying Duryodhana. Filled with wrath, the Pandavas, desirous of victory,\r\nsearched for thy son. Though, however, they looked very carefully for\r\nhim, they failed to discover the (Kuru) king. Mace in hand, he had fled\r\nwith great speed from the field of battle and penetrated into that lake,\r\nhaving by the aid of his powers of illusion, solidified its waters. When\r\nat last the animals of the Pandavas became very much tired, the latter\r\nproceeded to their camp and rested there with their soldiers. After the\r\nParthas had retired to their camp, Kripa and Drona's son and Kritavarma\r\nof the Satwata race, slowly proceeded towards that lake. Approaching the\r\nlake within which lay the king, they addressed that invincible ruler of\r\nmen asleep within the water, saying, \"Arise, O king, and fight with us\r\nagainst Yudhishthira! Either obtaining victory enjoy the earth, or,\r\nslain, proceed to heaven! The forces of the Pandavas also, O Duryodhana,\r\nhave all been slain by thee! Those amongst them that are yet alive have\r\nbeen exceedingly mangled! They will not be able, O monarch, to bear thy\r\nimpetuosity, especially when thou shalt be protected by us! Arise,\r\ntherefore, O Bharata!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"By good luck, I see you, ye bulls among men, come\r\nback with life from this destructive battle between the Pandavas and the\r\nKauravas! After we have rested a while and dispelled our fatigue, we\r\nshall encounter the enemy and conquer him! Ye also are tired and I myself\r\nam exceedingly mangled! The army of the Pandavas is swelling with might!\r\nFor these reasons, I do not like to fight now! These exhortations on your\r\npart, ye heroes, are not at all wonderful, for your hearts are noble!\r\nYour devotion also to me is great! This, however, is not the time for\r\nprowess! Resting for this one night, I shall, on the morrow, join you and\r\nfight with the foe! In this there is no doubt!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Drona replied unto the\r\nking, who was invincible in battle, saying, \"Arise, O king, blessed be\r\nthou, we shall yet vanquish the foe! I swear by all my religious acts, by\r\nall the gifts I have made, by truth itself, and my silent meditations, O\r\nking, that I shall today slay the Somakas! Let me not obtain the delight\r\nresulting from the performance of sacrifices, that delight which is felt\r\nby all pious men, if this night passes away without my slaying the\r\nPandavas in battle! Without slaying all the Pancalas, I will not, O lord,\r\nput off my armour! I tell thee this truly. Believe me, O ruler of men!\"\r\nWhile they were thus conversing, a number of hunters came there. Fatigued\r\nwith the weight of meat they carried, they came there, not of any set\r\npurpose, for slaking their thirst. Those huntsmen, O lord, used every\r\nday, to procure, with great regard, a basketful of meat for Bhimasena, O\r\nking! As they sat concealed on the banks of that lake, those men heard\r\nevery word of that conversation between Duryodhana and those warriors.\r\nFinding the Kuru king unwilling to fight, those great bowmen, themselves\r\ndesirous of battle, began to urge him greatly to adopt their counsels.\r\nSeeing those car-warriors of the Kaurava army, and understanding that the\r\nking, unwilling to fight, was staying within the waters, and hearing that\r\nconversation between those heroes and their master staying within the\r\ndepths of the lake, indeed, O monarch, the huntsmen, clearly perceiving\r\nthat it was Duryodhana who was staying within the lake, formed a\r\nresolution. A little while before, the son of Pandu, while searching for\r\nthe king, had met those men and asked them about the whereabouts of\r\nDuryodhana. Recollecting the words that the son of Pandu had said, those\r\nhunters, O king, whisperingly said unto one another, \"We will discover\r\nDuryodhana (unto the Pandavas). The son of Pandu will then give us\r\nwealth! It is evident to us that the celebrated king Duryodhana is here!\r\nLet us then, all of us, proceed to the spot where king Yudhishthira is,\r\nfor telling him that the vindictive Duryodhana is concealed within the\r\nwaters of this lake! Let us also, all of us, inform that great bowman,\r\nthe intelligent Bhimasena, that the son of Dhritarashtra is concealed\r\nhere within the waters of this lake! Gratified with us, he will give us\r\nmuch wealth! What need of fatiguing ourselves, day after day, with\r\nprocuring meat and weakening ourselves with such toil?\" Having said these\r\nwords, those huntsmen, filled with joy and longing for wealth, took up\r\ntheir baskets of meat and proceeded towards the (Pandava) camp. Possessed\r\nof sure aim and skilled in smiting, the Pandavas, O monarch, not seeing\r\nin battle Duryodhana, who was then concealed, (were resting in their\r\ncamp). Desirous of reaching the end of that sinful wight's evil policy,\r\nthey had despatched spies in all directions on the field of battle. All\r\nthe soldiers, however, that had been despatched on that mission returned\r\nto the camp together and informed king Yudhishthira the just that no\r\ntrace could be found of king Duryodhana. Hearing these words of the\r\nreturned messengers, O bull of Bharata's race, king Yudhishthira became\r\nfilled with great anxiety and began to breathe heavily. While the\r\nPandavas, O bull of Bharata's race, were staying in such cheerlessness,\r\nthose huntsmen, O lord, having come with great speed from the banks of\r\nthat lake, arrived at the camp, filled with joy at having discovered\r\nDuryodhana. Though forbidden, they still entered the camp, in the very\r\nsight of Bhimasena. Having approached that mighty son of Pandu,\r\nBhimasena, they represented everything unto him about what they had seen\r\nand heard. Then Vrikodara, that scorcher of foes, O king, giving them\r\nmuch wealth, represented everything unto king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nsaying, \"Duryodhana, O king, hath been discovered by the huntsmen that\r\nsupply me with meat! He, O king, for whom thou grievest now lies within a\r\nlake whose waters have been solidified by him!' Hearing these agreeable\r\nwords of Bhimasena, O monarch, Kunti's son, Ajatasatru, became, with all\r\nhis brothers, filled with joy. Having learnt that the mighty bowman\r\nDuryodhana had penetrated into the waters of a lake, the king proceeded\r\nthither with great speed, with Janardana at his head. Then a tumultuous\r\nnoise arose, O monarch, from among the Pandavas and the Pancalas all of\r\nwhom were filled with joy. The warriors uttered leonine roars, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, and shouted loudly. All the Kshatriyas, O king, proceeded\r\nwith great speed towards that lake called Dvaipayana. The rejoicing\r\nSomakas all around loudly and repeatedly exclaimed, \"The sinful son of\r\nDhritarashtra has been found!\" The noise made by the cars of those\r\nimpetuous warriors who proceeded with great speed, became very loud, O\r\nmonarch, and touched the heavens. Although their animals were tired, all\r\nof them still proceeded with speed behind king Yudhishthira who was bent\r\nupon finding out Duryodhana. Arjuna, and Bhimasena, and the two sons of\r\nMadri by Pandu, and the Pancala prince Dhrishtadyumna, and the\r\nunvanquished Shikhandi, and Uttamaujas, and Yudhamanyu, and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and those amongst\r\nthe Pancalas, O king, that were yet alive, and all the Pandavas, and all\r\ntheir elephants, and foot-soldiers by hundreds upon hundreds, all\r\nproceeded with Yudhishthira. Possessed of great valour, king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, O monarch, arrived at the lake known by the name of Dvaipayana\r\nwithin which Duryodhana then was. Wide as the ocean itself, its aspect\r\nwas agreeable and its waters were cool and transparent. Solidifying the\r\nwaters by means of his power of illusion, by, indeed, a wonderful method,\r\nthy son Duryodhana, O Bharata, happened to be within that lake. Indeed,\r\nwithin those waters lay, O lord, that king, armed with his mace, who, O\r\nruler of men, could not be vanquished by any man! Staying within the\r\nwaters of that lake, king Duryodhana heard that tumultuous noise (of the\r\nPandava army) which resembled the very roar of the clouds. Yudhishthira\r\nthen, O king, with his brothers repaired to that lake from desire of\r\nslaying Duryodhana. Raising a thick dust, the son of Pandu caused the\r\nearth to tremble with the sound of his car-wheels and the loud blare of\r\nhis conch. Hearing the noise made by the army of Yudhishthira, those\r\ngreat car-warriors, Kritavarma and Kripa and the son of Drona, said these\r\nwords unto the Kuru king, \"Filled with joy and longing for victory, the\r\nPandavas are coming hither! We will, therefore, leave this place. Let it\r\nbe known to thee!\" Hearing those words of these heroes endued with great\r\nactivity, he answered them, saying, \"So be it,\" and remained (as before)\r\nwithin the waters, having, O lord, solidified them by his powers of\r\nillusion. Those car-warriors headed by Kripa, filled with grief, took\r\nleave of the king, O monarch, and went away to a place far removed from\r\nthat spot. Having proceeded far, they beheld a banyan, O sire, under\r\nwhose shade they stopped, greatly tired, and exceedingly anxious about\r\nthe king and indulging in such thoughts as these, \"The mighty son of\r\nDhritarashtra, having solidified the waters of the lake, lay stretched at\r\nthe bottom. The Pandavas have reached that spot, from desire of battle.\r\nHow will the battle take place? What will become of the king?' Thinking\r\nof these things, O king, those heroes, Kripa and the others, liberated\r\ntheir horses from their cars and prepared to rest there for some time.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After those three car-warriors had left that spot, the\r\nPandavas arrived at that lake within which Duryodhana was resting\r\nhimself. Having reached the banks of the Dvaipayana lake, O chief of\r\nKuru's race, they beheld that receptacle of waters enchanted by thy son.\r\nThen Yudhishthira, addressing Vasudeva, said, \"Behold, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra hath applied his power of illusion to these waters! Having\r\nenchanted the waters, he lieth within them. He can have now no fear (of\r\ninjury) from man! Having invoked a celestial illusion, he is now within\r\nthe waters! By an act of deception, that wight conversant with every\r\ndeception hath sought this refuge! He shall not, however, escape me with\r\nlife! Even if the wielder of the thunderbolt himself aid him in battle,\r\npeople, O Madhava, shall yet behold him slain today!'\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"With thy own powers of illusion, O Bharata, destroy\r\nthis illusion of Duryodhana who is an adept in it! One conversant with\r\nillusion should be slain with illusion! This is the truth, O\r\nYudhishthira! With acts and means and applying thy power of illusion to\r\nthese waters, slay, O chief of the Bharatas, this Suyodhana, who is the\r\nvery soul of illusion! With acts and means Indra himself slew the Daityas\r\nand the Danavas! Vali himself was bound by that high-souled one\r\n(Upendra), with the aid of many acts and means! The great Asura\r\nHiranyaksha, as also that other one, Hiranyakasipu, was slain by the aid\r\nof many acts and means. Without doubt, O king, Vritra also was slain by\r\nthe aid of acts! Similarly was the Rakshasa Ravana of Pulastya's race,\r\nwith his relatives and followers, slain by Rama! Relying upon acts and\r\ncontrivances, do thou also display thy powers! Those two ancient Daityas,\r\nTaraka and Viprachitti of great energy, were in ancient times, O king,\r\nslain by the aid of acts and means! Similarly, Vatapi and Ilwala, and\r\nTrisiras, O lord, and the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, were all slain by\r\nthe aid of means! Indra himself enjoys heaven by the aid of acts and\r\nmeans! Acts are very efficacious, O king, and nothing else so, O\r\nYudhishthira! Daityas and Danavas and Rakshasas and kings had been slain\r\nby the aid of acts and means. Do thou take therefore, the help of act!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Vasudeva, Pandu's son of rigid\r\nvows, smiling the while, addressed, O monarch, thy son of great might,\r\nwho, O Bharata, was then within the waters of that lake, saying, \"Why, O\r\nSuyodhana, hast thou entered these waters, after having caused all the\r\nKshatriyas to perish and after having, O king, caused thy own race to be\r\nannihilated? Why hast thou entered into this lake today, wishing to save\r\nthy own life? Arise, O king, and fight us, O Suyodhana! Where, O foremost\r\nof men, hath that pride and that sense of honour which thou hadst now\r\ngone, since, O king, thou hast enchanted these waters and art now lying\r\nwithin them? All men speak of thee in assemblies as a hero. All that,\r\nhowever, is entirely untrue, I think, since thou art now concealed within\r\nthese waters! Arise, O king, and fight, for thou art a Kshatriya born of\r\na noble race! Thou art Kauraveya in particular! Remember thy birth! How\r\ncanst thou boast of thy birth in Kuru's race when thou concealest thyself\r\nwithin the depths of this lake, having fled away from battle in fear?\r\nThis is not the eternal duty of a Kshatriya, staying away from battle!\r\nFlight from battle, O king, is not the practice of those that are\r\nhonourable, nor does it lead to heaven! How is it that without having\r\nattained to the end of this war, inspired though thou wert with the\r\ndesire of victory, thou stayest now within this lake, after having caused\r\nand witnessed the slaughter of thy sons and brothers and sires and\r\nrelatives and friends and maternal uncles and kinsmen? Ever boastful of\r\nthy courage, thou art, however, not a hero! Falsely dost thou describe\r\nthyself, O Bharata, when thou sayst in the hearing of all men that thou\r\nart a hero, O thou of wicked understanding! They that are heroes never\r\nfly away at sight of foes! Or, tell us, O hero, about (the nature of)\r\nthat courage in consequence of which thou hast fled from battle! Arise, O\r\nprince, and fight, casting off thy fears! Having caused all thy troops\r\nand thy brothers to be slain, O Suyodhana, thou shouldst not, if thou art\r\ninspired with righteous motives, think now of saving thy life! One like\r\nthee, O Suyodhana, that has adopted Kshatriya duties, should not act in\r\nthis way! Relying upon Karna, as also upon Shakuni the son of Subala,\r\nthou hadst regarded thyself immortal and hadst, from folly, failed to\r\nunderstand thy own self! Having perpetrated such grievous sin, fight now,\r\nO Bharata! How dost that flight from battle recommend itself to one like\r\nthee? Surely, thou forgettest thyself! Where is that manliness of thine,\r\nO sire, and where, O Suyodhana, is that pride cherished by thee! Where\r\nhath that prowess of thine now gone, and where also that swelling and\r\ngreat energy which thou hadst? Where is that accomplishment of thine in\r\nweapons? Why dost thou lie within this lake now? Arise, O Bharata, and\r\nfight, observing the duties of a Kshatriya! Either rule the wide earth\r\nafter vanquishing us, or sleep, O Bharata, on the bare ground, slain by\r\nus! Even this is thy highest duty, as laid down by the illustrious\r\nCreator himself! Act as it has been laid down truly in the scriptures,\r\nand be a king, O great car-warrior!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, O monarch, by the intelligent son of\r\nDharma, thy son answered him from within the waters in these words.\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"It is not at all a matter of surprise, O king, that\r\nfear should enter the hearts of living creatures. As regards myself,\r\nhowever, O Bharata, I have not fled from the field of battle actuated by\r\nthe fear of life! My car was destroyed, my quivers were gone, and my\r\nParshni drivers were killed! I was alone, without a single follower to\r\nstand by me in battle! It was for this that I desired a little rest! It\r\nwas not for the sake of saving my life, it was not from fear, it was not\r\nfrom grief, O king, that I entered these waters! It was only in\r\nconsequence of fatigue that I did so! Do thou, O son of Kunti, rest a\r\nwhile with those that follow thee! Rising from this lake I will certainly\r\nfight all of you in battle!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, 'All of us have rested sufficiently. For a long\r\nwhile we were engaged in a search after thee! Rise then, even now, O\r\nSuyodhana, and give us battle! Either slaying the Parthas in battle make\r\nthis kingdom that swelleth with prosperity thy own, or slain by us in\r\nbattle, proceed to those regions that are reserved for heroes!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"They amongst the Kurus, O son of Kurus' race, for\r\nwhose sake I desired sovereignty, that is, those brothers of mine, O\r\nking, all lie dead on the field! I do not, again, like to enjoy any\r\nlonger the earth that is now shorn of wealth and reft of superior\r\nKshatriyas, and that hath, therefore, become like a widowed lady! I,\r\nhowever, still hope to vanquish thee, O Yudhishthira, after curbing the\r\npride, O bull of Bharata's race, of the Pancalas and the Pandus! There\r\nis, however, no longer any need for battle when Drona and Karna have been\r\nquieted and when our grandsire Bhishma hath been slain! This shorn earth,\r\nO king, now exists for thee! What king is there that would like to rule a\r\nkingdom divested of friends and allies? Having caused friends such as I\r\nhad to be slain and even sons and brothers and sires, and seeing my\r\nkingdom wrested by you, who is there like myself that would like to live?\r\nClad in deer-skins I would retire into the woods! I have no desire for\r\nkingdom, deprived as I am of friends and allies, O Bharata! Reft almost\r\nentirely of friends and allies, of heroes and elephants, this earth\r\nexists for thee, O king! Do thou enjoy her now cheerfully! As for myself,\r\nclad in deerskins, I shall go to the woods! Friendless as I am, I have no\r\ndesire, O lord, for even life! Go, O monarch, and rule the earth\r\ndestitute of lords, without warriors, reft of wealth, and without\r\ncitadels, as thou choosest!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of poignant grief the\r\nillustrious Yudhishthira addressed thy son Duryodhana who was still\r\nwithin those waters, saying, \"Do not utter such ravings of sorrow, O\r\nsire, from within the waters! I do not, like Shakuni, feel any compassion\r\nfor thee, O king, for such words as these! Thou mayest now, O Suyodhana,\r\nbe willing to make a gift of the earth to me. I, however, do not wish to\r\nrule the earth thus given by thee! I cannot sinfully accept this earth\r\nfrom thee! Acceptance of a gift, O king, is not the duty laid down for a\r\nKshatriya! I do not, therefore, wish to have the wide earth thus given\r\naway by thee! I shall, on the other hand, enjoy the earth after\r\nvanquishing thee in battle! Thou art now the lord of the earth! Why then\r\ndost thou desire to make a gift of that over which thou hast no dominion?\r\nWhy, O king, didst thou not then give us the earth when we, observant of\r\nthe rules of righteousness and desirous of the welfare of our race, had\r\nbegged thee for our portion? Having first refused the request of the\r\nmighty Krishna, why dost thou now desire to give away the earth? What is\r\nthis folly of thine? What king is there, who, assailed by foes, would\r\nwish to give away his kingdom? O son of Kuru's race, today thou art not\r\ncompetent to give away the earth! Why then dost thou wish to make a gift\r\nof that over which thou hast no power? Vanquishing me in battle, rule\r\nthou this earth! Thou didst not formerly agree to give me even that much\r\nof the earth which would be covered by the point of a needle! How then, O\r\nmonarch, dost thou make me a gift of the whole earth? How is it that\r\nthou, who couldst not formerly abandon even that much of land which the\r\npoint of a needle would cover, now wishest to abandon the whole earth?\r\nWhat fool is there that would, after having obtained such prosperity and\r\nruled the entire earth, think of making a gift of that earth to his\r\nenemies? Stupefied by folly, thou seest not the impropriety of this!\r\nAlthough thou desirest to give away the earth, thou shalt not yet escape\r\nme with life! Either rule the earth after having vanquished us, or go to\r\nregions of blessedness after being slain by us! If both of us, that is,\r\nthyself and myself, be alive, then all creatures will remain in doubt\r\nabout to whom the victory belongs. Thy life, O thou of limited foresight,\r\nnow depends upon me! If I like, I can suffer thee to live, but thou art\r\nnot capable of protecting thy own life! Thou hadst at one time especially\r\nendeavoured to burn us to death and to take our lives by means of snakes\r\nand other kinds of poison and by drowning us! We were also wronged by\r\nthee, O king, by the deprivation of our kingdom, by the cruel words\r\nspoken by thee, and by thy maltreatment of Draupadi! For these reasons, O\r\nwretch, thy life must be taken! Rise, rise, and fight us! That will\r\nbenefit thee!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'In this strain, O king, those heroes, the Pandavas,\r\nflushed with victory, repeatedly spoke there (rebuking and mocking\r\nDuryodhana).'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\n(Gada-yuddha Parva)\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thus admonished (by his foes), how, indeed, did\r\nthat scorcher of enemies, my heroic and royal son, who was wrathful by\r\nnature, then behave? He had never before listened to admonitions such as\r\nthese! He had, again, been treated by all with the respect due to a king!\r\nHe, who had formerly grieved to stand in the shade of an umbrella,\r\nthinking he had taken another's shelter, he, who could not endure the\r\nvery effulgence of the sun in consequence of his sensitive pride, how\r\ncould he endure these words of his foes? Thou hast, with thy own eyes, O\r\nSanjaya, seen the whole earth, with even her Mlecchas and nomad tribes,\r\ndepend upon his grace! Rebuked thus at that spot by the sons of Pandu in\r\nparticular, while lying concealed in such a solitary place after having\r\nbeen deprived of his followers and attendants, alas, what answer did he\r\nmake unto the Pandavas upon hearing such bitter and repeated taunts from\r\nhis victorious enemies? Tell me everything, O Sanjaya, about it!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus rebuked, O monarch, by Yudhishthira and his\r\nbrothers, thy royal son, lying within those waters, O king of kings,\r\nheard those bitter words and became very miserable. Breathing hot and\r\nlong sighs repeatedly, the king waved his arms again and again, and\r\nsetting his heart on battle, thus answered, from within the waters, the\r\nroyal son of Pandu.\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"Ye Parthas, all of you are possessed of friends, of\r\ncars, and of animals! I, however, am alone, cheerless, without a car, and\r\nwithout an animal! Being alone and destitute of weapons, how can I\r\nventure to fight on foot, against numerous foes all well-armed and\r\npossessed of cars? Do you, however, O Yudhishthira, fight me one at a\r\ntime! It is not proper that one should in battle fight many endued with\r\ncourage, especially when that one is without armour, fatigued, afflicted\r\nwith calamity, exceedingly mangled in his limbs, and destitute of both\r\nanimals and troops! I do not entertain the least fear, O monarch, of\r\neither thee, or Vrikodara, the son of Pritha, or Phalguna, or Vasudeva,\r\nor all the Pancalas, or the twins, or Yuyudhana, or all the other troops\r\nthou hast! Standing in battle, alone as I am, I shall resist all of you!\r\nThe fame, O king, of all righteous men hath righteousness for its basis!\r\nI say all this to you, observant of both righteousness and fame! Rising\r\n(from this lake), I shall fight all of you in battle! Like the year that\r\ngradually meets all the seasons, I shall meet all of you in fight! Wait,\r\nye Pandavas! Like the sun destroying by his energy the light of all stars\r\nat dawn, I shall today, though weaponless and carless, destroy all of you\r\npossessed of cars and steeds! Today I shall free myself from the debt I\r\nowe to the many illustrious Kshatriyas (that have fallen for me), to\r\nBahlika and Drona and Bhishma and the high-souled Karna, to the heroic\r\nJayadratha and Bhagadatta, to Shalya the ruler of the Madras and\r\nBhurishrava, to my sons, O chief of Bharata's race, and Shakuni the son\r\nof Subala, to all my friends and well-wishers and kinsmen! Today I shall\r\nfree myself from that debt by slaying thee with thy brothers!\" With these\r\nwords, the (Kuru) king ceased speaking.\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"By good luck, O Suyodhana, thou knowest the duties\r\nof a Kshatriya! By good luck, O thou of mighty arms, thy heart inclineth\r\nto battle! By good luck, thou art a hero, O thou of Kuru's race, and, by\r\ngood luck, thou art conversant with battle, since, single-handed, thou\r\nwishest to meet all of us in battle! Fight any one of us, taking whatever\r\nweapon thou likest! All of us will stand as spectators here! I grant thee\r\nalso, O hero, this (other) wish of thy heart, that if thou slayest any of\r\nus, thou shalt then become king! Otherwise, slain by us, go to heaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"A brave man as thou art, if thou grantest me the\r\noption of fighting only one of you, this mace that I hold in my hand is\r\nthe weapon that I select! Let any one amongst you who thinks that he will\r\nbe my match come forward and fight with me on foot, armed with mace! Many\r\nwonderful single combats have occurred on cars! Let this one great and\r\nwonderful combat with the mace happen today! Men (while fighting) desire\r\nto change weapons. Let the manner of the fight be changed today, with thy\r\npermission! O thou of mighty arms, I shall, with my mace, vanquish thee\r\ntoday with all thy younger brothers, as also all the Pancalas and the\r\nSrinjayas and all the other troops thou still hast! I do not cherish the\r\nleast fear, O Yudhishthira, of even Shakra himself!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"Rise, rise, O son of Gandhari, and fight me,\r\nSuyodhana! Alone as thou art, fight us, encountering one at a time, thou\r\nof great might, armed with thy mace! Be a man, O son of Gandhari, and\r\nfight with good care! Today thou shalt have to lay down thy life even if\r\nIndra becomes thy ally!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'That tiger among men, thy son, could not bear these\r\nwords of Yudhishthira. He breathed long and heavy sighs from within the\r\nwater like a mighty snake from within its hole. Struck repeatedly with\r\nsuch wordy goads, he could not endure it at all, like a horse of high\r\nbreed that cannot endure the whip. Agitating the waters with great force,\r\nthat valiant warrior rose like a prince of elephants from within the\r\nlake, breathing heavily in rage, and armed with his heavy mace that was\r\nendued with the strength of adamant and decked with gold. Piercing the\r\nsolidified waters, thy son rose, shouldering his mace of iron, like the\r\nsun himself scorching everything with his rays. Endued with great\r\nstrength, thy son, possessed of great intelligence, began to handle his\r\nheavy mace made of iron and equipped with a sling. Beholding him armed\r\nwith mace and resembling a crested mountain or the trident-wielding Rudra\r\nhimself casting angry glances on living creatures, they observed that\r\nBharata chief shedding an effulgence around like the scorching sun\r\nhimself in the sky. Indeed, all creatures then regarded that mighty-armed\r\nchastiser of foes, as he stood shouldering his mace after rising from the\r\nwaters, looking like the Destroyer himself armed with his bludgeon.\r\nIndeed, all the Pancalas then saw thy royal son to look like the\r\nthunder-wielding Shakra or the trident-bearing Hara. Seeing him, however,\r\nrise from within the waters, all the Pancalas and the Pandavas began to\r\nrejoice and seize each other's hands. Thy son Duryodhana regarded that\r\naction of the spectators to be an insult directed towards him. Rolling\r\nhis eyes in wrath, and as if burning the Pandavas with his glances, and\r\ncontracting his brow into three furrows, and repeatedly biting his nether\r\nlip, he addressed the Pandavas with Keshava in their midst, saying, \"You\r\nPandavas, you shall have to bear the fruit of these taunts! Slain by me\r\ntoday, you shall, with the Pancalas, have to repair to the abode of\r\nYama!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Rising from the water, thy son Duryodhana stood\r\nthere, armed with mace, and with limbs bathed in blood. Covered with\r\nblood and drenched with water, his body then looked like a mountain\r\nshedding water from within. As he stood armed with mace, the Pandavas\r\nregarded him to be the angry son of Surya himself armed with the bludgeon\r\ncalled Kinkara. With voice deep as that of the clouds or of a bull\r\nroaring in joy, Duryodhana then, of great prowess, armed with his mace,\r\nsummoned the Parthas to battle.'\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"You will have, O Yudhishthira, to encounter me one at\r\na time! It is not proper, that one hero should fight with many at the\r\nsame time, especially when that single warrior is divested of armour,\r\nfatigued with exertion, covered with water, exceedingly mangled in limbs,\r\nand without cars, animals and troops! Let the gods in heaven behold me\r\nfight single-handed destitute of all equipment and deprived of even\r\narmour and weapons! I shall certainly fight all of you! Thou shalt be\r\njudge, as thou hast the necessary qualifications, of the propriety and\r\nimpropriety of everything!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"How is it, O Duryodhana, that thou hadst not this\r\nknowledge when many great car-warriors, uniting together, slew Abhimanyu\r\nin battle? Kshatriya duties are exceedingly cruel, unmindful of all\r\nconsiderations, and without the least compassion! Otherwise, how could\r\nyou slay Abhimanyu under those circumstances? All of you were acquainted\r\nwith righteousness! All of you were heroes! All of you were prepared to\r\nlay down your lives in battle! The high end declared for those that fight\r\nrighteously is the attainment of the regions of Shakra! If this be your\r\nduty, that one should never be slain by many, why is it then that\r\nAbhimanyu was slain by many, acting in accord with thy counsels? All\r\ncreatures, when in difficulty forget considerations of virtue. They then\r\nview the gates of the other world to be closed. Put on armour, O hero,\r\nand bind thy locks! Take everything else, O Bharata, of which thou\r\nstandest in need! This another wish of thine, O hero, I grant thee in\r\naddition, that if thou canst slay him amongst the five Pandavas with whom\r\nthou wishest an encounter, thou shalt then be king! Otherwise, slain (by\r\nhim), thou shalt proceed to heaven! Except thy life, O hero, tell us what\r\nboon we may grant thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then thy son, O king, cased his body with armour\r\nmade of gold, and put on a beautiful head-gear adorned with pure gold.\r\nClad in bright armour of gold, he put on that head-gear. Indeed, O king,\r\nthy son then looked resplendent like a golden cliff. Clad in mail, armed\r\nwith mace, and accoutred with other equipments, thy son Duryodhana then,\r\nO king, standing on the field of battle, addressed all the Pandavas,\r\nsaying, 'Amongst you (five) brothers, let any one fight me, armed with\r\nmace! As regards myself, I am willing to fight either Sahadeva, or Bhima,\r\nor Nakula, or Phalguna, or thee today, O bull of Bharata's race! Accorded\r\nan encounter, I will fight any one amongst you and will certainly gain\r\nthe victory on the field! Today I will reach the end of these hostilities\r\nthat is difficult to reach, with the aid, O tiger among men, of my mace\r\nwrapped with cloth of gold. I think, there is none to be my match in an\r\nencounter with the mace! With my mace I shall slay all of you one after\r\nanother! Amongst all of you there is no one who is competent to fight\r\nfairly with me! It is not proper for me to speak such words of pride with\r\nrespect to my own self! I shall, however, make these words of mine true\r\nin your presence! Within this very hour, these words will become either\r\ntrue or false! Let him amongst you take up the mace that will fight with\r\nme!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Whilst Duryodhana, O king, was repeatedly roaring in this\r\nstrain, Vasudeva, filled with wrath, said these words unto Yudhishthira,\r\n\"What rash words hast thou spoken, O king, to the effect, 'Slaying one\r\namongst us be thou king among the Kurus.' If, indeed, O Yudhishthira,\r\nDuryodhana select thee for battle, or Arjuna, or Nakula, or Sahadeva\r\n(what will be the consequence)? From desire of slaying Bhimasena, O king,\r\nfor these thirteen years hath Duryodhana practised with the mace upon a\r\nstatue of iron! How then, O bull of Bharata's race, will our purpose be\r\nachieved? From compassion, O best of kings, thou hast acted with great\r\nrashness! I do not at this moment behold a match (for Duryodhana) except\r\nPritha's son Vrikodara! His practice, again, with the mace, is not so\r\ngreat! Thou hast, therefore, once more allowed a wretched game of chance\r\nto commence as that one in former days between thyself and Shakuni, O\r\nmonarch! Bhima is possessed of might and prowess. King Suyodhana,\r\nhowever, is possessed of skill! In a contest between might and skill, he\r\nthat is possessed of skill, O king, always prevails! Such a foe, O king,\r\nthou hast, by thy words, placed in a position of ease and comfort! Thou\r\nhast placed thine own self, however, in a position of difficulty. We\r\nhave, in consequence of this, been placed in great danger! Who is there\r\nthat would abandon sovereignty within grasp, after having vanquished all\r\nhis foes and when he hath only one foe to dispose of and that one plunged\r\nin difficulties? I do not see that man in the world today, be he a god,\r\nwho is competent to vanquish the mace-armed Duryodhana in battle! Neither\r\nthou nor Bhima, nor Nakula nor Sahadeva, nor Phalguna, is capable of\r\nvanquishing Duryodhana in fair fight! King Duryodhana is possessed of\r\ngreat skill! How then, O Bharata, canst thou say unto such a foe words\r\nsuch as these, 'Fight, selecting the mace as thy weapon, and if thou\r\ncanst slay one amongst us, thou shalt then be king?' If Duryodhana\r\nencounters Vrikodara amongst us wishing to fight fairly with him, even\r\nthen our victory would be doubtful. Duryodhana is possessed of great\r\nmight and great skill. How couldst thou say unto him, 'Slaying only one\r\namongst us be thou king'? Without a doubt, the offspring of Pandu and\r\nKunti are not destined to enjoy sovereignty! They were born for passing\r\ntheir lives in continued exile in the woods or in mendicancy!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Bhimasena said, \"O slayer of Madhu, do not, O delighter of the Yadus,\r\ngive way to sorrow! However, difficult to reach it, I shall today reach\r\nthe end of these hostilities! Without doubt, I shall slay Suyodhana in\r\nbattle! It appears, O Krishna, that the victory of Yudhishthira the just\r\nis certain! This mace of mine is heavier than Duryodhana's by one and a\r\nhalf times! Do not, O Madhava, give way to grief! I dare fight him,\r\nselecting the mace as the weapon! Let all of you, O Janardana, stand as\r\nspectators of the encounter! What do you say of Suyodhana, I would fight\r\nwith the three worlds including the very gods, even if they be armed with\r\nevery kind of weapon!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'After Vrikodara had said these words, Vasudeva,\r\nfilled with joy, applauded him highly and said unto him, \"Relying on\r\nthee, O thou of mighty arms, king Yudhishthira the just will, without\r\ndoubt, get back his own blazing prosperity after the slaughter of all his\r\nfoes! Thou hast slain all the sons of Dhritarashtra in battle! At thy\r\nhands many kings and princes and elephants have met with their fate! The\r\nKalingas, the Magadhas, the Kauravas the Westerners, the Gandharas have\r\nall been slain in dreadful battle, O son of Pandu! Slaying Duryodhana\r\nthen, O son of Kunti, bestow the earth with her oceans upon Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, like Vishnu (conferring the sovereignty of three worlds) upon\r\nthe Lord of Sachi! The wretched son of Dhritarashtra, obtaining thee for\r\na foe in battle, will, without doubt, meet with his fate! Thou wilt\r\ncertainly accomplish thy vow by breaking his bones! Thou shouldst,\r\nhowever, O son of Pritha, always fight with care with the son of\r\nDhritarashtra! He is possessed of both skill and strength and always\r\ntakes delight in battle!\" Then Satyaki, O king, applauded the son of\r\nPandu. The Pancalas and the Pandavas, also, headed by king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, all applauded those words of Bhimasena. Then Bhima of terrible\r\nmight addressed Yudhishthira, who was staying amid the Srinjayas like the\r\nblazing sun himself, saying, \"Encountering this one in battle, I venture\r\nto fight with him! This wretch among men is not competent to vanquish me\r\nin fight! Today I shall vomit that wrath which hath been nursed in my\r\nbosom upon Suyodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, like Arjuna throwing fire\r\non the forest of Khandava! I shall today pluck out the dart, O son of\r\nPandu, that lay so long sticking to thy heart! Be happy, O king, after I\r\nshall have laid low this wretch with my mace! Today I shall recover, O\r\nsinless one, thy wreath of glory! Today Suyodhana shall abandon his life\r\nbreath, his prosperity, and his kingdom! Today king Dhritarashtra also,\r\nhearing of his son's slaughter, will remember all those wrongs (that he\r\ndid unto us) arising from the suggestions of Shakuni!\" Having said these\r\nwords that prince of Bharata's race, possessed of great energy, stood up\r\nfor battle, like Shakra summoning Vritra (to an encounter). Unable to\r\nendure that summons, thy son, of great energy, proceeded to the\r\nencounter, like one infuriated elephant proceeding to assail another. The\r\nPandavas beheld thy son, as he came armed with mace, look like the\r\ncrested mountain of Kailasa. Indeed, seeing that mighty son of thine\r\nstanding alone like a prince of elephants separated from the herd, the\r\nPandavas became filled with delight. Standing in battle like a very lion,\r\nDuryodhana had no fear, no alarm, no pain, no anxiety. Beholding him\r\nstand there with uplifted mace like the crested mountain of Kailasa,\r\nBhimasena, O monarch, addressed him, saying, \"Call to thy mind all those\r\nwrongs that king Dhritarashtra and thyself have done unto us! Recollect\r\nwhat happened at Varanavata! Recollect how Draupadi, while in her season,\r\nwas maltreated in the midst of the assembly and how king Yudhishthira was\r\ndefeated at dice through Shakuni's suggestion! See now, O thou of wicked\r\nsoul, the terrible consequence of those acts as also of the other wrongs\r\nthat thou didst unto the innocent Parthas! It is for thee that that\r\nillustrious chief of the Bharatas, the son of Ganga, the grandsire of us\r\nall, lieth now on a bed of arrows, struck down (by us)! Drona also hath\r\nbeen slain! Karna hath been slain! Shalya of great valour hath been\r\nslain! Yonder Shakuni also, the root of these hostilities, hath been\r\nslain in battle! Thy heroic brothers, as also thy sons, with all thy\r\ntroops, have been slain! Other kings also, possessed of heroism, and\r\nnever retreating from battle, have been slain. These and many other bulls\r\namong Kshatriyas, as also the Pratikamin, that wretch who had seized the\r\ntresses of Draupadi, have been slain! Thou alone art still alive, thou\r\nexterminator of thy race, thou wretch among men! Thee also I shall today\r\nslay with my mace! Of this there is no doubt! Today, O king, I shall, in\r\nbattle, quell all thy pride! I shall destroy also thy hope of\r\nsovereignty, O king, and pay off all thy misdeeds unto the sons of Pandu!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"What use is there of many words? Fight now with me!\r\nToday, O Vrikodara, I shall beat out of thee thy desire for battle! Why\r\ndost thou not behold me, O wretch, standing here for an encounter with\r\nthe mace? Am I not armed with a formidable mace that looks like a cliff\r\nof Himavat? What foe is there, O wretch, that would venture to vanquish\r\nme armed with this weapon? If it be a fair fight, Purandara himself,\r\namongst the gods, is not competent for that end! For all those wicked\r\ndeeds of mine to which thou hast referred, thou couldst not (hitherto) do\r\nme the slightest injury! By exercising my might, I caused ye to dwell in\r\nthe woods, to serve in another's dwelling, to conceal yourselves in\r\ndisguises! Your friends and allies also have been slain. Our loss has\r\nbeen equal! If, then my fall takes place in this battle, that would be\r\nhighly praiseworthy. Or, perhaps, Time will be the cause! Up to this day\r\nI have never been vanquished in fair fight on the field of battle! If you\r\nvanquish me by deceit, your infamy will certainly last for ever! That act\r\nof yours will, without doubt, be unrighteous and infamous! Do not, O son\r\nof Kunti, roar fruitlessly in this way like autumnal clouds uncharged\r\nwith water! Show all the strength thou hast in battle now!\" Hearing these\r\nwords of his, the Pandavas with the Srinjayas, all inspired with desire\r\nof victory, applauded them highly. Like men exciting an infuriated\r\nelephant with clapping of hands, all of them then gladdened king\r\nDuryodhana (with those praises and cheers). The elephants that were there\r\nbegan to grunt and the steeds to neigh repeatedly. The weapons of the\r\nPandavas, who were inspired with desire of victory blazed forth of their\r\nown accord.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'When that fierce battle, O monarch, was about to\r\ncommence, and when all the high-souled Pandavas had taken their seats,\r\nindeed, having heard that battle between those two heroes, both of whom\r\nwere his disciples, was about to begin, Rama, whose banner bore the\r\ndevice of the palmyra palm, and who owns the plough for his weapon, came\r\nto that spot. Beholding him, the Pandavas, with Keshava, filled with joy\r\nadvanced towards him, and receiving him, worshipped him with due rites.\r\nTheir worship over, they then, O king, said unto him these words,\r\n\"Witness, O Rama, the skill, in battle, of thy two disciples!\" Rama then\r\ncasting his eyes on Krishna and the Pandavas, and looking at Duryodhana\r\nalso of Kuru's race who was standing there armed with mace, said, \"Two\r\nand forty days have passed since I left home. I had set out under the\r\nconstellation Pushya and have come back under Sravana. I am desirous, O\r\nMadhava, of beholding this encounter with the mace between these two\r\ndisciples of mine!\" At that time the two heroes, Duryodhana and\r\nVrikodara, looked resplendent as they stood on the field, both armed with\r\nmaces. King Yudhishthira, embracing him owning the plough for his weapon,\r\nduly enquired about his welfare and bade him welcome. Those two great\r\nbowmen, the two illustrious Krishnas, filled with joy, cheerfully saluted\r\nthe hero having the plough for his weapon and embraced him. Similarly,\r\nthe two sons of Madri and the five sons of Draupadi saluted Rohini's son\r\nof great strength and stood (at a respectful distance). Bhimasena of\r\ngreat strength and thy son, O monarch, both with uplifted maces (in their\r\narms), worshipped Valadeva. The other kings honoured him by bidding him\r\nwelcome, and then all of them said unto Rama, \"Witness this encounter, O\r\nthou of mighty arms!\" Even thus those mighty car-warriors said unto the\r\nhigh-souled son of Rohini. Endued with immeasurable energy, Rama, having\r\nembraced the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, enquired after the welfare of\r\nall the (other) kings. Similarly, all of them, approaching, enquired\r\nafter his welfare. The hero of the plough, having in return saluted all\r\nthe high-souled Kshatriyas, and having made courteous enquiries about\r\neach according to their years, affectionately embraced Janardana and\r\nSatyaki. Smelling their heads, he enquired after their welfare. Those\r\ntwo, in return, O king, duly worshipped him, their superior, joyfully,\r\nlike Indra and Upendra worshipping Brahman, the lord of the celestials.\r\nThen Dharma's son, O Bharata, said these words unto that chastiser of\r\nfoes, the son of Rohini, \"Behold, O Rama, this formidable encounter\r\nbetween the two brothers!\" Thus worshipped by those great car-warriors,\r\nthe elder brother of Keshava, of mighty arms and great beauty, took his\r\nseat amongst them. Clad in blue robes and possessed of a fair complexion,\r\nRama, as he sat amidst those kings, looked resplendent like the moon in\r\nthe firmament, encompassed by multitudes of stars. Then that dreadful\r\nencounter, making the very hair stand on end, took place between those\r\ntwo sons of thine, O king, for terminating the quarrel (that had raged\r\nfor many years).'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"On the eve of the great battle (between the Kurus and\r\nthe Pandus), the lord Rama, with Keshava's leave, had gone away (from\r\nDwaraka) accompanied by many of the Vrishnis. He had said unto Keshava,\r\n'I will render aid neither unto the son of Dhritarashtra nor unto the\r\nsons of Pandu, but will go whithersoever I like!' Having said these\r\nwords, Rama, that resister of foes, had gone away. It behoveth thee, O\r\nBrahmana, to tell me everything about his return! Tell me in detail how\r\nRama came to that spot, how he witnessed the battle. In my opinion thou\r\nart well-skilled in narration!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After the high-souled Pandavas had taken up their\r\npost at Upaplavya, they despatched the slayer of Madhu to Dhritarashtra's\r\npresence, for the object of peace, O mighty-armed one, and for the good\r\nof all creatures. Having gone to Hastinapura and met Dhritarashtra,\r\nKeshava spoke words of true and especially beneficial import. The king,\r\nhowever, as I have told thee before, listened not to those counsels.\r\nUnable to obtain peace, the mighty-armed Krishna, that foremost of men,\r\ncame back, O monarch, to Upaplavya. Dismissed by Dhritarashtra's son,\r\nKrishna returned (to the Pandava camp), and upon the failure of his\r\nmission, O tiger among kings, said these words unto the Pandavas, 'Urged\r\nby Fate, the Kauravas are for disregarding my words! Come, ye sons of\r\nPandu, with me (to the field of battle), setting out under the\r\nconstellation Pushya!' After this, while the troops (of both sides) were\r\nbeing mustered and arrayed, the high-souled son of Rohini, that foremost\r\nof all persons endued with might, addressed his brother Krishna, saying,\r\n'O mighty-armed one, O slayer of Madhu, let us render assistance to the\r\nKurus!' Krishna, however, did not listen to those words of his. With\r\nheart filled with rage (at this), that illustrious son of Yadu's race,\r\nthe wielder of the plough then set out on a pilgrimage to the Sarasvati.\r\nAccompanied by all the Yadavas, he set out under the conjunction of the\r\nasterism called Maitra. The Bhoja chief (Kritavarma), however, adopted\r\nthe side of Duryodhana. Accompanied by Yuyudhana, Vasudeva adopted that\r\nof the Pandavas. After the heroic son of Rohini had set out under the\r\nconstellation Pushya, the slayer of Madhu, placing the Pandavas in his\r\nvan, proceeded against the Kurus. While proceeding, Rama ordered his\r\nservants on the way, saying, 'Bring all things that are necessary for a\r\npilgrimage, that is, every article of use! Bring the (sacred) fire that\r\nis at Dwaraka, and our priests. Bring gold, silver, kine, robes, steeds,\r\nelephants, cars, mules, camels, and other draft cattle! Bring all these\r\nnecessaries for a trip to the sacred waters, and proceed with great speed\r\ntowards the Sarasvati! Bring also some priests to be especially employed,\r\nand hundreds of foremost of Brahmanas!' Having given these orders to the\r\nservants, the mighty Valadeva set out on a pilgrimage at that time of\r\ngreat calamity to the Kurus. Setting out towards the Sarasvati, he\r\nvisited all the sacred places along her course, accompanied by priests,\r\nfriends, and many foremost of Brahmanas, as also with cars and elephants\r\nand steeds and servants, O bull of Bharata's race, and with many vehicles\r\ndrawn by kine and mules and camels. Diverse kinds of necessaries of life\r\nwere given away in large measure and in diverse countries unto the weary\r\nand worn, children and the old, in response, O king, to solicitations.\r\nEverywhere, O king, Brahmanas were promptly gratified with whatever\r\nviands they desired. At the command of Rohini's son, men at different\r\nstages of the journey stored food and drink in large quantities. Costly\r\ngarments and bedsteads and coverlets were given for the gratification of\r\nBrahmanas, desirous of ease and comfort. Whatever Brahmana or Kshatriya\r\nsolicited whatever thing, that O Bharata, it was seen to be ungrudgingly\r\ngiven to him. All who formed the party proceeded with great happiness and\r\nlived happily. The people (of Valarama's train) gave away vehicles to\r\npersons desirous of making journeys, drinks to them that were thirsty,\r\nand savoury viands to them that were hungry, as also robes and ornaments,\r\nO bull of Bharata's race, to many! The road, O king, along which the\r\nparty proceeded, looked resplendent, O hero, and was highly comfortable\r\nfor all, and resembled heaven itself. There were rejoicings everywhere\r\nupon it, and savoury viands were procurable everywhere. There were shops\r\nand stalls and diverse objects exposed for sale. The whole way was,\r\nbesides, crowded with human beings. And it was adorned with various kinds\r\nof trees and creatures, and various kinds of gems. The high-souled\r\nValadeva, observant of rigid vows, gave away unto the Brahmanas much\r\nwealth and plentiful sacrificial presents, O king, in diverse sacred\r\nspots. That chief of Yadu's race also gave away thousands of milch kine\r\ncovered with excellent cloths and having their horns cased in gold, many\r\nsteeds belonging to different countries, many vehicles, and many\r\nbeautiful slaves. Even thus did the high-souled Rama give away wealth in\r\ndiverse excellent tirthas on the Sarasvati. In course of his wanderings,\r\nthat hero of unrivalled power and magnanimous conduct at last came to\r\nKurukshetra.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Tell me, O foremost of men, the features, the origin,\r\nand the merits of the several tirthas on the Sarasvati and the ordinances\r\nto be observed while sojourning there! Tell me these, in their order, O\r\nillustrious one! My curiosity is irrepressible, O foremost of all persons\r\nacquainted with Brahma!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"The subject of the features and origin of all these\r\ntirthas, O king, is very large. I shall, however, describe them to thee.\r\nListen to that sacred account in its entirety, O king! Accompanied by his\r\npriests and friends, Valadeva first proceeded to the tirtha called\r\nPrabhasa. There, the Lord of the constellations (Soma), who had been\r\naffected with phthisis, became freed from his curse. Regaining energy\r\nthere, O king, he now illuminates the universe. And because that foremost\r\nof tirthas on earth had formerly contributed to invest Soma with\r\nsplendour (after he had lost it), it is, therefore, called Prabhasa.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"For what reason was the adorable Soma afflicted with\r\nphthisis? How also did he bathe in that tirtha? How did he, having bathed\r\nin that sacred water, regain his energy? Tell me all this in detail, O\r\ngreat Muni!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Daksha had seven and twenty daughters, O king! These\r\nhe bestowed (in marriage) upon Soma. Connected with the several\r\nconstellations, those wives, O king, of Soma of auspicious deeds, served\r\nto help men in calculating time. Possessed of large eyes, all of them\r\nwere unrivalled in beauty in the world. In wealth of beauty, however,\r\nRohini was the foremost of them all. The adorable Soma took great delight\r\nin her. She became very agreeable to him, and therefore, he enjoyed the\r\npleasures of her company (exclusively). In those days of yore, O monarch,\r\nSoma lived long with Rohini (exclusively). For this, those other wives of\r\nhis, they that were called the constellations, became displeased with\r\nthat high-souled one. Repairing speedily to their sire (Daksha), that\r\nLord of creation, they said unto him, 'Soma doth not live with us! He\r\nalways payeth court to Rohini only! All of us, therefore, O Lord of\r\ncreatures, shall dwell by thy side, on regulated diet and observant of\r\naustere penances!' Hearing these words of theirs, Daksha (saw Soma and)\r\nsaid unto him, 'Behave equally towards all thy wives! Let not a great sin\r\nstain thee!' And Daksha then said unto those daughters of his, 'Go, all\r\nof you, to the presence of Sasin. At my command, he, (otherwise called)\r\nCandramas, will behave equally towards all of you!' Dismissed by him,\r\nthey then proceeded to the abode of him having cool rays. Still the\r\nadorable Soma, O lord of earth, continued to act as before, for pleased\r\nwith Rohini alone, he continued to live with her exclusively. His other\r\nwives then once more came together to their sire and said unto him,\r\n'Employed in serving thee, we will dwell in thy asylum! Soma does not\r\nlive with us and is unmindful of thy commands!' Hearing these words of\r\ntheirs, Daksha once more said unto Soma, 'Behave equally towards all thy\r\nwives! Let me not, O Virochana, curse thee!' Disregarding, however, these\r\nwords of Daksha, the adorable Soma continued to live with Rohini alone.\r\nAt this, his other wives became once more angry. Repairing to their sire,\r\nthey bowed unto him by lowering their heads, and said, 'Soma doth not\r\nlive with us! Give us thy protection! The adorable Candramas always lives\r\nwith Rohini exclusively! He sets no importance to thy words, and does not\r\nwish to show us any affection! Therefore, save us so that Soma may accept\r\nus all!' Hearing these words, the adorable Daksha, O king, became angry\r\nand in consequence thereof hurled the curse of phthisis upon Soma. Thus\r\ndid that disease overtake the Lord of the stars. Afflicted with phthisis,\r\nSasin began to waste away day by day. He made many endeavours for freeing\r\nhimself from that disease by performing diverse sacrifices, O monarch!\r\nThe maker of night, however, could not free himself from that curse. On\r\nthe other hand, he continued to endure waste and emaciation. In\r\nconsequence, however, of the wasting of Soma, the deciduous herbs failed\r\nto grow. Their juices dried up and they became tasteless, and all of them\r\nbecame deprived of their virtues. And, in consequence of this decadence\r\nof the deciduous herbs, living creatures also began to decay. Indeed,\r\nowing to the wasting of Soma, all creatures began to be emaciated. Then\r\nall the celestials, coming to Soma, O king, asked him, saying, 'Why is it\r\nthat thy form is not so beautiful and resplendent (as before)? Tell us\r\nthe reason whence hath proceeded this great calamity! Hearing thy answer,\r\nwe shall do what is needed for dispelling thy fear!' Thus addressed, the\r\ngod having the hare for his mark, replied unto them and informed them of\r\nthe cause of the curse and the phthisis with which he was afflicted. The\r\ngods then, having heard those words, repaired to Daksha and said, 'Be\r\ngratified, O adorable one, with Soma! Let this curse of thine be\r\nwithdrawn! Candramas is very emaciated! Only a small portion of him may\r\nbe seen! In consequence of his wasting, O Lord of the celestials, all\r\ncreatures also are wasting! Creepers and herbs of diverse kinds are also\r\nwasting! In their waste we ourselves also are suffering emaciation!\r\nWithout us, what will this universe be? Knowing this, O master of the\r\nuniverse, it behoveth thee to be gratified (with Soma)!' Thus addressed\r\n(Daksha), that Lord of creatures, said these words unto the celestials,\r\n'It is impossible to make my words become otherwise! By some contrivance,\r\nhowever, ye blessed ones, my words may be withdrawn! Let Sasin always\r\nbehave equally towards all his wives! Having bathed also in that foremost\r\nof tirthas on the Sarasvati, the god having the hare for his mark shall,\r\nye gods, grow once more! These words of mine are true! For half the month\r\nSoma shall wane every day, and for half the month (following) he will wax\r\nevery day! These words of mine are true! Proceeding to the western Ocean\r\nat the spot where the Sarasvati mingles with the Ocean, that vast\r\nreceptacle of waters, let him adore that God of gods (Mahadeva) there! He\r\nwill then regain his form and beauty!' At this command of the (celestial)\r\nRishi (Daksha), Soma then proceeded to the Sarasvati. He arrived at that\r\nforemost of tirthas called Prabhasa belonging to the Sarasvati. Bathing\r\nthere on the day of the new moon, that god of great energy and great\r\neffulgence got back his cool rays and continued once more to illumine the\r\nworlds. All the creatures also, O monarch, having repaired to Prabhasa,\r\nreturned with Soma amongst them to the place where Daksha was. (Receiving\r\nthem duly) that Lord of creatures then dismissed them. Pleased with Soma,\r\nthe adorable Daksha once more addressed him, saying, 'Do not, O son,\r\ndisregard women, and never disregard Brahmanas! Go and attentively obey\r\nmy commands!' Dismissed by him, Soma came back to his own abode. All\r\ncreatures, filled with joy, continued to live as before. I have thus told\r\nthee everything about how the maker of the night had been cursed, and,\r\nhow also Prabhasa became the foremost of all tirthas. On every recurring\r\nday of the new moon, O monarch, the god having the hare for his mark\r\nbathes in the excellent tirtha of Prabhasa and regains his form and\r\nbeauty. It is for this reason, O lord of earth, that that tirtha is known\r\nby the name of Prabhasa, since bathing there, Candramas regained his\r\ngreat (Prabha) effulgence. After this, the mighty Baladeva of undecaying\r\nglory proceeded to Chamasodbheda, that is, to that tirtha which is called\r\nby that name. Giving away many costly gifts at that place, the hero\r\nhaving the plough for his weapon passed one night there and performed his\r\nablutions duly. The elder brother of Keshava then proceeded quickly to\r\nUdapana. Although the Sarasvati seems to be lost there, yet persons\r\ncrowned with ascetic success, in consequence of their obtaining great\r\nmerits and great blessedness at that spot, and owing also to the coolness\r\nof the herbs and of the land there, know that the river has an invisible\r\ncurrent, O monarch, through the bowels of the earth there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Baladeva (as already said), proceeded next to the\r\ntirtha called Udapana in the Sarasvati, that had formerly been the\r\nresidence, O king, of the illustrious (ascetic) Trita. Having given away\r\nmuch wealth and worshipped the Brahmanas, the hero having the plough for\r\nhis weapon bathed there and became filled with joy. Devoted to\r\nrighteousness, the great ascetic Trita had lived there. While in a hole,\r\nthat high-souled one had drunk the Soma juice. His two brothers, dashing\r\nhim down into that pit, had returned to their home. That foremost of\r\nBrahmanas, Trita, had thereupon cursed them both.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"What is the origin of Udapana? How did the great\r\nascetic (Trita) fall into a pit, there? Why was that foremost of\r\nBrahmanas thrown into that pit by his brothers? How did his brothers,\r\nafter throwing him into that hole, return home? How did Trita perform his\r\nsacrifice and how did he drink Soma? Tell me all this, O Brahmana, if\r\nthou thinkest that I may listen to it without impropriety!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"In a former Yuga, O king, there were three\r\nbrothers that were ascetics. They were called Ekata, Dwita, and Trita,\r\nand all three were endued with effulgence like that of the sun. They were\r\nlike Lords of the creation and were blessed with children. Utterers of\r\nBrahma, they had by their penances, acquired the privilege of attaining\r\nto the regions of Brahman (after death). With their penances, vows, and\r\nself-restraint, their sire Gautama, who was ever devoted to virtue,\r\nbecame highly and always pleased with them. Having obtained great joy in\r\nconsequence of his sons, the adorable Gautama, after passing a long life\r\nhere, went at last to the region (in the other world) that was fit for\r\nhim. Those kings, however, O monarch, that had been the Yajamanas of\r\nGautama, continued to worship Gautama's sons after the sire had proceeded\r\nto heaven. Amongst them, however, Trita, by his acts and study (of the\r\nVedas), O king, became the foremost, even like his sire Gautama. Then all\r\nthe highly blessed ascetics, characterised by righteousness, began to\r\nworship Trita as they had worshipped his sire Gautama before him. Once\r\nupon a time, the two brothers Ekata and Dwita thought of performing a\r\nsacrifice and became anxious for wealth. The plan they formed, O scorcher\r\nof foes, was to take Trita with them, and calling upon all their\r\nYajamanas and collecting the needful number of animals, they would\r\njoyfully drink the Soma juice and acquire the great merits of sacrifice.\r\nThe three brothers then, O monarch, did as settled. Calling upon all\r\ntheir Yajamanas for (obtaining) animals, and assisting them in their\r\nsacrifices and receiving a large number of animals from them, and having\r\nduly accepted them in gift in consequence of those priestly services\r\nwhich they rendered, those high-souled and great Rishis came towards the\r\neast. Trita, O king, with a cheerful heart was walking before them. Ekata\r\nand Dwita were in his rear, bringing up the animals. Beholding that large\r\nherd of animals, they began to reflect as to how they two could\r\nappropriate that property without giving a share unto Trita. Hear, O\r\nking, what those two sinful wretches, Ekata and Dwita, said while\r\nconversing with each other! They said, 'Trita is skilled in assisting at\r\nsacrifices. Trita is devoted to the Vedas. Trita is capable of earning\r\nmany other kine. Let us two, therefore, go away, taking the kine with us!\r\nLet Trita go whithersoever he chooses, without being in our company!' As\r\nthey proceeded, night came upon them on the way. They then saw a wolf\r\nbefore them. Not far from that spot was a deep hole on the bank of the\r\nSarasvati. Trita, who was in advance of his brothers, seeing the wolf,\r\nran in fright and fell into that hole. That hole was fathomless and\r\nterrible and capable of inspiring all creatures with fear. Then Trita, O\r\nking, that best of ascetics, from within that hole, began to utter wails\r\nof woe. His two brothers heard his cries. Understanding that he had\r\nfallen into a pit, his brothers Ekata and Dwita, moved by fear of the\r\nwolf as also by temptation, went on, deserting their brother. Thus\r\ndeserted by his two brothers, who were moved by the temptation of\r\nappropriating those animals, the great ascetic Trita, O king, while\r\nwithin that lonely well covered with dust and herbs and creepers, thought\r\nhimself plunged, O chief of the Bharatas, into hell itself like a sinful\r\nwretch. He feared to die inasmuch as he had not earned the merit of\r\ndrinking Soma juice. Possessed of great wisdom, he began to reflect with\r\nthe aid of his intelligence as to how he could succeed in drinking Soma\r\neven there. While thinking on that subject, the great ascetic, standing\r\nin that pit, beheld a creeper hanging down into it in course of its\r\ngrowth. Although the pit was dry, the sage imagined the existence of\r\nwater and of sacrificial fires there. Constituting himself the Hotri (in\r\nimagination), the great ascetic imagined the creeper he saw to be the\r\nSoma plant. He then mentally uttered the Richs, the Yayushes and the\r\nSamans (that were necessary for the performance of a sacrifice). The\r\npebbles (lying at the bottom of the well) Trita converted into grains of\r\nsugar (in imagination). He then, O king, (mentally) performed his\r\nablutions. He conceived the water (he had imagined) to be clarified\r\nbutter. He allotted to the celestials their respective shares (of those\r\nsacrificial offerings). Having next (mentally) drunk Soma, he began to\r\nutter a loud noise. Those sounds, O king, first uttered by the\r\nsacrificing Rishi, penetrated into heaven, and Trita completed that\r\nsacrifice after the manner laid down by utterers of Brahma. During the\r\nprogress of that sacrifice of the high-souled Trita, the whole region of\r\nthe celestials became agitated. None knew, however, the cause. Brihaspati\r\n(the preceptor of the gods) heard that loud noise (made by Trita). The\r\npriests of the celestials said unto the latter, 'Trita is performing a\r\nsacrifice. We must go there, ye gods! Endued with great ascetic merit, if\r\nangry, he is competent to create other gods!' Hearing these words of\r\nBrihaspati, all the gods, united together, repaired to that spot where\r\nthe sacrifice of Trita was going on. Having proceeded to that spot, the\r\ngods beheld the high-souled Trita installed in the performance of his\r\nsacrifice. Beholding that high-souled one resplendent with beauty, the\r\ngods addressed him, saying, 'We have come hither for our shares (in thy\r\nofferings)!' The Rishi said unto them, 'Behold me, ye denizens of heaven,\r\nfallen into this terrible well, almost deprived of my senses!' Then,\r\nTrita, O monarch, duly gave unto them their shares with proper mantras.\r\nThe gods took them and became very glad. Having duly obtained their\r\nallotted shares, the denizens of heaven, gratified with him, gave him\r\nsuch boons as he desired. The boon, however, that he solicited was that\r\nthe gods should relieve him from his distressful situation (in the well).\r\nHe also said, 'Let him that bathes in this well, have the end that is\r\nattained by persons that have drunk Soma!' At these words, O king, the\r\nSarasvati with her waves appeared within that well. Raised aloft by her,\r\nTrita came up and worshipped the denizens of heaven. The gods then said\r\nunto him 'Be it as thou wishest!' All of them, then, O king, went to the\r\nplace whence they had come, and Trita, filled with joy, proceeded to his\r\nown abode. Meeting with those two Rishis, his brothers, he became enraged\r\nwith them. Possessed of great ascetic merit, he said certain harsh words\r\nunto them and cursed them, saying, 'Since, moved by covetousness, you ran\r\naway, deserting me, therefore, you shall become fierce wolves with sharp\r\nteeth and range the forest, cursed by me in consequence of that sinful\r\nact of yours! The offspring also that you shall have will consist of\r\nleopards, and bears and apes!' After Trita had said these words, O\r\nmonarch, his two brothers were seen to be very soon transformed into\r\nthese shapes in consequence of the words of that truthful sage. Of\r\nimmeasurable prowess, Valadeva touched the waters of Udapana. And he gave\r\naway diverse kinds of wealth there and worshipped many Brahmanas.\r\nBeholding Udapana and applauding it repeatedly, Valadeva next proceeded\r\nto Vinasana which also was on the Sarasvati.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Then Valadeva, O king, proceeded to Vinasana where\r\nthe Sarasvati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for\r\nSudras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such\r\ncontempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, O chief of\r\nthe Bharatas, always name the place as Vinasana. Having bathed in that\r\ntirtha of the Sarasvati, the mighty Baladeva then proceeded to Subhumika,\r\nsituated on the excellent bank of the same river. There many\r\nfair-complexioned Apsaras, of beautiful faces, are always engaged in\r\nsports of a pure character without any intermission. The gods and the\r\nGandharvas, every month, O ruler of men, repair to that sacred tirtha\r\nwhich is the resort of Brahman himself. The Gandharvas and diverse tribes\r\nof Apsaras are to be seen there, O king, assembled together and passing\r\nthe time as happily as they like. There the gods and the Pitris sport in\r\njoy, with sacred and auspicious flowers repeatedly rained over them, and\r\nall the creepers also were adorned with flowery loads. And because, O\r\nking, that spot is the beautiful sporting ground of those Apsaras,\r\ntherefore is that tirtha on the excellent bank of the Sarasvati called\r\nSubhumika. Baladeva of Madhu's race, having bathed in that tirtha and\r\ngiven away much wealth unto the Brahmanas, heard the sound of those\r\ncelestial songs and musical instruments. He also saw there many shadows\r\nof gods, Gandharvas, and Rakshasas. The son of Rohini then proceeded to\r\nthe tirtha of the Gandharvas. There many Gandharvas headed by Viswavasu\r\nand possessed of ascetic merit, pass their time in dance and song of the\r\nmost charming kind. Giving away diverse kinds of wealth unto the\r\nBrahmanas, as also goats and sheep and kine and mules and camels and gold\r\nand silver, and feeding many Brahmanas and gratifying them with many\r\ncostly gifts that were desired by them. Baladeva of Madhu's race\r\nproceeded thence, accompanied by many Brahmanas and eulogised by them.\r\nLeaving that tirtha resorted to by Gandharvas, that mighty-armed\r\nchastiser of foes, having but one earring, then proceeded to the famous\r\ntirtha called Gargasrota. There, in that sacred tirtha of the Sarasvati,\r\nthe illustrious Garga of venerable years and soul cleansed by ascetic\r\npenances, O Janamejaya, had acquired a knowledge of Time and its course,\r\nof the deviations of luminous bodies (in the firmament), and of all\r\nauspicious and inauspicious portents. That tirtha, for this reason, came\r\nto be called after his name as Gargasrota. There, O king, highly blessed\r\nRishis of excellent vows always waited upon Garga, O lord, for obtaining\r\na knowledge of Time. Smeared with white sandal-paste, O king, Baladeva,\r\nrepairing to that tirtha, duly gave away wealth unto many ascetics of\r\ncleansed souls. Having given also many kinds of costly viands unto the\r\nBrahmanas, that illustrious one attired in blue robes then proceeded to\r\nthe tirtha called Sankha. There, on the bank of the Sarasvati, that\r\nmighty hero having the palmyra on his banner beheld a gigantic tree,\r\ncalled Mohasankha, tall as Meru, looking like the White-mountain, and\r\nresorted to by Rishis. There dwell Yakshas, and Vidyadharas, and\r\nRakshasas of immeasurable energy and Pisachas of immeasurable might, and\r\nSiddhas, numbering thousands. All of them, abandoning other kinds of\r\nfood, observe vows and regulations, and take at due seasons the fruits of\r\nthat lord of the forest for their sustenance and wander in separate\r\nbands, unseen by men, O foremost of human beings! That monarch of the\r\nforest, O king, is known for this throughout the world! That tree is the\r\ncause of this celebrated and sacred tirtha on the Sarasvati. Having given\r\naway in that tirtha many milch cows, and vessels of copper and iron, and\r\ndiverse kinds of other vessels, that tiger of Yadu's race, Baladeva,\r\nhaving the plough for his weapon, worshipped the Brahmanas and was\r\nworshipped by them in return. He then, O king, proceeded to the Dwaita\r\nlake. Arrived there, Vala saw diverse kinds of ascetics in diverse kinds\r\nof attire. Bathing in its waters, he worshipped the Brahmanas. Having\r\ngiven away unto the Brahmanas diverse articles of enjoyment in profusion,\r\nBaladeva then, O king, proceeded along the southern bank of the\r\nSarasvati. The mighty-armed and illustrious Rama of virtuous soul and\r\nunfading glory then proceeded to the tirtha called Nagadhanwana. Swarming\r\nwith numerous snakes, O monarch, it was the abode of Vasuki of great\r\nsplendour, the king of the snakes. There 14,000 Rishis also had their\r\npermanent home. The celestials, having come there (in days of yore), had\r\naccording to due rites, installed the excellent snake Vasuki as king of\r\nall the snakes. There is no fear of snakes in that place, O thou of\r\nKuru's race! Duly giving away many valuables there unto the Brahmanas,\r\nBaladeva then set out with face towards the east and reached, one after\r\nanother, hundreds and thousands of famous tirthas that occurred at every\r\nstep. Bathing in all those tirthas, and observing fasts and other vows as\r\ndirected by the Rishis, and giving away wealth in profusion, and saluting\r\nall the ascetics who had taken up their residence there, Baladeva once\r\nmore set out, along the way that those ascetics pointed out to him, for\r\nreaching that spot where the Sarasvati turns in an eastward direction,\r\nlike torrents of rain bent by the action of the wind. The river took that\r\ncourse for beholding the high-souled Rishis dwelling in the forest of\r\nNaimisha. Always smeared with white sandalpaste, Vala, having the plough\r\nfor his weapon, beholding that foremost of rivers change her course,\r\nbecame, O king, filled with wonder.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why, O Brahmana, did the Sarasvati bend her course\r\nthere in an easternly direction? O best of Adharyus, it behoveth thee to\r\ntell me everything relating to this! For what reason was that daughter of\r\nthe Yadus filled with wonder? Why, indeed, did that foremost of rivers\r\nthus alter her course?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Formerly, in the Krita age, O king, the ascetics\r\ndwelling in Naimisha were engaged in a grand sacrifice extending for\r\ntwelve years. Many were the Rishis, O king, that came to that sacrifice.\r\nPassing their days, according to due rites, in the performance of that\r\nsacrifice, those highly blessed ones, after the completion of that twelve\r\nyears' sacrifice at Naimisha, set out in large number for visiting the\r\ntirthas. In consequence of the number of the Rishis, O king, the tirthas\r\non the southern banks of the Sarasvati all looked like towns and cities.\r\nThose foremost of Brahmanas, O tiger among men, in consequence of their\r\neagerness for enjoying the merits of tirthas, took up their abodes on the\r\nbank of the river up to the site of Samantapanchaka. The whole region\r\nseemed to resound with the loud Vedic recitations of those Rishis of\r\ncleansed souls, all employed in pouring libations on sacrificial fires.\r\nThat foremost of rivers looked exceedingly beautiful with those blazing\r\nhoma fires all around, over which those high-souled ascetics poured\r\nlibations of clarified butter. Valkhilyas and Asmakuttas,\r\nDantolakhalinas, Samprakshanas and other ascetics, as also those that\r\nsubsisted on air, and those that lived on water, and those that lived on\r\ndry leaves of trees, and diverse others that were observant of diverse\r\nkinds of vows, and those that forswore beds for the bare and hard earth,\r\nall came to that spot in the vicinity of the Sarasvati. And they made\r\nthat foremost of rivers exceedingly beautiful, like the celestials\r\nbeautifying (with their presence) the heavenly stream called Mandakini.\r\nHundreds upon hundreds of Rishis, all given to the observance of\r\nsacrifices, came thither. Those practisers of high vows, however, failed\r\nto find sufficient room on the banks of the Sarasvati. Measuring small\r\nplots of land with their sacred threads, they performed their Agnihotras\r\nand diverse other rites. The river Sarasvati beheld, O monarch, that\r\nlarge body of Rishis penetrated with despair and plunged into anxiety for\r\nwant of a broad tirtha wherein to perform their rites. For their sake,\r\nthat foremost of streams came there, having made many abodes for herself\r\nin that spot, through kindness for those Rishis of sacred penances, O\r\nJanamejaya! Having thus, O monarch, turned her course for their sake, the\r\nSarasvati, that foremost of rivers, once more flowed in a westerly\r\ndirection, as if she said, 'I must go hence, having prevented the arrival\r\nof these Rishis from becoming futile!' This wonderful feat, O king, was\r\naccomplished there by that great river. Even thus those receptacles of\r\nwater, O king, were formed in Naimisha. There, at Kurukshetra, O foremost\r\nof Kuru's care, do thou perform grand sacrifices and rites! As he beheld\r\nthose many receptacles of water and seeing that foremost of rivers turn\r\nher course, wonder filled the heart of the high-souled Rama. Bathing in\r\nthose tirthas duly and giving away wealth and diverse articles of\r\nenjoyment unto the Brahmanas, that delighter of Yadu's race also gave\r\naway diverse kinds of food and diverse desirable articles unto them.\r\nWorshipped by those regenerate ones, Vala, O king, then set out from that\r\nforemost of all tirthas on the Sarasvati (Sapta-Saraswat). Numerous\r\nfeathery creatures have their home there. And it abounded with Vadari,\r\nInguda, Ksamarya, Plaksha, Aswattha, Vibhitaka, Kakkola, Palasa, Karira,\r\nPilu, and diverse other kinds of trees that grow on the banks of the\r\nSarasvati. And it was adorned with forest of Karushakas, Vilwas, and\r\nAmratakas, and Atimuktas and Kashandas and Parijatas. Agreeable to the\r\nsight and most charming, it abounded with forests of plantains. And it\r\nwas resorted to by diverse tribes of ascetics, some living on air, some\r\non water, some on fruit, some on leaves, some on raw grain which they\r\nhusked with the aid only of stones, and some that were called Vaneyas.\r\nAnd it resounded with the chanting of the Vedas, and teemed with diverse\r\nkinds of animals. And it was the favourite abode of men without malice\r\nand devoted to righteousness. Valadeva, having the plough for his weapon,\r\narrived at that tirtha called Sapta-Saraswat, where the great ascetic\r\nMankanaka had performed his penances and became crowned with success.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why was that tirtha called Sapta-Saraswat? Who was the\r\nascetic Mankanaka? How did that adorable one become crowned with success?\r\nWhat were his vows and observances? In whose race was he born? What books\r\ndid that best of regenerate ones study? I desire to hear all this, O\r\nforemost of regenerate ones!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"O king, the seven Sarasvatis cover this universe!\r\nWhithersoever the Sarasvati was summoned by persons of great energy,\r\nthither she made her appearance. These are the seven forms of the\r\nSarasvati: Suprava, Kanchanakshi, Visala, Manorama, Oghavati, Surenu, and\r\nVimalodaka. The Supreme Grandsire had at one time performed a great\r\nsacrifice. While that sacrifice was in course of performance on the\r\nground selected, many regenerate ones crowned with ascetic success came\r\nthere. The spot resounded with the recitation of sacred hymns and the\r\nchanting of the Vedas. In the matter of those sacrificial rites, the very\r\ngods lost their coolness (so grand were the preparations). There, O\r\nmonarch, while the Grandsire was installed in the sacrifice and was\r\nperforming the grand ceremony capable of bestowing prosperity and every\r\nwish, many notable ones conversant with righteousness and profit were\r\npresent. As soon as they thought of the articles of which they stood in\r\nneed, these, O monarch, immediately appeared before the regenerate ones\r\n(among the guests) that came there. The Gandharvas sang and the diverse\r\ntribes of Apsaras danced. And they played upon many celestial instruments\r\nall the time. The wealth of provisions procured in that sacrifice\r\nsatisfied the very gods. What shall I say then of human beings? The very\r\ncelestials became filled with wonder! During the continuance of that\r\nsacrifice at Pushkara and in the presence of the Grandsire, the Rishis, O\r\nking, said, 'This sacrifice cannot be said to possess high attributes,\r\nsince that foremost of rivers, Sarasvati, is not to be seen here!'\r\nHearing these words, the divine Brahman cheerfully thought of Sarasvati.\r\nSummoned at Pushkara by the Grandsire engaged in the performance of a\r\nsacrifice, Sarasvati, O king, appeared there, under the name of Suprava.\r\nBeholding Sarasvati quickly pay that regard to the Grandsire, the Munis\r\nesteemed that sacrifice highly. Even thus that foremost of rivers, the\r\nSarasvati, made her appearance at Pushkara for the sake of the Grandsire\r\nand for gratifying the Munis. (At another time), O king, many Munis,\r\nmustering together at Naimisha, took up their residence there. Delightful\r\ndisquisition occurred among them, O king, about the Vedas. There where\r\nthose Munis, conversant with diverse scriptures, took up their abode,\r\nthere they thought of the Sarasvati. Thus thought of, O monarch, by those\r\nRishis performing a sacrifice, the highly blessed and sacred Sarasvati,\r\nfor rendering assistance, O king, to those high-souled Munis assembled\r\ntogether, made her appearance at Naimisha and came to be called\r\nKanchanakshi. That foremost of rivers, worshipped by all, thus came\r\nthere, O Bharata! While (king) Gaya was engaged in the performance of a\r\ngreat sacrifice at Gaya, the foremost of rivers, Sarasvati, summoned at\r\nGaya's sacrifice (made her appearance there). The Rishis of rigid vows\r\nthat were there, named this form of hers at Gaya as Visala. That river of\r\nswift current flows from the sides of the Himavat. Auddalaka had also, O\r\nBharata, performed a sacrifice. A large concourse of Munis had been\r\ngathered there. It was on that sacred region, the northern part of\r\nKosala, O king, that the sacrifice of high-souled Auddalaka was\r\nperformed. Before Auddalaka began his sacrifice, he had thought of the\r\nSarasvati. That foremost of rivers came to that region for the sake of\r\nthose Rishis. Worshipped by all those Munis clad in barks and deer-skins\r\nshe became known by the name of Manorama, as those Rishis mentally called\r\nher. While, again, the high-souled Kuru was engaged in a sacrifice at\r\nKurukshetra, that foremost of rivers, the highly blessed Sarasvati, made\r\nher appearance there. Summoned, O monarch, by the high-souled Vasishtha\r\n(who assisted Kuru in his sacrifice), the Sarasvati, full of celestial\r\nwater appeared at Kurukshetra under the name of Oghavati. Daksha at one\r\ntime performed a sacrifice at the source of Ganga. The Sarasvati appeared\r\nthere under the name of the fast-flowing Surenu. Once again, while\r\nBrahman was engaged in a sacrifice on the sacred forest of the Himavat\r\nmountains, the adorable Sarasvati, summoned (by him), appeared there. All\r\nthese seven forms then came and joined together in that tirtha where\r\nBaladeva came. And because the seven mingled together at that spot,\r\ntherefore is that tirtha known on Earth by the name of Sapta Sarasvati.\r\nThus have I told thee of the seven Sarasvatis, according to their names.\r\nI have also told thee of the sacred tirtha called Sapta Saraswat. Listen\r\nnow to a great feat of Mankanaka, who had from his youth led the life of\r\na brahmacari. While employed in performing his ablutions in the river, he\r\nbeheld (one day), O Bharata, a woman of faultless limbs and fair brows,\r\nbathing in the river at will, her person uncovered. At this sight, O\r\nmonarch, the vital seed of the Rishi fell unto the Sarasvati. The great\r\nascetic took it up and placed it within his earthen pot. Kept within that\r\nvessel, the fluid became divided into seven parts. From those seven\r\nportions were born seven Rishis from whom sprang the (nine and forty)\r\nMaruts. The seven Rishis were named Vayuvega, Vayuhan, Vayumandala,\r\nVayujata, Vayuretas, and Vayuchakra of great energy. Thus were born these\r\nprogenitors of the diverse Maruts. Hear now a more wonderful thing, O\r\nking, a fact exceedingly marvellous on Earth, about the conduct of the\r\ngreat Rishi, which is well known in the three worlds. In days of yore,\r\nafter Mankanaka had become crowned with success, O king, his hand, on one\r\noccasion, became pierced with a Kusa blade. Thereupon, a vegetable juice\r\ncame out of the wound (and not red blood). Seeing that vegetable juice,\r\nthe Rishi became filled with joy and danced about on the spot. Seeing him\r\ndance, all mobile and immobile creatures, O hero, stupefied by his\r\nenergy, began to dance. Then the gods with Brahman at their head, and the\r\nRishis possessed of wealth of asceticism, O king, all went to Mahadeva\r\nand informed him of the act of the Rishi (Mankanaka). And they said unto\r\nhim, 'It behoveth thee, O god, to do that which may prevent the Rishi\r\nfrom dancing!' Then Mahadeva, seeing the Rishi filled with great joy, and\r\nmoved by the desire of doing good unto the gods, addressed him, saying,\r\n'Why, O Brahmana, dost thou dance in this way, acquainted as thou art\r\nwith thy duties? What grave cause is there for such joy of thine, O sage,\r\nthat, an ascetic as thou art, O best of Brahmanas, and walking as thou\r\ndost along the path of virtue, thou shouldst act in this way?'\r\n\r\n\"The Rishi said, 'Why, seest thou not, O Brahmana, that a vegetable juice\r\nis flowing from this wound of mine? Seeing this, O lord, I am dancing in\r\ngreat joy!' Laughing at the Rishi who was stupefied by passion, the god\r\nsaid, 'I do not, O Brahmana, at all wonder at this! Behold me!' Having\r\nsaid this unto that foremost of Rishis, Mahadeva of great intelligence\r\nstruck his thumb with the end of one of his fingers. Thereupon, O king,\r\nashes, white as snow, came out of that wound. Seeing this, the Rishi\r\nbecame ashamed, O monarch, and fell at the feet of the god. He understood\r\nthe god to be none else than Mahadeva. Filled with wonder, he said, 'I do\r\nnot think that thou art any one else than Rudra, that great and Supreme\r\nbeing! O wielder of the trident, thou art the refuge of this universe\r\nconsisting of gods and Asuras! The wise say that this universe hath been\r\ncreated by thee! At the universal destruction, everything once more\r\nenters thee! Thou art incapable of being known by the gods, how then\r\ncanst thou be known by me? All forms of being that are in the universe\r\nare seen in thee! The gods with Brahman at their head worship thy boon\r\ngiving self, O sinless one! Thou art everything! Thou art the creator of\r\nthe gods and it was thou who hadst caused them to be created! Through thy\r\ngrace, the gods pass their time in joy and perfect fearlessness!' Having\r\npraised Mahadeva in this manner, the Rishi bowed to him, 'Let not this\r\nabsence of gravity, ridiculous in the extreme, that I displayed, O god,\r\ndestroy my ascetic merit! I pray to thee for this!' The god, with a\r\ncheerful heart, once more said unto him 'Let thy asceticism increase a\r\nthousandfold, O Brahmana, through my grace! I shall also always dwell\r\nwith thee in this asylum! For the man that will worship me in the tirtha\r\nSapta-Saraswat there will be nothing unattainable here or hereafter.\r\nWithout doubt, such a one shall go to the region called Saraswat (in\r\nheaven) after death!' Even this is the history of Mankanaka of abundant\r\nenergy. He was a son begotten by the god of wind upon (the lady) Sukanya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Having passed one night more, Rama, having the\r\nplough for his weapon, worshipped the dwellers of that tirtha and showed\r\nhis regard for Mankanaka. Having given wealth unto the Brahmanas, and\r\npassed the night there, the hero having the plough for his weapon was\r\nworshipped by the Munis. Rising up in the morning, he took leave of all\r\nthe ascetics, and having touched the sacred water, O Bharata, set out\r\nquickly for other tirthas. Baladeva then went to the tirtha known by the\r\nname of Usanas. It is also called Kapalamochana. Formerly, Rama (the son\r\nof Dasaratha) slew a Rakshasa and hurled his head to a great distance.\r\nThat head, O king, fell upon the thigh of a great sage named Mahodara and\r\nstruck to it. Bathing in this tirtha, the great Rishi became freed from\r\nthe burthen. The high-souled Kavi (Sukra) had performed his ascetic\r\npenances there. It was there that the whole science of politics and\r\nmorals (that goes by Sukra's name) appeared to him by inward light. While\r\nresiding there, Sukra meditated upon the war of the Daityas and the\r\nDanavas (with the gods). Arrived at that foremost of tirthas, Baladeva, O\r\nking, duly made presents unto the high-souled Brahmanas.'\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why is it called Kapalamochana, where the great Muni\r\nbecame freed (from the Rakshasa's head)? For what reason and how did that\r\nhead stick unto him?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Formerly, O tiger among kings, the high-souled Rama\r\n(the son of Dasaratha) lived (for some time) in the forest of Dandaka,\r\nfrom desire of slaying the Rakshasas. At Janasthana he cut off the head\r\nof a wicked-souled Rakshasa with a razor-headed shaft of great sharpness.\r\nThat head fell in the deep forest. That head, coursing at will (through\r\nthe welkin) fell upon the thigh of Mahodara while the latter was\r\nwandering through the woods. Piercing his thigh, O king, it struck to it\r\nand remained there. In consequence of that head thus sticking to his\r\nthigh, the Brahmana (Mahodara) of great wisdom could not (with ease)\r\nproceed to tirthas and other sacred spots. Afflicted with great pain and\r\nwith putrid matter flowing from his thigh, he went to all the tirthas of\r\nthe Earth (one after another), as heard by us. He went to all the rivers\r\nand to the ocean also. (Not finding any relief) the great ascetic spoke\r\nof his sufferings to many Rishis of cleansed souls about his having\r\nbathed in all the tirthas without having found the relief he sought. That\r\nforemost of Brahmanas then heard from those sages words of high import\r\nabout this foremost of tirthas situate on the Sarasvati, and known by the\r\nname of Usanasa, which was represented as competent to cleanse from every\r\nsin and as an excellent spot for attaining to (ascetic) success. That\r\nBrahmana, then, repairing to that Usanasa tirtha, bathed in its waters.\r\nUpon this, the Rakshasa's head, leaving the thigh, fell into the water.\r\nFreed from that (dead) head, the Rishi felt great happiness. As regards\r\nthe head itself, it was lost in the waters. Mahodara then, O king, freed\r\nfrom the Rakshasa's head, cheerfully returned, with cleansed soul and all\r\nhis sins washed away, to his asylum after achieving success. The great\r\nascetic thus freed, after returning to his sacred asylum, spoke of what\r\nhad happened to those Rishis of cleansed souls. The assembled Rishis,\r\nhaving heard his words, bestowed the name of Kapalamochana on the tirtha.\r\nThe great Rishi Mahodara, repairing once more to that foremost of\r\ntirthas, drank its water and attained to great ascetic success. He of\r\nMadhu's race, having given away much wealth unto the Brahmanas and\r\nworshipped them, then proceeded to the asylum of Rushangu. There, O\r\nBharata, Arshtishena had in former days undergone the austerest of\r\npenances. There the great Muni Vishvamitra (who had before been a\r\nKshatriya) became a Brahmana. That great asylum is capable of granting\r\nthe fruition of every wish. It is always, O lord, the abode of Munis and\r\nBrahmanas. Baladeva of great beauty, surrounded by Brahmanas, then went\r\nto that spot, O monarch, where Rushangu had, in former days, cast off his\r\nbody. Rushangu, O Bharata, was an old Brahmana, who was always devoted to\r\nascetic penances. Resolved to cast off his body, he reflected for a long\r\nwhile. Endued with great ascetic merit, he then summoned all his sons and\r\ntold them to take him to a spot where water was abundant. Those ascetics,\r\nknowing their sire had become very old, took that ascetic to a tirtha on\r\nthe Sarasvati. Brought by his sons to the sacred Sarasvati containing\r\nhundreds of tirthas and on whose banks dwelt Rishis unconnected with the\r\nworld, that intelligent ascetic of austere penance bathed in that tirtha\r\naccording to due rites, and that foremost of Rishis conversant with the\r\nmerits of tirthas, then cheerfully said, O tiger among men, unto all his\r\nsons, who were dutifully waiting upon him, these words, 'He that would\r\ncast off his body on the northern bank of the Sarasvati containing much\r\nwater, while employed in mentally reciting sacred mantras, would never\r\nagain be afflicted with death!' The righteoussouled Baladeva, touching\r\nthe water of that tirtha and bathing in it, gave considerable wealth unto\r\nthe Brahmanas, being devoted to them. Possessed of great might and great\r\nprowess Baladeva then proceeded to that tirtha where the adorable\r\nGrandsire had created the mountains called Lokaloka, where that foremost\r\nof Rishis, Arshtishena of rigid vows, O thou of Kuru's race, had by\r\naustere penances acquired the status of Brahmanhood, where the royal sage\r\nSindhudwipa, and the great ascetic Devapi, and the adorable and\r\nillustrious Muni Vishvamitra of austere penances and fierce energy, had\r\nall acquired a similar status.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why did the adorable Arshtishena undergo the austerest\r\nof penances? How also did Sindhudwipa acquire the status of a Brahmana?\r\nHow also did Devapi, O Brahmana, and how Vishvamitra, O best of men,\r\nacquire the same status? Tell me all this, O adorable one! Great is my\r\ncuriosity to listen to all these.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Formerly, in the Krita age, O king, there was a\r\nforemost of regenerate persons called Arshtishena. Residing in his\r\npreceptor's house, he attended to his lessons every day. Although, O\r\nking, he resided long in the abode of his preceptor, he could not still\r\nacquire the mastery of any branch of knowledge or of the Vedas. O\r\nmonarch! In great disappointment, O king, the great ascetic performed\r\nvery austere penances. By his penances he then acquired the mastery of\r\nthe Vedas, to which there is nothing superior. Acquiring great learning\r\nand a mastery of the Vedas, that foremost of Rishis became crowned with\r\nsuccess in that tirtha. He then bestowed three boons on that place. (He\r\nsaid), 'From this day, a person, by bathing in this tirtha of the great\r\nriver (Sarasvati), shall obtain the great fruit of a horse sacrifice!\r\nFrom this day there will be no fear in this tirtha from snakes and wild\r\nbeasts! By small exertions, again, one shall attain to great result\r\nhere!' Having said these words, that Muni of great energy proceeded to\r\nheaven. Even thus the adorable Arshtishena of great energy became crowned\r\nwith success. In that very tirtha in the Krita age, Sindhudwipa of great\r\nenergy, and Devapi also, O monarch, had acquired the high status of\r\nBrahmanhood. Similarly Kusika's son, devoted to ascetic penances and with\r\nhis senses under control, acquired the status of Brahmanhood by\r\npractising well-directed austerities. There was a great Kshatriya,\r\ncelebrated over the world, known by the name of Gadhi. He had a son born\r\nto him, of the name of Vishvamitra of great prowess. King Kausika became\r\na great ascetic. Possessed of great ascetic merit, he wished to install\r\nhis son Vishvamitra on his throne, himself having resolved to cast off\r\nhis body. His subjects, bowing unto him, said, 'Thou shouldst not go\r\naway, O thou of great wisdom, but do thou protect us from a great fear!'\r\nThus addressed, Gadhi replied unto his subjects, saying, 'My son will\r\nbecome the protector of the wide universe!' Having said these words, and\r\nplaced Vishvamitra (on the throne), Gadhi, O king, went to heaven, and\r\nVishvamitra became king. He could not, however, protect the earth with\r\neven his best exertions. The king then heard of the existence of a great\r\nfear of Rakshasas (in his kingdom). With his four kinds of forces, he\r\nwent out of his capital. Having proceeded far on his way, he reached the\r\nasylum of Vasishtha. His troops, O king, caused much mischief there. The\r\nadorable Brahmana Vasishtha, when he came to his asylum, saw the\r\nextensive woods in course of destruction. That best of Rishis, Vasishtha,\r\nO king, became angry, O monarch, with Vishvamitra. He commanded his own\r\n(homa) cow, saying, 'Create a number of terrible Savaras!' Thus\r\naddressed, the cow created a swarm of men of frightful visages. These\r\nencountered the army of Vishvamitra and began to cause a great carnage\r\neverywhere. Seeing this, his troops fled away. Vishvamitra, the son of\r\nGadhi, however, regarding ascetic austerities highly efficacious, set his\r\nheart upon them. In this foremost of tirthas of the Sarasvati, O king, he\r\nbegan to emaciate his own body by means of vows and fasts with fixed\r\nresolve. He made water and air and (the fallen) leaves of trees his food.\r\nHe slept on the bare ground, and observed other vows (enjoined for\r\nascetics). The gods made repeated attempts for impeding him in the\r\nobservance of his vows. His heart, however, never swerved from the vows\r\n(he had proposed to himself). Then, having practised diverse kinds of\r\nausterities with great devotion, the son of Gadhi became like the Sun\r\nhimself in effulgence. The boon-giving Grandsire, of great energy,\r\nresolved to grant Vishvamitra, when he had become endued with ascetic\r\nmerit, the boon the latter desired. The boon that Vishvamitra solicited\r\nwas that he should be permitted to become a Brahmana. Brahma the\r\nGrandsire of all the worlds, said unto him, 'So be it.' Having by his\r\naustere penances acquired the status of Brahmanhood, the illustrious\r\nVishvamitra, after the attainment of his wish, wandered over the whole\r\nEarth like a celestial. Giving away diverse kinds of wealth in that\r\nforemost of tirthas, Rama also cheerfully gave away milch cows and\r\nvehicles and beds, ornaments, and food and drink of the best kinds, O\r\nking, unto many foremost of Brahmanas, after having worshipped them duly.\r\nThen, O king, Rama proceeded to the asylum of Vaka which was not very\r\ndistant from where he was, that asylum in which, as heard by us, Dalvya\r\nVaka had practised the austerest of penances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"The delighter of the Yadus then proceeded to the\r\nasylum (of Vaka) which resounded with the chanting of the Vedas. There\r\nthe great ascetic, O king, named Dalvyavaka poured the kingdom of\r\nDhritarashtra, the son of Vichitravirya, as a libation (on the\r\nsacrificial fire). By practising very austere penances he emaciated his\r\nown body. Endued with great energy, the virtuous Rishi, filled with great\r\nwrath, (did that act). In former times, the Rishis residing in the\r\nNaimisha forest had performed a sacrifice extending for twelve years. In\r\ncourse of that sacrifice, after a particular one called Viswajit had been\r\ncompleted, the Rishis set out for the country of the Pancalas. Arrived\r\nthere, they solicited the king for giving them one and twenty strong and\r\nhealthy calves to be given away as Dakshina (in the sacrifice they have\r\ncompleted). Dalvya Vaka, however, (calling those Rishis), said unto them,\r\n'Do you divide those animals (of mine) among you! Giving away these (unto\r\nyou), I shall solicit a great king (for some).' Having said so unto all\r\nthose Rishis, Vaka of great energy, that best of Brahmanas, then\r\nproceeded to the abode of Dhritarashtra. Arrived at the presence of king\r\nDhritarashtra, Dalvya begged some animals of him. That best of kings,\r\nhowever, seeing that some of his kine died without any cause, angrily\r\nsaid unto him. 'Wretch of a Brahmana, take, if thou likest, these animals\r\nthat (are dead)!' Hearing these words, the Rishi, conversant with duties,\r\nthought, 'Alas, cruel are the words that have been addressed to me in the\r\nassembly!' Having reflected in this strain, that best of Brahmanas,\r\nfilled with wrath, set his heart upon the destruction of king\r\nDhritarashtra. Cutting the flesh from off the dead animals, that best of\r\nsages, having ignited a (sacrificial) fire on the tirtha of the\r\nSarasvati, poured those pieces as libations for the destruction of king\r\nDhritarashtra's kingdom. Observant of rigid vows, the great Dalvya Vaka,\r\nO monarch, poured Dhritarashtra's kingdom as a libation on the fire, with\r\nthe aid of those pieces of meat. Upon the commencement of that fierce\r\nsacrifice according to due rites, the kingdom of Dhritarashtra, O\r\nmonarch, began to waste away. Indeed, O lord, the kingdom of that monarch\r\nbegan to waste away, even as a large forest begins to disappear when men\r\nproceed to cut it down with the axe. Overtaken by calamities, the kingdom\r\nbegan to lose its prosperity and life. Seeing his kingdom thus afflicted,\r\nthe puissant monarch, O king, became very cheerless and thoughtful.\r\nConsulting with the Brahmanas, he began to make great endeavours for\r\nfreeing his territories (from affliction). No good, however, came of his\r\nefforts, for the kingdom continued to waste away. The king became very\r\ncheerless. The Brahmanas also, O sinless one, became filled with grief.\r\nWhen at last the king failed to save his kingdom, he asked his\r\ncounsellors. O Janamejaya, (about the remedy). The counsellors reminded\r\nhim of the evil he had done in connection with the dead kine. And they\r\nsaid, 'The sage Vaka is pouring thy kingdom as a libation on the fire\r\nwith the aid of the flesh (of those animals). Thence is this great waste\r\nof thy kingdom! This is the consequence of ascetic rites. Thence is this\r\ngreat calamity! Go, O king, and gratify that Rishi by the side of a\r\nreceptacle of water on the bank of the Sarasvati!' Repairing to the bank\r\nof the Sarasvati, the king falling at his feet and touching them with his\r\nhead, joined his hands and said, O thou of Bharata's race, these words,\r\n'I gratify thee, O adorable one, forgive my offence. I am a senseless\r\nfool, a wretch inspired with avarice. Thou art my refuge, thou art my\r\nprotector, it behoveth thee to show me thy grace!' Beholding him thus\r\noverwhelmed with grief and indulging in lamentations like these, Vaka\r\nfelt compassion for him and freed his kingdom. The Rishi became gratified\r\nwith him, having dismissed his angry feelings. For freeing his kingdom,\r\nthe sage again poured libations on the fire. Having freed the kingdom\r\n(from calamities) and taken many animals in grief, he became pleased at\r\nheart and once more proceeded to the Naimisha woods. The liberal-minded\r\nking Dhritarashtra also, of righteous soul, with a cheerful heart,\r\nreturned to his own capital full of prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"In that tirtha, Brihaspati also, of great intelligence, for the\r\ndestruction of the Asuras and the prosperity of the denizens of heaven,\r\npoured libations on the sacrificial fire, with the aid of flesh. Upon\r\nthis, the Asuras began to waste away and were destroyed by the gods,\r\ninspired by desire of victory in battle. Having with due rites given unto\r\nthe Brahmanas steeds and elephants and vehicles with mules yoked unto\r\nthem and jewels of great value and much wealth, and much corn, the\r\nillustrious and mighty-armed Rama then proceeded, O king, to the tirtha\r\ncalled Yayata. There, O monarch, at the sacrifice of the high-souled\r\nYayati, the son of Nahusha, the Sarasvati produced milk and clarified\r\nbutter. That tiger among men, king Yayati, having performed a sacrifice\r\nthere, went cheerfully to heaven and obtained many regions of\r\nblessedness. Once again, O lord, king Yayati performed a sacrifice there.\r\nBeholding his great magnanimity of soul and his immutable devotion to\r\nherself, the river Sarasvati gave unto the Brahamanas (invited to that\r\nsacrifice) everything for which each of them cherished only a wish in his\r\nheart. That foremost of rivers gave unto each where he was, amongst those\r\nthat were invited to the sacrifice, houses and beds and food of the six\r\ndifferent kinds of taste, and diverse other kinds of things. The\r\nBrahmanas regarded those valuable gifts as made to them by the king.\r\nCheerfully they praised the monarch and bestowed their auspicious\r\nblessings upon him. The gods and the Gandharvas were all pleased with the\r\nprofusion of articles in that sacrifice. As regards human beings, they\r\nwere filled with wonder at sight of that profusion. The illustrious\r\nBaladeva, of soul subdued and restrained and cleansed, having the palmyra\r\non his banner, distinguished by great righteousness, and ever giving away\r\nthe most valuable things, then proceeded to that tirtha of fierce current\r\ncalled Vasishthapavaha.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why is the current of (the tirtha known by the name of)\r\nVasishthapavaha so rapid? For what reason did the foremost of rivers bear\r\naway Vasishtha? What, O lord, was the cause of the dispute between\r\nVasishtha and Vishvamitra? Questioned by me, O thou of great wisdom, tell\r\nme all this! I am never satiated with hearing thee!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"A great enmity arose between Vishvamitra and\r\nVasishtha, O Bharata, due to their rivalry in respect of ascetic\r\nausterities. The high abode of Vasishtha was in the tirtha called Sthanu\r\non the eastern bank of the Sarasvati. On the opposite bank was the asylum\r\nof the intelligent Vishvamitra. There, in that tirtha, O monarch, Sthanu\r\n(Mahadeva) had practised the austerest penances. Sages still speak of\r\nthose fierce feats. Having performed a sacrifice there and worshipped the\r\nriver Sarasvati, Sthanu established that tirtha there. Hence it is known\r\nby the name Sthanu-tirtha, O lord. In that tirtha, the celestials had, in\r\ndays of yore, O king, installed Skanda, that slayer of the enemies of the\r\ngods, in the supreme command of their army. Unto that tirtha of the\r\nSarasvati, the great Rishi Vishvamitra, by the aid of his austere\r\npenances, brought Vasishtha. Listen to that history. The two ascetics\r\nVishvamitra and Vasishtha, O Bharata, every day challenged each other\r\nvery earnestly in respect of the superiority of their penances. The great\r\nMuni Vishvamitra, burning (with jealousy) at sight of the energy of\r\nVasishtha, began to reflect on the matter. Though devoted to the\r\nperformance of his duties, this, however, is the resolution, O Bharata,\r\nthat he formed: 'This Sarasvati shall quickly bring, by force of her\r\ncurrent, that foremost of ascetics, Vasishtha, to my presence. After he\r\nshall have been brought hither, I shall, without doubt, slay that\r\nforemost of regenerate ones.' Having settled this, the illustrious and\r\ngreat Rishi Vishvamitra with eyes red in wrath, thought of that foremost\r\nof rivers. Thus remembered by the ascetic, she became exceedingly\r\nagitated. The fair lady, however, repaired to that Rishi of great energy\r\nand great wrath. Pale and trembling, Sarasvati, with joined hands\r\nappeared before that foremost of sages. Indeed, the lady was much\r\nafflicted with grief, even like a woman who has lost her mighty lord. And\r\nshe said unto that best of sages, 'Tell me what is there that I shall do\r\nfor thee.' Filled with rage, the ascetic said unto her, 'Bring hither\r\nVasishtha without delay, so that I may slay him.' Hearing these words the\r\nriver became agitated. With joined hands the lotus-eyed lady began to\r\ntremble exceedingly in fear like a creeper shaken by the wind. Beholding\r\nthe great river in that plight, the ascetic said unto her, 'Without any\r\nscruple, bring Vasishtha unto my presence!' Hearing these words of his,\r\nand knowing the evil he intended to do, and acquainted also with the\r\nprowess of Vasishtha that was unrivalled on earth, she repaired to\r\nVasishtha and informed him of what the intelligent Vishvamitra had said\r\nunto her. Fearing the curse of both, she trembled repeatedly. Indeed, her\r\nheart was on the grievous curse (that either of them might pronounce on\r\nher). She stood in terror of both. Seeing her pale and plunged in\r\nanxiety, the righteous-souled Vasishtha, that foremost of men, O king,\r\nsaid these words unto her.\r\n\r\n\"Vasishtha said, 'O foremost of rivers, save thyself! O thou of rapid\r\ncurrent, bear me away, otherwise Vishvamitra will curse thee. Do not feel\r\nany scruple.' Hearing these words of that compassionate Rishi, the river\r\nbegan to think, O Kauravya, as to what course would be best for her to\r\nfollow. Even these were the thoughts that arose in her mind: 'Vasishtha\r\nshoweth great compassion for me. It is proper for me that I should serve\r\nhim.' Beholding then that best of Rishis, (Vasishtha) engaged in silent\r\nrecitation (of mantras) on her bank, and seeing Kusika's son\r\n(Vishvamitra) also engaged in homa, Sarasvati thought, 'Even this is my\r\nopportunity.' Then that foremost of rivers, by her current, washed away\r\none of her banks. In washing away that bank, she bore Vasishtha away.\r\nWhile being borne away, O king, Vasishtha praised the river in these\r\nwords: 'From the Grandsire's (manasa) lake thou hast taken thy rise, O\r\nSarasvati! This whole universe is filled with thy excellent waters!\r\nWending through the firmament, O goddess, thou impartest thy waters to\r\nthe clouds! All the waters are thee! Through thee we exercise our\r\nthinking faculties! Thou art Pushti and Dyuti, Kirti, and Siddhi and Uma!\r\nThou art Speech, and thou art Svaha! This whole universe is dependent on\r\nthee! It is thou that dwellest in all creatures, in four forms!' Thus\r\npraised by that great Rishi, Sarasvati, O king, speedily bore that\r\nBrahmana towards the asylum of Vishvamitra and repeatedly represented\r\nunto the latter the arrival of the former. Beholding Vasishtha thus\r\nbrought before him by Sarasvati, Vishvamitra, filled with rage, began to\r\nlook for a weapon wherewith to slay that brahmana. Seeing him filled with\r\nwrath, the river from fear of (witnessing and aiding in) a brahmana's\r\nslaughter, quickly bore Vasishtha away to her eastern bank once more. She\r\nthus obeyed the words of both, although she deceived the son of Gadhi by\r\nher act. Seeing that best of Rishis, Vasishtha, borne away, the\r\nvindictive Vishvamitra, filled with wrath, addressed Sarasvati. saying,\r\n'Since, O foremost of rivers, thou hast gone away, having deceived me,\r\nlet thy current be changed into blood that is acceptable to Rakshasas.'\r\nThen, cursed by the intelligent Vishvamitra, Sarasvati flowed for a whole\r\nyear, bearing blood mixed with water. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the\r\nApsaras, beholding the Sarasvati reduced to that plight, became filled\r\nwith great sorrow. For this reason, O king, the tirtha came to be called\r\nVasishthapravaha on earth. The foremost of rivers, however, once more got\r\nback her own proper condition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Cursed by the intelligent Vishvamitra in anger,\r\nSarasvati, in that auspicious and best of tirthas, flowed, bearing blood\r\nin her current. Then, O king, many Rakshasas came, O Bharata, and lived\r\nhappily there, drinking the blood that flowed. Exceedingly gratified with\r\nthat blood, cheerfully and without anxiety of any kind, they danced and\r\nlaughed there like persons that have (by merit) attained to heaven. After\r\nsome time had passed away, some Rishis, possessed of wealth of\r\nasceticism, came to the Sarasvati, O king, on a sojourn to her tirthas.\r\nThose foremost of Munis, having bathed in all the tirthas and obtained\r\ngreat happiness, became desirous of acquiring more merit. Those learned\r\npersons at last came, O king, to that tirtha where the Sarasvati ran a\r\nbloody current. Those highly blessed ones, arriving at that frightful\r\ntirtha, saw the water of the Sarasvati mixed with blood and that\r\ninnumerable Rakshasas, O monarch, were drinking it. Beholding those\r\nRakshasas, O king, those ascetics of rigid vows made great endeavours for\r\nrescuing the Sarasvati from that plight. Those blessed ones of high vows,\r\narrived there, invoked that foremost of rivers and said these words unto\r\nher, 'Tell us the reason, O auspicious lady, why this lake in thee hath\r\nbeen afflicted with such distress Hearing it, we shall endeavour (to\r\nrestore it to its proper condition).' Thus questioned, Sarasvati,\r\ntrembling as she spoke, informed them of everything that had occurred.\r\nSeeing her afflicted with woe, those ascetics said, 'We have heard the\r\nreason. We have heard of thy curse, O sinless lady! All of us shall exert\r\nourselves!' Having said these words unto that foremost of rivers, they\r\nthen consulted with one another thus, 'All of us shall emancipate\r\nSarasvati from her curse.' Then all those Brahmanas, O king, worshipping\r\nMahadeva, that lord of the universe and protector of all creatures, with\r\npenance and vows and fasts and diverse kinds of abstinences and painful\r\nobservances, emancipated that foremost of rivers, the divine Sarasvati.\r\nBeholding the water of Sarasvati purified by those Munis, the Rakshasas\r\n(that had taken up their abode there), afflicted with hunger, sought the\r\nprotection of those Munis themselves. Afflicted with hunger, the\r\nRakshasas, with joined hands, repeatedly said unto those ascetics filled\r\nwith compassion, these words, 'All of us are hungry! We have swerved from\r\neternal virtue! That we are sinful in behaviour is not of our free will!\r\nThrough the absence of your, grace and through our own evil acts, as also\r\nthrough the sexual sins of our women, our demerits increase and we have\r\nbecome Brahma-Rakshasas! So amongst Vaisyas and Sudras, and Kshatriyas,\r\nthose that hate and injure Brahmanas became Rakshasas. Ye best of\r\nBrahmanas, make arrangements then for our relief! Ye are competent to\r\nrelieve all the worlds!' Hearing these words of theirs, those ascetics\r\npraised the great river. For the rescue of those Rakshasas, with rapt\r\nminds those ascetics said, 'The food over which one sneezed, that in\r\nwhich there are worms and insects, that which may be mixed with any\r\nleavings of dishes, that which is mixed with hair, that which is mixed\r\nwith tears, that which is trodden upon shall form the portion of these\r\nRakshasas! The learned man, knowing all this, shall carefully avoid these\r\nkinds of food. He that shall take such food shall be regarded as eating\r\nthe food of Rakshasas!' Having purified the tirtha in this way, those\r\nascetics thus solicited that river for the relief of those Rakshasas.\r\nUnderstanding the views of those great Rishis, that foremost of rivers\r\ncaused her body, O bull among men, to assume a new shape called Aruna.\r\nBathing in that new river (a branch of the Sarasvati) the Rakshasas cast\r\noff their bodies and went to heaven. Ascertaining all this, the chief of\r\nthe celestials, (Indra of a hundred sacrifices), bathed in that foremost\r\nof tirthas and became cleansed of a grievous sin.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"For what reason was Indra tainted with the sin of\r\nBrahmanicide? How also did he become cleansed by bathing in that tirtha?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Listen to that history, O ruler of men! Hear of\r\nthose occurrences as they happened! Hear how Vasava, in days of yore,\r\nbroke his treaty with Namuchi! The Asura Namuchi, from fear of Vasava,\r\nhad entered a ray of the Sun. Indra then made friends with Namuchi and\r\nentered into a covenant with him, saying, 'O foremost of Asuras, I shall\r\nnot slay thee, O friend, with anything that is wet or with anything that\r\nis dry! I shall not slay thee in the night or in the day! I swear this to\r\nthee by truth. Having made this covenant, the lord Indra one day beheld a\r\nfog. He then, O king, cut off Namuchi's head, using the foam of water (as\r\nhis weapon). The severed head of Namuchi thereupon pursued Indra from\r\nbehind, saying unto him from a near point these words, 'O slayer of a\r\nfriend, O wretch!' Urged on incessantly by that head, Indra repaired to\r\nthe Grandsire and informed him, in grief, of what had occurred. The\r\nSupreme Lord of the universe said unto him, 'Performing a sacrifice,\r\nbathe with due rites, O chief of the celestials, in Aruna, that tirtha\r\nwhich saveth from the fear of sin! The water of that river, O Shakra,\r\nhath been made sacred by the Munis! Formerly the presence of that river\r\nat its site was concealed. The divine Sarasvati repaired to the Aruna,\r\nand flooded it with her waters. This confluence of Sarasvati and Aruna is\r\nhighly sacred! Thither, O chief of the celestials, perform a sacrifice!\r\nGive away gifts in profusion! Performing thy ablutions there, thou shall\r\nbe freed from thy sin.' Thus addressed, Shakra, at these words of Brahma,\r\nO Janamejaya, performed in that abode of Sarasvati diverse sacrifices.\r\nGiving away many gifts and bathing in that tirtha, he of a hundred\r\nsacrifices, the piercer of Vala, duly performed certain sacrifices and\r\nthen plunged in the Aruna. He became freed from the sin arising out of\r\nthe slaughter of a Brahmana. The lord of heaven then returned to heaven\r\nwith a joyful heart. The head of Namuchi also fell into that stream, O\r\nBharata, and the Asura obtained many eternal regions, O best of kings,\r\nthat granted every wish.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"The high-souled Baladeva having bathed in that\r\ntirtha and given away many kinds of gifts, obtained great merit. Of\r\nrighteous deeds, he then proceeded to the great tirtha of Soma. There, in\r\ndays of yore, Soma himself, O king of kings, had performed the Rajasuya\r\nsacrifice. The high-souled Atri, that foremost of Brahmanas, gifted with\r\ngreat intelligence became the Hotri in that grand sacrifice. Upon the\r\nconclusion of that sacrifice, a great battle took place between the gods\r\n(on the one side) and the Danavas, the Daityas, and the Rakshasas (on the\r\nother). That fierce battle is known after the name of (the Asura) Taraka.\r\nIn that battle Skanda slew Taraka. There, on that occasion, Mahasena\r\n(Skanda), that destroyer of Daityas, obtained the command of the\r\ncelestial forces. In that tirtha is a gigantic Aswattha tree. Under its\r\nshade, Kartikeya, otherwise called Kumara, always resides in person.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Thou hast described the merits of the Sarasvati, O best\r\nof Brahmanas! It behoveth thee, O regenerate one, to describe to me the\r\ninvestiture of Kumara (by the gods). Great is the curiosity I feel. Tell\r\nme everything, therefore, about the time when and the place where and the\r\nmanner in which the adorable and puissant lord Skanda was invested (with\r\nthe command of the celestial forces). Tell me also, O foremost of\r\nspeakers, who they were that invested him and who performed the actual\r\nrites, and how the celestial generalissimo made a great carnage of the\r\nDaityas!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"This curiosity that thou feelest is worthy of thy\r\nbirth in Kuru's race. The words that I shall speak, will, O Janamejaya,\r\nbe conducive to thy pleasure. I shall narrate to thee the story of the\r\ninvestiture of Kumara and the prowess of that high-souled one, since, O\r\nruler of men thou wishest to hear it! In days of yore the vital seed of\r\nMaheshvara coming out, fell into a blazing fire. The consumer of\r\neverything, the adorable Agni, could not burn that indestructible seed.\r\nOn the other hand, the bearer of sacrificial libations, in consequence of\r\nthat seed, became possessed of great energy and splendour. He could not\r\nbear within himself that, seed of mighty energy. At the command of\r\nBrahman, the lord Agni, approaching (the river) Ganga, threw into her\r\nthat divine seed possessed of the effulgence of the Sun. Ganga also,\r\nunable to hold it, cast it on the beautiful breast of Himavat that is\r\nworshipped by the celestials. Thereupon Agni's son began to grow there,\r\noverwhelming all the worlds by his energy. Meanwhile (the six) Krittikas\r\nbeheld that child of fiery splendour. Seeing that puissant lord, that\r\nhigh-souled son of Agni, lying on a clump of heath, all the six\r\nKrittikas, who were desirous of a son, cried aloud, saying, \"This child\r\nis mine, this child is mine!\" Understanding the state of mind of those\r\nsix mothers, the adorable lord Skanda sucked the breasts of all having\r\nassumed six mouths. Beholding that puissance of the child, the Krittikas,\r\nthose goddesses of beautiful forms, became filled with wonder. And since\r\nthe adorable child had been cast by the river Ganga upon the summit of\r\nHimavat, that mountain looked beautiful, having, O delighter of the\r\nKurus, been transformed into gold! With that growing child the whole\r\nEarth became beautiful, and it was for this reason that mountains (from\r\nthat time) came to be producers of gold. Possessed of great energy, the\r\nchild came to be called by the name of Kartikeya. At first he had been\r\ncalled by the name of Gangeya. He became possessed of high ascetic\r\npowers. Endued with self-restraint and asceticism and great energy, the\r\nchild grew up, O monarch, into a person of highly agreeable features like\r\nSoma himself. Possessed of great beauty, the child lay on that excellent\r\nand golden clump of heath, adored and praised by Gandharvas and ascetics.\r\nCelestial girls, by thousands, conversant with celestial music and dance,\r\nand of very beautiful features, praised him and danced before him. The\r\nforemost of all rivers, Ganga, waited upon that god. The Earth also,\r\nassuming great beauty, held the child (on her lap). The celestial priest\r\nBrihaspati performed the usual rites after birth, in respect of that\r\nchild. The Vedas assuming a four-fold form, approached the child with\r\njoined hands. The Science of arms, with its four divisions, and all the\r\nweapons as also all kinds of arrows, came to him. One day, the child, of\r\ngreat energy, saw that god of gods, the lord of Uma, seated with the\r\ndaughter of Himavat, amid a swarm of ghostly creatures. Those ghostly\r\ncreatures, of emaciated bodies, were of wonderful features. They were\r\nugly and of ugly features, and wore awkward ornaments and marks. Their\r\nfaces were like those of tigers and lions and bears and cats and makaras.\r\nOthers were of faces like those of scorpions; others of faces like those\r\nof elephants and camels and owls. And some had faces like those of\r\nvultures and jackals. And some there were that had faces like those of\r\ncranes and pigeons and Kurus. And many amongst them had bodies like those\r\nof dogs and porcupines and iguanas and goats and sheep and cows. And some\r\nresembled mountains and some oceans, and some stood with uplifted discs\r\nand maces for their weapons. And some looked like masses of antimony and\r\nsome like white mountains. The seven Matris also were present there, O\r\nmonarch, and the Sadhyas, the Viswedevas, the Maruts, the Vasus, the\r\nRudras, the Adityas, the Siddhas, the Danavas, the birds, the self-born\r\nand adorable Brahman with his sons, and Vishnu, and Shakra, all went\r\nthither for beholding that child of unfading glory. And many of the\r\nforemost of celestials and Gandharvas, headed by Narada and many\r\ncelestial Rishis and Siddhas headed by Brihaspati, and the fathers of the\r\nuniverse, those foremost ones, they that are regarded as gods of the\r\ngods, and the Yamas and the Dharmas, all went there. Endued with great\r\nstrength, the child possessed of great ascetic power, proceeded to the\r\npresence of that Lord of the gods, (Mahadeva), armed with trident and\r\nPinaka. Seeing the child coming, the thought entered the mind of Siva, as\r\nit did that of Himavat's daughter and that of Ganga and of Agni, as to\r\nwhom amongst the four the child would first approach for honouring him or\r\nher. Each of them thought, 'He will come to me!' Understanding that this\r\nwas the expectation cherished by each of those four, he had recourse to\r\nhis Yoga powers and assumed at the same time four different forms. Indeed\r\nthe adorable and puissant lord assumed those four forms in an instant.\r\nThe three forms that stood behind were Sakha and Visakha and Naigameya.\r\nThe adorable and puissant one, having divided his self into four forms,\r\n(proceeded towards the four that sat expecting him). The form called\r\nSkanda of wonderful appearance proceeded to the spot where Rudra was\r\nsitting. Visakha went to the spot where the divine daughter of Himavat\r\nwas. The adorable Sakha, which is Kartikeya's Vayu form proceeded towards\r\nAgni. Naigameya, that child of fiery splendour, proceeded to the presence\r\nof Ganga. All those forms, of similar appearance, were endued with great\r\neffulgence. The four forms proceeded calmly to the four gods and\r\ngoddesses (already mentioned). All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. The\r\ngods, the Danavas, and the Rakshasas, made a loud noise at sight of that\r\nexceedingly wonderful incident making the very hair to stand on end. Then\r\nRudra and the goddess Uma and Agni, and Ganga, all bowed unto the\r\nGrandsire, that Lord of the Universe. Having duly bowed unto him, O bull\r\namong kings, they said these words, O monarch, from desire of doing good\r\nunto Kartikeya. 'It behoveth thee, O Lord of the gods, to grant to this\r\nyouth, for the sake of our happiness, some kind of sovereignty that may\r\nbe suitable to him and that he may desire. At this, the adorable\r\nGrandsire of all the worlds, possessed of great intelligence, began to\r\nthink within his mind as to what he should bestow upon that youth. He had\r\nformerly given away unto the formless ones (gods) all kinds of wealth\r\nover which the high-souled celestials, the Gandharvas, the Rakshasas,\r\nghosts, Yakshas, birds, and snakes have dominion. Brahma, therefore,\r\nregarded that youth to be fully entitled to that dominion (which had been\r\nbestowed upon the gods). Having reflected for a moment, the Grandsire,\r\never mindful of the welfare of the gods, bestowed upon him the status of\r\na generalissimo among all creatures, O Bharata! And the Grandsire further\r\nordered all those gods that were regarded as the chief of the celestials\r\nand other formless beings to wait upon him. Then the gods headed by\r\nBrahman, taking that youth with them, together came to Himavat. The spot\r\nthey selected was the bank of the sacred and divine Sarasvati, that\r\nforemost of rivers, taking her rise from Himavat, that Sarasvati which,\r\nat Samanta-panchaka, is celebrated over the three worlds. There, on the\r\nsacred bank, possessing every merit, of the Sarasvati, the gods and the\r\nGandharvas took their seats with hearts well-pleased in consequence of\r\nthe gratification of all their desires.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Collecting all articles as laid down in the\r\nscriptures for the ceremony of investiture, Brihaspati duly poured\r\nlibations on the blazing fire. Himavat gave a seat which was adorned with\r\nmany costly gems. Kartikeya was made to sit on that auspicious and best\r\nof seats decked with excellent gems. The gods brought thither all kinds\r\nof auspicious articles, with due rites and mantras, that were necessary\r\nfor a ceremony of the kind. The diverse gods--Indra and Vishnu, both of\r\ngreat energy, and Surya and Candramas, and Dhatri, and Vidhatri, and\r\nVayu, and Agni, and Pushan, and Bhaga, and Aryaman, and Ansa, and\r\nVivaswat, and Rudra of great intelligence, and Mitra, and the (eleven)\r\nRudras, the (eight) Vasus, the (twelve) Adityas, the (twin) Ashvinis, the\r\nViswedevas, the Maruts, the Saddhyas, the Pitris, the Gandharvas, the\r\nApsaras, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Pannagas, innumerable celestial\r\nRishis, the Vaikhanasas, the Valakhilyas, those others (among Rishis)\r\nthat subsist only on air and those that subsist on the rays of the Sun,\r\nthe descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, many high-souled Yatis, all the\r\nVidyadharas, all those that were crowned with ascetic success, the\r\nGrandsire, Pulastya, Pulaha of great ascetic merits, Angiras, Kasyapa,\r\nAtri, Marichi, Bhrigu, Kratu, Hara, Prachetas, Manu, Daksha, the Seasons,\r\nthe Planets, and all the luminaries; O monarch, all the rivers in their\r\nembodied forms, the eternal Vedas, the Seas, the diverse tirthas, the\r\nEarth, the Sky, the Cardinal and Subsidiary points of the compass, and\r\nall the Trees, O king, Aditi the mother of the gods, Hri, Sri, Swaha,\r\nSarasvati, Uma, Sachi, Sinivali, Anumati, Kuhu, the Day of the new moon,\r\nthe Day of the full Moon, the wives of the denizens of heaven, Himavat,\r\nVindhya, Meru of many summits, Airavat with all his followers, the\r\nDivisions of time called Kala, Kashtha, Fortnight, the Seasons, Night,\r\nand Day, O king, the prince of steeds, Ucchaisravas, Vasuki the king of\r\nthe Snakes, Aruna, Garuda, the Trees, the deciduous herbs, and the\r\nadorable god Dharma--all came there together. And there came also Kala,\r\nYama, Mrityu, and the followers of Yama. From fear of swelling the list I\r\ndo not mention the diverse other gods that came there. All of them came\r\nto that ceremony for investing Kartikeya with the status of\r\ngeneralissimo. All the denizens of heaven, O king, brought there\r\neverything necessary for the ceremony and every auspicious article.\r\nFilled with joy, the denizens of heaven made that high-souled youth, that\r\nterror of the Asuras, the generalissimo of the celestial forces, after\r\npouring upon his head the sacred and excellent water of the Sarasvati\r\nfrom golden jars that contained other sacred articles needed for the\r\npurpose. The Grandsire of the worlds, Brahman, and Kasyapa of great\r\nenergy, and the others (mentioned and) not mentioned, all poured water\r\nupon Skanda even as, O monarch, the gods had poured water on the head of\r\nVaruna, the lord of waters, for investing him with dominion. The lord\r\nBrahman then, with a gratified heart, gave unto Skanda four companions,\r\npossessed of great might, endued with speed like that of the wind,\r\ncrowned with ascetic success, and gifted with energy which they could\r\nincrease at will. They were named Nandisena and Lohitaksha and\r\nGhantakarna and Kumudamalin. The lord Sthanu, O monarch, gave unto Skanda\r\na companion possessed of great impetuosity, capable of producing a\r\nhundred illusions, and endued with might and energy that he could enhance\r\nat will. And he was the great destroyer of Asuras. In the great battle\r\nbetween the gods and the Asuras, this companion that Sthanu gave, filled\r\nwith wrath, slew, with his hands alone, fourteen millions of Daityas of\r\nfierce deeds. The gods then made over to Skanda the celestial host,\r\ninvincible, abounding with celestial troops, capable of destroying the\r\nenemies of the gods, and of forms like that of Vishnu. The gods then,\r\nwith Vasava at their head, and the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the\r\nRakshasas, the Munis, and the Pitris, all shouted, 'Victory (to Skanda)!'\r\nThen Yama gave him two companions, both of whom resembled Death, Unmatha\r\nand Pramatha, possessed of great energy and great splendour. Endued with\r\ngreat prowess, Surya, with a gratified heart, gave unto Kartikeya two of\r\nhis followers named Subhraja and Bhaswara. Soma also gave him two\r\ncompanions, Mani and Sumani, both of whom looked like summits of the\r\nKailasa mountain and always used white garlands and white unguents. Agni\r\ngave unto him two heroic companions, grinders of hostile armies, who were\r\nnamed Jwalajihbha and Jyoti. Ansa gave unto Skanda of great intelligence\r\nfive companions, Parigha, and Vata, and Bhima of terrible strength, and\r\nDahati and Dahana, both of whom were exceedingly fierce and possessed of\r\ngreat energy. Vasava that slayer of hostile heroes, gave unto Agni's son\r\ntwo companions, Utkrosa and Panchaka, who were armed respectively with\r\nthunder-bolt and club. These had in battle slain innumerable enemies of\r\nShakra. The illustrious Vishnu gave unto Skanda three companions, Chakra\r\nand Vikrama and Sankrama of great might.

Besides these, many other\r\nhigh-souled and mighty companions, devoted to ascetic austerities and\r\nregardful of Brahmanas, were given unto him by the Grandsire. Some of\r\nthem were in youth; some were old and some, O Janamejaya, were very young\r\nin years. Thousands upon thousands of such came to Kartikeya. They were\r\npossessed of diverse kinds of faces. Listen to me, O Janamejaya, as I\r\ndescribe them! Some had faces like those of tortoises, and some like\r\nthose of cocks. The faces of some were very long, O Bharata.

Some had\r\nmouths on their stomachs, some on their backs, some on their cheeks, some\r\non their calves, and some on their flanks, and the mouths of many were\r\nplaced on other parts of their bodies. The faces of many amongst those\r\nleaders of troops were like those of insects and worms. The mouths of\r\nmany amongst them were like those of diverse beasts of prey. Some had\r\nmany arms and some many heads. The arms of some resembled trees, and the\r\nheads of some were on their loins. The faces of some were tapering like\r\nthe bodies of snakes. Many amongst them had their abodes on diverse kinds\r\nof plants and herbs. Some were clad in rags, some in diverse kinds of\r\nbones, some were diversely clad, and some were adorned in diverse kinds\r\nof garlands and diverse kinds of unguents. Dressed diversely, some had\r\nskins for their robes. Some had head-gears; the brows of some were\r\nfurrowed into lines; the necks of some bore marks like those on\r\nconchshells, some were possessed of great effulgence. Some had diadems,\r\nsome had five tufts of hair on their heads, and the hair of some was very\r\nhard. Some had two tufts, some three, and some seven. Some had feathers\r\non their heads, some had crowns, some had heads that were perfectly bald,\r\nand some had matted locks. Some were adorned with beautiful garlands, and\r\nthe faces of some were very hairy. Battle was the one thing in which they\r\ntook great delight, and all of them were invincible by even the foremost\r\nones amongst the gods. Many amongst them were clad in diverse kinds of\r\ncelestial robes. All were fond of battle. Some were of dark complexion,\r\nand the faces of some had no flesh on them. Some had very long backs, and\r\nsome had no stomachs. The backs of some were very large while those of\r\nsome were very short. Some had long stomachs and the limbs of some were\r\nlong.

Some were\r\nof symmetrical limbs, possessed of great splendour, and adorned with\r\nornaments. Some had yellow eyes, some had ears like arrows, some had\r\nnoses like gavials. O Bharata! Some had broad teeth, some had broad lips,\r\nand some had green hair. Possessed of diverse kinds of feet and lips and\r\nteeth, they had diverse kinds of arms and heads. Clad in diverse kinds of\r\nskins, they spoke diverse kinds of languages, O Bharata! Skilled in all\r\nprovincial dialects, those puissant ones conversed with one another.\r\nThose mighty companions, filled with joy, gambolled there, cutting capers\r\n(around Kartikeya). Some were long-necked, some longnailed, some\r\nlong-legged. Some amongst them were large-headed and some large-armed.\r\nThe eyes of some were yellow. The throats of some were blue, and the ears\r\nof some were long, O Bharata. The stomachs of some were like masses of\r\nantimony. The eyes of some were white, the necks of some were red, and\r\nsome had eyes of a tawny hue. Many were dark in colour and many, O king,\r\nwere of diverse colours, O Bharata.

Some were of diversified colours and some had\r\ngolden complexions, and some were endued with splendours like those of\r\nthe peacock. I shall describe to thee the weapons that were taken by\r\nthose that came last to Kartikeya. Listen to me. Some had noses on their\r\nuplifted arms. Their faces were like those of tigers and asses. Their\r\neyes were on their backs, their throats were blue, and their arms\r\nresembled spiked clubs. Some were armed with Sataghnis and discs, and\r\nsome had heavy and short clubs. Some had swords and mallets and some were\r\narmed with bludgeons, O Bharata. Some, possessed of gigantic sizes and\r\ngreat strength, were armed with lances and scimitars. Some were armed\r\nwith maces and Bhusundis and some had spears on their hands. Possessed of\r\nhigh souls and great strength and endued with great speed and great\r\nimpetuosity, those mighty companions had diverse kinds of terrible\r\nweapons in their arms. Beholding the installation of Kartikeya, those\r\nbeings of mighty energy, delighting in battle and wearing on their\r\npersons rows of tinkling bells, danced around him in joy. These and many\r\nother mighty companions, O king, came to the high-souled and illustrious\r\nKartikeya. Some belonged to the celestial regions, some to the aerial,\r\nand some to the regions of the Earth. All of them were endued with speed\r\nlike that of the wind. Commanded by the gods, those brave and mighty ones\r\nbecame the companions of Kartikeya. Thousands upon thousands, millions\r\nupon millions, of such beings came there at the installation of the\r\nhigh-souled Kartikeya and stood surrounding him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Listen now to the large bands of the mothers, those\r\nslayers of foes, O hero, that became the companions of Kumara, as I\r\nmention their names. Listen, O Bharata, to the names of those illustrious\r\nmothers. The mobile and immobile universe is pervaded by those auspicious\r\nones.

Their\r\nnails were long, their teeth were large and their lips also, O Bharata,\r\nwere protruding. Of straight forms and sweet features, all of them,\r\nendowed with youth, were decked with ornaments. Possessed of ascetic\r\nmerit, they were capable of assuming any form at will. Having not much\r\nflesh on their limbs, they were of fair complexions and endued with\r\nsplendour like that of gold. Some amongst them were dark and looked like\r\nclouds in hue and some were of the colour of smoke, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace. And some were endued with the splendour of the morning sun and were\r\nhighly blessed. Possessed of long tresses, they were clad in robes of\r\nwhite. The braids of some were tied upwards, and the eyes of some were\r\ntawny, and some had girdles that were very long. Some had long stomachs,\r\nsome had long ears, and some had long breasts. Some had coppery eyes and\r\ncoppery complexion, and the eyes of some were green.\r\n\r\nCapable of granting boons and of travelling at will, they were always\r\ncheerful. Possessed of great strength, some amongst them partook of the\r\nnature of Yama, some of Rudra, some of Soma, some of Kuvera, some of\r\nVaruna, some of Indra, and some of Agni, O scorcher of foes. And some\r\npartook of the nature of Vayu, some of Kumara, some of Brahma, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, and some of Vishnu and some of Surya, and some of Varaha.\r\n\r\nOf charming and delightful features, they were beautiful like the asuras.\r\nIn voice they resembled the kokila and in prosperity they resembled the\r\nLord of Treasures. In battle, their energy resembled that of Shakra. In\r\nsplendour they resembled fire. In battle they always inspired their foes\r\nwith terror. Capable of assuming any form at will, in fleetness they\r\nresembled the very wind. Of inconceivable might and energy, their prowess\r\nalso was inconceivable.\r\n\r\nThey have their abodes on trees and open spots and crossings of four\r\nroads. They live also in caves and crematoriums, mountains and springs.\r\nAdorned with diverse kinds of ornaments, they wear diverse kinds of\r\nattire, and speak diverse languages. These and many other tribes (of the\r\nmothers), all capable of inspiring foes with dread, followed the\r\nhigh-souled Kartikeya at the command of the chief of the celestials.\r\n\r\nThe adorable chastiser of Paka, O tiger among kings, gave unto Guha\r\n(Kartikeya) a dart for the destruction of the enemies of the gods. That\r\ndart produces a loud whiz and is adorned with many large bells. Possessed\r\nof great splendour, it seemed to blaze with light. And Indra also gave\r\nhim a banner effulgent as the morning sun. Shiva gave him a large army,\r\nexceedingly fierce and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, and endued\r\nwith great energy begotten of ascetic penances. Invincible and possessing\r\nall the qualities of a good army, that force was known by the name of\r\ndhananjaya. It was protected by thirty 30,000 warriors each of whom was\r\npossessed of might equal to that of Rudra himself. That force knew not\r\nhow to fly from battle. Vishnu gave him a triumphal garland that enhances\r\nthe might of the wearer. Uma gave him two pieces of cloth of effulgence\r\nlike that of the Sun. With great pleasure Ganga gave unto Kumara a\r\ncelestial water-pot, begotten of amrita, and Brihaspati gave him a sacred\r\nstick. Garuda gave him his favourite son, a peacock of beautiful\r\nfeathers. Aruna gave him a cock of sharp talons. The royal Varuna gave\r\nhim a snake of great energy and might. The lord Brahma gave unto that god\r\ndevoted to Brahman a black deer-skin. And the Creator of all the worlds\r\nalso gave him victory in all battles.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the command of the celestial forces, Skanda looked\r\nresplendent like a blazing fire of bright flames. Accompanied by those\r\ncompanions and the mothers, he proceeded for the destruction of the\r\ndaityas, gladdening all the foremost of the gods. The terrible host of\r\ncelestials, furnished with standards adorned with bells, and equipped\r\nwith drums and conchs and cymbals, and armed with weapons, and decked\r\nwith many banners, looked beautiful like the autumnal firmament\r\nbespangled with planets and stars.\r\n\r\nThen that vast assemblage of celestials and diverse kinds of creatures\r\nbegan cheerfully to beat their drums and blow their conchs numbering\r\nthousands. And they also played on their patahas and jharjharas and\r\nkrikacas and cow-horns and adambaras and gomukhas and dindimas of loud\r\nsound. All the gods, with Vasava at their head, praised Kumara. The\r\ncelestials and the gandharvas sang and the apsaras danced.\r\n\r\nWell-pleased (with these attentions) Skanda granted a boon unto all the\r\ngods, saying, 'I shall slay all your foes,' then, that is, that desire to\r\nslay you. Having obtained this boon from that best of gods, the\r\nillustrious celestials regarded their foes to be already slain. After\r\nSkanda had granted that boon, a loud sound arose from all those creatures\r\ninspired with joy, filling the three worlds.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by that vast host, Skanda then set out for the destruction of\r\nthe daityas and the protection of the denizens of heaven. Exertion, and\r\nVictory, and Righteousness, and Success, and Prosperity, and Courage, and\r\nthe Scriptures (in their embodied forms) proceeded in the van of\r\nKartikeya's army, O king! With that terrible force, which was armed with\r\nlances, mallets, blazing brands, maces, heavy clubs, arrows, darts and\r\nspears, and which was decked with beautiful ornaments and armour, and\r\nwhich uttered roars like those of a proud lion, the divine Guha set out.\r\n\r\nBeholding him, all the daityas, rakshasas and danavas, anxious with fear,\r\nfled away on all sides. Armed with diverse weapons, the celestials\r\npursued them. Seeing (the foe flying away), Skanda, endued with energy\r\nand might, became inflamed with wrath. He repeatedly hurled his terrible\r\nweapon, the dart (he had received from Agni). The energy that he then\r\ndisplayed resembled a fire fed with libations of clarified butter. While\r\nthe dart was repeatedly hurled by Skanda of immeasurable energy, meteoric\r\nflashes, O king, fell upon the Earth. Thunderbolts also, with tremendous\r\nnoise, fell upon the earth. Everything became as frightful O king, as it\r\nbecomes on the day of universal destruction. When that terrible dart was\r\nonce hurled by the son of Agni, millions of darts issued from it, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race.\r\n\r\nThe puissant and adorable Skanda, filled with joy, at last slew Taraka,\r\nthe chief of the daityas, endued with great might and prowess, and\r\nsurrounded (in that battle) by a 100,000 heroic and mighty daityas. He\r\nthen, in that battle, slew Mahisha who was surrounded by eight padmas of\r\ndaityas. He next slew Tripada who was surrounded by a 1,000 ajutas of\r\ndaityas. The puissant Skanda then slew Hradodara, who was surrounded by\r\nten nikharvas of daityas, with all his followers armed with diverse\r\nweapons. Filling the ten points of the compass, the followers of Kumara,\r\nO king, made a loud noise while those daityas were being slain, and\r\ndanced and jumped and laughed in joy.\r\n\r\nThousands of daityas, O king, were burnt with the flames that issued from\r\nSkanda's dart, while others breathed their last, terrified by the roars\r\nof Skanda. The three worlds were frightened at the yawns of Skanda's\r\nsoldiers. The foes were consumed with flames produced by Skanda. Many\r\nwere slain by his roars alone. Some amongst the foes of the gods, struck\r\nwith banners, were slain. Some, frightened by the sounds of bells, fell\r\ndown on the surface of the Earth. Some, mangled with weapons, fell down,\r\ndeprived of life. In this way the heroic and mighty Kartikeya slew\r\ninnumerable foes of the gods possessed of great strength that came to\r\nfight with him.\r\n\r\nThen Bali's son Vana of great might, getting upon the Kraunca mountain,\r\nbattled with the celestial host. Possessed of great intelligence, the\r\ngreat generalissimo Skanda rushed against that foe of the gods. From fear\r\nof Kartikeya, he took shelter within the Kraunca mountain. Inflamed with\r\nrage, the adorable Kartikeya then pierced that mountain with that dart\r\ngiven him by Agni. The mountain was called Kraunca (crane) because of the\r\nsound it always produced resembled the cry of a crane. That mountain was\r\nvariegated with shala trees. The apes and elephants on it were\r\naffrighted. The birds that had their abode on it rose up and wheeled\r\naround in the welkin. The snakes began to dart down its sides. It\r\nresounded also with the cries of leopards and bears in large numbers that\r\nran hither and thither in fear. Other forests on it rang with the cries\r\nof hundreds upon hundreds of animals. Sharabhas and lions suddenly ran\r\nout. In consequence of all this that mountain, though it was reduced to a\r\nvery pitiable plight, still assumed a very beautiful aspect. The\r\nvidyadharas dwelling on its summits soared into the air. The kinnaras\r\nalso became very anxious, distracted by the fear caused by the fall of\r\nSkanda's dart. The daityas then, by hundreds and thousands, came out of\r\nthat blazing mountain, all clad in beautiful ornaments and garlands.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Kumara, prevailing over them in battle, slew them all.\r\nThe adorable Skanda, inflamed with rage, quickly slew the son of daitya\r\nchief (Bali) along with his younger brother, even as Indra had slain\r\nVritra (in days before). The slayer of hostile heroes, Agni's son,\r\npierced with his dart the Kraunca mountain, dividing his own self\r\nsometimes into many and sometimes uniting all his portions into one.\r\nRepeatedly hurled from his hand, the dart repeatedly came back to him.\r\nEven such was the might and glory of the adorable son of Agni. With\r\nredoubled heroism, and energy and fame and success, the god pierced the\r\nmountain and slew hundreds of daityas. The adorable god, having thus\r\nslain the enemies of the celestials, was worshipped and honoured by the\r\nlatter and obtained great joy.\r\n\r\nAfter the Kraunca mountain had been pierced and after the son of Canda\r\nhad been slain, drums were beaten, O king, and conchs were blown. The\r\ncelestial ladies rained floral showers in succession upon that divine\r\nlord of yogis. Auspicious breezes began to blow, bearing celestial\r\nperfumes. The gandharvas hymned his praises, as also great rishis always\r\nengaged in the performance of sacrifices. Some speak of him as the\r\npuissant son of the Grandsire, Sanat-kumara, the eldest of all the sons\r\nof Brahma. Some speak of him as the son of Maheshvara, and some as that\r\nof Agni. Some again describe him as the son of Uma or of the Krittikas or\r\nof Ganga. Hundreds and thousands of people speak of that Lord of yogis of\r\nblazing form and great might, as the son of one of those, or of either of\r\ntwo of those, or of any one of four of those.\r\n\r\nI have thus told thee, O king, everything about the installation of\r\nKartikeya. Listen now to the history of the sacredness of that foremost\r\nof tirthas on the Sarasvati. That foremost of tirthas, O monarch, after\r\nthe enemies of the gods had been slain, became a second heaven. The\r\npuissant son of Agni gave unto each of the foremost ones among the\r\ncelestials diverse kinds of dominion and affluence and at last the\r\nsovereignty of the three worlds. Even thus, O monarch, was that adorable\r\nexterminator of the daityas installed by the gods as their generalissimo.\r\nThat other tirtha, O bull of Bharata's race, where in days of yore Varuna\r\nthe lord of waters had been installed by the celestials, is known by the\r\nname of Taijasa. Having bathed in that tirtha and adored Skanda, Rama\r\ngave unto the brahmanas gold and clothes and ornaments and other things.\r\nPassing one night there, that slayer of hostile heroes, Madhava, praising\r\nthat foremost of tirthas and touching its water, became cheerful and\r\nhappy. I have now told thee everything about which thou hadst enquired,\r\nhow the divine Skanda was installed by the assembled gods!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"This history, O regenerate one, that I have heard from\r\nthee is exceedingly wonderful, this narration, in detail, of the\r\ninstallation, according to due rites, of Skanda. O thou possessed of\r\nwealth of asceticism, I deem myself cleansed by having listened to this\r\naccount. My hair stands on end and my mind hath become cheerful. Having\r\nheard the history of the installation of Kumara and the destruction of\r\nthe Daityas, great hath been my joy. I feel a curiosity, however, in\r\nrespect of another matter. How was the Lord of the waters installed by\r\nthe celestials in that tirtha in days of yore? O best of men, tell me\r\nthat, for thou art possessed of great wisdom and art skilled in\r\nnarration!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Listen, O king, to this wonderful history of what\r\ntranspired truly in a former Kalpa! In days of yore, in the Krita age, O\r\nking, all celestials, duly approaching Varuna, said unto him these words,\r\n'As Shakra, the Lord of the celestials, always protects us from every\r\nfear, similarly be thou the Lord of all the rivers! Thou always residest,\r\nO god, in the Ocean, that home of makaras! This Ocean, the lord of\r\nrivers, will then be under thy dominion! Thou shalt then wax and wane\r\nwith Soma!' (Thus addressed) Varuna answered them, saying, 'Let it be\r\nso!' All the celestials then, assembling together, made Varuna having his\r\nabode in the ocean the Lord of all the waters, according to the rites\r\nlaid down in the scriptures. Having installed Varuna as the Lord of all\r\naquatic creatures and worshipping him duly, the celestials returned to\r\ntheir respective abodes. Installed by the celestials, the illustrious\r\nVaruna began to duly protect seas and lakes and rivers and other\r\nreservoirs of water as Shakra protects the gods. Bathing in that tirtha\r\nalso and giving away diverse kinds of gifts, Baladeva, the slayer of\r\nPralamva, possessed of great wisdom, then proceeded to Agnitirtha, that\r\nspot where the eater of clarified butter, disappearing from the view,\r\nbecame concealed within the entrails of the Sami wood. When the light of\r\nall the worlds thus disappeared, O sinless one, the gods then repaired to\r\nthe Grandsire of the universe. And they said, 'The adorable Agni has\r\ndisappeared. We do not know the reason. Let not all creatures be\r\ndestroyed. Create fire, O puissant Lord!'\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"For what reason did Agni, the Creator of all the\r\nworlds, disappear? How also was he discovered by the gods? Tell me all\r\nthis in detail.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Agni of great energy became very much frightened at\r\nthe curse of Bhrigu. Concealing himself within the entrails of the Sami\r\nwood, that adorable god disappeared from the view. Upon the disappearance\r\nof Agni, all the gods, with Vasava at their head, in great affliction,\r\nsearched for the missing god. Finding Agni then, they saw that god lying\r\nwithin the entrails of the Sami wood. The celestials, O tiger among king,\r\nwith Brihaspati at their head, having succeeded in finding out the god,\r\nbecame very glad with Vasava amongst them. They then returned to the\r\nplaces they had come from. Agni also, from Bhrigu's curse, became an\r\neater of everything, as Bhrigu, that utterer of Brahma, had said. The\r\nintelligent Balarama, having bathed there, then proceeded to Brahmayoni\r\nwhere the adorable Grandsire of all the worlds had exercised his\r\nfunctions of creations. In days of yore, the Lord Brahman, along with all\r\nthe gods, bathed in that tirtha, according to due rites for the\r\ncelestials. Bathing there and giving away diverse kinds of gifts,\r\nValadeva then proceeded to the tirtha called Kauvera where the puissant\r\nAilavila, having practised severe austerities, obtained, O king, the\r\nLordship over all treasures. While he dwelt there (engaged in\r\nausterities), all kinds of wealth, and all the precious gems came to him\r\nof their own accord. Baladeva having repaired to that tirtha and bathed\r\nin its waters duly gave much wealth unto the Brahamanas. Rama beheld at\r\nthat spot the excellent woods of Kuvera. In days of yore, the high-souled\r\nKuvera, the chief of the Yakshas, having practised the severest\r\nausterities there, obtained many boons. There were the lordship of all\r\ntreasures, the friendship of Rudra possessed of immeasurable energy, the\r\nstatus of a god, the regency over a particular point of the compass (the\r\nnorth), and a son named Nakakuvera. These the chief of the Yakshas\r\nspeedily obtained there, O thou of mighty arms! The Maruts, coming there,\r\ninstalled him duly (in his sovereignty). He also obtained for a vehicle a\r\nwell-equipped and celestial car, fleet as thought, as also all the\r\naffluence of a god. Bathing in that tirtha and giving away much wealth,\r\nVala using white unguents thence proceeded quickly to another tirtha.\r\nPopulous with all kinds of creatures, that tirtha is known by the name\r\nVadarapachana. There the fruits of every season are always to be found\r\nand flowers and fruits of every kind are always abundant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Rama (as already said) then proceeded to the tirtha\r\ncalled Vadarapachana where dwelt many ascetics and Siddhas. There the\r\ndaughter of Bharadwaja, unrivalled on earth for beauty, named Sruvavati,\r\npractised severe austerities. She was a maiden who led the life of a\r\nBrahmacharini. That beautiful damsel, observing diverse kinds of vows,\r\npractised the austerest of penances, moved by the desire of obtaining the\r\nLord of the celestials for her husband. Many years passed away, O\r\nperpetuator of Kuru's race, during which that damsel continually observed\r\nthose diverse vows exceedingly difficult of being practised by women. The\r\nadorable chastiser of Paka at last became gratified with her in\r\nconsequence of that conduct and those penances of hers and that high\r\nregard she showed for him. The puissant Lord of the celestials then came\r\nto that hermitage, having assumed the form of the high-souled and\r\nregenerate Rishi Vasishtha. Beholding that foremost of ascetics,\r\nVasishtha, of the austerest penances, she worshipped him, O Bharata\r\naccording to the rites observed by ascetics. Conversant with vows, the\r\nauspicious and sweet-speeched damsel addressed him, saying, 'O adorable\r\none, O tiger among ascetics, tell me thy commands, O lord! O thou of\r\nexcellent vows, I shall serve thee according to the measure of my might!\r\nI will not, however, give thee my hand, in consequence of my regard for\r\nShakra! I am seeking to please Shakra, the lord of the three worlds, with\r\nvows and rigid observances and ascetic penances!' Thus addressed by her,\r\nthe illustrious god, smiling as he cast his eyes on her, and knowing her\r\nobservances, addressed her sweetly, O Bharata, saying, 'Thou practisest\r\npenances of the austerest kind! This is known to me, O thou of excellent\r\nvows! That object also, cherished in thy heart, for the attainment of\r\nwhich thou strivest, O auspicious one, shall, O thou of beautiful face,\r\nbe accomplished for thee! Everything is attainable by penances.\r\nEverything rests on penances. All those regions of blessedness, O thou of\r\nbeautiful face, that belong to the gods can be obtained by penances.\r\nPenances are the root of great happiness. Those men that cast off their\r\nbodies after having practised austere penances, obtain the status of\r\ngods, O auspicious one! Bear in mind these words of mine! Do thou now, O\r\nblessed damsel, boil these five jujubes, O thou of excellent vows!'\r\nHaving said these words, the adorable slayer of Vala went away, taking\r\nleave, to mentally recite certain mantras at an excellent tirtha not far\r\nfrom that hermitage. That tirtha came to be known in the three worlds\r\nafter the name of Indra, O giver of honours! Indeed, it was for the\r\npurpose of testing the damsel's devotion that the Lord of the celestials\r\nacted in that way for obstructing the boiling of the jujubes. The damsel,\r\nO king, having cleansed herself, began her task; restraining speech and\r\nwith attention fixed on it, she sat to her task without feeling any\r\nfatigue. Even thus that damsel of high vows, O tiger among kings, began\r\nto boil those jujubes. As she sat employed in her task, O bull among men,\r\nday was about to wane, but yet those jujubes showed no signs of having\r\nbeen softened. The fuel she had there was all consumed. Seeing the fire\r\nabout to die away owing to want of fuel, she began to burn her own limbs.\r\nThe beautiful maiden first thrust her feet into the fire. The sinless\r\ndamsel sat still while her feet began to be consumed. The faultless girl\r\ndid not at all mind her burning feet. Difficult of accomplishment, she\r\ndid it from desire of doing good to the Rishi (that had been her guest).\r\nHer face did not at all change under that painful process, nor did she\r\nfeel any cheerlessness on that account. Having thrust her limbs into the\r\nfire, she felt as much joy as if she had dipped them into cool water. The\r\nwords of the Rishi, 'Cook these jujubes well' were borne in her mind, O\r\nBharata! The auspicious damsel, bearing those words of the great Rishi in\r\nher mind, began to cook those jujubes although the latter, O king, showed\r\nno signs of softening. The adorable Agni himself consumed her feet. For\r\nthis, however, the maiden did not feel the slightest pain. Beholding this\r\nact of hers, the Lord of the three worlds became highly satisfied. He\r\nthen showed himself in his own proper form to the damsel. The chief of\r\nthe celestials then addressed that maiden of very austere vows saying, 'I\r\nam pleased at thy devotion, thy penances, and thy vows! The wish,\r\ntherefore, O auspicious one, that thou cherishest shall be accomplished!\r\nCasting off thy body, O blessed one, thou shalt in heaven live with me!\r\nThis hermitage, again, shall become the foremost of tirthas in the world,\r\ncapable of cleansing from every sin, O thou of fair eye-brows, and shall\r\nbe known by the name of Vadarapachana. It shall be celebrated in the\r\nthree worlds and shall be praised by great Rishis. In this very tirtha, O\r\nauspicious, sinless, and highly blessed one, the seven Rishis had, on one\r\noccasion, left Arundhati, (the wife of one of them), when they went to\r\nHimavat. Those highly blessed ones of very rigid vows, had gone there for\r\ngathering fruits and roots for their sustenance. While they thus lived in\r\na forest of Himavat for procuring their sustenance, a drought occurred\r\nextending for twelve years. Those ascetics, having made an asylum for\r\nthemselves, continued to live there. Meanwhile Arundhati devoted herself\r\nto ascetic penances (at the spot where she had been left). Beholding\r\nArundhati devoted to the austerest of vows, the boon-giving and\r\nthree-eyed deity (Mahadeva) highly pleased, came there. The great\r\nMahadeva, assuming the form of a Brahmana, came to her and said, 'I\r\ndesire alms, O auspicious one!' The beautiful Arundhati said unto him,\r\n'Our store of food hath been exhausted, O Brahmana! Do thou eat jujubes!'\r\nMahadeva replied, 'Cook these jujubes, O thou of excellent vows!' After\r\nthese words, she began to cook those jujubes for doing what was agreeable\r\nto that Brahmana. Placing those jujubes on the fire, the celebrated\r\nArundhati listened to diverse excellent and charming and sacred\r\ndiscourses (from the lips of Mahadeva). That twelve years' drought then\r\npassed away (as if it were a single day). Without food, and employed in\r\ncooking and listening to those auspicious discourses, that terrible\r\nperiod passed away, as if it were a single day to her. Then the seven\r\nRishis, having procured fruits from the mountain, returned to that spot.\r\nThe adorable Mahadeva, highly pleased with Arundhati, said unto her,\r\n'Approach, as formerly, these Rishis, O righteous one! I have been\r\ngratified with thy penances and vows!' The adorable Hara then stood\r\nconfessed in his own form. Gratified, he spoke unto them about the noble\r\nconduct of Arundhati (in these words) 'The ascetic merit, ye regenerate\r\nones, that this lady hath earned, is, I think, much greater than what ye\r\nhave earned on the breast of Himavat! The penances practised by this lady\r\nhave been exceedingly austere, for she passed twelve years in cooking,\r\nherself fasting all the while!' The divine Mahadeva then, addressing\r\nArundhati, said unto her, 'Solicit thou the boon, O auspicious dame,\r\nwhich is in thy heart!' Then that lady of large eyes that were of a\r\nreddish hue addressed that god in the midst of the seven Rishis, saying,\r\n'If, O divine one thou art gratified with me, then let this spot be an\r\nexcellent tirtha! Let it be known by the name of Vadarapachana and let it\r\nbe the favourite resort of Siddhas and celestial Rishis. So also, O god\r\nof gods, let him who observes a fast here and resides for three nights\r\nafter having cleansed himself, obtain the fruit of a twelve years' fast!'\r\nThe god answered her, saying, 'Let it be so!' Praised by the seven\r\nRishis, the god then repaired to heaven. Indeed the Rishis had been\r\nfilled with wonder at the sight of the god and upon beholding the chaste\r\nArundhati herself unspent and still possessed of the hue of health and so\r\ncapable of bearing hunger and thirst. Even thus the pure-souled\r\nArundhati, in days of old, obtained the highest success, like thee, O\r\nhighly blessed lady, for my sake, O damsel of rigid vows! Thou, however,\r\nO amiable maiden, hast practised severer penances! Gratified with thy\r\nvows, I shall also grant thee this special boon, O auspicious one, a boon\r\nthat is superior to what was granted to Arundhati. Through the power of\r\nthe high-souled god who had granted that boon to Arundhati and through\r\nthe energy of thyself, O amiable one, I shall duly grant thee another\r\nboon now, that the person who will reside in this tirtha for only one\r\nnight and bathe here with soul fixed (on meditation), will, after casting\r\noff his body obtain many regions of blessedness that are difficult of\r\nacquisition (by other means)! Having said these words unto the cleansed\r\nSruvavati, the thousand-eyed Shakra of great energy then went back to\r\nheaven. After the wielder of the thunderbolt, O king, had departed, a\r\nshower of celestial flowers of sweet fragrance fell there, O chief of\r\nBharata's race! Celestial kettle-drums also, of loud sound, were beaten\r\nthere. Auspicious and perfumed breezes also blew there, O monarch! The\r\nauspicious Sruvavati then, casting off her body, became the spouse of\r\nIndra. Obtaining the status through austere penances, she began to pass\r\nher time, sporting with him for ever and ever.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Who was the mother of Sruvavati, and how was that fair\r\ndamsel reared? I desire to hear this, O Brahmana, for the curiosity I\r\nfeel is great.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"The vital seed of the regenerate and high-souled\r\nRishi Bharadwaja fell, upon beholding the large-eyed Apsara Ghritachi as\r\nthe latter was passing at one time. That foremost of ascetics thereupon\r\nheld it in his hand. It was then kept in a cup made of the leaves of a\r\ntree. In that cup was born the girl Sruvavati. Having performed the usual\r\npost-genital rites, the great ascetic Bharadwaja, endued with wealth of\r\npenances, gave her a name. The name the righteous-souled Rishi gave her\r\nin the presence of the gods and Rishis was Sruvavati. Keeping the girl in\r\nhis hermitage, Bharadwaja repaired to the forests of Himavat. That\r\nforemost one among the Yadus, Baladeva of great dignity, having bathed in\r\nthat tirtha and given away much wealth unto many foremost of Brahmanas,\r\nthen proceeded, with soul well-fixed on meditation, to the tirtha of\r\nSakta.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"The mighty chief of the Yadus, having proceeded to\r\nIndra's tirtha, bathed there according to due rites and gave away wealth\r\nand gems unto the Brahmanas. There the chief of the celestials had\r\nperformed a hundred horse sacrifices and given away enormous wealth unto\r\nBrihaspati. Indeed, through the assistance of Brahmanas conversant with\r\nthe Vedas, Shakra performed all those sacrifices there, according to\r\nrites ordained (in the scriptures). Those sacrifices were such that\r\neverything in them was unstinted. Steeds of all kinds were brought there.\r\nThe gifts to Brahmanas were profuse. Having duly completed those hundred\r\nsacrifices, O chief of the Bharatas, Shakra of great splendour came to be\r\ncalled by the name of Satakratu. That auspicious and sacred tirtha,\r\ncapable of cleansing from every sin, thereupon came to be called after\r\nhis name as Indra-tirtha. Having duly bathed there, Baladeva worshipped\r\nthe Brahmanas with presents of excellent food and robes. He then\r\nproceeded to that auspicious and foremost of tirthas called after the\r\nname of Rama. The highly blessed Rama of Bhrigu's race, endued with great\r\nascetic merit, repeatedly subjugated the Earth and slew all the foremost\r\nof Kshatriyas. (After achieving such feats) Rama performed in that tirtha\r\na Vajapeya sacrifice and a hundred horse sacrifices through the\r\nassistance of his preceptor Kasyapa, that best of Munis. There, as\r\nsacrificial fee, Rama gave unto his preceptor the whole earth with her\r\noceans. The great Rama, having duly bathed there, made presents unto the\r\nBrahmanas, O Janamejaya, and worshipped them thus. Having made diverse\r\npresent consisting of diverse kinds of gems as also kine and elephants\r\nand female slaves and sheep and goats, he then retired into the woods.\r\nHaving bathed in that sacred and foremost of tirthas that was the resort\r\nof gods and regenerate Rishis, Baladeva duly worshipped the ascetics\r\nthere, and then proceeded to the tirtha called Yamuna. Endued with great\r\neffulgence, Varuna, the highly blessed son of Aditi, had in days of yore\r\nperformed in that tirtha the Rajasuya sacrifice, O lord of Earth! Having\r\nin battle subjugated both men and celestials and Gandharvas and\r\nRakshasas, Varuna, O king, that slayer of hostile heroes, performed his\r\ngrand sacrifice in that tirtha. Upon the commencement of that foremost of\r\nsacrifices, a battle ensued between the gods and the Danavas inspiring\r\nthe three worlds with terror. After the completion of that foremost of\r\nsacrifices, the Rajasuya (of Varuna), a terrible battle, O Janamejaya,\r\nensued amongst the Kshatriyas. The ever-liberal and puissant Baladeva\r\nhaving worshipped the Rishis there, made many presents unto those that\r\ndesired them. Filled with joy and praised by the great Rishis, Baladeva,\r\nthat hero ever decked with garlands of wild flowers and possessed of eyes\r\nlike lotus leaves, then proceeded to the tirtha called Aditya. There, O\r\nbest of kings, the adorable Surya of great splendour, having performed a\r\nsacrifice, obtained the sovereignty of all luminous bodies (in the\r\nuniverse) and acquired also his great energy. There, in that tirtha\r\nsituated on the bank of that river, all the gods with Vasava at their\r\nhead, the Viswedevas, the Maruts, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the\r\nIsland-born (Vyasa), Suka, Krishna the slayer of Madhu, the Yakshas, the\r\nRakshasas, and the Pisachas, O king, and diverse others, numbering by\r\nthousands, all crowned with ascetic success, always reside. Indeed in\r\nthat auspicious and sacred tirtha of the Sarasvati, Vishnu himself,\r\nhaving in days of yore slain the Asuras, Madhu and Kaitabha, had, O chief\r\nof the Bharatas, performed his ablutions. The island-born (Vyasa) also,\r\nof virtuous soul, O Bharata, having bathed in that tirtha, obtained great\r\nYoga powers and attained to high success. Endued with great ascetic\r\nmerit, the Rishi Asita-Devala also, having bathed in that very tirtha\r\nwith soul rapt in high Yoga meditation, obtained great Yoga powers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"In that tirtha lived in days of yore a Rishi of\r\nvirtuous soul, named Asita-Devala, observant of the duties of\r\nDomesticity. Devoted to virtue, he led a life of purity and\r\nself-restraint. Possessed of great ascetic merit, he was compassionate\r\nunto all creatures and never injured anyone. In word, deed, and thought,\r\nhe maintained an equal behaviour towards all creatures. Without wrath, O\r\nmonarch, censure and praise were equal to him. Of equal attitude towards\r\nthe agreeable and the disagreeable, he was, like Yama himself, thoroughly\r\nimpartial. The great ascetic looked with an equal eye upon gold and a\r\nheap of pebbles. He daily worshipped the gods and guests, and Brahmanas\r\n(that came to him). Ever devoted to righteousness, he always practised\r\nthe vow of brahmacarya. Once upon a time, an intelligent ascetic, O\r\nmonarch, of the name of Jaigishavya, devoted to Yoga and rapt in\r\nmeditation and leading the life of a mendicant, came to Devala's asylum.\r\nPossessed of great splendour, that great ascetic, ever devoted to Yoga, O\r\nmonarch, while residing in Devala's asylum, became crowned with ascetic\r\nsuccess. Indeed, while the great Muni Jaigishavya resided there, Devala\r\nkept his eyes on him, never neglecting him at any time. Thus, O monarch,\r\na long time was passed by the two in days of yore. On one occasion,\r\nDevala lost sight of Jaigishavya, that foremost of ascetics. At the hour,\r\nhowever, of dinner, O Janamejaya, the intelligent and righteous ascetic,\r\nleading a life of mendicancy, approached Devala for soliciting alms.\r\nBeholding that great ascetic re-appear in the guise of a mendicant,\r\nDevala showed him great honour and expressed much gratification. And\r\nDevala worshipped his guest, O Bharata, according to the measure of his\r\nabilities, after the rites laid down by the Rishis and with great\r\nattention for many years. One day, however, O king, in the sight of that\r\ngreat Muni, a deep anxiety perturbed the heart of the highsouled Devala.\r\nThe latter thought within himself, 'Many years have I passed in\r\nworshipping this ascetic. This idle mendicant, however, hath not yet\r\nspoken to me a single word!' Having thought of this, the blessed Devala\r\nproceeded to the shores of the ocean, journeying through the welkin and\r\nbearing his earthen jug with him. Arrived at the coast of the Ocean, that\r\nlord of rivers, O Bharata, the righteous-souled Devala saw Jaigishavya\r\narrived there before him. The lord Asita, at this sight, became filled\r\nwith wonder and thought within himself, 'How could the mendicant come to\r\nthe ocean and perform his ablutions even before my arrival?' Thus thought\r\nthe great Rishi Asita. Duly performing his ablutions there and purifying\r\nhimself thereby, he then began to silently recite the sacred mantras.\r\nHaving finished his ablutions and silent prayers, the blessed Devala\r\nreturned to his asylum, O Janamejaya, bearing with him his earthen vessel\r\nfilled with water. As the ascetic, however, entered his own asylum, he\r\nsaw Jaigishavya seated there. The great ascetic Jaigishavya never spoke a\r\nword to Devala, but lived in the latter's asylum as if he were a piece of\r\nwood. Having beheld that ascetic, who was an ocean of austerities,\r\nplunged in the waters of the sea (before his own arrival there), Asita\r\nnow saw him returned to his hermitage before his own return. Witnessing\r\nthis power, derived through Yoga, of Jaigishavya's penances, Asita\r\nDevala, O king, endued with great intelligence, began to reflect upon the\r\nmatter. Indeed that best of ascetics, O monarch, wondered much, saying,\r\n'How could this one be seen in the ocean and again in my hermitage?'\r\nWhile absorbed in such thoughts, the ascetic Devala, conversant with\r\nmantras, then soared aloft, O monarch, from his hermitage into the sky,\r\nfor ascertaining who Jaigishavya, wedded to a life of mendicancy, really\r\nwas. Devala saw crowds of sky-ranging Siddhas rapt in meditation, and he\r\nsaw Jaigishavya reverentially worshipped by those Siddhas. Firm in the\r\nobservance of his vows and persevering (in his efforts), Devala became\r\nfilled with wrath at the sight. He then saw Jaigishavya set out for\r\nheaven. He next beheld him proceed to the region of the Pitris. Devala\r\nsaw him then proceed to the region of Yama. From Yama's region the great\r\nascetic Jaigishavya was then seen to soar aloft and proceed to the abode\r\nof Soma. He was then seen to proceed to the blessed regions (one after\r\nanother) of the performers of certain rigid sacrifices. Thence he\r\nproceeded to the regions of the Agnihotris and thence to the region of\r\nthose ascetics that perform the Darsa and the Paurnamasa sacrifices. The\r\nintelligent Devala then saw him proceed from those regions of persons\r\nperforming sacrifices by killing animals to that pure region which is\r\nworshipped by the very gods. Devala next saw the mendicant proceed to the\r\nplace of those ascetics that perform the sacrifice called Chaturmasya and\r\ndiverse others of the same kind. Thence he proceeded to the region\r\nbelonging to the performers of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Devala then saw\r\nhis guest repair to the place of those ascetics that perform the\r\nsacrifice called Agnishutta. Indeed, Devala next saw him in the regions\r\nof those highly wise men that perform the foremost of sacrifices,\r\nVajapeya, and that other sacrifice in which a profusion of gold is\r\nnecessary. Then he saw Jaigishavya in the region of those that perform\r\nthe Rajasuya and the Pundarika. He then saw him in the regions of those\r\nforemost of men that perform the horse-sacrifice and the sacrifice in\r\nwhich human beings are slaughtered. Indeed, Devala saw Jaigishavya in the\r\nregions also of those that perform the sacrifice called Sautramani and\r\nthat other in which the flesh, so difficult to procure, of all living\r\nanimals, is required. Jaigishavya was then seen in the regions of those\r\nthat perform the sacrifice called Dadasaha and diverse others of similar\r\ncharacter. Asita next saw his guest sojourning in the region of\r\nMitravaruna and then in that of the Adityas. Asita then saw his guest\r\npass through the regions of the Rudras, the Vasus and Brihaspati. Having\r\nsoared next into the blessed region called Goloka, Jaigishavya was next\r\nseen to pass into these of the Brahmasatris. Having by his energy passed\r\nthrough three other regions, he was seen to proceed to those regions that\r\nare reserved for women that are chaste and devoted to their husbands.\r\nAsita, however, at this point, O chastiser of foes, lost sight of\r\nJaigishavya, that foremost of ascetics, who, rapt in yoga, vanished from\r\nhis sight. The highly blessed Devala then reflected upon the power of\r\nJaigishavya and the excellence of his vows as also upon the unrivalled\r\nsuccess of his yoga. Then the self-restrained Asita, with joined hands\r\nand in a reverential spirit, enquired of those foremost of Siddhas in the\r\nregions of the Brahmasatris, saying, 'I do not see Jaigishavya! Tell me\r\nwhere that ascetic of great energy is. I desire to hear this, for great\r\nis my curiosity.'\r\n\r\n\"The Siddhis said, 'Listen, O Devala of rigid vows, as we speak to thee\r\nthe truth. Jaigishavya hath gone to the eternal region of Brahman.'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of those Siddhas residing\r\nin the regions of the Brahmasatris, Asita endeavoured to soar aloft but\r\nhe soon fell down. The Siddhas then, once more addressing Devala, said\r\nunto him, 'Thou, O Devala, art not competent to proceed thither, to the\r\nabode of Brahman, whither Jaigishavya hath gone!'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing those words of the Siddhas, Devala came\r\ndown, descending from one region to another in due order. Indeed, he\r\nrepaired to his own sacred asylum very quickly, like a winged insect. As\r\nsoon as he entered his abode he beheld Jaigishavya seated there. Then\r\nDevala, beholding the power derived through Yoga of Jaigishavya's\r\npenances, reflected upon it with his righteous understanding and\r\napproaching that great ascetic, O king, with humility, addressed the\r\nhigh-souled Jaigishavya, saying, 'I desire, O adorable one, to adopt the\r\nreligion of Moksha (Emancipation)! Hearing these words of his,\r\nJaigishavya gave him lessons. And he also taught him the ordinances of\r\nYoga and the supreme and eternal duties and their reverse. The great\r\nascetic, seeing him firmly resolved, performed all the acts (for his\r\nadmission into that religion) according to the rites ordained for that\r\nend. Then all creatures, with the Pitris, beholding Devala resolved to\r\nadopt the religion of Moksha, began to weep, saying, 'Alas, who will\r\nhenceforth give us food!' Hearing these lamentations of all creatures\r\nthat resounded through the ten points, Devala set his heart upon\r\nrenouncing the religion of Moksha. Then all kinds of sacred fruits and\r\nroots, O Bharata, and flowers and deciduous herbs, in thousands, began to\r\nweep, saying, 'The wicked-hearted and mean Devala will, without doubt,\r\nonce more pluck and cut us! Alas, having once assured all creatures of\r\nhis perfect harmlessness, he sees not the wrong that he meditates to do!'\r\nAt this, that best of ascetics began to reflect with the aid of his\r\nunderstanding, saying, 'Which amongst these two, the religion of Moksha\r\nor that of Domesticity, will be the better for me? Reflecting upon this,\r\nDevala, O best of kings, abandoned the religion of Domesticity and\r\nadopted that of Moksha. Having indulged in those reflections, Devala, in\r\nconsequence of that resolve obtained the highest success, O Bharata, and\r\nthe highest Yoga. The celestials then, headed by Brihaspati, applauded\r\nJaigishavya and the penances of that ascetic. Then that foremost of\r\nascetics, Narada, addressing the gods, said, 'There is no ascetic penance\r\nin Jaigishavya since he filled Asita with wonder!' The denizens of heaven\r\nthen, addressing Narada who said such frightful words, said, 'Do not say\r\nso about the great ascetic Jaigishavya! There is no one superior or even\r\nequal to this high-souled one in force of energy and penance and Yoga!'\r\nEven such was the power of Jaigishavya as also of Asita. This is the\r\nplace of those two, and this the tirtha of those two high-souled persons.\r\nBathing there and giving away wealth unto the Brahmanas, the high-souled\r\nwielder of the plough, of noble deeds, earned great merit and then\r\nproceeded to the tirtha of Soma.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"There, in that tirtha, O Bharata, where the Lord of\r\nstars had in former days performed the rajasuya sacrifice, a great battle\r\nwas fought in which Taraka was the root of the evil. Bathing in that\r\ntirtha and making many presents, the virtuous Bala of cleansed soul\r\nproceeded to the tirtha of the muni named Sarasvata. There, during a\r\ndrought extending for twelve years, the sage Sarasvata, in former days,\r\ntaught the Vedas unto many foremost of brahmanas.\"\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why did the sage Sarasvata, O thou of ascetic merit,\r\nteach the Vedas unto the rishis during a twelve years' drought?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"In days of yore, O monarch, there was an\r\nintelligent sage of great ascetic merit. He was celebrated by the name of\r\nDadhica. Possessing a complete control over his senses, he led the life\r\nof a brahmacari. In consequence of his excessive ascetic austerities\r\nShakra was afflicted with a great fear. The sage could not be turned\r\n(away from his penance) by the offer of even diverse kinds of rewards. At\r\nlast the chastiser of Paka, for tempting the sage, despatched unto him\r\nthe exceedingly beautiful and celestial apsara, by name Alambusa. Thither\r\nwhere on the banks of the Sarasvati the high-souled sage was engaged in\r\nthe act of gratifying the gods, the celestial damsel named above, O\r\nmonarch, made her appearance. Beholding that damsel of beautiful limbs,\r\nthe vital seed of that ascetic of cleansed soul came out. It fell into\r\nthe Sarasvati, and the latter held it with care. Indeed, O bull among\r\nmen, the River, beholding that seed, held it in her womb. In time the\r\nseed developed into a foetus and the great river held it so that it might\r\nbe inspired with life as a child. When the time came, the foremost of\r\nrivers brought forth that child and then went, O lord, taking it with\r\nher, to that rishi.\r\n\r\nBeholding that best of rishis in a conclave, Sarasvati, O monarch, while\r\nmaking over the child, said these words, 'O regenerate rishi, this is thy\r\nson whom I held through devotion for thee! That seed of thine which fell\r\nat sight of the apsara Alambusa, had been held by me in my womb, O\r\nregenerate rishi, through devotion for thee, well knowing that that\r\nenergy of thine would never suffer destruction! Given by me, accept this\r\nfaultless child of thy own!' Thus addressed by her, the rishi accepted\r\nthe child and felt great joy. Through affection, that foremost of\r\nbrahmanas then smelt the head of his son and held him in a close embrace,\r\nO foremost one of Bharata's race, for some time. Gratified with the\r\nRiver, the great ascetic Dadhica then gave a boon to her, saying, 'The\r\nvishvadevas, the rishis, and all the tribes of the gandharvas and the\r\napsaras, will henceforth, O blessed one, derive great happiness when\r\noblations of thy water are presented unto them!'\r\n\r\nHaving said so unto that great river, the sage, gratified and filled with\r\njoy, then praised her in these words. Listen to them duly, O king! 'Thou\r\nhast taken thy rise, O highly blessed one, from the lake of Brahman in\r\ndays of old. All ascetics of rigid vows know thee, O foremost of rivers!\r\nAlways of agreeable features, thou hast done me great good! This thy\r\ngreat child, O thou of the fairest complexion, will be known by the name\r\nof Sarasvata! This thy son, capable of creating new worlds, will become\r\nknown after thy name! Indeed, that great ascetic will be known by the\r\nname of Sarasvata! During a drought extending for twelve years, this\r\nSarasvata, O blessed one, will teach the Vedas unto many foremost of\r\nbrahmanas! O blessed Sarasvati, through my grace, thou shalt, O beautiful\r\none, always become the foremost of all sacred rivers!' Even thus was the\r\ngreat River praised by the sage after the latter had granted her boons.\r\nThe River then, in great joy, went away, O bull of Bharata's race, taking\r\nwith her that child.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the occasion of a war between the gods and the danavas,\r\nShakra wandered through the three worlds in search of weapons. The great\r\ngod, however, failed to find such weapons as were fit to slay the foes of\r\nthe celestials. Shakra then said unto the gods. 'The great asuras are\r\nincapable of being dealt with by me! Indeed, without the bones of\r\nDadhica, our foes could not be slain! Ye best of celestials, repair,\r\ntherefore, to that foremost of rishis and solicit him, saying, \"Grant us,\r\nO Dadhica, thy bones! With them we will slay our foes!\"\r\n\r\nBesought by them for his bones, that foremost of rishis, O chief of\r\nKuru's race, unhesitatingly gave up his life. Having done what was\r\nagreeable to the gods, the sage obtained many regions of inexhaustible\r\nmerit. With his bones, meanwhile, Shakra joyfully caused to be made many\r\nkinds of weapons, such as thunderbolts, discs, heavy maces, and many\r\nkinds of clubs and bludgeons. Equal unto the Creator himself, Dadhica,\r\nhad been begotten by the great rishi Bhrigu, the son of the Lord of all\r\ncreatures, with the aid of his austere penances. Of stout limbs and\r\npossessed of great energy, Dadhica had been made the strongest of\r\ncreatures in the world. The puissant Dadhica, celebrated for his glory,\r\nbecame tall like the king of mountains. The chastiser of Paka had always\r\nbeen anxious on account of his energy. With the thunderbolt born of\r\nbrahma energy, and inspired with mantras, O Bharata, Indra made a loud\r\nnoise when he hurled it, and slew nine and ninety heroes among the\r\ndaityas. After a long and dreadful time had elapsed since then, a\r\ndrought, O king, occurred that extended for twelve years. During that\r\ndrought extending for twelve years, the great rishis, for the sake of\r\nsustenance, fled away, O monarch, on all sides.\r\n\r\nBeholding them scattered in all directions, the sage Sarasvata also set\r\nhis heart on flight. The river Sarasvati then said unto him, 'Thou needst\r\nnot, O son, depart hence, for I will always supply thee with food even\r\nhere by giving thee large fishes! Stay thou, therefore, even here!' Thus\r\naddressed (by the river), the sage continued to live there and offer\r\noblations of food unto the rishis and the gods. He got also his daily\r\nfood and thus continued to support both himself and the gods.\r\n\r\nAfter that twelve year's drought had passed away, the great rishis\r\nsolicited one another for lectures on the Vedas. While wandering with\r\nfamished stomachs, the rishis had lost the knowledge of the Vedas. There\r\nwas, indeed, not one amongst them that could understand the scriptures.\r\nIt chanced that someone amongst them encountered Sarasvata, that foremost\r\nof rishis, while the latter was reading the Vedas with concentrated\r\nattention. Coming back to the conclave of rishis, he spoke to them of\r\nSarasvata of unrivalled splendour and god-like mien engaged in reading\r\nthe Vedas in a solitary forest. Then all the great rishis came to that\r\nspot, and jointly spoke unto Sarasvata, that best of ascetics, these\r\nwords, 'Teach us, O sage!' Unto them the ascetic replied, saying, 'Become\r\nye my disciples duly!' The conclave of ascetics answered, 'O son, thou\r\nart too young in years!' Thereupon he answered the ascetics, 'I must act\r\nin such a way that my religious merit may not suffer a diminution! He\r\nthat teaches improperly, and he that learns improperly, are both lost in\r\nno time and come to hate each other! It is not upon years, or\r\ndecrepitude, or wealth, or the number of kinsmen, that rishis found their\r\nclaim to merit! He amongst us is great who is capable of reading and\r\nunderstanding the Vedas!'\r\n\r\nHearing these words of his, those munis duly became his disciples and\r\nobtaining from him their Vedas, once more began to praise their rites.\r\n60,000 munis became disciples of the regenerate rishi Sarasvata for the\r\nsake of acquiring their Vedas from him. Owning obedience to that\r\nagreeable rishi, though a boy, the munis each brought a handful of grass\r\nand offered it to him for his seat. The mighty son of Rohini, and elder\r\nbrother of Keshava, having given away wealth in that tirtha, then\r\njoyfully proceeded to another place where lived (in days of yore) an old\r\nlady without having passed through the ceremony of marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"Why, O regenerate one, did that maiden betake herself\r\nto ascetic penances, in days of old? For what reason did she practise\r\npenances, and what was her vow? Unrivalled and fraught with mystery is\r\nthe discourse that I have already heard from thee! Tell me (now) all the\r\nparticulars in detail regarding how that maid engaged herself in\r\npenances.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"There was a rishi of abundant energy and great fame,\r\nnamed Kuni-Garga. That foremost of ascetics, having practised the\r\nausterest of penances, O king, created a fair-browed daughter by a fiat\r\nof his will. Beholding her, the celebrated ascetic Kuni-Garga became\r\nfilled with joy. He abandoned his body, O king, and then went to heaven.\r\nThat faultless and amiable and fair-browed maiden, meanwhile, of eyes\r\nlike lotus petals continued to practise severe and very rigid penances.\r\nShe worshipped the pitris and the gods with fasts. In the practice of\r\nsuch severe penances a long period elapsed. Though her sire had been for\r\ngiving her away to a husband, she yet did not wish for marriage, for she\r\ndid not see a husband that could be worthy of her.\r\n\r\nContinuing to emaciate her body with austere penances, she devoted\r\nherself to the worship of the pitris and the gods in that solitary\r\nforest. Although engaged in such toil, O monarch, and although she\r\nemaciated herself by age and austerities, yet she regarded herself happy.\r\nAt last when she (became very old so that she) could no longer move even\r\na single step without being aided by somebody, she set her heart upon\r\ndeparting for the other world.\r\n\r\nBeholding her about to cast off her body, Narada said unto her, 'O\r\nsinless one, thou hast no regions of blessedness to obtain in consequence\r\nof thy not having cleansed thyself by rite of marriage! O thou of great\r\nvows, we have heard this in heaven! Great hath been thy ascetic\r\nausterities, but thou hast no claim to regions of blessedness!'\r\n\r\nHearing these words of Narada, the old lady went to a concourse of rishis\r\nand said, 'I shall give him half my penances who will accept my hand in\r\nmarriage!' After she had said those words, Galava's son, a rishi, known\r\nby the name of Sringavat, accepted her hand, having proposed this compact\r\nto her, 'With this compact, O beautiful lady, I shall accept thy hand,\r\nthat thou shalt live with me for only one night!' Having agreed to that\r\ncompact, she gave him her hand.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Galava's son, according to the ordinances laid down and having\r\nduly poured libations on the fire, accepted her hand and married her. On\r\nthat night, she became a young lady of the fairest complexion, robed in\r\ncelestial attire and decked in celestial ornaments and garlands and\r\nsmeared with celestial unguents and perfumes. Beholding her blazing with\r\nbeauty, Galava's son became very happy and passed one night in her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAt morn she said unto him, 'The compact, O brahmana, I had made with\r\nthee, hath been fulfilled, O foremost of ascetics! Blessed be thou, I\r\nshall now leave thee!' After obtaining his permission, she once more\r\nsaid, 'He that will, with rapt attention, pass one night in this tirtha\r\nafter having gratified the denizens of heaven with oblations of water,\r\nshall obtain that merit which is his who observes the vow of brahmacarya\r\nfor eight and fifty years!' Having said these words, that chaste lady\r\ndeparted for heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Rishi, her lord, became very cheerless, by dwelling upon the memory\r\nof her beauty. In consequence of the compact he had made, he accepted\r\nwith difficulty half her penances. Casting off his body he soon followed\r\nher, moved by sorrow, O chief of Bharata's race, and forced to it by her\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nEven this is the glorious history of the old maid that I have told thee!\r\nEven this is the account of her brahmacarya and her auspicious departure\r\nfor heaven. While there Baladeva heard of the slaughter of Shalya. Having\r\nmade presents unto the brahmanas there, he gave way to grief, O scorcher\r\nof his foes, for Shalya who had been slain by the Pandavas in battle.\r\nThen he of Madhu's race, having come out of the environs of\r\nSamantapanchaka, enquired of the rishis about the results of the battle\r\nat Kurukshetra. Asked by that lion of Yadu's race about the results of\r\nthe battle at Kurukshetra, those high-souled ones told him everything as\r\nit had happened.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\n\"The Rishis said, 'O Rama, this Samantapanchaka is said to be the eternal\r\nnorthern altar of Brahman, the Lord of all creatures. There the denizens\r\nof heaven, those givers of great boons, performed in days of yore a great\r\nsacrifice. That foremost of royal sages, the high-souled Kuru, of great\r\nintelligence and immeasurable energy, had cultivated this field for many\r\nyears. Hence it came to be Kurukshetra (the field of Kuru)!'\r\n\r\n\"Rama said, 'For what reason did the high-souled Kuru cultivate this\r\nfield? I desire to have this narrated by you, ye Rishis possessed of\r\nwealth of penances!'\r\n\r\n\"The Rishis said, 'In days of yore, O Rama, Kuru was engaged in\r\nperseveringly tilling the soil of this field. Shakra, coming down from\r\nheaven, asked him the reason, saying, \"Why O king, art thou employed (in\r\nthis task) with such perseverance? What is thy purpose, O royal sage, for\r\nthe accomplishment of which thou art tilling the soil?\" Kuru thereupon\r\nreplied, saying, \"O thou of a hundred sacrifices, they that will die upon\r\nthis plain shall proceed to regions of blessedness after being cleansed\r\nof their sins!\" The lord Shakra, ridiculing this, went back to heaven.\r\nThe royal sage Kuru, however, without being at all depressed, continued\r\nto till the soil. Shakra repeatedly came to him and repeatedly receiving\r\nthe same reply went away ridiculing him. Kuru, however, did not, on that\r\naccount, feel depressed. Seeing the king till the soil with unflagging\r\nperseverance. Shakra summoned the celestials and informed them of the\r\nmonarch's occupation. Hearing Indra's words, the celestials said unto\r\ntheir chief of a 1,000 eyes, \"Stop the royal sage, O Shakra by granting\r\nhim a boon, if thou canst! If men, by only dying there were to come to\r\nheaven, without having performed sacrifices to us, our very existence\r\nwill be endangered!\" Thus exhorted, Shakra then came back to that royal\r\nsage and said, \"Do not toil any more! Act according to my words! Those\r\nmen that will die here, having abstained from food with all their senses\r\nawake, and those that will perish here in battle, shall, O king, come to\r\nheaven! They, O thou of great soul, shall enjoy the blessings of heaven,\r\nO monarch!\" Thus addressed, king Kuru answered Shakra, saying, \"So be\r\nit!\" Taking Kuru's leave, the slayer of Vala, Shakra, then, with a joyful\r\nheart, quickly went back to heaven. Even thus, O foremost one of Yadu's\r\nrace, that royal sage had, in days of yore, tilled this plain and Shakra\r\nhad promised great merit unto those that would cast off their bodies\r\nhere. Indeed, it was sanctioned by all the foremost ones, headed by\r\nBrahman, among the gods, and by the sacred Rishis, that on earth there\r\nshould be no more sacred spot than this! Those men that perform austere\r\npenances here would all after casting off their bodies go to Brahman's\r\nabode. Those meritorious men, again, that would give away their wealth\r\nhere would soon have their wealth doubled. They, again, that will, in\r\nexpectation of good, reside constantly here, will never have to visit the\r\nregion of Yama. Those kings that will perform great sacrifices here will\r\nreside as long in heaven as Earth herself will last. The chief of the\r\ncelestials, Shakra, himself composed a verse here and sang it. Listen to\r\nit, O Baladeva! \"The very dust of Kurukshetra, borne away by the wind,\r\nshall cleanse persons of wicked acts and bear them to heaven!\" The\r\nforemost ones amongst the gods, as also those amongst the Brahmanas, and\r\nmany foremost ones among the kings of the Earth such as Nriga and others,\r\nhaving performed costly sacrifices here, after abandoning their bodies,\r\nproceeded to heaven. The space between the Tarantuka and the Arantuka and\r\nthe lakes of Rama and Shamachakra, is known as Kurukshetra.\r\nSamantapanchaka is called the northern (sacrificial) altar of Brahman,\r\nthe Lord of all creatures. Auspicious and highly sacred and much regarded\r\nby the denizens of heaven is this spot that possesses all attributes. It\r\nis for this that Kshatriyas slain in battle here obtain sacred regions of\r\neternal blessedness. Even this was said by Shakra himself about the high\r\nblessedness of Kurukshetra. All that Shakra said was again approved and\r\nsanctioned by Brahman, by Vishnu, and by Maheshvara.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Having visited Kurukshetra and given away wealth\r\nthere, he of the Satwata race then proceeded, O Janamejaya, to a large\r\nand exceedingly beautiful hermitage. That hermitage was overgrown with\r\nMadhuka and mango trees, and abounded with Plakshas and Nyagrodhas. And\r\nit contained many Vilwas and many excellent jack and Arjuna trees.\r\nBeholding that goodly asylum with many marks of sacredness, Baladeva\r\nasked the Rishis as to whose it was. Those high-souled ones, O king, said\r\nunto Baladeva, 'Listen in detail, O Rama, as to whose asylum this was in\r\ndays of yore! Here the god Vishnu in days of yore performed austere\r\npenances. Here he performed duly all the eternal sacrifices. Here a\r\nBrahmani maiden, leading from youth the vow of Brahmacharya, became\r\ncrowned with ascetic success. Ultimately, in the possession of Yoga\r\npowers, that lady of ascetic penances proceeded to heaven. The\r\nhigh-souled Sandilya, O king, got a beautiful daughter who was chaste,\r\nwedded to severe vows, self-restrained, and observant of Brahmacharya.\r\nHaving performed the severest of penances such as are incapable of being\r\nperformed by women, the blessed lady at last went to heaven, worshipped\r\nby the gods and Brahmanas!' Having heard these words of the Rishis,\r\nBaladeva entered that asylum. Bidding farewell to the Rishis, Baladeva of\r\nunfading glory went through the performance of all the rites and\r\nceremonies of the evening twilight on the side of Himavat and then began\r\nhis ascent of the mountain. The mighty Balarama having the device of the\r\npalmyra on his banner had not proceeded far in his ascent when he beheld\r\na sacred and goodly tirtha and wondered at the sight. Beholding the glory\r\nof the Sarasvati, as also the tirtha called Plakshaprasravana, Vala next\r\nreached another excellent and foremost of tirthas called Karavapana. The\r\nhero of the plough, of great strength, having made many presents there,\r\nbathed in the cool, clear, sacred, and sin-cleansing water (of that\r\ntirtha). Passing one night there with the ascetics and the Brahmanas,\r\nRama then proceeded to the sacred asylum of the Mitra-Varunas. From\r\nKaravapana he proceeded to that spot on the Yamuna where in days of yore\r\nIndra and Agni and Aryaman had obtained great happiness. Bathing there,\r\nthat bull of Yadu's race, of righteous soul, obtained great happiness.\r\nThe hero then sat himself down with the Rishis and the Siddhas there for\r\nlistening to their excellent talk. There where Rama sat in the midst of\r\nthat conclave, the adorable Rishi Narada came (in course of his\r\nwandering). Covered with matted locks and attired in golden rays, he bore\r\nin his hands, O king, a staff made of gold and a waterpot made of the\r\nsame precious metal. Accomplished in song and dance and adored by gods\r\nand Brahmanas, he had with him a beautiful Vina of melodious notes, made\r\nof the tortoise-shell. A provoker of quarrels and ever fond of quarrels,\r\nthe celestial Rishi came to that spot where the handsome Rama was\r\nresting. Standing up and sufficiently honouring the celestial Rishi of\r\nregulated vows, Rama asked him about all that had happened to the Kurus.\r\nConversant with every duty and usage, Narada then, O king, told him\r\neverything, as it had happened, about the awful extermination of the\r\nKurus. The son of Rohini then, in sorrowful words, enquired of the Rishi,\r\nsaying, 'What is the state of the field? How are those kings now that had\r\nassembled there? I have heard everything before, O thou that art\r\npossessed of the wealth of penances, but my curiosity is great for\r\nhearing it in detail!'\r\n\r\n\"Narada said, 'Already Bhishma and Drona and the lord of the Sindhus have\r\nfallen! Vikartana's son Karna also hath fallen, with his sons, those\r\ngreat car-warriors! Bhurishrava too, O son of Rohini, and the valiant\r\nchief of the Madras have fallen! Those and many other mighty heroes that\r\nhad assembled there, ready to lay down their lives for the victory of\r\nDuryodhana, those kings and princes unreturning from battle, have all\r\nfallen! Listen now to me, O Madhava, about those that are yet alive! In\r\nthe army of Dhritarashtra's son, only three grinders of hosts are yet\r\nalive! They are Kripa and Kritavarma and the valiant son of Drona! These\r\nalso, O Rama, have from fear fled away to the ten points of the compass!\r\nAfter Shalya's fall and the flight of Kripa and the others, Duryodhana,\r\nin great grief, had entered the depths of the Dvaipayana lake. While\r\nlying stretched for rest at the bottom of the lake after stupefying its\r\nwaters, Duryodhana was approached by the Pandavas with Krishna and\r\npierced by them with their cruel words. Pierced with wordy darts, O Rama,\r\nfrom every side, the mighty and heroic Duryodhana hath risen from the\r\nlake armed with his heavy mace. He hath come forward for fighting Bhima\r\nfor the present. Their terrible encounter, O Rama, will take place today!\r\nIf thou feelest any curiosity, then hasten, O Madhava, without tarrying\r\nhere! Go, if thou wishest, and witness that terrible battle between thy\r\ntwo disciples!'\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of Narada, Rama bade a\r\nrespectful farewell to those foremost of Brahmanas and dismissed all\r\nthose that had accompanied him (in his pilgrimage). Indeed, he ordered\r\nhis attendants, saying, 'Return ye to Dwaraka!' He then descended from\r\nthat prince of mountains and that fair hermitage called\r\nPlakshaprasravana. Having listened to the discourse of the sages about\r\nthe great merits of tirthas, Rama of unfading glory sang this verse in\r\nthe midst of the Brahmanas, 'Where else is such happiness as that in a\r\nresidence by the Sarasvati? Where also such merits as those in a\r\nresidence by the Sarasvati? Men have departed for heaven, having\r\napproached the Sarasvati! All should ever remember the Sarasvati!\r\nSarasvati is the most sacred of rivers! Sarasvati always bestows the\r\ngreatest happiness on men! Men, after approaching the Sarasvati, will not\r\nhave to grieve for their sins either here or hereafter!' Repeatedly\r\ncasting his eyes with joy on the Sarasvati, that scorcher of foes then\r\nascended an excellent car unto which were yoked goodly steeds. Journeying\r\nthen on that car of great fleetness, Baladeva, that bull of Yadu's race,\r\ndesirous of beholding the approaching encounter of his two disciples\r\narrived on the field.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Even thus, O Janamejaya, did that terrible battle\r\ntake place. King Dhritarashtra, in great sorrow, said these words with\r\nreference to it:\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding Rama approach that spot when the\r\nmace-fight was about to happen, how, O Sanjaya, did my son fight Bhima?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the presence of Rama, thy valiant son,\r\nDuryodhana of mighty arms, desirous of battle, became full of joy. Seeing\r\nthe hero of the plough, king Yudhishthira, O Bharata, stood up and duly\r\nhonoured him, feeling great joy the while. He gave him a seat and\r\nenquired about his welfare. Rama then answered Yudhishthira in these\r\nsweet and righteous words that were highly beneficial to heroes, \"I have\r\nheard it said by the Rishis, O best of kings, that Kurukshetra is a\r\nhighly sacred and sin-cleansing spot, equal to heaven itself, adored by\r\ngods and Rishis and high-souled Brahmanas! Those men that cast off their\r\nbodies while engaged in battle on this field, are sure to reside, O sire,\r\nin heaven with Shakra himself! I shall, for this, O king, speedily\r\nproceed to Samantapanchaka. In the world of gods that spot is known as\r\nthe northern (sacrificial) altar of Brahman, the Lord of all creatures!\r\nHe that dies in battle on that eternal and most sacred of spots in the\r\nthree worlds, is sure to obtain heaven!\" Saying, \"So be it,\" O monarch,\r\nKunti's brave son, the lord Yudhishthira, proceeded towards\r\nSamantapanchaka. King Duryodhana also, taking up his gigantic mace,\r\nwrathfully proceeded on foot with the Pandavas. While proceeding thus,\r\narmed with mace and clad in armour, the celestials in the welkin\r\napplauded him, saying, \"Excellent, Excellent!\" The Charanas fleet as air,\r\nseeing the Kuru king, became filled with delight. Surrounded by the\r\nPandavas, thy son, the Kuru king, proceeded, assuming the tread of an\r\ninfuriated elephant. All the points of the compass were filled with the\r\nblare of conchs and the loud peals of drums and the leonine roars of\r\nheroes. Proceeding with face westwards to the appointed spot, with thy\r\nson (in their midst), they scattered themselves on every side when they\r\nreached it. That was an excellent tirtha on the southern side of the\r\nSarasvati. The ground there was not sandy and was, therefore, selected\r\nfor the encounter. Clad in armour, and armed with his mace of gigantic\r\nthickness, Bhima, O monarch, assumed the form of the mighty Garuda. With\r\nhead-gear fastened on his head, and wearing an armour made of gold,\r\nlicking the corners of his mouth, O monarch, with eyes red in wrath, and\r\nbreathing hard, thy son, on that field, O king, looked resplendent like\r\nthe golden Sumeru. Taking up his mace, king Duryodhana of great energy,\r\ncasting his glances on Bhimasena, challenged him to the encounter like an\r\nelephant challenging a rival elephant. Similarly, the valiant Bhima,\r\ntaking up his adamantine mace, challenged the king like a lion\r\nchallenging a lion. Duryodhana and Bhima, with uplifted maces, looked in\r\nthat bottle like two mountains with tall summits. Both of them were\r\nexceedingly angry; both were possessed of awful prowess; in encounters\r\nwith the mace both were disciples of Rohini's intelligent son, both\r\nresembled each other in their feats and looked like Maya and Vasava. Both\r\nwere endued with great strength, both resembled Varuna in achievements.\r\nEach resembling Vasudeva, or Rama, or Visravana's son (Ravana), they\r\nlooked, O monarch, like Madhu and Kaitabha. Each like the other in feats,\r\nthey looked like Sunda and Upasunda, or Rama and Ravana, or Vali and\r\nSugriva. Those two scorchers of foes looked like Kala and Mrityu. They\r\nthen ran towards each other like two infuriated elephants, swelling with\r\npride and mad with passion in the season of autumn and longing for the\r\ncompanionship of a she-elephant in her time. Each seemed to vomit upon\r\nthe other the poison of his wrath like two fiery snakes. Those two\r\nchastisers of foes cast the angriest of glances upon each other. Both\r\nwere tigers of Bharata's race, and each was possessed of great prowess.\r\nIn encounters with the mace, those two scorchers of foes were invincible\r\nlike lions. Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, inspired with desire of\r\nvictory, they looked like two infuriated elephants. Those heroes were\r\nunbearable, like two tigers accoutred with teeth and claws. They were\r\nlike two uncrossable oceans lashed into fury and bent upon the\r\ndestruction of creatures, or like two angry Suns risen for consuming\r\neverything. Those two mighty car-warriors looked like an Eastern and a\r\nWestern cloud agitated by the wind, roaring awfully and pouring torrents\r\nof rain in the rainy season. Those two high-souled and mighty heroes,\r\nboth possessed of great splendour and effulgence, looked like two Suns\r\nrisen at the hour of the universal dissolution. Looking like two enraged\r\ntigers or like two roaring masses of clouds, they became as glad as two\r\nmaned lions. Like two angry elephants or two blazing fires, those two\r\nhigh-souled ones appeared like two mountains with tall summits. With lips\r\nswelling with rage and casting keen glances upon each other, those two\r\nhigh-souled and best of men, armed with maces, encountered each other.\r\nBoth were filled with joy, and each regarded the other as a worthy\r\nopponent, and Vrikodara then resembled two goodly steeds neighing at each\r\nother, or two elephants trumpeting at each other. Those two foremost of\r\nmen then looked resplendent like a couple of Daityas swelling with might.\r\nThen Duryodhana, O monarch, said these proud words unto Yudhishthira in\r\nthe midst of his brothers and of the high-souled Krishna and Rama of\r\nimmeasurable energy, 'Protected by the Kaikeyas and the Srinjayas and the\r\nhigh-souled Pancalas, behold ye with all those foremost of kings, seated\r\ntogether, this battle that is about to take place between me and Bhima!'\r\nHearing these words of Duryodhana, they did as requested. Then that large\r\nconcourse of kings sat down and was seen to look resplendent like a\r\nconclave of celestials in heaven. In the midst of that concourse the\r\nmighty-armed and handsome elder brother of Keshava, O monarch, as he sat\r\ndown, was worshipped by all around him. In the midst of those kings,\r\nValadeva clad in blue robes and possessed of a fair complexion, looked\r\nbeautiful like the moon at full surrounded in the night by thousands of\r\nstars. Meanwhile those two heroes, O monarch, both armed with maces and\r\nboth unbearable by foes, stood there, goading each other with fierce\r\nspeeches. Having addressed each other in disagreeable and bitter words,\r\nthose two foremost of heroes of Kuru's race stood, casting angry glances\r\nupon each other, like Shakra and Vritra in fight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"At the outset, O Janamejaya a fierce wordy encounter\r\ntook place between the two heroes. With respect to that, king\r\nDhritarashtra, filled with grief, said this, 'Oh, fie on man, who hath\r\nsuch an end! My son, O sinless one, had been the lord of eleven chamus of\r\ntroops He had all the kings under his command and had enjoyed the\r\nsovereignty of the whole earth! Alas, he that had been so, now a warrior\r\nproceeding to battle, on foot, shouldering his mace! My poor son, who had\r\nbefore been the protector of the universe, was now himself without\r\nprotection! Alas, he had, on that occasion, to proceed on foot,\r\nshouldering his mace! What can it be but Destiny? Alas, O Sanjaya, great\r\nwas the grief that was felt by my son now!' Having uttered these words,\r\nthat ruler of men, afflicted with great woe, became silent.\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Deep-voiced like a cloud, Duryodhana then roared from joy\r\nlike a bull. Possessed of great energy, he challenged the son of Pritha\r\nto battle. When the high-souled king of the Kurus thus summoned Bhima to\r\nthe encounter, diverse portents of an awful kind became noticeable.\r\nFierce winds began to blow with loud noises at intervals, and a shower of\r\ndust fell. All the points of the compass became enveloped in a thick\r\ngloom. Thunderbolts of loud peal fell on all sides, causing a great\r\nconfusion and making the very hair to stand on end. Hundreds of meteors\r\nfell, bursting with a loud noise from the welkin. Rahu swallowed the Sun\r\nmost untimely, O monarch! The Earth with her forests and trees shook\r\ngreatly. Hot winds blew, bearing showers of hard pebbles along the\r\nground. The summits of mountains fell down on the earth's surface.\r\nAnimals of diverse forms were seen to run in all directions. Terrible and\r\nfierce jackals, with blazing mouths, howled everywhere. Loud and terrific\r\nreports were heard on every side, making the hair stand on end. The four\r\nquarters seemed to be ablaze and many were the animals of ill omen that\r\nbecame visible. The water in the wells on every side swelled up of their\r\nown accord. Loud sounds came from every side, without, O king, visible\r\ncreatures to utter them. Beholding these and other portents, Vrikodara\r\nsaid unto his eldest brother, king Yudhishthira the just, \"This Suyodhana\r\nof wicked soul is not competent to vanquish me in battle! I shall today\r\nvomit that wrath which I have been cherishing for a long while in the\r\nsecret recesses of my heart, upon this ruler of the Kurus like Arjuna\r\nthrowing fire upon the forest of Khandava! Today, O son of Pandu, I shall\r\nextract the dart that lies sticking to thy heart! Slaying with my mace\r\nthis sinful wretch of Kuru's race, I shall today place around thy neck\r\nthe garland of Fame! Slaying this wight of sinful deeds with my mace on\r\nthe field of battle, I shall today, with this very mace of mine, break\r\nhis body into a hundred fragments! He shall not have again to enter the\r\ncity called after the elephant. The setting of snakes at us while we were\r\nasleep, the giving of poison to us while we ate, the casting of our body\r\ninto the water at Pramanakoti, the attempt to burn us at the house of\r\nlac, the insult offered us at the assembly, the robbing us of all our\r\npossessions, the whole year of our living in concealment, our exile into\r\nthe woods, O sinless one, of all these woes, O best of Bharata's race, I\r\nshall today reach the end, O bull of Bharata's line! Slaying this wretch,\r\nI shall, in one single day, pay off all the debts I owe him! Today, the\r\nperiod of life of this wicked son of Dhritarashtra, of uncleansed soul,\r\nhath reached its close, O chief of the Bharatas! After this day he shall\r\nnot again look at his father and mother! Today, O monarch, the happiness\r\nof this wicked king of the Kurus hath come to an end! After this day, O\r\nmonarch, he shall not again cast his eyes on female beauty! Today this\r\ndisgrace of Santanu's line shall sleep on the bare Earth, abandoning his\r\nlife-breath, his prosperity, and his kingdom! Today king Dhritarashtra\r\nalso, hearing of the fall of his son, shall recollect all those evil acts\r\nthat were born of Shakuni's brain!\" With these words, O tiger among\r\nkings, Vrikodara of great energy, armed with mace, stood for fight, like\r\nShakra challenging the asura Vritra. Beholding Duryodhana also standing\r\nwith uplifted mace like mount Kailasa graced with its summit, Bhimasena,\r\nfilled with wrath, once more addressed him, saying, \"Recall to thy mind\r\nthat evil act of thyself and king Dhritarashtra that occurred at\r\nVaranavata! Remember Draupadi who was ill-treated, while in her season,\r\nin the midst of the assembly! Remember the deprivation of the king\r\nthrough dice by thyself and Subala's son! Remember that great woe\r\nsuffered by us, in consequence of thee, in the forest, as also in\r\nVirata's city as if we had once more entered the womb! I shall avenge\r\nmyself of them all today! By good luck, O thou of wicked soul, I see thee\r\ntoday! It is for thy sake that that foremost of car-warriors, the son of\r\nGanga, of great prowess, struck down by Yajnasena's son, sleepeth on a\r\nbed of arrows! Drona also hath been slain, and Karna, and Shalya of great\r\nprowess! Subala's son Shakuni, too, that root of these hostilities, hath\r\nbeen slain! The wretched Pratikamin, who had seized Draupadi's tresses,\r\nhath been slain! All thy brave brothers also, who fought with great\r\nvalour, have been slain! These and many other kings have been slain\r\nthrough thy fault! Thee too I shall slay today with my mace! There is not\r\nthe slightest doubt in this.\" While Vrikodara, O monarch, was uttering\r\nthese words in a loud voice, thy fearless son of true prowess answered\r\nhim, saying, \"What use of such elaborate bragging? Fight me, O Vrikodara!\r\nO wretch of thy race, today I shall destroy thy desire of battle! Mean\r\nvermin as thou art, know that Duryodhana is not capab le, like an\r\nordinary person, of being terrified by a person like thee! For a long\r\ntime have I cherished this desire! For a long time hath this wish been in\r\nmy heart! By good luck the gods have at last brought it about, a mace\r\nencounter with thee! What use of long speeches and empty bragging, O\r\nwicked-souled one! Accomplish these words of thine in acts. Do not tarry\r\nat all!\" Hearing these words of his, the Somakas and the other kings that\r\nwere present there all applauded them highly. Applauded by all,\r\nDuryodhana's hair stood erect with joy and he firmly set his heart on\r\nbattle. The kings present once again cheered thy wrathful son with\r\nclapping, like persons exciting an infuriated elephant to an encounter.\r\nThe high-souled Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, then, uplifting his mace,\r\nrushed furiously at thy high-souled son. The elephants present there\r\ntrumpeted aloud and the steeds neighed repeatedly. The weapons of the\r\nPandavas who longed for victory blazed forth of their own accord.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Duryodhana, with heart undepressed, beholding Bhimasena\r\nin that state, rushed furiously against him, uttering a loud roar. They\r\nencountered each other like two bulls encountering each other with their\r\nhorns. The strokes of their maces produced loud sounds like those of\r\nthunderbolts. Each longing for victory, the battle that took place\r\nbetween them was terrible, making the very hair stand on end, like that\r\nbetween Indra and Prahlada. All their limbs bathed in blood, the two\r\nhigh-souled warriors of great energy, both armed with maces, looked like\r\ntwo Kinsukas decked with flowers. During the progress of that great and\r\nawful encounter, the welkin looked beautiful as if it swarmed with\r\nfire-flies. After that fierce and terrible battle had lasted for some\r\ntime, both those chastisers of foes became fatigued. Having rested for a\r\nlittle while, those two scorchers of foes, taking up their handsome\r\nmaces, once again began to ward off each others' attacks. Indeed, when\r\nthose two warriors of great energy, those two foremost of men, both\r\npossessed of great might, encountered each other after having taken a\r\nlittle rest, they looked like two elephants infuriated with passion and\r\nattacking each other for obtaining the companionship of a cow elephant in\r\nseason. Beholding those two heroes, both armed with maces and each equal\r\nto the other in energy, the gods and Gandharvas and men became filled\r\nwith wonder. Beholding Duryodhana and Vrikodara both armed with maces,\r\nall creatures became doubtful as to who amongst them would be victorious.\r\nThose two cousins, those two foremost of mighty men, once again rushing\r\nat each other and desiring to take advantage of each other's lapses,\r\nwaited each watching the other. The spectators, O king, beheld each armed\r\nwith his uplifted mace, that was heavy, fierce, and murderous, and that\r\nresembled the bludgeon of Yama or the thunder-bolt of Indra. While\r\nBhimasena whirled his weapon, loud and awful was the sound that it\r\nproduced. Beholding his foe, the son of Pandu, thus whirling his mace\r\nendued with unrivalled impetuosity, Duryodhana became filled with\r\namazement. Indeed, the heroic Vrikodara, O Bharata, as he careered in\r\ndiverse courses, presented a highly beautiful spectacle. Both bent upon\r\ncarefully protecting themselves, as they approached, they repeatedly\r\nmangled each other like two cats fighting for a piece of meat. Bhimasena\r\nperformed diverse kinds of evolutions. He coursed in beautiful circles,\r\nadvanced, and receded. He dealt blows and warded off those of his\r\nadversary, with wonderful activity. He took up various kinds of position\r\n(for attack and defence). He delivered attacks and avoided those of his\r\nantagonist. He ran at his foe, now turning to the right and now to the\r\nleft. He advanced straight against the enemy. He made ruses for drawing\r\nhis foe. He stood immovable, prepared for attacking his foe as soon as\r\nthe latter would expose himself to attack. He circumambulated his foe,\r\nand prevented his foe from circumambulating him. He avoided the blows of\r\nhis foe by moving away in bent postures or jumping aloft. He struck,\r\ncoming up to his foe face to face, or dealt back-thrusts while moving\r\naway from him. Both accomplished in encounters with the mace, Bhima and\r\nDuryodhana thus careered and fought, and struck each other. Those two\r\nforemost ones of Kuru's race careered thus, each avoiding the other's\r\nblows. Indeed, those two mighty warriors thus coursed in circles and\r\nseemed to sport with each other. Displaying in that encounter their skill\r\nin battle, those two chastisers of foes sometimes suddenly attacked each\r\nother with their weapons, like two elephants approaching and attacking\r\neach other with their tusks. Covered with blood, they looked very\r\nbeautiful, O monarch, on the field. Even thus occurred that battle,\r\nawfully and before the gaze of a large multitude, towards the close of\r\nthe day, like the battle between Vritra and Vasava. Armed with maces,\r\nboth began to career in circles. Duryodhana, O monarch, adopted the right\r\nmandala, while Bhimasena adopted the left mandala. While Bhima was thus\r\ncareering in circles on the field of battle, Duryodhana, O monarch,\r\nsuddenly struck him a fierce blow on one of his flanks. Struck by thy\r\nson, O sire, Bhima began to whirl his heavy mace for returning that blow.\r\nThe spectators, O monarch, beheld that mace of Bhimasena look as terrible\r\nas Indra's thunder-bolt or Yama's uplifted bludgeon. Seeing Bhima whirl\r\nhis mace, thy son, uplifting his own terrible weapon, struck him again.\r\nLoud was the sound, O Bharata, produced by the descent of thy son's mace.\r\nSo quick was that descent that it generated a flame of fire in the\r\nwelkin. Coursing in diverse kinds of circles, adopting each motion at the\r\nproper time, Suyodhana, possessed of great energy, once more seemed to\r\nprevail over Bhima. The massive mace of Bhimasena meanwhile, whirled with\r\nhis whole force, produced a loud sound as also smoke and sparks and\r\nflames of fire. Beholding Bhimasena whirling his mace, Suyodhana also\r\nwhirled his heavy and adamantine weapon and presented a highly beautiful\r\naspect. Marking the violence of the wind produced by the whirl of\r\nDuryodhana's mace, a great fear entered the hearts of all the Pandus and\r\nthe Somakas. Meanwhile those two chastisers of foes, displaying on every\r\nside their skill in battle, continued to strike each other with their\r\nmaces, like two elephants approaching and striking each other with their\r\ntusks. Both of them, O monarch, covered with blood, looked highly\r\nbeautiful. Even thus progressed that awful combat before the gaze of\r\nthousands of spectators at the close of day, like the fierce battle that\r\ntook place between Vritra and Vasava. Beholding Bhima firmly stationed on\r\nthe field, thy mighty son, careering in more beautiful motions, rushed\r\ntowards that son of Kunti. Filled with wrath, Bhima struck the mace,\r\nendued with great impetuosity and adorned with gold, of the angry\r\nDuryodhana. A loud sound with sparks of fire was produced by that clash\r\nof the two maces which resembled the clash of two thunder-bolts from\r\nopposite directions. Hurled by Bhimasena, his impetuous mace, as it fell\r\ndown, caused the very earth to tremble. The Kuru prince could not brook\r\nto see his own mace thus baffled in that attack. Indeed, he became filled\r\nwith rage like an infuriated elephant at the sight of a rival elephant.\r\nAdopting the left mandala, O monarch, and whirling his mace, Suyodhana\r\nthen, firmly resolved, struck the son of Kunti on the head with his\r\nweapon of terrible force. Thus struck by thy son, Bhima, the son of\r\nPandu, trembled not, O monarch, at which all the spectators wondered\r\nexceedingly. That amazing patience, O king, of Bhimasena, who stirred not\r\nan inch though struck so violently, was applauded by all the warriors\r\npresent there. Then Bhima of terrible prowess hurled at Duryodhana his\r\nown heavy and blazing mace adorned with gold. That blow the mighty and\r\nfearless Duryodhana warded off by his agility. Beholding this, great was\r\nthe wonder that the spectators felt. That mace, hurled by Bhima, O king,\r\nas it fell baffled of effect, produced a loud sound like that of the\r\nthunderbolt and caused the very earth to tremble. Adopting the manoeuvre\r\ncalled Kausika, and repeatedly jumping up, Duryodhana, properly marking\r\nthe descent of Bhima's mace, baffled the latter. Baffling Bhimasena thus,\r\nthe Kuru king, endued with great strength, at last in rage struck the\r\nformer on the chest. Struck very forcibly by thy son in that dreadful\r\nbattle, Bhimasena became stupefied and for a time knew not what to do. At\r\nthat time, O king, the Somakas and the Pandavas became greatly\r\ndisappointed and very cheerless. Filled with rage at that blow, Bhima\r\nthen rushed at thy son like an elephant rushing against an elephant.\r\nIndeed, with uplifted mace, Bhima rushed furiously at Duryodhana like a\r\nlion rushing against a wild elephant. Approaching the Kuru king, the son\r\nof Pandu, O monarch, accomplished in the use of the mace, began to whirl\r\nhis weapon, taking aim at thy son. Bhimasena then struck Duryodhana on\r\none of his flanks. Stupefied at that blow, the latter fell down on the\r\nearth, supporting himself on his knees. When that foremost one of Kuru's\r\nrace fell upon his knees, a loud cry arose from among the Srinjayas, O\r\nruler of the world! Hearing that loud uproar of the Srinjayas, O bull\r\namong men, thy son became filled with rage. The mighty-armed hero, rising\r\nup, began to breathe like a mighty snake, and seemed to burn Bhimasena by\r\ncasting his glances upon him. That foremost one of Bharata's race then\r\nrushed at Bhimasena, as if he would that time crush the head of his\r\nantagonist in that battle. The high-souled Duryodhana of terrible prowess\r\nthen struck the high-souled Bhimasena on the forehead. The latter,\r\nhowever, moved not an inch but stood immovable like a mountain. Thus\r\nstruck in that battle, the son of Pritha, O monarch, looked beautiful, as\r\nhe bled profusely, like an elephant of rent temples with juicy secretions\r\ntrickling adown. The elder brother of Dhananjaya, then, that crusher of\r\nfoes, taking up his hero-slaying mace made of iron and producing a sound\r\nloud as that of the thunder-bolt, struck his adversary with great force.\r\nStruck by Bhimasena, thy son fell down, his frame trembling all over,\r\nlike a gigantic Sala in the forest, decked with flowers, uprooted by the\r\nviolence of the tempest. Beholding thy son prostrated on the earth, the\r\nPandavas became exceedingly glad and uttered loud cries. Recovering his\r\nconsciousness, thy son then rose, like an elephant from a lake. That ever\r\nwrathful monarch and great car-warrior then careering with great skill,\r\nstruck Bhimasena who was standing before him. At this, the son of Pandu,\r\nwith weakened limbs, fell down on the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Having by his energy prostrated Bhimasena on the ground, the Kuru prince\r\nuttered a leonine roar. By the descent of his mace, whose violence\r\nresembled that of the thunder, he had fractured Bhima's coat of mail. A\r\nloud uproar was then heard in the welkin, made by the denizens of heaven\r\nand the Apsaras. A floral shower, emitting great fragrance, fell, rained\r\nby the celestials. Beholding Bhima prostrated on the earth and weakened\r\nin strength, and seeing his coat of mail laid open, a great fear entered\r\nthe hearts of our foes. Recovering his senses in a moment, and wiping his\r\nface which had been dyed with blood, and mustering great patience,\r\nVrikodara stood up, with rolling eyes steadying himself with great\r\neffort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that fight thus raging between those two\r\nforemost heroes of Kuru's race, Arjuna said unto Vasudeva, \"Between these\r\ntwo, who, in thy opinion, is superior? Who amongst them hath what merit?\r\nTell me this, O Janardana.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"The instruction received by them hath been equal.\r\nBhima, however, is possessed of greater might, while the son of\r\nDhritarashtra is possessed of greater skill and hath laboured more. If he\r\nwere to fight fairly, Bhimasena will never succeed in winning the\r\nvictory. If, however, he fights unfairly he will be surely able to slay\r\nDuryodhana. The Asuras were vanquished by the gods with the aid of\r\ndeception. We have heard this. Virochana was vanquished by Shakra with\r\nthe aid of deception. The slayer of Vala deprived Vritra of his energy by\r\nan act of deception. Therefore, let Bhimasena put forth his prowess,\r\naided by deception! At the time of the gambling, O Dhananjaya, Bhima\r\nvowed to break the thighs of Suyodhana with his mace in battle. Let this\r\ncrusher of foes, therefore, accomplish that vow of his. Let him with\r\ndeception, slay the Kuru king who is full of deception. If Bhima,\r\ndepending upon his might alone, were to fight fairly, king Yudhishthira\r\nwill have to incur great danger. I tell thee again, O son of Pandu,\r\nlisten to me. It is through the fault of king Yudhishthira alone that\r\ndanger hath once more overtaken us! Having achieved great feats by the\r\nslaughter of Bhishma and the other Kurus, the king had won victory and\r\nfame and had almost attained the end of the hostilities. Having thus\r\nobtained the victory, he placed himself once more in a situation of doubt\r\nand peril. This has been an act of great folly on the part of\r\nYudhishthira, O Pandava, since he hath made the result of the battle\r\ndepend upon the victory or the defeat of only one warrior! Suyodhana is\r\naccomplished, he is a hero; he is again firmly resolved. This old verse\r\nuttered by Usanas hath been heard by us. Listen to me as I recite it to\r\nthee with its true sense and meaning! 'Those amongst the remnant of a\r\nhostile force broken flying away for life, that rally and come back to\r\nthe fight, should always be feared, for they are firmly resolved and have\r\nbut one purpose! Shakra himself, O Dhananjaya, cannot stand before them\r\nthat rush in fury, having abandoned all hope of life. This Suyodhana had\r\nbroken and fled. All his troops had been killed. He had entered the\r\ndepths of a lake. He had been defeated and, therefore, he had desired to\r\nretire into the woods, having become hopeless of retaining his kingdom.\r\nWhat man is there, possessed of any wisdom, that would challenge such a\r\nperson to a single combat? I do not know whether Duryodhana may not\r\nsucceed in snatching the kingdom that had already become ours! For full\r\nthirteen years he practised with the mace with great resolution. Even\r\nnow, for slaying Bhimasena, he jumpeth up and leapeth transversely! If\r\nthe mighty-armed Bhima does not slay him unfairly, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra will surely remain king!\" Having heard those words of the\r\nhigh-souled Keshava, Dhananjaya struck his own left thigh before the eyes\r\nof Bhimasena. Understanding that sign, Bhima began to career with his\r\nuplifted mace, making many a beautiful circle and many a Yomaka and other\r\nkinds of manoeuvres. Sometimes adopting the right mandala, sometimes the\r\nleft mandala, and sometimes the motion called Gomutraka, the son of Pandu\r\nbegan to career, O king, stupefying his foe. Similarly, thy son, O\r\nmonarch, who was well conversant with encounters with the mace, careered\r\nbeautifully and with great activity, for slaying Bhimasena. Whirling\r\ntheir terrible maces which were smeared with sandal paste and other\r\nperfumed unguents, the two heroes, desirous of reaching the end of their\r\nhostilities, careered in that battle like two angry Yamas. Desirous of\r\nslaying each other, those two foremost of men, possessed of great\r\nheroism, fought like two Garudas desirous of catching the same snake.\r\nWhile the king and Bhima careered in beautiful circles, their maces\r\nclashed, and sparks of fire were generated by those repeated clashes.\r\nThose two heroic and mighty warriors struck each other equally in that\r\nbattle. They then resembled, O monarch, two oceans agitated by the\r\ntempest. Striking each other equally like two infuriated elephants, their\r\nclashing maces produced peals of thunder. During the progress of that\r\ndreadful and fierce battle at close quarters, both those chastisers of\r\nfoes, while battling, became fatigued. Having rested for a while, those\r\ntwo scorchers of foes, filled with rage and uplifting their maces, once\r\nmore began to battle with each other. When by the repeated descents of\r\ntheir maces, O monarch, they mangled each other, the battle they fought\r\nbecame exceedingly dreadful and perfectly unrestrained. Rushing at each\r\nother in that encounter, those two heroes, possessed of eyes like those\r\nof bulls and endued with great activity, struck each other fiercely like\r\ntwo buffaloes in the mire. All their limbs mangled and bruised, and\r\ncovered with blood from head to foot, they looked like a couple of\r\nKinsukas on the breast of Himavat. During the progress of the encounter,\r\nwhen, Vrikodara (as a ruse) seemed to give Duryodhana an opportunity, the\r\nlatter, smiling a little, advanced forward. Well-skilled in battle, the\r\nmighty Vrikodara, beholding his adversary come up, suddenly hurled his\r\nmace at him. Seeing the mace hurled at him, thy son, O monarch, moved\r\naway from that spot at which the weapon fell down baffled on the earth.\r\nHaving warded off that blow, thy son, that foremost one of Kuru's race,\r\nquickly struck Bhimasena with his weapon. In consequence of the large\r\nquantity of blood drawn by that blow, as also owing to the violence\r\nitself of the blow, Bhimasena of immeasurable energy seemed to be\r\nstupefied. Duryodhana, however, knew not that the son of Pandu was so\r\nafflicted at that moment. Though deeply afflicted, Bhima sustained\r\nhimself, summoning all his patience. Duryodhana, therefore, regarded him\r\nto be unmoved and ready to return the blow. It was for this that thy son\r\ndid not then strike him again. Having rested for a little while, the\r\nvaliant Bhimasena rushed furiously, O king, at Duryodhana who was\r\nstanding near. Beholding Bhimasena of immeasurable energy filled with\r\nrage and rushing towards him, thy high-souled son, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, desiring to baffle his blow, set his heart on the manoeuvre called\r\nAvasthana. He, therefore, desired to jump upwards, O monarch, for\r\nbeguiling Vrikodara. Bhimasena fully understood the intentions of his\r\nadversary. Rushing, therefore, at him, with a loud leonine roar, he\r\nfiercely hurled his mace at the thighs of the Kuru king as the latter had\r\njumped up for baffling the first aim. That mace, endued with the force of\r\nthe thunder and hurled by Bhima of terrible feats, fractured the two\r\nhandsome thighs of Duryodhana. That tiger among men, thy son, after his\r\nthighs had been broken by Bhimasena, fell down, causing the earth to echo\r\nwith his fall. Fierce winds began to blow, with loud sounds at repeated\r\nintervals. Showers of dust fell. The earth, with her trees and plants and\r\nmountains, began to tremble. Upon the fall of that hero who was the head\r\nof all monarchs on earth, fierce and fiery winds blew with a loud noise\r\nand with thunder falling frequently. Indeed, when that lord of earth\r\nfell, large meteors were seen to flash down from the sky. Bloody showers,\r\nas also showers of dust, fell, O Bharata! These were poured by Maghavat,\r\nupon the fall of thy son! A loud noise was heard, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, in the welkin, made by the Yakshas, and the Rakshasas and the\r\nPisachas. At that terrible sound, animals and birds, numbering in\r\nthousands, began to utter more frightful noise on every side. Those\r\nsteeds and elephants and human beings that formed the (unslain) remnant\r\nof the (Pandava) host uttered loud cries when thy son fell. Loud also\r\nbecame the blare of conchs and the peal of drums and cymbals. A terrific\r\nnoise seemed to come from within the bowels of the earth. Upon the fall\r\nof thy son, O monarch, headless beings of frightful forms, possessed of\r\nmany legs and many arms, and inspiring all creatures with dread, began to\r\ndance and cover the earth on all sides. Warriors, O king, that stood with\r\nstandards or weapons in their arms, began to tremble, O king, when thy\r\nson fell. Lakes and wells, O best of kings, vomited forth blood. Rivers\r\nof rapid currents flowed in opposite directions. Women seemed to look\r\nlike men, and men to look like women at that hour, O king, when thy son\r\nDuryodhana fell! Beholding those wonderful portents, the Pancalas and the\r\nPandavas, O bull of Bharata's race, became filled with anxiety. The gods\r\nand the Gandharvas went away to the regions they desired, talking, as\r\nthey proceeded, of that wonderful battle between thy sons. Similarly the\r\nSiddhas, and the Charanas of the fleetest course, went to those places\r\nfrom which they had come, applauding those two lions among men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Duryodhana felled upon the earth like a\r\ngigantic Sala uprooted (by the tempest) the Pandavas became filled with\r\njoy. The Somakas also beheld, with hair standing on end, the Kuru king\r\nfelled upon the earth like an infuriated elephant felled by a lion.\r\nHaving struck Duryodhana down, the valiant Bhimasena, approaching the\r\nKuru chief, addressed him, saying, \"O wretch, formerly laughing at the\r\ndisrobed Draupadi in the midst of the assembly, thou hadst, O fool,\r\naddressed us as 'Cow, Cow!' Bear now the fruit of that insult!\" Having\r\nsaid these words, he touched the head of his fallen foe with his left\r\nfoot. Indeed, he struck the head of that lion among kings with his foot.\r\nWith eyes red in wrath, Bhimasena, that grinder of hostile armies, once\r\nmore said these words. Listen to them, O monarch! \"They that danced at us\r\ninsultingly, saying, 'Cow, Cow!' we shall now dance at them, uttering the\r\nsame words, 'Cow, Cow!' We have no guile, no fire, no match, at dice, no\r\ndeception! Depending upon the might of our own arms we resist and check\r\nour foes!\" Having attained to the other shores of those fierce\r\nhostilities, Vrikodara once more laughingly said these words slowly unto\r\nYudhishthira and Keshava and Srinjaya and Dhananjaya and the two sons of\r\nMadri, \"They that had dragged Draupadi, while ill, into the assembly and\r\nhad disrobed her there, behold those Dhartarashtras slain in battle by\r\nthe Pandavas through the ascetic penances of Yajnasena's daughter! Those\r\nwicked-hearted sons of king Dhritarashtra who had called us 'Sesame seeds\r\nwithout kernel,' have all been slain by us with their relatives and\r\nfollowers! It matters little whether (as a consequence of those deeds) we\r\ngo to heaven or fall into hell!\" Once more, uplifting the mace that lay\r\non his shoulders, he struck with his left foot the head of the monarch\r\nwho was prostrate on the earth, and addressing the deceitful Duryodhana,\r\nsaid these words. Many of the foremost warriors among the Somakas, who\r\nwere all of righteous souls, beholding the foot of the rejoicing\r\nBhimasena of narrow heart placed upon the head of that foremost one of\r\nKuru's race, did not at all approve of it. While Vrikodara, after having\r\nstruck down thy son, was thus bragging and dancing madly, king\r\nYudhishthira addressed him, saying, \"Thou hast paid off thy hostility\r\n(towards Duryodhana) and accomplished thy vow by a fair or an unfair act!\r\nCease now, O Bhima! Do not crush his head with thy foot! Do not act\r\nsinfully! Duryodhana is a king! He is, again, thy kinsman! He is fallen!\r\nThis conduct of thine, O sinless one, is not proper. Duryodhana was the\r\nlord of eleven Akshauhinis of troops. He was the king of the Kurus. Do\r\nnot, O Bhima, touch a king and a kinsman with thy foot. His kinsmen are\r\nslain. His friends and counsellors are gone. His troops have been\r\nexterminated. He has been struck down in battle. He is to be pitied in\r\nevery respect. He deserves not to be insulted, for remember that he is a\r\nking. He is ruined. His friends and kinsmen have been slain. His brothers\r\nhave been killed. His sons too have been slain. His funeral cake hath\r\nbeen taken away. He is our brother. This that thou doest unto him is not\r\nproper. 'Bhimasena is a man of righteous behaviour': people used to say\r\nthis before of thee! Why then, O Bhimasena, dost thou insult the king in\r\nthis way?\" Having said these words unto Bhimasena, Yudhishthira, with\r\nvoice choked in tears, and afflicted with grief, approached Duryodhana,\r\nthat chastiser of foes, and said unto him, \"O sire, thou shouldst not\r\ngive way to anger nor grieve for thyself. Without doubt thou bearest the\r\ndreadful consequences of thy own former acts. Without doubt this sad and\r\nwoeful result had been ordained by the Creator himself, that we should\r\ninjure thee and thou shouldst injure us, O foremost one of Kuru's race!\r\nThrough thy own fault this great calamity has come upon thee, due to\r\navarice and pride and folly, O Bharata! Having caused thy companions and\r\nbrothers and sires and sons and grandsons and others to be all slain,\r\nthou comest now by thy own death. In consequence of thy fault, thy\r\nbrothers, mighty car-warriors all, and thy kinsmen have been slain by us.\r\nI think all this to be the work of irresistible Destiny. Thou art not to\r\nbe pitied. On the other hand, thy death, O sinless one, is enviable. It\r\nis we that deserve to be pitied in every respect, O Kaurava! We shall\r\nhave to drag on a miserable existence, reft of all our dear friends and\r\nkinsmen. Alas, how shall I behold the widows, overwhelmed with grief and\r\ndeprived of their senses by sorrow, of my brothers and sons and\r\ngrandsons! Thou, O king, departest from this world! Thou art sure to have\r\nthy residence in heaven! We, on the other hand, shall be reckoned as\r\ncreatures of hell, and shall continue to suffer the most poignant grief!\r\nThe grief-afflicted wives of Dhritarashtra's sons and grandsons, those\r\nwidows crushed with sorrow, will without doubt, curse us all!\" Having\r\nsaid these words, Dharma's royal son, Yudhishthira, deeply afflicted with\r\ngrief, began to breathe hard and indulge in lamentations.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding the (Kuru) king struck down unfairly,\r\nwhat O Suta, did the mighty Baladeva, that foremost one of Yadu's race,\r\nsay? Tell me, O Sanjaya, what Rohini's son, well-skilled in encounters\r\nwith the mace and well acquainted with all its rules, did on that\r\noccasion!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding thy son struck at the thighs, the mighty Rama,\r\nthat foremost of smiters, became exceedingly angry. Raising his arms\r\naloft the hero having the plough for his weapon, in a voice of deep\r\nsorrow, said in the midst of those kings, \"Oh, fie on Bhima, fie on\r\nBhima! Oh, fie, that in such a fair fight a blow hath been struck below\r\nthe navel! Never before hath such an act as Vrikodara hath done been\r\nwitnessed in an encounter with the mace! No limb below the navel should\r\nbe struck. This is the precept laid down in treatises! This Bhima,\r\nhowever, is an ignorant wretch, unacquainted with the truths of\r\ntreatises! He, therefore, acteth as he likes!\" While uttering these\r\nwords, Rama gave way to great wrath. The mighty Baladeva then, uplifting\r\nhis plough, rushed towards Bhimasena! The form of that high-souled\r\nwarrior of uplifted arms then became like that of the gigantic mountains\r\nof Kailasa variegated with diverse kinds of metals. The mighty Keshava,\r\nhowever, ever bending with humanity, seized the rushing Rama encircling\r\nhim with his massive and well-rounded arms. Those two foremost heroes of\r\nYadu's race, the one dark in complexion and the other fair, looked\r\nexceedingly beautiful at that moment, like the Sun and the Moon, O king,\r\non the evening sky! For pacifying the angry Rama, Keshava addressed him,\r\nsaying, \"There are six kinds of advancement that a person may have: one's\r\nown advancement, the advancement of one's friends, the advancement of\r\none's friends', the decay of one's enemy, the decay of one's enemy's\r\nfriends, and the decay of one's enemy's friends' friends. When reverses\r\nhappen to one's own self or to one's friends, one should then understand\r\nthat one's fall is at hand and, therefore, one should at such times look\r\nfor the means of applying a remedy. The Pandavas of unsullied prowess are\r\nour natural friends. They are the children of our own sire's sister! They\r\nhad been greatly afflicted by their foes! The accomplishment of one's vow\r\nis one's duty. Formerly Bhima had vowed in the midst of the assembly that\r\nhe would in great battle break with his mace the thighs of Duryodhana.\r\nThe great Rishi Maitreya also, O scorcher of foes, had formerly cursed\r\nDuryodhana, saying, 'Bhima will, with his mace, break thy thighs!' In\r\nconsequence of all this, I do not see any fault in Bhima! Do not give way\r\nto wrath, O slayer of Pralamva! Our relationship with the Pandavas is\r\nfounded upon birth and blood, as also upon an attraction of hearts. In\r\ntheir growth is our growth. Do not, therefore, give way to wrath, O bull\r\namong men!\" Hearing these words of Vasudeva the wielder of the plough,\r\nwho was conversant with rules of morality, said, \"Morality is well\r\npractised by the good. Morality, however, is always afflicted by two\r\nthings, the desire of Profit entertained by those that covet it, and the\r\ndesire for Pleasure cherished by those that are wedded to it. Whoever\r\nwithout afflicting Morality and Profit, or Morality and Pleasure, or\r\nPleasure and Profit, followeth all three--Morality, Profit and\r\nPleasure--always succeeds in obtaining great happiness. In consequence,\r\nhowever, of morality being afflicted by Bhimasena, this harmony of which\r\nI have spoken hath been disturbed, whatever, O Govinda, thou mayst tell\r\nme!\" Krishna replied, saying, \"Thou art always described as bereft of\r\nwrath, and righteous-souled and devoted to righteousness! Calm thyself,\r\ntherefore, and do not give way to wrath! Know that the Kali age is at\r\nhand. Remember also the vow made by the son of Pandu! Let, therefore, the\r\nson of Pandu be regarded to have paid off the debt he owed to his\r\nhostility and to have fulfilled his vow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing this fallacious discourse from Keshava, O\r\nking, Rama failed to dispel his wrath and became cheerful. He then said\r\nin that assembly, \"Having unfairly slain king Suyodhana of righteous\r\nsoul, the son of Pandu shall be reputed in the world as a crooked\r\nwarrior! The righteous-souled Duryodhana, on the other hand, shall obtain\r\neternal blessedness! Dhritarashtra's royal son, that ruler of men, who\r\nhath been struck down, is a fair warrior. Having made every arrangement\r\nfor the Sacrifice of battle and having undergone the initiatory\r\nceremonies on the field, and, lastly, having poured his life as a\r\nlibation upon the fire represented by his foes, Duryodhana has fairly\r\ncompleted his sacrifice by the final ablutions represented by the\r\nattainment of glory!\" Having said these words, the valiant son of Rohini,\r\nlooking like the crest of a white cloud, ascended his car and proceeded\r\ntowards Dwaraka. The Pancalas with the Vrishnis, as also the Pandavas, O\r\nmonarch, became rather cheerless after Rama had set out for Dwaravati.\r\nThen Vasudeva, approaching Yudhishthira who was exceedingly melancholy\r\nand filled with anxiety, and who hung down his head and knew not what to\r\ndo in consequence of his deep affliction, said unto him these words:\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"O Yudhishthira the just, why dost thou sanction this\r\nunrighteous act, since thou permittest the head of the insensible and\r\nfallen Duryodhana whose kinsmen and friends have all been slain to be\r\nthus struck by Bhima with his foot. Conversant with the ways of morality,\r\nwhy dost thou, O king, witness this act with indifference?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira answered, \"This act, O Krishna, done from wrath, of\r\nVrikodara's touching the head of the king with his foot, is not agreeable\r\nto me, nor am I glad at this extermination of my race! By guile were we\r\nalways deceived by the sons of Dhritarashtra! Many were the cruel words\r\nthey spoke to us. We were again exiled into the woods by them. Great is\r\nthe grief on account of all those acts that is in Bhimasena's heart!\r\nReflecting on all this, O thou of Vrishni's race, I looked on with\r\nindifference! Having slain the covetous Duryodhana bereft of wisdom and\r\nenslaved by his passions, let the son of Pandu gratify his desire, be it\r\nrighteousness or unrighteousness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'After Yudhishthira had said this, Vasudeva, that\r\nperpetuator of Yadu's race, said with difficulty, \"Let it be so!\" Indeed,\r\nafter Vasudeva had been addressed in those words by Yudhishthira, the\r\nformer, who, always wished what was agreeable to and beneficial for\r\nBhima, approved all those acts that Bhima had done in battle. Having\r\nstruck down thy son in battle, the wrathful Bhimasena, his heart filled\r\nwith joy, stood with joined hands before Yudhishthira and saluted him in\r\nproper form. With eyes expanded in delight and proud of the victory he\r\nhad won, Vrikodara of great energy, O king, addressed his eldest brother,\r\nsaying, \"The Earth is today thine, O king, without brawls to disturb her\r\nand with all her thorns removed! Rule over her, O monarch, and observe\r\nthe duties of thy order! He who was the cause of these hostilities and\r\nwho fomented them by means of his guile, that wretched wight fond of\r\ndeception, lieth, struck down, on the bare ground, O lord of earth! All\r\nthese wretches headed by Duhshasana, who used to utter cruel words, as\r\nalso those other foes of thine, the son of Radha, and Shakuni, have been\r\nslain! Teeming with all kinds of gems, the Earth, with her forests and\r\nmountains, O monarch, once more cometh to thee that hast no foes alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yudhishthira said, \"Hostilities have come to an end! King Suyodhana\r\nhath been struck down! The earth hath been conquered (by us), ourselves\r\nhaving acted according to the counsels of Krishna! By good luck, thou\r\nhast paid off thy debt to thy mother and to thy wrath! By good luck, thou\r\nhast been victorious, O invincible hero, and by good luck, thy foe hath\r\nbeen slain!\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding Duryodhana struck down in battle by\r\nBhimasena, what, O Sanjaya, did the Pandavas and the Srinjayas do?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Duryodhana slain by Bhimasena in battle, O\r\nking, like a wild elephant slain by a lion, the Pandavas with Krishna\r\nbecame filled with delight. The Pancalas and the Srinjayas also, upon the\r\nfall of the Kuru king, waved their upper garments (in the air) and\r\nuttered leonine roars. The very Earth seemed to be unable to bear those\r\nrejoicing warriors. Some stretched their bows; others drew their\r\nbowstrings. Some blew their huge conchs; others beat their drums. Some\r\nsported and jumped about, while some amongst thy foes laughed aloud. Many\r\nheroes repeatedly said these words unto Bhimasena, \"Exceedingly difficult\r\nand great hath been the fears that thou hast achieved today in battle, by\r\nhaving struck down the Kuru king, himself a great warrior, with thy mace!\r\nAll these men regard this slaughter of the foe by thee to be like that of\r\nVritra by Indra himself! Who else, save thyself, O Vrikodara, could slay\r\nthe heroic Duryodhana while careering in diverse kinds of motion and\r\nperforming all the wheeling manoeuvres (characteristic of such\r\nencounters)? Thou hast now reached the other shore of these hostilities,\r\nthat other shore which none else could reach. This feat that thou hast\r\nachieved is incapable of being achieved by any other warriors. By good\r\nluck, thou hast, O hero, like an infuriated elephant, crushed with thy\r\nfoot the head of Duryodhana on the field of battle! Having fought a\r\nwonderful battle, by good luck, O sinless one, thou hast quaffed the\r\nblood of Duhshasana, like a lion quaffing the blood of a buffalo! By good\r\nluck, thou hast, by thy own energy, placed thy foot on the head of all\r\nthose that had injured the righteous-souled king Yudhishthira! In\r\nconsequence of having vanquished thy foes and of thy having slain\r\nDuryodhana, by good luck, O Bhima, thy fame hath spread over the whole\r\nworld! Bards and eulogists applauded Shakra after the fall of Vritra,\r\neven as we are now applauding thee, O Bharata, after the fall of thy\r\nfoes! Know, O Bharata, that the joy we felt upon the fall of Duryodhana\r\nhath not yet abated in the least!\" Even these were the words addressed to\r\nBhimasena by the assembled eulogists on that occasion! Whilst those\r\ntigers among men, the Pancalas and the Pandavas, all filled with delight\r\nwere indulging in such language, the slayer of Madhu addressed them,\r\nsaying, \"You rulers of men, it is not proper to slay a slain foe with\r\nsuch cruel speeches repeatedly uttered. This wight of wicked\r\nunderstanding hath already been slain. This sinful, shameless, and\r\ncovetous wretch, surrounded by sinful counsellors and ever regardless of\r\nthe advice of wise friends, met with his death even when he refused,\r\nthough repeatedly urged to contrary by Vidura and Drona and Kripa and\r\nSanjaya, to give unto the sons of Pandu their paternal share in the\r\nkingdom which they had solicited at his hands! This wretch is not now fit\r\nto be regarded either as a friend or a foe! What use in spending bitter\r\nbreath upon one who hath now become a piece of wood! Mount your cars\r\nquickly, ye kings, for we should leave this place! By good luck, this\r\nsinful wretch hath been slain with his counsellors and kinsmen and\r\nfriends!\" Hearing these rebukes from Krishna, king Duryodhana, O monarch,\r\ngave way to wrath and endeavoured to rise. Sitting on his haunches and\r\nsupporting himself on his two arms, he contracted his eyebrows and cast\r\nangry glances at Vasudeva. The form then of Duryodhana whose body was\r\nhalf raised looked like that of a poisonous snake, O Bharata, shorn of\r\nits tail. Disregarding his poignant and unbearable pains, Duryodhana\r\nbegan to afflict Vasudeva with keen and bitter words, \"O son of Kansa's\r\nslave, thou hast, it seems, no shame, for hast thou forgotten that I have\r\nbeen struck down most unfairly, judged by the rules that prevail in\r\nencounters with the mace? It was thou who unfairly caused this act by\r\nreminding Bhima with a hint about the breaking of my thighs! Dost thou\r\nthink I did not mark it when Arjuna (acting under thy advice) hinted it\r\nto Bhima? Having caused thousands of kings, who always fought fairly, to\r\nbe slain through diverse kinds of unfair means, feelest thou no shame or\r\nno abhorrence for those acts? Day after day having caused a great carnage\r\nof heroic warriors, thou causedst the grandsire to be slain by placing\r\nShikhandi to the fore! Having again caused an elephant of the name of\r\nAshvatthama to be slain, O thou of wicked understanding, thou causedst\r\nthe preceptor to lay aside his weapons. Thinkest thou that this is not\r\nknown to me! While again that valiant hero was about to be slain this\r\ncruel Dhrishtadyumna, thou didst not dissuade the latter! The dart that\r\nhad been begged (of Shakra as a boon) by Karna for the slaughter of\r\nArjuna was baffled by thee through Ghatotkacha! Who is there that is more\r\nsinful than thou? Similarly, the mighty Bhurishrava, with one of his arms\r\nlopped off and while observant of the Praya vow, was caused to be slain\r\nby thee through the agency of the high-souled Satyaki. Karna had done a\r\ngreat feat for vanquishing Partha. Thou, however, causedst Aswasena, the\r\nson of that prince of snakes (Takshaka), to be baffled in achieving his\r\npurpose! When again the wheel of Karna's car sank in mire and Karna was\r\nafflicted with calamity and almost vanquished on that account, when,\r\nindeed, that foremost of men became anxious to liberate his wheel, thou\r\ncausedst that Karna to be then slain! If ye had fought me and Karna and\r\nBhishma and Drona by fair means, victory then, without doubt, would never\r\nhave been yours. By adopting the most crooked and unrighteous of means\r\nthou hast caused many kings observant of the duties of their order and\r\nourselves also to be slain!'\r\n\r\n\"'Vasudeva said, \"Thou, O son of Gandhari, hast been slain with thy\r\nbrothers, sons, kinsmen, friends, and followers, only in consequence of\r\nthe sinful path in which thou hast trod! Through thy evil acts those two\r\nheroes, Bhishma and Drona, have been slain! Karna too hath been slain for\r\nhaving imitated thy behaviour! Solicited by me, O fool, thou didst not,\r\nfrom avarice, give the Pandavas their paternal share, acting according to\r\nthe counsels of Shakuni! Thou gavest poison to Bhimasena! Thou hadst,\r\nalso, O thou of wicked understanding, endeavoured to burn all the\r\nPandavas with their mother at the palace of lac! On the occasion also of\r\nthe gambling, thou hadst persecuted the daughter of Yajnasena, while in\r\nher season, in the midst of the assembly! Shameless as thou art, even\r\nthen thou becamest worthy of being slain! Thou hadst, through Subala's\r\nson well-versed in dice, unfairly vanquished the virtuous Yudhishthira\r\nwho was unskilled in gambling! For that art thou slain! Through the\r\nsinful Jayadratha again, Krishna was on another occasion persecuted when\r\nthe Pandavas, her lords, had gone out hunting towards the hermitage of\r\nTrinavindu! Causing Abhimanyu, who was a child and alone, to be\r\nsurrounded by many, thou didst slay that hero. It is in consequence of\r\nthat fault, O sinful wretch, that thou art slain! All those unrighteous\r\nacts that thou sayest have been perpetrated by us, have in reality been\r\nperpetrated by thee in consequence of thy sinful nature! Thou didst never\r\nlisten to the counsels of Brihaspati and Usanas! Thou didst never wait\r\nupon the old! Thou didst never hear beneficial words! Enslaved by\r\nungovernable covetousness and thirst of gain, thou didst perpetrate many\r\nunrighteous acts! Bear now the consequences of those acts of thine!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Duryodhana said, \"I have studied, made presents according to the\r\nordinance, governed the wide Earth with her seas, and stood over the\r\nheads of my foes! Who is there so fortunate as myself! That end again\r\nwhich is courted by Kshatriyas observant of the duties of their own\r\norder, death in battle, hath become mine. Who, therefore, is so fortunate\r\nas myself? Human enjoyments such as were worthy of the very gods and such\r\nas could with difficulty be obtained by other kings, had been mine.\r\nProsperity of the very highest kind had been attained by me! Who then is\r\nso fortunate as myself? With all my well-wishers, and my younger\r\nbrothers, I am going to heaven, O thou of unfading glory! As regards\r\nyourselves, with your purposes unachieved and torn by grief, live ye in\r\nthis unhappy world!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Upon the conclusion of these words of the\r\nintelligent king of the Kurus, a thick shower of fragrant flowers fell\r\nfrom the sky. The Gandharvas played upon many charming musical\r\ninstruments. The Apsaras in a chorus sang the glory of king Duryodhana.\r\nThe Siddhas uttered loud sound to the effect, \"Praise be to king\r\nDuryodhana!\" Fragrant and delicious breezes mildly blew on every side.\r\nAll the quarters became clear and the firmament looked blue as the lapis\r\nlazuli. Beholding these exceedingly wonderful things and this worship\r\noffered to Duryodhana, the Pandavas headed by Vasudeva became ashamed.\r\nHearing (invisible beings cry out) that Bhishma and Drona and Karna and\r\nBhurishrava were slain unrighteously, they became afflicted with grief\r\nand wept in sorrow. Beholding the Pandavas filled with anxiety and grief,\r\nKrishna addressed them in a voice deep as that of the clouds or the drum,\r\nsaying, \"All of them were great car-warriors and exceedingly quick in the\r\nuse of weapons! If ye had put forth all your prowess, even then ye could\r\nnever have slain them in battle by fighting fairly! King Duryodhana also\r\ncould never be slain in a fair encounter! The same is the case with all\r\nthose mighty car-warriors headed by Bhishma! From desire of doing good to\r\nyou, I repeatedly applied my powers of illusion and caused them to be\r\nslain by diverse means in battle. If I had not adopted such deceitful\r\nways in battle, victory would never have been yours, nor kingdom, nor\r\nwealth! Those four were very high-souled warriors and regarded as\r\nAtirathas in the world. The very Regents of the Earth could not slay them\r\nin fair fight! Similarly, the son of Dhritarashtra, though fatigued when\r\narmed with the mace, could not be slain in fair fight by Yama himself\r\narmed with his bludgeon! You should not take it to heart that this foe of\r\nyours hath been slain deceitfully. When the number of one's foes becomes\r\ngreat, then destruction should be effected by contrivances and means. The\r\ngods themselves, in slaying the Asuras, have trod the same way. That way,\r\ntherefore, that hath been trod by the gods, may be trod by all. We have\r\nbeen crowned with success. It is evening. We had better depart to our\r\ntents. Let us all, ye kings, take rest with our steeds and elephants and\r\ncars.\" Hearing these words of Vasudeva, the Pandavas and the Pancalas,\r\nfilled with delight, roared like a multitude of lions. All of them blew\r\ntheir conchs and Jadava himself blew Panchajanya, filled with joy, O bull\r\namong men, at the sight of Duryodhana struck down in battle.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"All those kings, possessed of arms that resembled spiked\r\nbludgeons, then proceeded towards their tents, filled with joy and\r\nblowing their conchs on their way. The Pandavas also, O monarch,\r\nproceeded towards our encampment. The great bowman Yuyutsu followed them,\r\nas also Satyaki, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and the five sons of\r\nDraupadi. The other great bowmen also proceeded towards our tents. The\r\nParthas then entered the tent of Duryodhana, shorn of its splendours and\r\nreft of its lord and looking like an arena of amusement after it has been\r\ndeserted by spectators. Indeed, that pavilion looked like a city reft of\r\nfestivities, or a lake without its elephant. It then swarmed with women\r\nand eunuchs and certain aged counsellors. Duryodhana and other heroes,\r\nattired in robes dyed in yellow, formerly used, O king, to wait\r\nreverentially, with joined hands, on those old counsellors.\r\n\r\nArrived at the pavilion of the Kuru king, the Pandavas, those foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, O monarch, dismounted from their cars. At that time, always\r\nengaged, O bull of Bharata's race, in the good of his friend, Keshava,\r\naddressed the wielder of gandiva, saying, \"Take down thy gandiva as also\r\nthe two inexhaustible quivers. I shall dismount after thee, O best of the\r\nBharatas! Get thee down, for this is for thy good, O sinless one!\"\r\n\r\nPandu's brave son Dhananjaya did as he was directed. The intelligent\r\nKrishna, abandoning the reins of the steeds, then dismounted from the car\r\nof Dhananjaya. After the high-souled Lord of all creatures had dismounted\r\nfrom that car, the celestial Ape that topped the mantle of Arjuna's\r\nvehicle, disappeared there and then. The top of the vehicle, which had\r\nbefore been burnt by Drona and Karna with their celestial weapons,\r\nquickly blazed forth to ashes, O king, without any visible fire having\r\nbeen in sight. Indeed, the car of Dhananjaya, with its quick pairs of\r\nsteeds, yoke, and shaft, fell down, reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nBeholding the vehicle thus reduced to ashes, O lord, the sons of Pandu\r\nbecame filled with wonder, and Arjuna, O king, having saluted Krishna and\r\nbowed unto him, said these words, with joined hands and in an\r\naffectionate voice, 'O Govinda, O divine one, for what reason hath this\r\ncar been consumed by fire? What is this highly wonderful incident that\r\nhas happened before our eyes! O thou of mighty arms, if thou thinkest\r\nthat I can listen to it without harm, then tell me everything.'\r\n\r\nVasudeva said, 'That car, O Arjuna, had before been consumed by diverse\r\nkinds of weapons. It was because I had sat upon it during battle that it\r\ndid not fall into pieces, O scorcher of foes! Previously consumed by the\r\nenergy of brahmastra, it has been reduced to ashes upon my abandoning it\r\nafter attainment by thee of thy objects!'\r\n\r\nThen, with a little pride, that slayer of foes, the divine Keshava,\r\nembracing king Yudhishthira, said unto him, 'By good luck, thou hast won\r\nthe victory, O son of Kunti! By good luck, thy foes have been vanquished!\r\nBy good luck, the wielder of gandiva, Bhimasena the son of Pandu,\r\nthyself, O king, and the two sons of Madri have escaped with life from\r\nthis battle so destructive of heroes, and have escaped after having slain\r\nall your foes! Quickly do that, O Bharata, which should now be done by\r\nthee!\r\n\r\nAfter I had arrived at Upaplavya, thyself, approaching me, with the\r\nwielder of gandiva in thy company, gavest me honey and the customary\r\ningredients, and saidst these words, O Lord: 'This Dhananjaya, O Krishna,\r\nis thy brother and friend! He should, therefore, be protected by thee in\r\nall dangers!' After thou didst say these words, I answered thee, saying,\r\n'So be it!'\r\n\r\nThat Savyasaci hath been protected by me. Victory also hath been thine, O\r\nking! With his brothers, O king of kings, that hero of true prowess hath\r\ncome out of this dreadful battle, so destructive of heroes, with life!'\r\nThus addressed by Krishna, King Yudhishthira the just, with hair standing\r\non end, O monarch, said these words unto Janardana:\r\n\r\nYudhishthira said, \"Who else save thee, O grinder of foes, not excepting\r\nthe thunder-wielding Purandara himself, could have withstood the\r\nbrahmastras hurled by Drona and Karna! It was through thy grace that the\r\nsamsaptakas were vanquished! It was through thy grace that Partha had\r\nnever to turn back from even the fiercest of encounters! Similarly, it\r\nwas through thy grace, O mighty-armed one, that I myself, with my\r\nposterity, have, by accomplishing diverse acts one after another,\r\nobtained the auspicious end of prowess and energy! At Upaplavya, the\r\ngreat rishi Krishna-Dvaipayana told me that thither is Krishna where\r\nrighteousness is, and thither is victory where Krishna is!'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"After this conversation, those heroes entered thy\r\nencampment and obtained the military chest, many jewels, and much wealth.\r\nAnd they also obtained silver and gold and gems and pearls and many\r\ncostly ornaments and blankets and skins, and innumerable slaves male and\r\nfemale, and many other things necessary for sovereignty. Having obtained\r\nthat inexhaustible wealth belonging to thee, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nthose highly blessed ones, whose foe had been slain, uttered loud cries\r\nof exultation. Having unyoked their animals, the Pandavas and Satyaki\r\nremained there awhile for resting themselves.\r\n\r\nThen Vasudeva of great renown said, 'We should, as an initiatory act of\r\nblessedness, remain out of the camp for this night.' Answering, 'So be\r\nit!' the Pandavas and Satyaki, accompanied by Vasudeva, went out of the\r\ncamp for the sake of doing that which was regarded as an auspicious act.\r\nArrived on the banks of the sacred stream Oghavati, O king, the Pandavas,\r\nreft of foes, took up their quarters there for that night!\r\n\r\nThey despatched Keshava of Yadu's race to Hastinapura. Vasudeva of great\r\nprowess, causing Daruka to get upon his car, proceeded very quickly to\r\nthat place where the royal son of Ambika was. While about to start on his\r\ncar having Shaibya and Sugriva (and the others) yoked unto it, (the\r\nPandavas) said unto him, 'Comfort the helpless Gandhari who hath lost all\r\nher sons!' Thus addressed by the Pandavas, that chief of the Satvatas\r\nthen proceeded towards Hastinapura and arrived at the presence of\r\nGandhari who had lost all her sons in the war.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"For what reason did that tiger among kings,\r\nYudhishthira the just, despatch that scorcher of foes, Vasudeva, unto\r\nGandhari? Krishna had at first gone to the Kauravas for the sake of\r\nbringing about peace. He did not obtain the fruition of his wishes. In\r\nconsequence of this the battle took place. When all the warriors were\r\nslain and Duryodhana was struck down, when in consequence of the battle\r\nthe empire of Pandu's son became perfectly foeless, when all the (Kuru)\r\ncamp became empty, all its inmates having fled, when great renown was won\r\nby the son of Pandu, what, O regenerate one, was the cause for which\r\nKrishna had once again to go to Hastinapura? It seems to me, O Brahmana,\r\nthat the cause could not be a light one, for it was Janardana of\r\nimmeasurable soul who had himself to make the journey! O foremost of all\r\nAdhyaryus, tell me in detail what the cause was for undertaking such a\r\nmission!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"The question thou askest me, O king, is, indeed,\r\nworthy of thee! I will tell thee everything truly as it occurred, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race! Beholding Duryodhana, the mighty son of Dhritarashtra,\r\nstruck down by Bhimasena in contravention of the rules of fair fight, in\r\nfact, beholding the Kuru king slain unfairly, O Bharata, Yudhishthira, O\r\nmonarch, became filled with great fear, at the thought of the highly\r\nblessed Gandhari possessed of ascetic merit. \"She hath undergone severe\r\nascetic austerities and can, therefore, consume the three worlds,\" even\r\nthus thought the son of Pandu. By sending Krishna, Gandhari, blazing with\r\nwrath, would be comforted before Yudhishthira's own arrival. \"Hearing of\r\nthe death of her son brought to such a plight by ourselves, she will, in\r\nwrath, with the fire of her mind, reduce us to ashes! How will Gandhari\r\nendure such poignant grief, after she hears her son, who always fought\r\nfairly, slain unfairly by us?\" Having reflected in this strain for a long\r\nwhile, king Yudhishthira the just, filled with fear and grief, said these\r\nwords unto Vasudeva: \"Through thy grace, O Govinda, my kingdom hath been\r\nreft of thorns! That which we could not in imagination even aspire to\r\nobtain hath now become ours, O thou of unfading glory! Before my eyes, O\r\nmighty-armed one, making the very hair stand on end, violent were the\r\nblows that thou hadst to bear, O delighter of the Yadavas! In the battle\r\nbetween the gods and the Asuras, thou hadst, in days of old, lent thy aid\r\nfor the destruction of the foes of the gods and those foes were slain! In\r\nthe same way, O mighty-armed one, thou hast given us aid, O thou of\r\nunfading glory! By agreeing to act as our charioteer, O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace, thou hast all along protected us! If thou hadst not been the\r\nprotector of Phalguna in dreadful battle, how could then this sea of\r\ntroops have been capable of being vanquished? Many were the blows of the\r\nmace, and many were the strokes of spiked bludgeons and darts and sharp\r\narrows and lances and battle axes, that have been endured by thee! For\r\nour sake, O Krishna, thou hadst also to hear many harsh words and endure\r\nthe fall, violent as the thunder, of weapons in battle! In consequence of\r\nDuryodhana's slaughter, all this has not been fruitless, O thou of\r\nunfading glory! Act thou again in such a way that the fruit of all those\r\nacts may not be destroyed! Although victory hath been ours, O Krishna,\r\nour heart, however, is yet trembling in doubt! Know, O Madhava, that\r\nGandhari's wrath, O mighty-armed one, hath been provoked! That\r\nhighly-blessed lady is always emaciating herself with the austerest of\r\npenances! Hearing of the slaughter of her sons and grandsons, she will,\r\nwithout doubt, consume us to ashes! It is time, O hero, I think, for\r\npacifying her! Except thee, O foremost of men, what other person is there\r\nthat is able to even behold that lady of eyes red like copper in wrath\r\nand exceedingly afflicted with the ills that have befallen her children?\r\nThat thou shouldst go there, O Madhava, is what I think to be proper, for\r\npacifying Gandhari, O chastiser of foes, who is blazing with wrath! Thou\r\nart the Creator and the Destroyer. Thou art the first cause of all the\r\nworlds thyself being eternal! By words fraught with reasons, visible and\r\ninvisible that are all the result of time, thou wilt quickly, O thou of\r\ngreat wisdom, be able to pacify Gandhari! Our grandsire, thy holy\r\nKrishna-Dvaipayana, will be there. O mighty-armed one, it is thy duty to\r\ndispel, by all means in thy power, the wrath of Gandhari!\" Hearing these\r\nwords of king Yudhishthira the just, the perpetuator of Yadu's race,\r\nsummoning Daruka, said, \"Let my car be equipped!\" Having received\r\nKeshava's command, Daruka in great haste, returned and represented unto\r\nhis high-souled master that the car was ready. That scorcher of foes and\r\nchief of Yadu's race, the lord Keshava, having mounted the car, proceeded\r\nwith great haste to the city of the Kurus. The adorable Madhava then,\r\nriding on his vehicle, proceeded, and arriving at the city called after\r\nthe elephant entered it. Causing the city to resound with the rattle of\r\nhis car-wheels as he entered it, he sent word to Dhritarashtra and then\r\nalighted from his vehicle and entered the palace of the old king. He\r\nthere beheld that best of Rishis, (Dvaipayana) arrived before him.\r\nJanardana, embracing the feet of both Vyasa and Dhritarashtra, quietly\r\nsaluted Gandhari also. Then the foremost of the Yadavas, Vishnu seizing\r\nDhritarashtra by the hand, O monarch, began to weep melodiously. Having\r\nshed tears for a while from sorrow, he washed his eyes and his face with\r\nwater according to rules. That chastiser of foes then said these softly\r\nflowing words unto Dhritarashtra, \"Nothing is unknown to thee, O Bharata,\r\nabout the past and the future! Thou art well-acquainted, O lord, with the\r\ncourse of time! From a regard for thee, the Pandavas had endeavoured to\r\nprevent the destruction of their race and the extermination of\r\nKshatriyas, O Bharata! Having made an understanding with his brothers,\r\nthe virtuous Yudhishthira had lived peacefully. He even went to exile\r\nafter defeat at unfair dice! With his brothers he led a life of\r\nconcealment, attired in various disguises. They also every day got into\r\ndiverse other woes as if they were quite helpless! On the eve of battle I\r\nmyself came and in the presence of all men begged of thee only five\r\nvillages. Afflicted by Time, and moved by covetousness, thou didst not\r\ngrant my request. Through thy fault, O king, all the Kshatriya race hath\r\nbeen exterminated! Bhishma, and Somadatta, and Valhika, and Kripa, and\r\nDrona and his son, and the wise Vidura, always solicited thee for peace.\r\nThou didst not, however, follow their counsels! Everyone, it seems, when\r\nafflicted by Time, is stupefied, O Bharata, since even thou, O king, as\r\nregards this matter, did act so foolishly! What else can it be but the\r\neffect of Time? Indeed, Destiny is supreme! Do not, O thou of great\r\nwisdom, impute any fault to the Pandavas! The smallest transgression is\r\nnot discernible in the high-souled Pandavas, judged by the rules of\r\nmorality or reason or affection, O scorcher of foes! Knowing all this to\r\nbe the fruit of thy own fault, it behoveth thee not to cherish any\r\nill-feeling towards the Pandavas! Race, line, funeral cake, and what else\r\ndepends upon offspring, now depend on the Pandavas as regards both\r\nthyself and Gandhari! Thyself, O tiger among the Kurus, and the renowned\r\nGandhari also, should not harbour malice towards the Pandavas. Reflecting\r\nupon all this, and thinking also of thy own transgressions, cherish good\r\nfeeling towards the Pandavas, I bow to thee, O bull of Bharata's race!\r\nThou knowest, O mighty-armed one, what the devotion is of king\r\nYudhishthira and what his affection is towards thee, O tiger among kings!\r\nHaving caused this slaughter of even foes that wronged him so, he is\r\nburning day and night, and hath not succeeded in obtaining peace of mind!\r\nThat tiger among men, grieving for thee and for Gandhari, faileth to\r\nobtain any happiness. Overwhelmed with shame he cometh not before thee\r\nthat art burning with grief on account of thy children and whose\r\nunderstanding and senses have been agitated by that grief!\" Having said\r\nthese words unto Dhritarashtra, that foremost one of Yadu's race, O\r\nmonarch, addressed the grief-stricken Gandhari in these words of high\r\nimport: \"O daughter of Subala, thou of excellent vows, listen to what I\r\nsay! O auspicious dame, there is now no lady like thee in the world! Thou\r\nrememberest, O queen, those words that thou spokest in the assembly in my\r\npresence, those words fraught with righteousness and that were beneficial\r\nto both parties, which thy sons, O auspicious lady, did not obey!\r\nDuryodhana who coveted victory was addressed by thee in bitter words!\r\nThou toldst him then. 'Listen, O fool, to these words of mine: \"thither\r\nis victory where righteousness is.\"' Those words of thine, O princess,\r\nhave now been accomplished! Knowing all this, O auspicious lady, do not\r\nset thy heart on sorrow. Let not thy heart incline towards the\r\ndestruction of the Pandavas! In consequence of the strength of thy\r\npenances, thou art able, O highly blessed one, to burn, with thy eyes\r\nkindled with rage, the whole Earth with her mobile and immobile\r\ncreatures!\" Hearing these words of Vasudeva, Gandhari said, \"It is even\r\nso, O Keshava, as thou sayest! My heart, burning in grief, has been\r\nunsteadied! After hearing thy words, however, that heart, O Janardana,\r\nhath again become steady. As regards the blind old king, now become\r\nchild, thou, O foremost of men, with those heroes, the sons of Pandu,\r\nhast become his refuge!\" Having said so much, Gandhari, burning in grief\r\non account of the death of her sons, covered her face with her cloth and\r\nbegan to weep aloud. The mighty-armed lord Keshava then comforted the\r\ngrief-stricken princess with words that were fraught with reasons drawn\r\nfrom visible instances. Having comforted Gandhari and Dhritarashtra,\r\nKeshava of Madhu's race came to know (by intuition) the evil that was\r\nmeditated by Drona's son. Rising up in haste after worshipping the feet\r\nof Vyasa bending his head, Keshava, O monarch, addressed Dhritarashtra,\r\nsaying, \"I take my leave, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Do not set thy\r\nheart on grief! The son of Drona bears an evil purpose. It is for this\r\nthat I rise so suddenly! It seems that he has formed a plan of destroying\r\nthe Pandavas during the night!\" Hearing these words, both Gandhari and\r\nDhritarashtra said unto Keshava that slayer of Keshi, these words: \"Go,\r\nquickly, O mighty-armed one, protect the Pandavas! Let me soon meet thee\r\nagain, O Janardana!\" Then Keshava of unfading glory proceeded with\r\nDaruka. After Vasudeva had departed, O king, Vyasa, that adored of the\r\nwhole world, of inconceivable soul, began to comfort king Dhritarashtra.\r\nThe righteous-souled Vasudeva departed, having achieved his mission\r\nsuccessfully, from Hastinapura, for seeing the camp and the Pandavas.\r\nArrived at the camp, he proceeded to the presence of the Pandavas.\r\nTelling them everything (about his mission to the city), he took his seat\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Kicked at the head, his thighs broken, prostrated\r\non the ground, exceedingly proud, what, O Sanjaya, did my son then say?\r\nKing Duryodhana was exceedingly wrathful and his hostility to the sons of\r\nPandu was deep-rooted. When therefore this great calamity overtook him,\r\nwhat did he next say on the field?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen to me, O monarch, as I describe to thee what\r\nhappened. Listen, O king, to what Duryodhana said when overtaken by\r\ncalamity. With his thighs broken, the king, O monarch, covered with dust,\r\ngathered his flowing locks, casting his eyes on all sides. Having with\r\ndifficulty gathered his locks, he began to sigh like a snake. Filled with\r\nrage and with tears flowing fast from his eyes, he looked at me. He\r\nstruck his arms against the Earth for a while like an infuriated\r\nelephant. Shaking his loose locks, and gnashing his teeth, he began to\r\ncensure the eldest son of Pandu. Breathing heavily, he then addressed me,\r\nsaying, \"Alas, I who had Santanu's son Bhishma for my protector, and\r\nKarna, that foremost of all wielders of weapons and Gotama's son,\r\nShakuni, and Drona, that first of all wielders of arms, and Ashvatthama,\r\nand the heroic Shalya, and Kritavarma, alas, even I have come to this\r\nplight! It seems that Time is irresistible! I was the lord of eleven\r\nChamus of troops and yet I have come to this plight! O mighty-armed one,\r\nno one can rise superior to Time! Those of my side that have escaped with\r\nlife from this battle should be informed, how I have been struck down by\r\nBhimasena in contravention of the rules of fair fight! Many have been the\r\nvery unfair and sinful acts that have been perpetrated towards\r\nBhurishrava, and Bhishma, and Drona of great prosperity! This is another\r\nvery infamous act that the cruel Pandavas have perpetrated, for which, I\r\nam certain, they will incur the condemnation of all righteous men! What\r\npleasure can a righteously disposed person enjoy at having gained a\r\nvictory by unfair acts? What wise man, again, is there that would accord\r\nhis approbation to a person contravening the rules of fairness? What\r\nlearned man is there that would rejoice after having won victory by\r\nunrighteousness as that sinful wretch, Vrikodara the son of Pandu,\r\nrejoices? What can be more amazing than this, that Bhimasena in wrath\r\nshould with his foot touch the head of one like me while lying with my\r\nthighs broken? Is that person, O Sanjaya, worthy of honour who behaveth\r\nthus towards a man possessed of glory endued with prosperity, living in\r\nthe midst of friends? My parents are not ignorant of the duties of\r\nbattle. Instructed by me, O Sanjaya, tell them that are afflicted with\r\ngrief these words: I have performed sacrifices, supported a large number\r\nof servants properly, governed the whole earth with her seas! I stayed on\r\nthe heads of my living foes! I gave wealth to my kinsmen to the extent of\r\nmy abilities, and I did what was agreeable to friends. I withstood all my\r\nfoes. Who is there that is more fortunate than myself? I have made\r\nprogresses through hostile kingdoms and commanded kings as slaves. I have\r\nacted handsomely towards all I loved and liked. Who is there more\r\nfortunate than myself? I honoured all my kinsmen and attended to the\r\nwelfare of all my dependants. I have attended to the three ends of human\r\nexistence, Religion, Profit, and Pleasure! Who is there more fortunate\r\nthan myself? I laid my commands on great kings, and honour, unattainable\r\nby others, was mine, I always made my journeys on the very best of\r\nsteeds. Who is there more fortunate than myself? I studied the Vedas and\r\nmade gifts according to the ordinance. My life has passed in happiness.\r\nBy observance of the duties of my own order, I have earned many regions\r\nof blessedness hereafter. Who is there more fortunate than myself? By\r\ngood luck, I have not been vanquished in battle and subjected to the\r\nnecessity of serving my foes as masters. By good luck, O lord, it is only\r\nafter my death that my swelling prosperity abandons me for waiting upon\r\nanother! That which is desired by good Kshatriyas observant of the duties\r\nof their order, that death, is obtained by me! Who is there so fortunate\r\nas myself? By good luck, I did not suffer myself to be turned away from\r\nthe path of hostility and to be vanquished like an ordinary person! By\r\ngood luck, I have not been vanquished after I had done some base act!\r\nLike the slaughter of a person that is asleep or that is heedless, like\r\nthe slaughter of one by the administration of poison, my slaughter hath\r\ntaken place, for I have been slain as unrighteously, in contravention of\r\nthe rules of fair fight! The highly blessed Ashvatthama, and Kritavarma\r\nof the Satwata race, and Saradwat's son Kripa, should be told these words\r\nof mine, 'You should never repose any confidence upon the Pandavas, those\r\nviolators of rules, who have perpetrated many unrighteous acts!' After\r\nthis, thy royal son of true prowess addressed our message-bearers in\r\nthese words, \"I have, in battle, been slain by Bhimasena most\r\nunrighteously! I am now like a moneyless wayfarer and shall follow in the\r\nwake of Drona who has already gone to heaven, of Karna and Shalya, of\r\nVrishasena of great energy, of Shakuni the son of Subala, of Jalasandha\r\nof great valour, of king Bhagadatta, of Somadatta's son, that mighty\r\nbowman, of Jayadratha, the king of the Sindhus, of all my brothers headed\r\nby Duhshasana and equal unto myself, of Duhshasana's son of great\r\nprowess, and of Lakshmana, my son, and thousands of others that fought\r\nfor me. Alas how shall my sister, stricken with woe, live sorrowfully,\r\nafter hearing of the slaughter of her brothers and her husband! Alas,\r\nwhat shall be the plight of the old king, my sire, with Gandhari, and his\r\ndaughters-in-law and grand-daughters-in-law! Without doubt, the beautiful\r\nand large-eyed mother of Lakshmana, made sonless and husbandless, will\r\nsoon meet with her death! If Charvaka, the mendicant devotee who is a\r\nmaster of speech, learns everything, that blessed man will certainly\r\navenge himself of my death! By dying upon the sacred field of\r\nSamantapanchaka, celebrated over the three worlds, I shall certainly\r\nobtain many eternal regions!\" Then, O sire, thousands of men, with eyes\r\nfull of tears, fled away in all directions, having heard these\r\nlamentations of the king. The whole Earth, with her forests and seas,\r\nwith all her mobile and immobile creatures, began to tremble violently,\r\nand produce a loud noise. All the points of the compass became murky. The\r\nmessengers, repairing to Drona's son, represented to him all that had\r\nhappened regarding the conduct of the mace-encounter and the fall of the\r\nking. Having represented everything unto Drona's son, O Bharata, all of\r\nthem remained in a thoughtful mood for a long while and then went away,\r\ngrief-stricken, to the place they came from.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having heard of Duryodhana's fall from the messengers,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, the unslain remnant of the Kaurava army,\r\nexceedingly wounded with keen shafts, and maces and lances and darts,\r\nthose three, Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma of the Satwata race,\r\ncame quickly on their fleet steeds to the field of battle. They beheld\r\nthere the high-souled son of Dhritarashtra prostrate on the ground like a\r\ngigantic Sala tree laid low in the forest by a tempest. They beheld him\r\nwrithing on the bare ground and covered with blood even like a mighty\r\nelephant in the forest laid low by a hunter. They saw him weltering in\r\nagony and bathed in profuse streams of blood. Indeed, they saw him lying\r\non the ground like the sun dropped on the earth or like the ocean dried\r\nby a mighty wind, or like the full Moon in the firmament with his disc\r\nshrouded by a fog. Equal to an elephant in prowess and possessed of long\r\narms, the king lay on the earth, covered with dust. Around him were many\r\nterrible creatures and carnivorous animals like wealth-coveting\r\ndependants around a monarch in state. His forehead was contracted into\r\nfurrows of rage and his eyes were rolling in wrath. They beheld the king,\r\nthat tiger among men, full of rage, like a tiger struck down (by\r\nhunters). Those great archers Kripa and others, beholding the monarch\r\nlaid low on the Earth, became stupefied. Alighting from their cars, they\r\nran towards the king. Seeing Duryodhana, all of them sat on the earth\r\naround him. Then Drona's son, O monarch, with tearful eyes and breathing\r\nlike a snake, said these words unto that chief of Bharata's race, that\r\nforemost of all the kings on earth, \"Truly, there is nothing stable in\r\nthe world of men, since thou, O tiger among men, liest on the bare earth,\r\nstained with dust! Thou wert a king who had laid thy commands on the\r\nwhole Earth! Why then, O foremost of monarchs, dost thou lie alone on the\r\nbare ground in such a lonely wilderness? I do not see Duhshasana beside\r\nthee, nor the great car-warrior Karna, nor those friends of thine\r\nnumbering in hundreds! What is this, O bull among men? Without doubt, it\r\nis difficult to learn the ways of Yama, since thou, O lord of all the\r\nworlds, thus liest on the bare ground, stained with dust! Alas, this\r\nscorcher of foes used to walk at the head of all Kshatriyas that had\r\ntheir locks sprinkled with holy water at ceremonies of coronation! Alas,\r\nhe now eateth the dust! Behold the reverses that Time bringeth on its\r\ncourse! Where is that pure white umbrella of thine? Where is that fanning\r\nyak-tail also, O king? Where hath that vast army of thine now gone, O\r\nbest of monarchs? The course of events is certainly a mystery when causes\r\nother than those relied upon are at book, since even thou that wert the\r\nmaster of the world hast been reduced to this plight! Without doubt, the\r\nprosperity of all mortals is very unstable, since thou that wert equal\r\nunto Shakra himself hast now been reduced to such a sorry plight!\"\r\nHearing these words of the sorrowing Ashvatthama, thy son answered him in\r\nthese words that were suited to the occasion. He wiped his eyes with his\r\nhands and shed tears of grief anew. The king then addressed all those\r\nheroes headed by Kripa and said, \"This liability to death (of all living\r\ncreatures) is said to have been ordained by the Creator himself. Death\r\ncomes to all beings in course of time. That death hath now come to me,\r\nbefore the eyes of you all! I who reigned over the whole earth have now\r\nbeen reduced to this plight! By good luck, I never turned back from\r\nbattle whatever calamities overtook me. By good luck, I have been slain\r\nby those sinful men, by the aid particularly of deception. By good luck,\r\nwhile engaged in hostilities, I always displayed courage and\r\nperseverance. By good luck, I am slain in battle, along with all my\r\nkinsmen and friends. By good luck, I behold you escaped with life from\r\nthis great slaughter, and safe and sound. This is highly agreeable to me.\r\nDo not, from affection, grieve for my death. If the Vedas are any\r\nauthority, I have certainly acquired many eternal regions! I am not\r\nignorant of the glory of Krishna of immeasurable energy. He hath not\r\ncaused me to fall off from the proper observance of Kshatriya duties. I\r\nhave obtained him. On no account should anybody grieve from me. Ye have\r\ndone what persons like ye should do. Ye have always striven for my\r\nsuccess. Destiny, however, is incapable of being frustrated.\" Having said\r\nthis much, the king, with eyes laved with tears, became silent, O\r\nmonarch, agitated as he was with agony. Beholding the king in tears and\r\ngrief, Drona's son flamed up in anger like the fire that is seen at the\r\nuniversal destruction. Overwhelmed with rage, he squeezed his hand and\r\naddressing the king in a voice hoarse with tears, he said these words,\r\n\"My sire was slain by those wretches with a cruel contrivance. That act,\r\nhowever, doth not burn me so keenly as this plight to which thou hast\r\nbeen reduced, O king! Listen to these words of mine that I utter,\r\nswearing by Truth itself, O lord, and by all my acts of piety, all my\r\ngifts, my religion, and the religious merits I have won. I shall today,\r\nin the very presence of Vasudeva, despatch all the Pancalas, by all means\r\nin my power, to the abode of Yama? It behoveth thee, O monarch, to grant\r\nme permission!\" Hearing these words of Drona's son, that were highly\r\nagreeable to his heart, the Kuru king addressing Kripa, said, \"O\r\npreceptor, bring me without delay a pot full of water!\" At these words of\r\nthe king, that foremost of Brahmanas soon brought a vessel full of water\r\nand approached the king. Thy son then, O monarch, said unto Kripa, \"Let\r\nthe son of Drona, O foremost of Brahmanas, (blessed be thou), be at my\r\ncommand installed as generalissimo, if thou wishest to do me the good! At\r\nthe command of the king, even a Brahmana may fight, specially one that\r\nhas adopted Kshatriya practices! Those learned in the scriptures say\r\nthis!\" Hearing these words of the king, Kripa, the son of Saradwat,\r\ninstalled Drona's son as generalissimo, at the king's command! The\r\ninstallation over, O monarch, Ashvatthama embraced that best of kings and\r\nleft the spot, having caused the ten points to resound with his leonine\r\nroars. That foremost of kings, Duryodhana, profusely covered with blood,\r\nbegan to pass there that night so frightful to all creatures. Wending\r\naway quickly from the field of battle, O king, those heroes, with hearts\r\nagitated by grief, began to reflect anxiously and earnestly.'\"\r\n\r\nThe End of Shalya-parv\r\n"
