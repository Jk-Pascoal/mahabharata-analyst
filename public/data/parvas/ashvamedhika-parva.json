      "content": "(Aswamedhika Parva)\r\n\r\nOM! HAVING BOWED down unto Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male\r\nbeings, and unto the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, \"After the king Dhritarashtra had offered libations\r\nof water (unto the manes of Bhisma), the mighty-armed[1] Yudhishthira,\r\nwith his senses bewildered, placing the former in his front, ascended the\r\nbanks (of the river), his eyes suffused with tears, and dropt down on the\r\nbank of the Ganga like an elephant pierced by the hunter. Then incited by\r\nKrishna, Bhima took him up sinking. 'This must not be so,' said Krishna,\r\nthe grinder of hostile hosts. The Pandavas, O king, saw Yudhishthira, the\r\nson of Dharma, troubled and lying on the ground, and also sighing again\r\nand again. And seeing the king despondent and feeble, the Pandavas,\r\noverwhelmed with grief, sat down, surrounding him. And endowed with high\r\nintelligence and having the sight of wisdom, king Dhritarashtra,\r\nexceedingly afflicted with grief for his sons, addressed the monarch,\r\nsaying,--'Rise up, O thou tiger among the Kurus. Do thou now attend to\r\nthy duties. O Kunti's son, thou hast conquered this Earth according to\r\nthe usage of the Kshatriyas. Do thou now, O lord of men, enjoy her with\r\nthy brothers and friends. O foremost of the righteous, I do not see why\r\nthou shouldst grieve. O lord of the Earth, having lost a hundred sons\r\nlike unto riches obtained in a dream, it is Gandhari and I, who should\r\nmourn. Not having listened to the pregnant words of the high-souled\r\nVidura, who sought our welfare, I, of perverse senses, (now) repent. The\r\nvirtuous Vidura, endowed with divine insight, had told me,--'Thy race\r\nwill meet with annihilation owing to the transgressions of Duryodhana. O\r\nking, if thou wish for the weal of thy line, act up to my advice. Cast\r\noff this wicked-minded monarch, Suyodhana, and let not either Karna or\r\nSakuni by any means see him. Their gambling too do thou, without making\r\nany fuss suppress, and anoint the righteous king Yudhishthira. That one\r\nof subdued senses will righteously govern the Earth. If thou wouldst not\r\nhave king Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, then, O monarch, do thou,\r\nperforming a sacrifice, thyself take charge of the kingdom, and regarding\r\nall creatures with an even eye, O lord of men, do thou let thy kinsmen. O\r\nthou advancer of thy kindred, subsist on thy bounty.' When, O Kunti's\r\nson, the far-sighted Vidura said this, fool that I was I followed the\r\nwicked Duryodhana. Having turned a deaf ear to the sweet speech of that\r\nsedate one, I have obtained this mighty sorrow as a consequence, and have\r\nbeen plunged in an ocean of woe. Behold thy old father and mother, O\r\nking, plunged in misery. But, O master of men, I find no occasion for thy\r\ngrief.'\""

And then Kesava\r\n(Krishna) accosted him,--'If a person indulges excessively in sorrow for\r\nhis departed forefathers, he grieves them. (Therefore, banishing grief),\r\ndo thou (now) celebrate many a sacrifice with suitable presents to the\r\npriests; and do thou gratify the gods with Soma liquor, and the manes of\r\nthy forefathers with their due food and drink. Do thou also gratify thy\r\nguests with meat and drink and the destitute with gifts commensurate with\r\ntheir desires. A person of thy high intelligence should not bear himself\r\nthus. What ought to be known hath been known by thee; what ought to be\r\ndone, hath also been performed. And thou hast heard the duties of the\r\nKshatriyas, recited by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi, by Krishna\r\nDwaipayana, Narada and Vidura. Therefore thou shouldst not walk the way\r\nof the stupid; but pursuing the course of thy forefathers, sustain the\r\nburthen (of the empire). It is meet that a Kshatriya should attain heaven\r\nfor certain by his (own) renown. Of heroes, those that came to be slain\r\nnever shall have to turn away (from the celestial regions). Renounce thy\r\ngrief, O mighty sovereign. Verily, what hath happened was destined to\r\nhappen so. Thou canst in no wise see those that have been slain in this\r\nwar.--Having said this unto Yudhishthira, prince of the pious, the\r\nhigh-spirited Govinda paused; and Yudhishthira answered him thus, 'O\r\nGovinda, full well do I know thy fondness for me. Thou hast ever favoured\r\nme with thy love and thy friendship. And, O holder of the mace and the\r\ndiscus. O scion of Yadu's race, O glorious one, if (now) with a pleased\r\nmind thou dost permit me to go to the ascetic's retreat in the woods,\r\nthen thou wouldst compass what is highly desired by me. Peace find I none\r\nafter having slain my grand-father, and that foremost of men, Karna, who\r\nnever fled from the field of battle. Do thou, O Janarddana, so order that\r\nI may be freed from this heinous sin and that my mind may be purified. As\r\nPritha's son was speaking thus, the highly-energetic Vyasa, cognisant of\r\nthe duties of life, soothing him, spoke these excellent words, My child,\r\nthy mind is not yet calmed; and therefore thou art again stupefied by a\r\nchildish sentiment. And wherefore, O child, do we over and over again\r\nscatter our speech to the winds? Thou knowest duties of the Kshatriyas,\r\nwho live by warfare. A king that hath performed his proper part should\r\nnot suffer himself to be overwhelmed by sorrow. Thou hast faithfully\r\nlistened to the entire doctrine of salvation; and I have repeatedly\r\nremoved thy misgivings arising out of desire. But not paying due heed to\r\nwhat I have unfolded, thou of perverse understanding hast doubtless\r\nforgotten it clean. Be it not so. Such ignorance is not worthy of thee. O\r\nsinless one, thou knowest all kinds, of expiation; and thou hast also\r\nheard of the virtues of kings as well as the merits of gifts. Wherefore\r\nthen, O Bharata, acquainted with every morality and versed in all the\r\nAgamas, art thou overwhelmed (with grief) as if from ignorance?'\""

It is God. who engageth him\r\nin acts good or bad, O bestower of honour. Where then is the room for\r\nrepentance? Thou deemest thyself as having perpetrated impious acts. Do\r\nthou, therefore, O Bharata, harken as to the way in which sin may be\r\nremoved. O Yudhishthira, those that commit sins, can always free\r\nthemselves from them through penance, sacrifice and gifts. O king, O\r\nforemost of men, sinful people are purified by sacrifice, austerities and\r\ncharity. The high-souled celestials and Asuras perform sacrifices for\r\nsecuring religious merit; and therefore sacrifice are of supreme\r\nimportance. It is through sacrifices that the high-souled celestials had\r\nwaxed so wondrously powerful; and having celebrated rites did they\r\nvanquish the Danavas. Do thou, O Yudhishthira, prepare for the Rajasuya,\r\nand the horse-sacrifice, as well as, O Bharata, for the Sarvamedha and\r\nthe Naramedha.[2] And then as Dasaratha's son, Rama, or as Dushmanta's\r\nand Sakuntala's son, thy ancestor, the lord of the Earth, the exceedingly\r\npuissant king Bharata, had done, do thou agreeably to the ordinance\r\ncelebrate the Horse-sacrifice with Dakshinas. Yudhishthira replied,\r\n'Beyond a doubt, the Horse-sacrifice purifieth princes. But I have a\r\npurpose of which it behoveth thee to hear. Having caused this huge\r\ncarnage of kindred, I cannot, O best of the regenerate ones, dispense\r\ngifts even on a small scale; I have no wealth to give. Nor can I for\r\nwealth solicit these juvenile sons of kings, staying in sorry plight,\r\nwith their wounds yet green, and undergoing suffering. How, O foremost of\r\ntwice-born ones, having myself destroyed the Earth can I, overcome by\r\nsorrow, levy dues for celebrating a sacrifice? Through Duryodhana's\r\nfault, O best of ascetics, the kings of the Earth have met with\r\ndestruction, and we have reaped ignominy. For wealth Duryodhana hath\r\nwasted the Earth; and the treasury of that wicked-minded son of\r\nDhritarashtra is empty. (In this sacrifice), the Earth is the Dakshina;\r\nthis is the rule that is prescribed in the first instance. The usual\r\nreversal of this rule, though sanctioned, is observed, by the learned as\r\nsuch. Nor, O ascetic, do I like to have a substitute (for this process).\r\nIn this matter, O reverend sir, it behoveth thee to favour me with thy\r\ncounsel'. Thus addressed by Pritha's son, Krishna Dwaipayana, reflecting\r\nfor a while, spoke unto the righteous king,--'This treasury, (now)\r\nexhausted, shall be full. O son of Pritha, in the mountain Himavat (The\r\nHimalayas) there is gold which had been left behind by Brahmanas at the\r\nsacrifice of the high-souled Marutta.'[3] Yudhishthira asked, 'How in\r\nthat sacrifice celebrated by Marutta was so much gold amassed? And, O\r\nforemost of speakers, when did he reign?' Vyasa said 'If, O Pritha's son,\r\nthou art anxious to hear concerning that king sprung from the Karandhama\r\nrace, then listen to me as I tell thee when that highly powerful monarch\r\npossessed of immense wealth reigned.'\""

Do thou, O Dwaipayana, relate this\r\nunto me, O sinless one.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'O child, in the Krita age Manu was lord (of the Earth)\r\nwielding the sceptre. His son was known under the name of Prasandhi.\r\nPrasandhi had a son named Kshupa, Kshupa's son was that lord (of men),\r\nking Ikshwaku. He, O king, had a hundred sons endowed with pre-eminent\r\npiety. And all of them were made monarchs by king Ikshwaku. The eldest of\r\nthem, Vinsa by name became the model of bowmen. Vinsa's son, O Bharata,\r\nwas the auspicious Vivinsa. Vivinsa, O king, had five and ten sons; all\r\nof them were powerful archers, reverencial to the Brahmanas and truthful,\r\ngentle and ever speaking fair. The eldest brother, Khaninetra, oppressed\r\nall his brothers. And having conquered the entire kingdom rid of all\r\ntroubles, Khaninetra could not retain his supremacy; nor were the people\r\npleased with him. And dethroning him, they, O foremost of monarchs,\r\ninvested his son Suvarcha with the rights of sovereignty and (having\r\neffected this) experienced joy (in their hearts). Seeing the reverses\r\nsustained by his site as well as his expulsion from the empire, he was\r\never intent on bringing about the welfare of the people, being devoted to\r\nthe Brahmanas, speaking the truth, practising purity and restraining his\r\nsenses and thoughts. And the subjects were well pleased with that\r\nhigh-minded one constant in virtue. But he being constantly engaged in\r\nvirtuous deeds, his treasures and vehicles became greatly reduced. And on\r\nhis treasury having become depleted, the feudatory princes swarming round\r\nhim began to give him trouble. Being thus oppressed by many foes while\r\nhis treasury, horses and vehicles were impoverished, the king underwent\r\ngreat tribulation along with his retainers and the denizens of his\r\ncapital. Although his power waned greatly, yet the foes could not slay\r\nthe king, for his power, O Yudhishthira, was established in\r\nrighteousness. And when he had reached the extreme of misery along with\r\nthe citizens, he blew his hand (with his mouth), and from that there\r\nappeared a supply of forces. And then he vanquished all the kings living\r\nalong the borders of his dominions. And from this circumstance O king, he\r\nhath been celebrated as Karandhama. His son, (the first) Karandhama who\r\nwas born at the beginning of the Treta age, equalled Indra himself and\r\nwas endowed with grace, and invincible even by the immortals. At that\r\ntime all the kings were under his control; and alike by virtue of his\r\nwealth and for his prowess, he became their emperor. In short, the\r\nrighteous king Avikshit by name, became like unto Indra himself in\r\nheroism; and he was given to sacrifices, delight took in virtue and held\r\nhis senses under restraint. And in energy he resembled the sun and in\r\nforbearance Earth herself; in intelligence, he was like Vrihaspati, and\r\nin calmness the mountain Himavat himself. And that king delighted the\r\nhearts of his subjects by act, thought, speech, self-restraint, and\r\nforbearance. He performed hundreds of horse-sacrifices, and the potent\r\nand learned Angira himself served him as priest. His son surpassed his\r\nsire in the possession of good qualities. Named Marutta, that lord of\r\nkings was righteous and o great renown, an possessed the might of ten\r\nthousand elephants. He was like unto Vishnu's second self. Desirous of\r\ncelebrating a sacrifice, that virtuous monarch, coming to Mount Meru on\r\nthe northern side of Himavat, caused thousands of shining golden vessels\r\nto be forged. There on a huge golden hill he performed the rites. And\r\ngoldsmiths made basins and vessels and pans and seats without number. And\r\nthe sacrificial ground was near this place. And that righteous lord of\r\nEarth, king Marutta, along with other princes, performed a sacrifice\r\nthere.'\""

And\r\nwhere now, O reverend sire, is all his wealth? And, O ascetic, how can we\r\nsecure the same?'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa thereupon said,--'As the numerous offspring of the Prajapati\r\nDaksha, the Asuras and the Celestials challenged each other (to\r\nencounter), so in the same way Angira's sons, the exceedingly energetic\r\nVrihaspati and the ascetic, Samvarta, of equal vows, challenged each\r\nother, O king. Vrihaspati began to worry Samvarta again and again. And\r\nconstantly troubled by his elder brother, he, O Bharata, renouncing his\r\nriches, went to the woods, with nothing to coyer his body save the open\r\nsky.[4] (At that time), Vasava having vanquished and destroyed the\r\nAsuras, and obtained the sovereignty of the celestial regions had\r\nappointed as his priest Angira's eldest son, that best of Brahmanas,\r\nVrihaspati. Formerly Angira was the family-priest of king Karandhama.\r\nMatchless among men in might, prowess and character; powerful like unto\r\nSatakratu, righteous souled and of rigid vows, O king, he had vehicles,\r\nand warrior, and many adherents, and superb and costly bedsteads,\r\nproduced through dint of meditation by the breath of his mouth. And by\r\nhis native virtues, the monarch had brought all the princes under his\r\nsway. And having lived as long as he desired, he ascended to the heaven\r\nin his corporal embodiment. And his son named Avikshit--conqueror of\r\nfoes,--righteous like unto Yayati, brought all the Earth under his\r\ndominion. And both in merit and might the king resembled his sire. He had\r\na son named Marutta, endowed with energy, and resembling Vasava himself.\r\nThis earth clad in oceans; felt herself drawn towards him. He always[5]\r\nused to defy the lord of the celestials; and O son of Pandu, Vasava also\r\ndefied Marutta. And Marutta,--master of Earth--was pure and possessed of\r\nperfections. And in spite of his striving, Sakra could not prevail over\r\nhim. And incapable of controlling him, he riding on the horse, along with\r\nthe celestials summoning Vrihaspati, spoke to him thus, 'O Vrihaspati, if\r\nthou wishest to do what is agreeable to me, do not perform priestly\r\noffices for Marutta on behalf of the deities or the ancestral Manes. I\r\nhave, O Vrihaspati, obtained the sovereignty of the three worlds, while\r\nMarutta is merely the lord of the Earth. How, O Brahmana, having acted as\r\npriest unto the immortal king of the celestials, wilt thou unhesitatingly\r\nperform priestly function unto Marutta subject to death? Good betide\r\nthee! Either espouse my side or that of the monarch, Marutta or forsaking\r\nMarutta, gladly come over to me.--Thus accosted by the sovereign of the\r\ncelestials, Vrihaspati, reflecting for a moment, replied unto the king of\r\nthe immortals. Thou art the Lord of creatures, and in thee are the worlds\r\nestablished, And thou hast destroyed Namuchi, Viswarupa and Vala. Thou, O\r\nhero, alone encompassest the highest prosperity of the celestials, and, O\r\nslayer of Vala, thou sustainest the earth as well as the heaven. How, O\r\nforemost of the celestials, having officiated as thy priest, shall I, O\r\nchastiser of Paka, serve a mortal prince. Do thou listen to what I say.\r\nEven if the god of fire cease to cause heat and warmth, or the earth\r\nchange its nature, or the sun ceases to give light, I shall never deviate\r\nfrom the truth (that I have spoken).\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--'On hearing this speech from Vrihaspati Indra\r\nbecame cured of his envious feelings, and then praising him he repaired\r\nto his own mansion.'"

On hearing of the compact made by Angira's son\r\nVrihaspati with the lord of the gods (Indra), king Marutta made the\r\nnecessary preparations for a great sacrifice. The eloquent grandson of\r\nKarandhama, (Marutta) having conceived the idea of a sacrifice in his\r\nmind, went to Vrihaspati and addressed him thus, 'O worshipful ascetic, I\r\nhave intended to perform the sacrifice which thou didst propose to me\r\nonce on a previous occasion and in accordance with thy instructions, and\r\nI now desire to appoint thee as officiating priest in this sacrifice, the\r\nmaterials whereof have also been collected by me.--O excellent one, thou\r\nart our family priest, therefore do thou take those sacrificial things\r\nand perform the sacrifice thyself.'\r\n\r\nVrihaspati said, 'O lord of the earth, I do not desire to perform thy\r\nsacrifice. I have been appointed as priest by the Lord of the gods\r\n(Indra) and I have promised to him to act as such.'\r\n\r\nMarutta said, 'Thou art our hereditary family priest, and for this reason\r\nI entertain great regard for thee, and I have acquired the right of being\r\nassisted at sacrifices by thee, and therefore it is meet that thou\r\nshouldst officiate as priest at my sacrifice.'\r\n\r\nVrihaspati said, 'Having, O Marutta, acted as priest to the Immortals,\r\nhow can I act as such to mortal men, and whether thou dost depart hence\r\nor stay, I tell thee, I have ceased to act as priest to any but the\r\nImmortals. O thou of mighty arms, I am unable to act as thy priest now.\r\nAnd according to thy own desire, thou canst appoint any one as thy priest\r\nwho will perform thy sacrifice.'\r\n\r\nVyasa said, 'Thus told, king Marutta became confused with shame, and\r\nwhile returning home with his mind oppressed by anxiety, he met Narada on\r\nhis way. And that monarch on seeing the divine Rishi Narada stood before\r\nhim with due salutation, with his hands clasped together. Then Narada\r\naddressing him thus said,--O royal sage, thou seemest to be not\r\nwell-pleased in thy mind; is all well with thee? Where hast thou been, O\r\nsinless one, and whence the cause of this thy mental disquietude? And, O\r\nking, if there be no objection to thy telling it to me, do thou, O best\r\nof kings, disclose (the cause of thy anxiety) to me, so that, O prince, I\r\nmay allay the disquietude of thy mind with all my efforts.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the great Rishi Narada, king\r\nMarutta informed him of the rebuff he had received from his religious\r\npreceptor.'\r\n\r\nMarutta said, 'Seeking for a priest to officiate at my sacrifice, I went\r\nto that priest of the Immortals, Vrihaspati, the son of Angira, but he\r\ndid not choose to accept my offer. Having met with this rebuff from him,\r\nI have no desire to live any longer now, for by his abandoning me thus, I\r\nhave, O Narada, become contaminated with sin.'\r\n\r\nVyasa said, 'Thus told by that king, Narada, O mighty prince, made this\r\nreply to him with words which seemed to revive that son of Avikshit.'\r\n\r\nNarada said, 'The virtuous son of Angira, Samvarta by name is wandering\r\nover all the quarters of the earth in a naked state to the wonder of all\r\ncreatures; do thou, O prince, go to him. If Vrihaspati does not desire to\r\nofficiate at thy sacrifice, the powerful Samvarta, if pleased with thee,\r\nwill perform thy sacrifice.'\r\n\r\nMarutta said, 'I feel as if instilled with new life, by these thy words,\r\nO Narada, but O the best of speakers, do thou tell me where I can find\r\nSamvarta, and how I can remain by his side, and how I am to act so that\r\nhe may not abandon me, for I do not desire to live if I meet with a\r\nrebuff from him also.'\r\n\r\nNarada said, 'Desirous of seeing Maheswara, O prince, he wanders about at\r\nhis pleasure in the city of Varanasi, in the garb of a mad man. And\r\nhaving reached the gate of that city, thou must place a dead body\r\nsomewhere near it, and the man who shall turn away on seeing the corpse,\r\ndo thou, O prince, know that man to be Samvarta, and knowing him, do thou\r\nfollow his footsteps wheresoever that powerful man chooses to go and\r\nfinding him (at length) in a lonely place thou must seek his protection\r\nwith thy hands clasped together in supplication to him. And if he\r\nenquires of thee as to the person who has given thee the information\r\nabout his own self, do thou tell him that Narada has informed thee about\r\nSamvarta. And if he should ask thee to follow me, thou must tell him\r\nwithout any hesitation, that I have entered into the fire.'\r\n\r\nVyasa said, 'Having signified his assent to the proposal of Narada, that\r\nroyal sage after duly worshipping him, and taking his permission,\r\nrepaired to the city of Varanasi, and having reached there, that famous\r\nprince did as he had been told, and remembering the words of Narada, he\r\nplaced a corpse at the gate of the city. And by coincidence, that\r\nBrahmana also entered the gate of the city at the same time. Then on\r\nbeholding the corpse, he suddenly turned away. And on seeing him turn\r\nback, that prince, the son of Avikshit followed his footsteps with his\r\nhands clasped together, and with the object of receiving instruction from\r\nhim. And then finding him in a lonely place, Samvarta covered the king\r\nwith mud and ashes and phlegm and spittle. And though thus worried and\r\noppressed by Samvarta, the king followed that sage with his hands clasped\r\ntogether in supplication and trying to appease him. At length overcome\r\nwith fatigue, and reaching the cool shade of a sacred fig tree with many\r\nbranches, Samvarta desisted from his course and sat himself to rest.'"

Why art thou bent upon having this\r\nsacrifice performed by a priest of such a singular disposition? My\r\nbrother is able to officiate at sacrifices, and he has gone over to\r\nVasava (Indra), and is engaged in performing his sacrifices, do thou\r\ntherefore have thy sacrifice performed by him. My elder brother has\r\nforcibly taken away from me all my household goods and mystical gods, and\r\nsacrificing clients, and has now left to me only this physical body of\r\nmine, and, O son of Avikshit, as he is worthy of all respect from me, I\r\ncannot by any means officiate at thy sacrifice, unless with his\r\npermission. Thou must therefore go to Vrihaspati first, and taking his\r\npermission thou canst come back to me, if thou hast any desire to perform\r\na sacrifice, and then only shall I officiate at thy sacrifice.'\r\n\r\nMarutta said, 'Do thou listen to me, O Samvarta, I did go to Vrihaspati\r\nfirst, but desiring the patronage of Vasava, he did not wish to have me\r\nas his sacrificer. He said, 'Having secured the priesthood of the\r\nImmortals, I do not desire to act for mortals, and, I have been forbidden\r\nby Sakra (Indra) to officiate at Marutta's sacrifice, as he told me that\r\nMarutta having become lord of the earth, was always filled with a desire\r\nto rival him.' And to this thy brother assented by saying to the Slayer\r\nof Vala (Indra),--Be it so. Know thou, O best of ascetics, that as he had\r\nsucceeded in securing the protection of the Lord of the Celestials, I\r\nrepaired to him with gratified heart, but he did not agree to act as my\r\npriest. And thus repulsed, I now desire to spend all I possess, to have\r\nthis sacrifice performed by thee, and to outstrip Vasava by the merit of\r\nthy good offices. As I have been repulsed by Vrihaspati for no fault of\r\nmine, I have now no desire, O Brahmana, to go to him to seek his aid in\r\nthis sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nSamvarta said, 'I can certainly, O king, accomplish all that thou\r\ndesirest, if only thou agree to do all that I shall ask thee to do, but I\r\napprehend that Vrihaspati and Purandara (Indra) when they will learn that\r\nI am engaged in performing thy sacrifice, will be filled with wrath, and\r\ndo all they can to injure thee. Therefore, do thou assure me of thy\r\nsteadfastness, so as to ensure my coolness and constancy, as otherwise.\r\nif I am filled with wrath against thee, I shall reduce (destroy) thee and\r\nthy kindred to ashes.\"\r\n\r\nMarutta said, 'If ever I forsake thee, may I never attain the blessed\r\nregions as long as the mountains shall exist, and the thousand-rayed sun\r\ncontinue to emit heat: if I forsake dice, may I never attain true wisdom,\r\nand remain for ever addicted to worldly (material) pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nSamvarta said, \"Listen, O son of Avikshit, excellent as it is the bent of\r\nthy mind to perform this act, so too, O king, have I in my mind the\r\nability to perform the sacrifice, I tell thee, O king, that thy good\r\nthings will become imperishable, and that thou shalt lord it over Sakra\r\nand the Celestials with Gandharvas. For myself, I have no desire to amass\r\nwealth or sacrificial presents, I shall only do what is disagreeable to\r\nboth Indra and my brother, I shall certainly make thee attain equality\r\nwith Sakra, and I tell thee truly that I shall do what is agreeable to\r\nthee.\""

I shall (therefore) relate to thee truly as I have heard it, the\r\nstory of the war of Indra with Vritra as it took place. In ancient times\r\nthe Prithivi (earth), O king, was encompassed by Vritra, and by this\r\nabstraction of earthly matter, the seat of all odour, there arose bad\r\nodours on all sides, and the Performer of a hundred sacrifices (Indra),\r\nbeing much enraged by this act, hurled his thunderbolt at Vritra. And\r\nbeing deeply wounded by the thunderbolt of mighty Indra, Vritra entered\r\ninto the (waters), and by doing so he destroyed their property. The\r\nwaters being seized by Vritra, their liquid property left them. At this\r\nIndra became highly enraged and again smote him with his thunderbolt. And\r\nhe (Vritra) smitten by the thunderbolt by the most powerful Indra betook\r\nhimself to the Jyoti (luminous matter) and abstracted its inherent\r\nproperty. The luminous matter being overwhelmed by Vritra and its\r\nproperty, colour and form being thereby lost, the wrathful Indra again\r\nhurled his thunderbolt at him. And thus wounded again by Indra of\r\nimmeasurable power, Vritra entered all on a sudden into the Vayu (gaseous\r\nmatter). and thereafter made away with its inherent property. And this\r\nmatter being overpowered by Vritra and its property, viz., touch being\r\nlost, Indra became again filled with wrath and flung his thunderbolt at\r\nhim. And wounded therein by the mighty (Indra), he overwhelmed the Akasa\r\n(ether), and took away its inherent property, and the Akasa being\r\noverwhelmed by Vritra, and its property, sound being destroyed, the god\r\nof a hundred sacrifices highly incensed, again smote him with his\r\nthunderbolt. And thus smitten by the mighty Indra, he suddenly entered\r\ninto his (Sakra's) body, and took away its essential attributes. And\r\novertaken by Vritra, he was filled with great illusion. And, O venerable\r\nsir, the mightiest of Bharata's race, we have heard that Vasistha\r\ncomforted Indra (when he was thus afflicted) and that the god of a\r\nhundred sacrifices slew Vritra in his body by means of his invisible\r\nthunderbolt, and know, O prince, that this religious mystery was recited\r\nby Sakra to the great sages, and they in turn told it to me.\""

The\r\nailment that is produced in the body, is called the physical ailment, and\r\nthat which has its seat in the mind, is known as the mental ailment. The\r\ncold, the warm (phlegm and bile) as well as the windy humours, O king,\r\nare the essential transformations generated in the physical body, and\r\nwhen these humours are evenly distributed, and are present in due\r\nproportions, they are said to be symptomatic of good health. The warm\r\nhumour is acted upon (allayed) by the cold, and the cold by the warm. And\r\nSattwa, Rajas and Tamas are the attributes of the soul, and it is said by\r\nthe learned that their presence in due proportions indicates health (of\r\nthe mind). But if any of the three preponderates, some remedy is enjoined\r\n(to restore the equilibrium). Happiness is overcome by sorrow, and sorrow\r\nby pleasure. Some people while afflicted by sorrow, desire to recall\r\n(past) happiness, while others, while in the enjoyment of happiness,\r\ndesire to recall past sorrow. But thou, O son of Kunti, dost neither\r\ndesire to recall thy sorrows nor thy happiness; what else dost thou\r\ndesire to recall barring this delusion of sorrow? Or, perchance, O son,\r\nof Pritha, it is thy innate nature, by which thou art at present\r\noverpowered. Thou dost not desire to recall to thy mind the painful sight\r\nof Krishna standing in the hall of assembly with only one piece of cloth\r\nto cover her body, and while she was in her menses and in the presence of\r\nall the Pandavas. And it is not meet that thou shouldst brood over thy\r\ndeparture from the city, and thy exile with the hide of the antelope for\r\nthy robe, and thy wanderings in the great forest, nor shouldst thou\r\nrecall to thy mind the affliction from Jatasura, the fight with\r\nChitrasena, and thy troubles from the Saindhavas. Nor it is proper, O son\r\nof Pritha, and conqueror of thy foes, that thou shouldst recall the\r\nincident of Kichaka's kicking Draupadi, during the period of thy exile\r\npassed in absolute concealment, nor the incidents of the fight which took\r\nplace between thyself and Drona and Bhishma. The time has now arrived,\r\nwhen thou must fight the battle which each must fight single-handed with\r\nhis mind. Therefore, O chief of Bharata's race, thou must now prepare to\r\ncarry the struggle against thy mind, and by dint of abstraction and the\r\nmerit of thine own Karma, thou must reach the other side of (overcome)\r\nthe mysterious and unintelligible (mind). In this war there will be no\r\nneed for any missiles, nor for friends, nor attendants. The battle which\r\nis to be fought alone and single-handed has now arrived for thee. And if\r\nvanquished in this struggle, thou shalt find thyself in the most wretched\r\nplight, and O son of Kunti, knowing this, and acting accordingly, shalt\r\nthou attain success. And knowing this wisdom and the destiny of all\r\ncreatures, and following the conduct of thy ancestors, do thou duly\r\nadminister thy kingdom.\""

      "content": "\"Vasudeva said, \"O scion of Bharata's race, salvation is not attained by\r\nforegoing the external things (like kingdom, etc), it is only attained by\r\ngiving up things which pander to the flesh (body). The virtue and\r\nhappiness which are attainable by the person who has renounced only the\r\nexternal objects, but who is at the same time engrossed by passions and\r\nweakness of the flesh, let these be the portion of our enemies. The word\r\nwith two letters is Mrit-yu (death of the soul or perdition), and the\r\nword with three letters is Sas-wa-ta (Brahman) or the eternal spirit. The\r\nconsciousness that this or that thing is mine, or the state of being\r\naddicted to worldly objects is Mrityu and the absence of that feeling is\r\nSaswatam. And these two, Brahman and Mrityu, O king, have their seats in\r\nthe souls of all creatures, and remaining unseen, they, without doubt,\r\nwage war with each other. And if, O Bharata, it be true that no creature\r\nis ever destroyed, then one doth not make oneself guilty of the death of\r\na creature by piercing (destroying) its body. What matters the world to a\r\nman, if having acquired the sovereignty of the whole earth with its\r\nmobile and immobile creation, he does not become attached to it, or\r\nengrossed in its enjoyment. But the man who having renounced the world,\r\nhas taken to the life of the recluse in the forest, living on wild roots\r\nand edibles, if such a man, O son of Pritha, has a craving for the good\r\nthings of the world, and is addicted to them, he may be said to bear\r\nMrityu (death) in his mouth. Do thou, O Bharata, watch and observe the\r\ncharacter of thy external and internal enemies, (by means of thy\r\nspiritual vision), And the man who is able to perceive the nature of the\r\neternal reality is able to overreach the influence of the great fear\r\n(perdition). Men do not look with approbation upon the conduct of those\r\nwho are engrossed in worldly desires and there is no act without having a\r\ndesire (at its root) and all (Kama) desires are, as it were, the limbs\r\n(offshoots) of the mind. Therefore, wise men knowing this subjugate their\r\ndesires. The Yogi who holds communion with the Supreme Spirit, knows Yoga\r\nto be the perfect way (to salvation) by reason of the practices of his\r\nmany former births. And remembering that, what the soul desires, is not\r\nconducive to piety and virtue, but that the suppression of the desires is\r\nat the root of all true virtue, such men do not engage in the practice of\r\ncharity, Vedic learning, asceticism and Vedic rites whose object is\r\nattainment of worldly prosperity, ceremonies, sacrifices, religious rules\r\nand meditation, with the motive of securing any advantage thereby. By way\r\nof illustration of this truth, the sages versed in ancient lore, recite\r\nthese Gathas called by the name of Kamagita, do thou O Yudhishthira,\r\nlisten to the recital of them in detail. (Kama says) No creature is able\r\nto destroy me without resorting to the proper methods (viz., subjugating\r\nof all desires and practice of Yoga etc.) If a man knowing my power,\r\nstrive to destroy me by muttering prayers etc., I prevail over him by\r\ndeluding him with the belief that I am the subjective ego within him. If\r\nhe wish to destroy me by means of sacrifices with many presents, I\r\ndeceive him by appearing in his mind as a most virtuous creature amongst\r\nthe mobile creation, and if he wish to annihilate me by mastering the\r\nVedas and Vedangas, I over reach him by seeming to his mind to be the\r\nsoul of virtue amongst the immobile creation. And if the man whose\r\nstrength lies in truth, desire to overcome me by patience, I appear to\r\nhim as his mind, and thus he does not perceive my existence, and if the\r\nman of austere religious practices, desire to destroy me by means of\r\nasceticism, I appear in the guise of asceticism in his mind, and thus he\r\nis prevented from knowing me, and the man of learning, who with the\r\nobject of attaining salvation desires to destroy me, I frolic and laugh\r\nin the face of such a man intent on salvation. I am the everlasting one\r\nwithout a compeer, whom no creature can kill or destroy. For this reason\r\nthou too, O prince, divert thy desires (Kama) to Virtue, so that, by this\r\nmeans, thou mayst attain what is well for thee. Do thou therefore make\r\npreparations for the due performance of the horse sacrifice with\r\npresents, and various other sacrifices of great splendour, and\r\naccompanied with presents. Let not therefore grief overpower thee again,\r\non beholding thy friends lying slain on the battlefield. Thou canst not\r\nsee the men slain in this battle alive again. Therefore shouldst thou\r\nperform magnificent sacrifices with presents, so that thou mayst attain\r\nfame in this world, and reach the perfect way (hereafter).\""

And that monarch\r\nYudhishthira after performing the obsequial ceremonies of his departed\r\nfriends, and honouring the Brahmanas and Devas (gods), brought the\r\nkingdom of the earth with its girdle of oceans, under his sway. And that\r\nprince of Kuru's race having regained his kingdom, with a tranquil mind,\r\nthus addressed Vyasa, Narada and the other sages who were present. I have\r\nbeen comforted by the words of so great, ancient and aged saints as\r\nyourselves, and I have now no cause left for the least affliction. And\r\nlikewise, I have attained great wealth, with which I may worship the\r\ngods. Therefore, with your assistance, I shall now perform the sacrifice,\r\nO the best of regenerate beings. We have heard that those (Himalayan)\r\nregions are full of wonders. Therefore, O Brahmana, saint and grandsire\r\ndo thou so ordain that under thy protection we may safety reach the\r\nHimalaya mountains, the performance of my sacrifice being entirely within\r\nthy control, and then the adorable celestial saint Narada and Devasthana\r\nhave also addressed exquisite and well-meaning words for our well being.\r\nNo unlucky man in times of great tribulation and distress, has ever the\r\ngood fortune to secure the services of such preceptors and friends\r\napproved by all virtuous men. Thus addressed by the king, those great\r\nsaints, bidding the king and Krishna and Arjuna to repair to the\r\nHimalayan regions, then and there vanished in the presence of the\r\nassembled multitude, and the king, the lordly son of Dharma, then seated\r\nhimself there for a while. And the Pandavas then in consequence of the\r\ndeath of Bhishma, were engaged in performing his funeral ceremonies. And\r\ntheir time, while thus engaged, seemed too long in passing and performing\r\nthe last rites to the mortal remains of Bhishma, Karna and other foremost\r\nKauravas, they gave away large presents to Brahmanas. And then the\r\nforemost descendant of Kuru again performed with Dhritarashtra the\r\nfuneral rites (of the heroes slain in battle), and having given away\r\nimmense wealth to the Brahmanas, the Pandava chief with Dhritarashtra in\r\nadvance, made this entry into the city of Hastina Nagar, and consoling\r\nhis lordly uncle, possessed of eyes of wisdom, that virtuous prince\r\ncontinued to administer the earth with his brothers."

And, O\r\nBharata, the high-souled Krishna and the son of Pandu (Dhananjaya)\r\nentering the beautiful hall of assembly at Indraprastha, whiled away\r\ntheir time in great merriment. And there, O prince, they passed their\r\ntime in recounting the stirring incidents of the war, and the sufferings\r\nof their past lives. And those two high-souled ancient sages, glad at\r\nheart, recited the genealogy of the races of saints and gods. Then\r\nKesava, knowing the full import of all matters, addressed Partha in a\r\nsweet and beautiful speech of excellent style and import.

And he of great ascetic merit and\r\nknowing the science of all things having duly consoled him, Arjuna rested\r\nfor a while, as if a great burden had been removed from his own person.\r\nThen Govinda (Krishna) consoling Arjuna with sweet speech addressed these\r\nwell-reasoned words to him.\r\n\r\nVasudeva said, 'O Arjuna, the terror of thine enemies, this whole earth\r\nhas been conquered by the king, the son of Dharma, relying on the power\r\nof thy arms. And O the best of men, the virtuous king Yudhishthira now\r\nenjoys the sovereignty of the earth without a rival, by the might of\r\nBhimasena and the twin brothers. O thou who knowest what virtue is, it\r\nwas by righteousness alone that the king has been able to regain his\r\nkingdom free from all enemies (thorns), and it was by the action of\r\nrighteousness that king Suyodhana has been killed in battle, and, O son\r\nof Pritha and pillar of the Kuru race, the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra,\r\navaricious, always rude in speech, and bent upon an unrighteous course of\r\nconduct, having been exterminated with their followers, the king, the son\r\nof Dharma and lord of the earth, now peaceably enjoys the entire kingdom\r\nof the earth with thy aid, and I too, O son of Pandu, have been\r\npleasantly whiling away my time in thy company, amidst woodland scenes. O\r\nterror of thine enemies, what more need I tell thee, but that where thou\r\nand Pritha, and the king, the son of Dharma, and the mighty Bhimasena and\r\nthe two sons of Madri are, there am I attracted with exquisite delight. O\r\ndescendant of Kuru, in these delightful and sacred and heaven-like halls\r\nof assembly a long time hath fleeted away in thy company without my\r\nseeing Vasudeva, Valadeva and other leaders of the Vrishni race. And now\r\nI am desirous of repairing to the city of Dwaravati. Do thou therefore, O\r\nmost valorous of men, assent to my departure. When king Yudhishthira was\r\nsmitten heavily with affliction, I with Bhishma, have recited to him many\r\nappropriate legends suited to the occasion with a view of assuaging his\r\ngrief, and the pliant and high-minded Yudhishthira, though our sovereign\r\nand versed in all lore paid due heed to our words. That son of Dharma\r\nhonours truth, and is grateful and righteous, therefore will his virtue\r\nand good sense and the stability of his power always endure. And now, O\r\nArjuna, if it pleases thee, do thou go to that high-minded prince and\r\ntell him of my intention to depart from this place. For, O thou of mighty\r\narms, even if death cometh to me, I am unwilling to do anything that may\r\ndisplease him, leaving alone my going to the city of Dwaravati. O son of\r\nPritha and descendant of Kuru, I now tell thee truly, desiring to do only\r\nwhat is good and agreeable to thee, and there can be nothing equivocal in\r\nit in any way, that the necessity for my staying here no longer exists,\r\nbecause, O Arjuna, that monarch the son of Dhritarashtra bath been slain\r\nwith his armies and attendants, and the earth, my friend, with its girdle\r\nof seas and its mountains and woods and forests, and the kingdom of the\r\nKuru king filled with various gems, have passed under the sway of that\r\nwise son of Dharma. And O foremost prince of Bharata's race, may that\r\nvirtuous prince administer the entire kingdom of the earth in\r\nrighteousness, and with the respect and approbation of numerous\r\nhigh-souled Siddhas, and having his praises always extolled by the court\r\nheralds. Do thou, O chieftain of Kuru's race, accompany me to-day to the\r\npresence of the king, the great aggrandiser of the Kuru race, and sound\r\nhim of my intended return to Dwaraka. As Yudhishthira the high-souled\r\nking of the Kurus always commands my love and respect, I have, O son of\r\nPritha, placed this my body and all the wealth that I have in my house,\r\nat his disposal. And O prince Partha (son of Pritha), when this earth has\r\ncome under thy sway and that of the worshipful Yudhishthira of excellent\r\ncharacter, there no longer remains any necessity for my staying here\r\nexcept for my affection for thee. And O monarch, when the redoubtable\r\nArjuna had been thus accosted by the noble-hearted Janarddana, he,\r\nshowing all the honours due to him, sorrowfully replied by merely saying\r\n'be it so.'"

One day, those two listlessly proceeded to a particular\r\npart of the palace that looked, O king, like a veritable portion of\r\nHeaven. Themselves filled with delight, they were then surrounded by\r\ntheir relatives and attendents. Pandu's son, Arjuna, filled with joy in\r\nthe company of Krishna, surveyed that delightful mansion, and then\r\naddressed his companion, saying, 'O--mighty-armed one, thy greatness\r\nbecame known to me upon the approach of the battle. O son of Devaki, thy\r\nform also, as the Lord of the universe, then became known to me! What thy\r\nholy self said unto me at that time, O Kesava, through affection, has all\r\nbeen forgotten by me, O chief of men, in consequence of the fickleness of\r\nmy mind. Repeatedly, however, have I been curious on the subject of those\r\ntruths. Thou again, O Madhava, wilt repair to Dwaraka soon.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by him, Krishna of mighty energy,\r\nthat foremost of speakers, embraced Phalguna and replied unto him as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n'Vasudeva said, 'I made thee listen to truths that are regarded as\r\nmysteries. I imparted to thee truths that are eternal. Verily, I\r\ndiscoursed to thee on Religion in its true form and on all the eternal\r\nregions. It is exceedingly disagreeable to me to learn that thou didst\r\nnot, from folly, receive what I imparted. The recollection of all that I\r\ntold thee on that occasion will not come to me now. Without doubt, O son\r\nof Pandu, thou art destitute of faith and thy understanding is not good.\r\nIt is impossible for me, O Dhananjaya, to repeat, in detail, all that I\r\nsaid on that occasion. That religion (about which I discoursed to thee\r\nthen) is more than sufficient for understanding Brahma. I cannot\r\ndiscourse on it again in detail. I discoursed to thee on Supreme Brahma,\r\nhaving concentrated myself in Yoga. I shalt now, however, recite to thee\r\nan old history upon the same topic. O foremost of all persons, observant\r\nof duty, listen to everything I now say, so that, with an understanding\r\nadapted to my teaching, thou mayst succeed in attaining to the highest\r\nend. O chastiser of foes, on one occasion, a Brahmana came to us from the\r\nregions of Heaven. Of irresistible energy, he came from the regions of\r\nthe Grandsire. He was duly reverenced by us. Listen. O son of Pritha,\r\nwithout yielding to scruples of any kind, to what he, O chief of\r\nBharata's race, said, in answer to our enquiries, agreeably to heavenly\r\nforms.'\r\n\r\nThe Brahmana said, That which thou askest me, O Krishna, connected with\r\nthe religion of Moksha (Emancipation), led by thy compassion for all\r\ncreatures (and not for thy own good),--that, indeed, which destroys all\r\ndelusion, O thou that art possessed of supreme puissance[6] I shall now\r\ntell thee duly, O slayer of Madhu. Do thou listen with concentrated\r\nattention as I discourse to thee, O Madhava. A Brahmana of the name of\r\nKasyapa, possessed of penances and the foremost of all persons conversant\r\nwith duties, came to a certain other Brahmana who had become conversant\r\nwith all the mysteries of religion.[7] Indeed, the latter had mastered\r\nall the knowledge which the scriptures teach respecting the departure and\r\nreappearance of beings and possessed that direct knowledge of all things\r\nwhich Yoga gives. He was well skilled in the truths of all topics\r\nrelating to the world. He had mastered the truth about pleasure and pain.\r\nHe knew the truth about birth and death, and understood the distinctions\r\nbetween merit and demerit. He was a beholder of the ends attained to by\r\nembodied creatures high and low in consequence of their acts. He lived\r\nlike one emancipated from the world. Crowned with ascetic success and\r\npossessed of perfect tranquillity of soul, he had all his senses under\r\ncomplete control. He seemed to blaze with the resplendence of Brahma and\r\nwas capable of going everywhere at will. He knew the science of\r\ndisappearing at will from before the eyes of all. He used to rove in the\r\ncompany of invisible Siddhas and celestial musicians. He used to sit and\r\nconverse with them on some spot retired from the bustle of humanity. He\r\nwas as unattached to all things as the wind. Kasyapa having heard of him\r\ntruly, desired to see him. Possessed of intelligence, that foremost of\r\nall Brahmanas, approached the sage. Himself possessed of penances,\r\nKasyapa, moved by the desire of acquiring merit, fell, with a rapt heart,\r\nat the feet of the sage when he had seen all those wonderful attributes.\r\nFilled with wonder at the sight of those extraordinary accomplishments,\r\nKasyapa began to wait upon that foremost of all Brahmanas, with the\r\ndutiful reverence of a disciple waiting upon his preceptor and succeeded\r\nin propitiating him. By his devotion, O scorcher of foes, rendering to\r\nhint the obedience due from a disciple to a preceptor, Kasyapa gratified\r\nthat Brahmana who possessed all these accomplishments and was endued,\r\nbesides, with scriptural learning and excellent conduct. Gratified with\r\nKasyapa, that Brahmana one day addressed him cheerfully and spoke as\r\nfollows, with an eye to the highest success. Listen to those words, O\r\nJanarddana, as I repeat them.\r\n\r\n\"--'The ascetic crowned with success said,'--By diverse acts, O son, as\r\nalso by the aid of merit, mortal creatures attain to diverse ends here\r\nand residence in Heaven. Nowhere is the highest happiness; nowhere can\r\nresidence be eternal. There are repeated falls from the highest regions\r\nacquired with such sorrow. In consequence of my indulgence in sin, I had\r\nto attain to diverse miserable and inauspicious ends, filled as I was\r\nwith lust and wrath, and deluded by cupidity. I have repeatedly undergone\r\ndeath and rebirth. I have eaten diverse kinds of food, I have sucked at\r\ndiverse breasts. I have seen diverse kinds of mothers, and diverse\r\nfathers dissimilar to one another. Diverse kinds of happiness have been\r\nmine and diverse kinds of misery, O sinless one. On diverse occasions\r\nhave I been separated from what was agreeable and united with what was\r\ndisagreeable. Having earned wealth with great toil I have had to put up\r\nwith its loss. Insults and excessive misery I have received from king and\r\nrelatives. Mental and physical pain, of great severity, have been mine.\r\nHumiliations I have undergone, and death and immurement under\r\ncircumstances of great severity. Falls into Hell have been mine, and\r\ngreat tortures in the domains of Yama. Decrepitude and diseases have\r\nrepeatedly assailed me, and calamities, as frequent, in copious measure.\r\nIn this world I have repeatedly undergone all those afflictions that flow\r\nfrom a perception of all pairs of opposites. After all this, one day,\r\noverwhelmed with sorrow, blank despair came upon me. I took refuge in the\r\nFormless. Afflicted as I was with great distress, I gave up the world\r\nwith all its joys and sorrows.[8] Understanding then this path, I\r\nexercised myself in it in this world. Afterwards, through tranquillity of\r\nsoul, I attained to this success that thou seest. I shall not have to\r\ncome to this world again (after my departure hence). Verily, till I\r\nattain to absorption into eternal Brahman, till, in fact, the final\r\ndissolution of the universe, I shall look on those happy ends that will\r\nbe mine, and on those beings that constitute this universe.[9] Having\r\nacquired this excellent success, I shall, after departing from this\r\nworld, proceed, to what is above it (i.e., Satyaloka) and thence to what\r\nis higher (i.e., absorption into Brahman). Verily, I shall attain to the\r\ncondition, which is unmanifest aspect of Brahman. Let no doubt be thine\r\nas regards this. O scorcher of foes, I shall not return to this world of\r\nmortal creatures. O thou of great wisdom, I have become gratified with\r\nthee. Tell me what I shall do for thee. The time has come for the\r\naccomplishment of that purpose for which thou hast come hither. Verily, I\r\nknow that object for which thou hast sought me. I shall soon depart from\r\nthis world. Hence it is that I have given thee this hint. O thou of great\r\nwisdom and experience, I have been highly gratified with thee for thy\r\nbehaviour. Do thou question me. I shall discourse on what is beneficial\r\nto thee, agreeably to thy desire. I think thy intelligence is great.\r\nIndeed, I applaud it much, for it was with the aid of that intelligence\r\nthat thou wert able to recognise me. Surely, O Kasyapa, thou art\r\npossessed of great intelligence.'"

How does one become emancipated after passing through a\r\nrepeated round of painful rebirths? Enjoying Prakriti for sometime, how\r\ndoes Jiva cast off the particular body (which Prakriti gives)? How does\r\nJiva, freed from the body, attain to what is different from it (viz.,\r\nBrahman)? How does a human being enjoy (and endure the fruits of) the\r\ngood and bad acts done by him? Where do the acts exist of one that is\r\ndevoid of body?[10]\r\n\r\n'The Brahmana said,--Thus urged by Kasyapa, the emancipated sage answered\r\nthose questions one after another. Do thou listen to me, O scion of the\r\nVrishi race, as I recite to thee the answers he made.'\r\n\r\n'--The Emancipated sage said, 'Upon the exhaustion of those acts capable\r\nof prolonging life and bringing on fame which are done in a particular\r\nbody that Jiva assumes, the embodied Jiva, with the span of his life\r\nshortened, begins to do acts hostile to life and health. On the approach\r\nof destruction, his understanding turns away from the proper course. The\r\nman of uncleansed soul, after even a correct apprehension of his\r\nconstitution and strength and of the season of both his own life and of\r\nthe year, begins to eat at irregular intervals and to eat such food as is\r\nhostile to him.[11] At such a time he indulges in practices that are\r\nexceedingly harmful. He sometimes eats excessively and sometimes abstains\r\naltogether from food. He eats bad food or bad meat or takes bad drinks,\r\nor food that has been made up of ingredients incompatible with one\r\nanother. He eats food that is heavy in excess of the measure that is\r\nbeneficial, or before the food previously taken has been digested. He\r\nindulges in physical exercise and sexual pleasure in excess of the due\r\nmeasure, or through avidity for work, suppresses the urgings of his\r\ncorporeal organism even when they become pronounced. Or, he takes food\r\nthat is very juicy, or indulges in sleep during daytime. Food that is not\r\nproperly digested, of itself excites the faults, when the time comes.[12]\r\nFrom such excitement of the faults in his body, he gets disease ending in\r\ndeath itself. Sometimes the person engages in perverse or unnatural acts\r\nlike hanging (for bringing about his death). Through these causes the\r\nliving body of the creature dissolves away. Understand correctly the\r\nmanner as I declare it to thee.[13] Urged on by the Wind which becomes\r\nviolent, the heat in the body, becoming excited and reaching every part\r\nof the body one after another, restrains all the (movements of the) vital\r\nbreaths. Know truly that excited all over the body, the heat becomes very\r\nstrong, and pierces every vital part where life may be said to reside. In\r\nconsequence of this, Jiva, feeling great pain, quickly takes leave of its\r\nmortal casement. Know, O foremost of regenerate persons, that when the\r\nvital parts of the physical organism become thus afflicted, Jiva slips\r\naway from the body, overwhelmed with great pain. All living creatures are\r\nrepeatedly afflicted with birth and death. It is seen, O chief of\r\nBrahmanas, that the pain which is felt by a person when casting off his\r\nbodies is like what is felt by him when first entering the womb or when\r\nissuing out of it. His joints become almost dislocated and he derives\r\nmuch distress from the waters (of the womb).[14] Urged on by (another)\r\nviolent wind, the wind that is in the body becomes excited through cold,\r\nand dissolves away the union of matter (called the body) into its\r\nrespective elements numbering five.[15] That wind which resides in the\r\nvital breaths called Prana and Apana occurring within this compound of\r\nthe five primal elements, rushes upwards, from a situation of distress,\r\nleaving the embodied creature. It is even thus that the wind leaves the\r\nbody. Then is seen breathlessness. The man then becomes destitute of\r\nheat, of breath, of beauty, and of consciousness. Deserted by Brahman\r\n(for Jiva is Brahman), the person is said to be dead. By those ducts\r\nthrough which he perceives all sensuous objects, the bearer of the body\r\nno longer perceives them. It is the eternal Jiva who creates in the body\r\nin those very duets the life-breaths that are generated by food. The\r\nelements gathered together become in certain parts firmly united. Know\r\nthat those parts are called the vitals of the body. It is said so in the\r\nSastras. When those vital parts are pierced, Jiva, rising up, enters the\r\nheart of the living creature and restrains the principle of animation\r\nwithout any delay. The creature then, though still endued with the\r\nprinciple of consciousness, fails to know anything. The vital parts being\r\nall overwhelmed, the knowledge of the living creature becomes overwhelmed\r\nby darkness. Jiva then, who has been deprived of everything upon which to\r\nstay, is then agitated by the wind. He then, deeply breathing a long and\r\npainful breath, goes out quickly, causing the inanimate body to tremble.\r\nDissociated from the body, Jiva, however, is surrounded by his acts. He\r\nbecomes equipped on every side with all his auspicious acts of merit and\r\nwith all his sins. Brahmanas endued with knowledge and equipped with the\r\ncertain conclusions of the scriptures, know him, from indications, as to\r\nwhether he is possessed of merit or with its reverse. Even as men\r\npossessed of eyes behold the fire-fly appearing and disappearing amid\r\ndarkness, men possessed of the eye of knowledge and crowned with success\r\nof penances, behold, with spiritual vision, Jiva as he leaves the body,\r\nas he is reborn, and as he enters the womb. It is seen that Jiva has\r\nthree regions assigned to him eternally. This world where creatures dwell\r\nis called the field of action. Accomplishing acts good or bad, all\r\nembodied creatures attain to the fruits thereof. In consequence of their\r\nown acts, creatures acquire even here superior or inferior enjoyments.\r\nDoers of evil deeds here, in consequence of those acts of theirs, attain\r\nto Hell. This condition of sinking with head downwards, in which\r\ncreatures are cooked, is one of great misery. It is such that a rescue\r\ntherefrom is exceedingly difficult. Indeed; one should strive hard for\r\nsaving oneself from this misery. Those regions where creatures dwell when\r\nthey ascend from this world I shall now declare truly. Do thou listen to\r\nme with attention. By listening to what I say, thou shalt attain to\r\nfirmness of understanding and a clear apprehension of (good and bad)\r\nacts. Know that even those are the regions of all creatures of righteous\r\ndeeds, viz., the stellar worlds that shine in the firmament, the lunar\r\ndisc, and the solar disc as well that shines in the universe in its own\r\nlight. Upon the exhaustion, again, of their merits, they fall away from\r\nthose regions repeatedly. There, in Heaven itself, is distinction of\r\ninferior, superior, and middling felicity. There, in Heaven itself, is\r\ndiscontent at sight of prosperity more blazing than one's own. Even these\r\nare the goals which I have mentioned in detail. I shall, after this,\r\ndiscourse to you on the attainment by Jiva of the condition of residence\r\nin the womb. Do thou hear me, with concentrated attention, O regenerate\r\none, as I speak to thee!'"

Upon attainment of body after body, those acts\r\nproduce fruits corresponding with them.[16] As a fruit-bearing tree, when\r\nthe season comes of productivity, yields a large quantity of fruit,\r\nsimilarly merit, achieved with a pure heart, yields a large crop (of\r\nfelicity). After the same fashion, sin, done with a sinful heart,\r\nproduces a large crop of misery. The Soul (or Jiva), placing the mind\r\nahead, addresses himself to action. Hear then how Jiva, equipt with all\r\nhis acts and overwhelmed with lust and wrath, enters the womb. The vital\r\nseed, mixed with blood, enters the womb of females and becomes the field\r\n(of Jiva), good or bad, born of (his) acts. In consequence of his\r\nsubtlety and the condition of being unmanifest, Jiva does not become\r\nattached to anything even after attaining to a body. Therefore, he is\r\ncalled Eternal Brahman.[17] That (viz., Jiva or Brahman) is the seed of\r\nall creatures. It is in consequence of Him that living creatures live.\r\nThat Jiva, entering all the limbs of the foetus part by part, accepting\r\nthe attribute of mind, and residing within all the regions that belong to\r\nPrana, supports (life). In consequence of this, the foetus becoming\r\nendued with mind begins to move its limbs.[18] As liquified iron, poured\r\n(into a mould), takes the form of the mould, know that the entrance of\r\nJiva into the foetus is even such. As fire, entering a mass of iron,\r\nheats it greatly, do thou know that the manifestation of Jiva in the\r\nfoetus is such. As a lamp, burning in a room, discovers (all things\r\nwithin it), after the same manner mind discovers the different limbs of\r\nthe body.[19] Whatever acts, good or bad, Jiva does in a former body,\r\nhave certainly to be enjoyed or endured by him. By such enjoyment and\r\nendurance former acts are exhausted, and other acts, again, accumulate,\r\ntill Jiva succeed in acquiring a knowledge of the duties included in that\r\ncontemplation which leads to Emancipation. Regarding this, I shall tell\r\nthee those acts by which Jiva, O best of men, while coursing through a\r\nrepeated round of re-births, becomes happy, Gifts, observances of\r\nausterity, Brahmacharyya, bearing Brahman according to the ordinances\r\nlaid down, self-restraint, tranquillity, compassion for all creatures,\r\nrestraint of passions, abstentions from cruelty as also from\r\nappropriating what belongs to others, refraining from doing even mentally\r\nall acts that are false and injurious to living creatures on the Earth,\r\nreverently serving mother and father, honouring deities and guests,\r\nworship of preceptors, pity, purity, constant restraint of all organs,\r\nand causing of all good acts, are said to constitute the conduct of the\r\ngood. From observance of such conduct, arises Righteousness which\r\nprotects all creatures eternally. Such conduct one would always behold\r\namong persons that are good. Verily, such conduct resides there\r\neternally. That course of practices to which persons of tranquil souls\r\nadhere indicates Righteousness. Among them is thrown that course of\r\npractices which constitutes eternal Righteousness. He who would betake\r\nhimself to that Righteousness would never have to attain to a miserable\r\nend. It is by the conduct of the good that the world is restrained in the\r\npaths of Righteousness when it falls away. He that is a Yogin is\r\nEmancipated, and is, therefore, distinguished above these (viz., the\r\ngood).[20] Deliverance from the world takes place, after a long time, of\r\none who acts righteously and well on every occasion as he should. A\r\nliving creature thus always meets with the acts done by him in a former\r\nlife. All these acts constitute the cause in consequence of which he\r\ncomes into this world in a state different from his true form.[21] There\r\nis a doubt in the world as regards the question. By what was the\r\nacceptance (by Jiva) of a body first determined. The Grandsire of all the\r\nworlds, viz., Brahma having first formed a body of his own, then created\r\nthe three worlds, in their entirety, of mobile and immobile creatures.\r\nHaving first himself assumed a body, he then created Pradhana. That\r\nPradhana is the material cause of all embodied creatures, by whom is all\r\nthis covered and whom all came to know as the highest. This that is seen\r\nis said to be destructible; while the other is immortal and\r\nindestructible. This that (is seen) is said to be Kshara (the\r\ndestructible); that, however, which is Para (the other) is the Immortal,\r\n(as also) Akshara (the Indestructible). Of each Purusha taken\r\ndistributively, the whole is duality among these three.[22] Seen first\r\n(to appear in an embodied form) Prajapati (then) created all the primal\r\nelements and all immobile creatures. Even this is the ancient audition.\r\nOf that (acceptance of body), the Grandsire ordained a limit in respect\r\nof time, and migrations among diverse creatures and return or rebirth.\r\nAll that I say is proper and correct, like to what a person who is endued\r\nwith intelligence and who has seen his soul, would say on this topic of\r\nprevious births.[23] That person who looks upon pleasure and pain as\r\ninconstant, which, indeed, is the correct view, who regards the body as\r\nan unholy conglomeration, and destruction as ordained in action, and who\r\nremembers that what little of pleasure there is, is really all pain, will\r\nsucceed in crossing this terrible ocean of worldly migration that is so\r\ndifficult to cross. Though assailed by decrepitude and death and disease,\r\nhe that understands Pradhana beholds with all equal eye that\r\nConsciousness which dwells in all beings endued with consciousness.\r\nSeeking the supreme seat, he then becomes utterly indifferent to all\r\n(other) things. O best of men, I shall now impart instruction to thee,\r\nagreeably to truth, concerning this. Do thou, O learned Brahmana,\r\nunderstand in completeness that which constitutes the excellent\r\nknowledge, as I declare it, of that indestructible seat.--'\""

      "content": "\"--The Brahmana said, 'He who becomes absorbed in the one receptacle (of\r\nall things), freeing himself from even the thought of his own identity\r\nwith all things,--indeed, ceasing to think of even his own\r\nexistence,--gradually casting off one after another, will succeed in\r\ncrossing his bonds.[24] That man who is the friend of all, who endures\r\nall, who is attached to tranquillity, who has conquered all his senses,\r\nwho is divested of fear and wrath, and who is of restrained soul.\r\nsucceeds in emancipating himself. He who behaves towards all creatures as\r\ntowards himself, who is restrained, pure, free from vanity and divested\r\nof egoism is regarded as emancipated from everything. He also is\r\nemancipated who looks with an equal eye upon life and death, pleasure and\r\npain, gain and loss, agreeable and disagreeable. He is in every way\r\nemancipated who does not covet what belongs to others, who never\r\ndisregards any body, who transcends all pairs of opposites, and whose\r\nsoul is free from attachment. He is emancipated who has no enemy, no\r\nkinsman, and no child, who has cast off religion, wealth, and pleasure,\r\nand who is freed from desire or cupidity. He becomes emancipated who\r\nacquires neither merit nor demerit, who casts off the merits and demerits\r\naccumulated in previous births, who wastes the elements of his body for\r\nattaining to a tranquillised soul, and who transcends all pairs of\r\nopposites. He who abstains from all acts, who is free from desire or\r\ncupidity, who looks upon the universe as unenduring or as like an\r\nAswattha tree, ever endued with birth, death and decrepitude, whose\r\nunderstanding is fixed on renunciation, and whose eyes are always\r\ndirected towards his own faults, soon succeeds in emancipating himself\r\nfrom the bonds that bind him.[25] He that sees his soul void of smell, of\r\ntaste and touch, of sound, of belongings, of vision, and unknowable,\r\nbecomes emancipated.[26] He who sees his soul devoid of the attributes of\r\nthe five elements to be without form and cause, to be really destitute of\r\nattributes though enjoying them, becomes emancipated.[27] Abandoning,\r\nwith the aid of the understanding, all purposes relating to body and\r\nmind, one gradually attains to cessation of separate existence, like a\r\nfire unfed with fuel.[28] One who is freed from all impressions, who\r\ntranscends all pairs of opposites, who is destitute of all belongings,\r\nand who uses all his senses under the guidance of penances, becomes\r\nemancipated.[29] Having become freed from all impressions, one then\r\nattains to Brahma which is Eternal and supreme, and tranquil, and stable,\r\nand enduring, and indestructible. After this I shall declare the science\r\nof Yoga to which there is nothing superior, and how Yogins, by\r\nconcentration, behold the perfect soul.[30] I shall declare the\r\ninstructions regarding it duly. Do thou learn from me those doors by\r\nwhich directing the soul within the body one beholds that which is\r\nwithout beginning and end.[31] Withdrawing the senses from their objects,\r\none should fix the mind upon the soul; having previously undergone the\r\nseverest austerities, one should practise that concentration of mind\r\nwhich leads to Emancipation.[32] Observant of penances and always\r\npractising concentration of mind, the learned Brahmana, endued with\r\nintelligence, should observe the precepts of the science of Yoga,\r\nbeholding the soul in the body. If the good man succeeds in concentrating\r\nthe mind on the soul, he then, habituated to exclusive meditation,\r\nbeholds the Supreme soul in his own soul. Self-restrained, and always\r\nconcentrated, and with all his senses completely conquered, the man of\r\ncleansed soul, in consequence of such complete concentration of mind,\r\nsucceeds in beholding the soul by the soul. As a person beholding some\r\nunseen individual in a dream recognises him, saying,--This is he,--when\r\nhe sees him after waking, after the same manner the good man having seen\r\nthe Supreme Soul in the deep contemplation of Samadhi recognises it upon\r\nwaking from Samadhi.[33] As one beholds the fibrous pith after extracting\r\nit from a blade of the Saccharum Munja, even so the Yogin beholds the\r\nsoul, extracting it from the body. The body has been called the Saccharum\r\nMunja, and the fibrous pith is said to stand for the soul. This is the\r\nexcellent illustration propounded by persons conversant with Yoga. When\r\nthe bearer of a body adequately beholds the soul in Yoga, he then has no\r\none that is master over him, for he then becomes the lord of the three\r\nworlds.[34] He succeeds in assuming diverse bodies according as he\r\nwishes. Turning away decrepitude and death, he neither grieves nor\r\nexults. The self-restrained man, concentrated in Yoga, can create (for\r\nhimself) the godship of the very gods. Casting off his transient body he\r\nattains to immutable Brahma.[35] No fear springs up in him at even the\r\nsight of all creatures falling victims to destruction (before his eyes).\r\nWhen all creatures are afflicted,--he can never be afflicted by any one.\r\nDevoid of desire and possessed of a tranquil mind, the person in Yoga is\r\nnever shaken by pain and sorrow and fear, the terrible effects that flow\r\nfrom attachment and affection. Weapons never pierce him; death does not\r\nexist for him. Nowhere in the world can be seen any one that is happier\r\nthan he. Having adequately concentrated his soul, he lives steadily on\r\nhimself. Turning off decrepitude and pain and pleasure, he sleeps in\r\ncomfort. Casting off this human body he attains to (other) forms\r\naccording to his pleasure. While one is enjoying the sovereignty that\r\nYoga bestows, one should never fall away from devotion to Yoga.[36] When\r\none, after adequate devotion to Yoga, beholds the Soul in oneself, one\r\nthen ceases to have any regard for even him of a hundred sacrifices\r\n(Indra).[37] Hear now how one, habituating oneself to exclusive\r\nmeditation, succeeds in attaining to Yoga. Thinking of that point of the\r\ncompass which has the Sun behind it, the mind should be fixed, not\r\noutside, but in the interior of that mansion in which one may happen to\r\nlive. Residing within that mansion, the mind should then, with all its\r\noutward and inward (operations), behold in that particular room in which\r\none may stay. At that time when, having deeply meditated, one beholds the\r\nAll (viz., Brahman, the Soul of the universe), there is then nothing\r\nexternal to Brahman where the mind may dwell. Restraining all the senses\r\nin a forest that is free from noise and that is uninhabited, with mind\r\nfixed thereon, one should meditate on the All (or universal Brahman) both\r\noutside and inside one's body. One should meditate on the teeth, the\r\npalate, the tongue, the throat, the neck likewise; one should also\r\nmeditate on the heart and the ligatures of the heart![38]\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana continued, 'Thus addressed by me, that intelligent\r\ndisciple, O slayer of Madhu, once more asked me about this religion of\r\nEmancipation that is so difficult to explain. How does this food that is\r\neaten from time to time become digested in the stomach? How does it\r\nbecome transformed into juice? How, again, into blood? How does it\r\nnourish the flesh, the marrow, the sinews, the bones? How do all these\r\nlimbs of embodied creatures grow? How does the strength grow of the\r\ngrowing man? How occurs the escape of all such elements as are not\r\nnutritive, and of all impurities separately? How does this one inhale and\r\nagain, exhale? Staying upon what particular part does the Soul dwell in\r\nthe body? How does Jiva, exerting himself, bear the body? Of what colour\r\nand of what kind is the body in which he dwells again (leaving a\r\nparticular body)? O holy one, it behoveth thee to tell me all this\r\naccurately, O sinless one,--even thus was I interrogated by that learned\r\nBrahmana, O Madhava. I replied unto him, O thou of mighty arms, after the\r\nmanner I myself had heard, O chastiser of all foes. As one placing some\r\nprecious object in one's store-room should keep one's mind on it, so,\r\nplacing the mind within one's own body, one should then, restraining all\r\nthe senses, seek after the Soul, avoiding all heedlessness. One would,\r\nbecoming always assiduous in this way and gratified with one's own self,\r\nwithin a very short time attain to that Brahma by beholding which one\r\nwould become conversant with Pradhana.[39] He is not capable of being\r\nseized by the eye; nor even by all the senses.[40] It is only with the\r\nlamp of the mind that great Soul can be seen. He has hands and feet on\r\nall sides; he has ears on all sides; he dwells, pervading all things in\r\nthe world.[41] Jiva beholds the Soul as extracted from the body (like the\r\nstalk from a blade of Saccharum Munja, when knowledge comes). Then\r\ncasting off Brahma as invested with form, by holding the mind in the\r\nbody, he beholds Brahma as freed from all attributes.[42] He sees the\r\nSoul with his mind, smiling as it were at the time. Depending upon that\r\nBrahma, he then attains to Emancipation in me.[43] O foremost of\r\nregenerate ones, all this mystery has now been declared by me. I ask thy\r\npermission, for I shall leave this spot. Do thou (also) go withersoever\r\nthou pleasest. Thus addressed by me, O Krishna, on that occasion, that\r\ndisciple of mine, endued with austere penances, that Brahmana of rigid\r\nvows, went away according to his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva continued, 'That best of Brahmanas, O son of Pritha, having\r\nsaid these words unto me, on that occasion, properly relating to the\r\nreligion of Emancipation, disappeared then and there. Has this discourse\r\nbeen heard by thee, O son of Pritha, with mind directed solely towards\r\nit? Even this was what thou didst hear on that occasion while thou wert\r\non thy car. It is my opinion, O son of Pritha, that this is difficult of\r\nbeing comprehended by one whose understanding is confused, or who has\r\nacquired no wisdom by study, or who eats food incompatible with his body,\r\nor whose Soul is not purified.[44] O chief of Bharata's race, this is a\r\ngreat mystery among the deities that has been declared (to thee). At no\r\ntime or place, O son of Pritha, has this been heard by man in this world.\r\nO sinless one, no other man than thyself is deserving of hearing it. It\r\nis not, at this time, capable of being easily understood by one whose\r\ninner soul is confused. The world of the deities is filled, O son of\r\nKunti, with those who follow the religion of actions. The cessation of\r\nthe mortal form (by practising the religion of inaction) is not agreeable\r\nto the deities.[45] That goal, O son of Pritha, is the highest which is\r\nconstituted by eternal Brahman where one, casting off the body, attains\r\nto immortality and becomes always happy. By adhering to this religion,\r\neven they who axe of sinful birth, such as women and Vaisyas and Sudras,\r\nattain to the highest goal. What need be said then, O son of Pritha, of\r\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas possessed of great learning, always devoted to\r\nthe duties of their own orders and who are intent on (the acquisition of)\r\nthe region of Brahma? This has been laid down with the reasons (on which\r\nit rests); and also the means for its acquisition; and its complete\r\nattainment and fruit, viz., Emancipation and the ascertainment of the\r\ntruth regarding pain. O chief of Bharata's race, there is nothing else\r\nthat is fraught with happiness greater than this. That mortal, O son of\r\nPandu, who, endued with intelligence, and faith, and prowess, renounces\r\nas unsubstantial what is regarded as substantial by the world, succeeds\r\nwithin a short time in obtaining the Supreme by these means. This is all\r\nthat is to be said,--there is nothing else that is higher than this. Yoga\r\ntakes place in his case, O son of Pritha, who devotes himself to its\r\nconstant practice for a period of six months.'\""

      "content": "\"Vasudeva said, 'In this connection is cited the ancient narrative, O son\r\nof Pritha, of the discourse that took place between a married couple. A\r\ncertain Brahmana's spouse, beholding the Brahmana, her husband who was a\r\ncomplete master of every kind of knowledge and wisdom, seated in\r\nseclusion, said unto him,--Into what region shall I go, depending on thee\r\nas my husband,--thee that art seated, having cast off all (religious)\r\nacts, that art harsh in thy conduct towards me, and that art so\r\nundiscerning?[46] It has been heard by us that a wife attains to those\r\nregions which are acquired by her husband. What, indeed, is the goal that\r\nI shall attain, having obtained thee for my husband?--Thus questioned,\r\nthat Brahmana of tranquil soul then said unto her, smilingly,--O blessed\r\ndame, I am not offended with these words of thine, O sinless one.\r\nWhatever acts exist that are adopted with the aid of others, that are\r\nseen (in consequence of their grossness), and that are true, are done as\r\nacts by men devoted to acts.[47] Those persons that are destitute of\r\nknowledge, only store delusion by acts. Freedom from acts, again, is\r\nincapable of being attained in this world for even a moment. From birth\r\nto the attainment of a different form, action good or bad, and\r\naccomplished by acts, mind, or speech, exists in all beings. Those paths\r\n(of action) which are characterised by visible objects (such as\r\nSoma-juice and ghee for libations) being destroyed by Rakshasas, turning\r\naway from them I have perceived the seat (of the soul) that is in the\r\nbody, without the aid of the soul.[48] There dwells Brahma transcending\r\nall pairs of opposites; there Soma with Agni: and there the urger of the\r\nunderstanding (viz., Vayu) always moves, upholding all creatures.[49] It\r\nis for that seat that the Grandsire Brahman and others, concentrated in\r\nYoga, worship the Indestructible. It is for that seat that men of\r\nlearning and excellent vows, of tranquil souls, and of senses completely\r\nvanquished, strive.[50] That is not capable of being smelt by the sense\r\nof smell; nor tasted by the tongue; or touched by the organs of touch. It\r\nis by the mind that that is attained. It is incapable of being conquered\r\nby the eye. It transcends the sense of hearing. It is destitute of scent,\r\ntaste, touch, and form as attributes. It is that from which proceeds the\r\nwell-ordained universe, and it is that upon which it rests. The\r\nlife-breaths called Prana and Apana and Samana and Vyana and Udana flow\r\nfrom it, and it is that into which they again enter. The breaths Prana\r\nand Apana move between Samana and Vyana. When the soul sleeps, both\r\nSamana and Vyana are absorbed.[51] Between Apana and Prana, Udana dwells,\r\npervading all. Hence, Prana and Apana do not desert a sleeping person. In\r\nconsequence of its controlling all the life-winds, the controlling breath\r\nis called Udana. Hence, utterers of Brahman undergo penances which have\r\nmyself for their goal.[52] In the midst of all those life-breaths that\r\nswallow up one another and move within the body, blazes forth the fire\r\ncalled Vaiswanara made up of seven flames. The nose, the tongue, the eye,\r\nthe skin, the ear which numbers the fifth, the mind, and the\r\nunderstanding,--these are the seven tongues of that Vaiswanara's flame.\r\nThat which is smelt, that which is seen, that which is drunk, that which\r\nis touched, as also that which is heard, that which is thought of, and\r\nthat which is understood,--these are the seven sorts of fuel for me. That\r\nwhich smells, that which eats, that which sees, that which touches, that\r\nwhich hears numbering the fifth; that which thinks, and that which\r\nunderstands,--these are the seven great officiating priests. Behold, O\r\nblessed one, learned sacrificers duly casting seven libations in seven\r\nways in the seven fires, viz., that which is smelt, that which is drunk,\r\nthat which is seen, that which is touched, as also that which is heard,\r\nthat which is thought of, and that which is understood, create them in\r\ntheir own wombs.[53] Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and Light numbering as\r\nthe fifth, Mind, and Understanding--these seven are called wombs (of all\r\nthings). All the attributes which constitute the sacrificial offerings,\r\nenter into the attribute that is born of the fire, and having dwelt\r\nwithin that dwelling became reborn in their respective wombs. Thither\r\nalso, viz., in that which generates all beings, they remain absorbed\r\nduring the period for which dissolution lasts. From that is produced\r\nsmell, from that is produced taste, from that is produced colour, and\r\nfrom that is produced touch; from that is produced sound; from that\r\narises doubt; and from that is produced resolution. This is what is known\r\nas the sevenfold creation. It is in this very way that all this was\r\ncomprehended by the ancients. By the three full and final libations, the\r\nfull become full with light.'\""

The points of the compass, Quarters, Wind, Sun, Moon,\r\nEarth, Fire, Vishnu, Indra, Prajapati, and Mitra,--these, O beautiful\r\none, are the ten (sacrificial) fires. The ten organs (of knowledge and\r\naction) are the sacrificing priests. The libations, O beautiful one, are\r\nten. The objects of the senses are the fuel that are cast into these ten\r\nfires,[54] as also the mind, which is the ladle, and the wealth (viz.,\r\nthe good and bad acts of the sacrificer). What remains is the pure,\r\nhighest knowledge. We have heard that all this universe was well\r\ndifferentiated (from Knowledge). All objects of knowledge are Mind.\r\nKnowledge only perceives (i.e., discovers the Mind without being attached\r\nto it). The knower (or Jiva), encased in subtle form, lives within the\r\ngross body that is produced by the vital seed. The bearer of the body is\r\nthe Garhapatya fire. From that is produced another. Mind is the Ahavaniya\r\nfire. Into it is poured the oblation. From that was produced the Veda (or\r\nWord); (then was born Mind); Mind (desirous of creation) sets itself on\r\nthe Veda (or the Word). Their arises form (or colour) undistinguished by\r\nparticular colours. It runs towards the Mind.'\"[55]\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana's wife said, 'Why did Word first arise and why did Mind\r\narise afterwards, seeing that Word starts into existence after having\r\nbeen thought upon by Mind? Upon that authority can it be said that Mati\r\n(Prana) takes refuge in Mind. Why, again, in dreamless slumber, though\r\nseparated from Mind, does not Prana apprehend (all objects)? What is that\r\nwhich restrains it then?'\"[56]\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana said, 'The Apana breath, becoming the lord (i.e., bringing\r\nthe Prana under its control), in consequence of such lordship over it,\r\nmakes it identical with itself. That restrained motion of the Prana\r\nbreath (which for the time becomes identical with that of the Apana) has\r\nbeen said to be the motion of the mind. Hence the mind is dependent upon\r\nPrana, not Prana upon the mind. Therefore, in dreamless slumber, upon the\r\ndisappearance of mind, Prana does not disappear. But since thou askest me\r\na question about word and mind, I shall, therefore, relate to thee a\r\ndiscourse between them. Both Word and Mind, repairing to the Soul of\r\nmatter,[57] asked him,--Do thou say who amongst us is superior. Do thou,\r\nO puissant one, dispel our doubt.--On that occasion, the holy one made\r\nthis answer.--The mind undoubtedly (is superior). Unto him Word said,--'I\r\nyield to thee the fruition of all thy desires!'[58]\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana said, 'Know that I have two minds, immovable and movable.\r\nThat which is immovable is, verily, with me; the movable is in your\r\ndominion.[59] That mind is verily called movable which, in the form of\r\nMantra, letter, or voice, is referable to your dominion. Hence, thou art\r\nsuperior (to the other mind which concerns itself with only the external\r\nworld). But since, coming of thy own accord, O beautiful one, thou\r\nenterest into the engagement (about the fruition of all wishes),\r\ntherefore, filling myself with breath, I utter thee.[60] The goddess Word\r\nused always to dwell between Prana and Apana. But, O blessed one, sinking\r\ninto Apana, though urged upwards, in consequence of becoming dissociated\r\nfrom Prana, she ran to Prajapati and said,--Be gratified with me, O holy\r\none.--The Prana appeared, once more fostering Word. Hence, Word,\r\nencountering deep exhalation, never utters anything. Word always flows as\r\nendued with utterance or unendued with it.[61] Amongst those two, Word\r\nwithout utterance is superior to Word with utterance. Like a cow endued\r\nwith excellent milk, she (Word without utterance) yields diverse kinds of\r\nmeaning. This one always yields the Eternal (viz., Emancipation),\r\nspeaking of Brahman. O thou of beautiful smiles, Word is a cow, in\r\nconsequence of her puissance which is both divine and not divine. Behold\r\nthe distinction of these two subtle forms of Word that flow.'\"[62]\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana's wife said, 'What did the goddess of Word then say, in\r\ndays of old, when, though impelled by the Wish to speak, Speech could not\r\ncome out?'\"\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana said, 'The Word that is generated in the body by Prana,\r\nthen attains to Apana from Prana. Then transformed into Udana and issuing\r\nout of the body, envelops all the quarters, with Vyana. After that, she\r\ndwells in Samana. Even in this way did Word formerly speak. Hence Mind,\r\nin consequence of being immovable, is distinguished, and the goddess\r\nWord, in consequence of being movable, is also distinguished.\"'"

If, again, thou deemest thy\r\npower over our objects to be always complete, do thou then seize colour\r\nby the nose, and taste by the eye. Do thou also take smell by the ear,\r\nand sensations of touch by the tongue. Do thou also take sounds by the\r\nskin, and likewise touch by the understanding. They that are powerful do\r\nnot own the dominion of any rules. Rules exist for those only that are\r\nweak. Do thou seize enjoyments unenjoyed before; it behoves thee not to\r\nenjoy what has been tasted before (by others). As a disciple repairs to a\r\npreceptor for the sake of (acquiring) the Srutis, and then, having\r\nacquired the Srutis, dwells on their import (by obeying their\r\ninjunctions), even so dost thou regard as thine those objects which are\r\nshown by us, past or future, in sleep or in wakefulness. Of creatures,\r\nagain, that are of little intelligence, when their mind becomes\r\ndistracted and cheerless, life is seen to be upheld upon our objects\r\ndischarging their functions.[64] It is seen also that a creature, after\r\nhaving formed even innumerable purposes and indulged in dreams, when\r\nafflicted by the desire to enjoy, runs to objects of sense at once.[65]\r\nOne entering upon enjoyments depending on mental purposes alone and\r\nunconnected with actual objects of sense, always meets with death upon\r\nthe exhaustion of the life-breaths, like an enkindled fire upon the\r\nexhaustion of fuel.

In the union of semen and blood, generated\r\nby Samana and Vyana, the pair that consists of Prana and Apana, enters,\r\nmoving transversely and upwards, Vyana and Samana both form a pair that\r\nmoves transversely.

The agent, the\r\ninstrument, the action and Emancipation,--these, O beautiful lady, are\r\nthe four sacrificing priests by whom the universe is enveloped. Hear in\r\nits entirety the assignment of causes (relating to this topic). The nose,\r\nthe tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear numbering the fifth, the mind, and\r\nthe understanding,--these seven should be understood as being caused by\r\n(the knowledge of) qualities. Smell, taste, colour, sound, touch,\r\nnumbering the fifth, the objects of the mind, and the objects of the\r\nunderstanding, these seven are caused by action. He who smells, he who\r\neats, he who sees, he who speaks, he who hears, numbering the fifth, he\r\nwho thinks, and he who understands--these seven should be known as caused\r\nby the agent. Possessed of qualities, these enjoy their own qualities,\r\nagreeable or disagreeable.[68] As regards the Soul, that is destitute of\r\nqualities. These seven are the causes of Emancipation. With them that are\r\nlearned and possessed of sufficient understanding, the qualities, which\r\nare in the position of deities, eat the oblations, each in its proper\r\nplace, and agreeably to what has been ordained. The person who is\r\ndestitute of learning, eating diverse kind of food, becomes seized with\r\nthe sense of mineness.[69] Digesting food for himself, he becomes ruined\r\nthrough the sense of mineness. The eating of food that should not be\r\neaten, and the drinking of wine, ruin him. He destroys the food (he\r\ntakes), and having destroyed that food, he becomes destroyed himself. The\r\nman of learning, however, being possessed of puissance, destroys his food\r\nfor reproducing it. The minutest transgression does not arise in him from\r\nthe food he takes. Whatever is thought of by the mind, whatever is\r\nuttered by speech, whatever is heard by the ear, whatever is seen by the\r\neye, whatever is touched by the (sense of) touch, whatever is smelt by\r\nthe nose, constitute oblations of clarified butter which should all,\r\nafter restraining the senses with the mind numbering the sixth, be poured\r\ninto that fire of high merits which burns within the body, viz., the\r\nSoul.[70] The sacrifice constituted by Yoga is going on as regards\r\nmyself. The spring whence that sacrifice proceeds is that which yields\r\nthe fire of knowledge. The upward life-wind Prana is the Stotra of that\r\nsacrifice. The downward life-wind Apana is its Sastra. The renunciation\r\nof everything is the excellent Dakshina of that sacrifice. Consciousness,\r\nMind, and Understanding--these becoming Brahma, are its Hotri, Adhwaryyu,\r\nand Udgatri. The Prasastri, his Sastra, is truth.[71] Cessation of\r\nseparate existence (or Emancipation) is the Dakshina. In this connection,\r\npeople conversant with Narayana recite some Richs. Unto the divine\r\nNarayana were animals offered in days of yore.[72] Then are sung some\r\nSamanas. On that topic occurs an authority.

They\r\n(then) never stand in fear of any creature, nor does any creature stand\r\nin fear of them. In that forest are seven large trees, seven fruits, and\r\nseven guests. There are seven hermitages, seven (forms of) Yoga\r\nconcentration, and seven (forms) of initiation. Even this a description\r\nof that forest.[76] The trees which stand filling that forest, produce\r\nexcellent flowers and fruits of five colours. The trees which stand there\r\nfilling that forest, produce flowers and fruits that are of excellent\r\ncolours and that are, besides, of two kinds. The trees which stand there\r\nfilling that forest, produce flowers and fruits that are endued with\r\nfragrance and that are, besides, of two colours. The trees which stand\r\nthere filling that forest, produce flowers and fruits that are possessed\r\nof fragrance and that are, besides, of one colour. The two trees which\r\nstand filling that forest, produce many flowers and fruits that are of\r\nunmanifest colours. There is one fire here, possessed of a good mind.\r\nThat is connected with Brahmana. The five senses are the fuel here. The\r\nseven forms of Emancipation flowing from them are the seven forms of\r\nInitiation. The qualities are the fruits, and the guests eat those\r\nfruits. There, in diverse places, the great Rishis accept hospitality.\r\nWhen they, having been worshipped, become annihilated, then another\r\nforest shines forth. In that forest, Intelligence is the tree;\r\nEmancipation is the fruit; Tranquillity is the shade of which it is\r\npossessed. It has knowledge for its resting house, contentment for its\r\nwater, and the Kshetrajna for its sun. Its end cannot be ascertained\r\nupwards, downwards, or horizontally. Seven females always dwell there,\r\nwith faces downwards, possessed of effulgence, and endued with the cause\r\nof generations. They take up all the different tastes from all creatures,\r\neven as inconstancy sucks up truth. In that itself dwell, and from that\r\nemerge, the seven Rishis who are crowned with ascetic success, with those\r\nseven having Vasishtha for their foremost. Glory, effulgence, greatness,\r\nenlightenment, victory, perfection, and energy, these seven always follow\r\nthis same like rays following the sun. Hills and mountains also exist\r\nthere, collected together; and rivers and streams bearing waters in their\r\ncourse, waters that are born of Brahma.

Those whose\r\nwishes have been reduced, whose wishes have been directed to excellent\r\nvows, and whose sins have been burnt off by penances, merging themselves\r\nin their souls, succeed in attaining to Brahman.

Nor do I entertain purposes of any kind. It is\r\nNature that desires such objects as are liked; it is Nature that hates\r\nsuch objects as are disliked. Desire and aversion spring from Nature,\r\nafter the manner of the upward and the downward life-winds when souls\r\nhave entered animate bodies. Separated from them are others; in them are\r\neternal dispositions; (these as also) the soul of all creatures, Yogins\r\nwould behold in the body. Dwelling in that, I am never attached to\r\nanything through desire and wrath, and decrepitude and death. Not having\r\nany desire for any object of desire, and not having any aversion for any\r\nevil, there is no taint on my natures, as there is no taint of a drop of\r\nwater on (the leaves of) the lotus. Of this constant (principle) which\r\nlooks upon diverse natures, they are inconstant possessions.[77] Though\r\nactions are performed, yet the assemblage of enjoyments does not attach\r\nitself to them, even as the assemblage of rays of the sun does not attach\r\nto the sky. In this connection is recited an ancient story of a discourse\r\nbetween an Adhwaryu and a Yati. Do thou hear it, O glorious lady.\r\nBeholding an animal sprinkled with water at a sacrificial ceremony, a\r\nYati said unto the Adhwaryu seated there these words in censure,--This is\r\ndestruction of life! unto him the Adhwaryu said in reply,--This goat will\r\nnot be destroyed. The animal (sacrificed) meets with great good, if the\r\nVedic declaration on this subject be true. That part of this animal which\r\nis of earth will go to earth. That part of this one which is born of\r\nwater, will enter into water. His eye will enter the sun; his ear will\r\nenter the different points of the horizon; his life-winds will enter the\r\nsky. I who adhere to the scriptures incur no fault (by assisting at the\r\nkilling of this animal).'\r\n\r\n\"The Yati said, 'If thou beholdest such good to the goat in this\r\ndissociation with (his) life-winds, then this sacrifice is for the goat.\r\nWhat need hast thou for it? Let the brother, father, mother, and friend\r\n(of this goat) give thee their approval in this. Taking him (to them) do\r\nthou consult them. This goat is especially dependent. It behoveth thee to\r\nsee them who can give their consent in this. After hearing their consent;\r\nthe matter will become fit for consideration. The life-winds of this goat\r\nhave been made to return to their respective sources. Only the inanimate\r\nbody remains behind. This is what I think. Of those who wish to enjoy\r\nfelicity by means of the inanimate body (of an animal) which is\r\ncomparable with fuel, the fuel (of sacrifice) is after all the animal\r\nhimself. Abstention from cruelty is the foremost of all deities. Even\r\nthis is the teaching of the elders. We know this is the proposition,\r\nviz.,--No slaughter (of living creatures).--If I say anything further,\r\n(it will then appear that) diverse kinds of faulty actions are capable of\r\nbeing done by thee. Always abstaining from cruelty to all creatures is\r\nwhat meets with our approbation. We establish this from what is directly\r\nperceptible. We do not rely on what is beyond direct perception.'\r\n\r\n\"The Adhwaryu said, 'Thou enjoyest the properties of smell which belong\r\nto the earth. Thou drinkest the tastes which appertain to water. Thou\r\nseest colours which belong to lighted bodies. Thou touchest the\r\nproperties which, have their origin in wind. Thou hearest the sounds\r\nwhich have their origin in space (or ether). Thou thinkest thoughts with\r\nthe mind. All these entities, thou art of opinion, have life. Thou dost\r\nnot then abstain from taking life. Really, thou art engaged in slaughter.\r\nThere can be no movement without slaughter. Or, what dost thou think, O\r\nregenerate one.'\r\n\r\n\"The Yati said, 'The Indestructible and the Destructible constitute the\r\ndouble manifestation of the soul. Of these the Indestructible is existed.\r\nThe Destructible is said to be exceedingly non-existent.[78] The\r\nlife-wind, the tongue, the mind, the quality of goodness, along with the\r\nquality of passion, are all existent. The Atman is above these forms and\r\nhence is without duality and hope. As regards one that is freed from\r\nthese existent objects, that transcends all pairs of opposites, that does\r\nnot cherish any expectation, that is alike to all creatures, that is\r\nliberated from the idea of meum, that has subjugated his self, and that\r\nis released from all his surroundings,--for him no fear exists from any\r\nsource!'[79]\r\n\r\n\"The Adhwaryu said, 'O foremost of intelligent men, one should reside\r\nwith those that are good. Hearing thy opinion my understanding shines\r\nwith light. O illustrious one, I come to thee, believing thee to be a\r\ngod; and I say I have no fault, O regenerate one, by performing these\r\nrites with the aid of Mantras!'[80]\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmana continued, 'With this conclusion, the Yati remained silent\r\nafter this. The Adhwaryu also proceeded with the great sacrifice, freed\r\nfrom delusion. The Brahmanas understand Emancipation, which is\r\nexceedingly subtle, to be of this kind and having understood it, they\r\nlive accordingly directed by the Kshetrajna, that beholder of all\r\ntopics.'\""

It has been heard by us that, once on a time, as he was\r\nwalking on the shores of the sea, proud of his might, he showered\r\nhundreds of shafts on that vast receptacle of waters. The Ocean, bowing\r\ndown unto him, said, with joined hands,--Do not, O hero, shoot thy shafts\r\n(at me)! Say, what shall I do to thee. With these mighty arrows shot by\r\nthee, those creatures which have taken shelter in me are being killed, O\r\ntiger among kings. Do thou, O lord, grant them security.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'If any wielder of the bow exists that is equal to me in\r\nbattle, and that would stand against me in the field, do thou name him to\r\nme!'\r\n\r\n\"The Ocean said, If thou hast heard, O king, of the great Rishi\r\nJamadagni, his son is competent to duly receive thee as a guest.--Then\r\nthat king proceeded, filled with great wrath. Arrived at that retreat, he\r\nfound Rama himself. With his kinsmen he began to do many acts that were\r\nhostile to Rama, and caused much trouble to that high-souled hero. Then\r\nthe energy, which was immeasurable of Rama blazed forth, burning the\r\ntroops of the foe, O lotus-eyed one. Taking up his battle-axe, Rama\r\nsuddenly put forth his power, and hacked that thousand-armed hero, like a\r\ntree of many branches. Beholding him slain and prostrated on the earth,\r\nall his kinsmen, uniting together, and taking up their darts, rushed at\r\nRama, who was then seated, from all sides. Rama also, taking up his bow\r\nand quickly ascending on his car, shot showers of arrows and chastised\r\nthe army of the king. Then, some of the Kshatriyas, afflicted with the\r\nterror of Jamadagni's son, entered mountain-fastnesses, like deer\r\nafflicted by the lion. Of them that were unable, through fear of Rama, to\r\ndischarge the duties ordained for their order, the progeny became\r\nVrishalas owing to their inability to find Brahmanas.[81] In this way\r\nDravidas and Abhiras and Pundras, together with the Savaras, became\r\nVrishalas through those men who had Kshatriya duties assigned to them (in\r\nconsequence of their birth), falling away (from those duties). Then the\r\nKshatriyas that were begotten by the Brahmanas upon Kshatriya women that\r\nhad lost their heroic children, were repeatedly destroyed by Jamadagni's\r\nson. The slaughter proceeded one and twenty times. At its conclusion a\r\nbodiless voice, sweet and proceeding from heaven, and which was heard by\r\nall people, spoke to Rama, 'O Rama, O Rama, desist! What met it dost thou\r\nsee, O son, in thus destroying repeatedly these inferior Kshatriyas?'[82]\r\nIn this way, O blessed dame, his grandsires, headed by Richika, addressed\r\nthat high-souled one, saying. 'Do thou desist.' Rama, however, unable to\r\nforgive the slaughter of his sire, replied unto those Rishis saying, 'It\r\nbehoves you not to forbid me.' The Pitris then said, 'O foremost of all\r\nvictorious men, it behoves thee not to slay these inferior Kshatriyas. It\r\nis not proper that thyself, being a Brahmana, should slay these kings.'\""

Cutting these with showers of arrows, the man of\r\nintelligence, free from procrastination, possessed of a tranquil soul,\r\nand with his senses under subjection, ventures to vanquish others.[85] In\r\nthis connection, persons conversant with (the occurrence of) ancient\r\ncycles recite some verses which were sung in days of old by king\r\nAmvarisha who had acquired a tranquil soul. When diverse kinds of faults\r\nwere in the ascendant and when the righteous were afflicted, Amvarisha of\r\ngreat fame put forth his strength for assuming sovereignty.[86] Subduing\r\nhis own faults and worshipping the righteous, he attained to great\r\nsuccess and sang these verses.--I have subdued many faults. I have killed\r\nall foes. But there is one, the greatest, vice which deserves to be\r\ndestroyed but which has not been destroyed by me! Urged by that fault,\r\nthis Jiva fails to attain to freedom from desire. Afflicted by desire,\r\none runs into ditches without knowing it. Urged by that fault, one\r\nindulges in acts that are forbidden. Do thou cut off, cut off, that\r\ncupidity with sharp-edged swords. From cupidity arise desires. From\r\ndesire flows anxiety. The man who yields to desire acquires many\r\nqualities that appertain to passion. When these have been acquired, he\r\ngets many qualities that appertain to Darkness. In consequence of those\r\nqualities, he repeatedly takes birth, with the bonds of body united, and\r\nis impelled to action. Upon the expiration of life, with body becoming\r\ndismembered and scattered, he once meets with death which is due to birth\r\nitself.[87] Hence, duly understanding this, and subduing cupidity by\r\nintelligence, one should desire for sovereignty in one's soul. This is\r\n(true) sovereignty. There is no other sovereignty here. The soul,\r\nproperly understood, is the king. Even these were the verses sung by king\r\nAmbarisha of great celebrity, on the subject of sovereignty which he kept\r\nbefore him,--that king who had cut off the one foremost fault viz.,\r\ncupidity.'\""

When I failed to find it even\r\nthere, a cloudedness of understanding came over me. After that\r\ncloudedness of understanding passed away, intelligence came back to me.\r\nThen I thought that I have no dominion, or that everything is my\r\ndominion. Even this body is not mine, or the whole Earth is mine. At the\r\nsame time, O best of regenerate persons, I think that that is as much\r\nmine as it is of others.

What, indeed, is the notion through which thou\r\nhast no dominion, or everything is thy dominion?'\r\n\r\n\"Janaka said, 'All conditions here, in all affairs, have been understood\r\nby me to be terminable. Hence, I could not find that which should be\r\ncalled mine.[88] (Considering) whose is this, I thought of the Vedic text\r\nabout anybody's property, I could not, therefore, find, by my\r\nunderstanding, what should be (called) mine.[89] Depending upon this\r\nnotion, I got rid of idea of mineness. Hear now what that notion is\r\ndepending upon which I came to the conclusion that I have dominion\r\neverywhere. I do not desire for my own self those smells that are even in\r\nmy nose.

O holy one, O thou of excellent vows, it behoves\r\nthee to answer these questions of mine, O learned Rishi, correctly,\r\ntruly, and accurately. Who else is there in this world than thee that is\r\ncapable of answering these questions? Do thou answer them, O foremost of\r\nall persons conversant with duties. My curiosity is great. Thou art\r\ncelebrated in all the worlds as one well skilled in the duties relating\r\nto Emancipation. There is none else than thou that is competent to remove\r\nall kinds of doubts. Afraid of worldly life, we have become desirous of\r\nachieving Emancipation.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'Unto that disciple who had humbly sought his instruction\r\nand put the questions duly, who was devoted to his preceptor and\r\npossessed of tranquillity, and who always behaved in a manner that was\r\nagreeable (to his instructor), who lived so constantly by the side of his\r\ninstructor as to have almost become his shadow, who was self-restrained,\r\nand who had the life of a Yati and Brahmacharin, O son of Pritha, that\r\npreceptor possessed of intelligence and observant of vows, duly explained\r\nall the questions, O foremost one of Kuru's race, O chastiser of all\r\nfoes.'\r\n\r\n\"The preceptor said, 'All this was declared (In days of old) by Brahma\r\nhimself (the Grandsire of all the worlds). Applauded and practised by the\r\nforemost of Rishis, and depending on a knowledge of the Vedas, it\r\ninvolves a consideration of what constitutes the real entity. We regard\r\nknowledge to be the highest object, and renunciation as the best penance.\r\nHe who, with certainty, knows the true object of knowledge which is\r\nincapable of being modified by circumstances, viz., the soul abiding in\r\nall creatures, succeeds in going whithersoever he wishes and comes to be\r\nregarded as the highest. That learned man who beholds the residence of\r\nall things in one place and their severance as well, and who sees unity\r\nin diversity, succeeds in freeing himself from misery. He who does not\r\ncovet anything and does not cherish the idea of mineness with regard to\r\nanything, comes to be regarded, although residing in this world, as\r\nidentifiable with Brahman, He who is conversant with the truth about the\r\nqualities of Pradhana (or Nature), acquainted with the creation of all\r\nexistent objects, divested of the idea of mineness, and without pride,\r\nsucceeds, without doubt, in emancipating himself. Understanding properly\r\nthat great tree which has the unmanifest for its seed sprout, and the\r\nunderstanding for its trunk, and high consciousness of self for its\r\nbranches, and the senses for the cells whence its twigs issue, and the\r\n(five) great elements for its flower-buds, and the gross elements for its\r\nsmaller boughs, which is always endued with leaves, which always puts\r\nforth flowers, and upon which all existent objects depend, whose seed is\r\nBrahman, and which is eternal,--and cutting all topics with the sharp\r\nsword of knowledge, one attains to immortality and casts off birth and\r\ndeath. The conclusions with regard to the past, present, and future, etc,\r\nand religion, pleasure and wealth, which are all well known to conclaves\r\nof Siddhas, which appertain to remote cycles, and which are, indeed,\r\neternal, I shall declare to thee, O thou of great wisdom. These\r\nconstitute what is called Good. Men of wisdom, understanding them in this\r\nworld, attain to success. In days of old, the Rishis Vrihaspati and\r\nBharadwaja, and Gautama and Bhargava, and Vasishtha and Kasyapa, and\r\nViswamitra, and Atri, assembled together for the purpose of asking one\r\nanother. They thus assembled together after having travelled over all\r\npaths and after they had got tired with the acts each of them had done.\r\nThose regenerate persons, placing the sage son of Angiras at their head,\r\nproceeded to the region of the Grandsire. There they beheld Brahma\r\nperfectly cleansed of all sin. Bowing their heads unto that high-souled\r\none who was seated at his ease, the great Rishis, endued with humility,\r\nasked him this grave question regarding the highest good. How should a\r\ngood man act? How would one be released from sin? What paths are\r\nauspicious for us? What is truth, and what is sin? By what action are the\r\ntwo paths, northern and southern, obtained? What is destruction? What is\r\nEmancipation? What is birth and what is death of all existent objects? I\r\nshall tell thee, O disciple, what the Grandsire, thus addressed, said\r\nunto them, conformably to the scriptures. Do thou listen.'\r\n\r\n\"Brahma said, 'It is from Truth that all creatures, mobile and immobile,\r\nhave been born. They live by penance (of action). Understand this, O ye\r\nof excellent vows. In consequence of their own actions they live,\r\ntranscending: their own origin.[101] For Truth, when united with\r\nqualities, becomes always possessed of five indications. Brahman is\r\nTruth. Penance is truth. Prajapati is truth. It is from Truth that all\r\ncreatures have sprung. Truth is the universe of being. It is for this\r\nthat Brahmanas who are always devoted to Yoga, who have transcended wrath\r\nand sorrow, and who always regard Religion as the causeway (along which\r\nevery one must pass for avoiding the morass below), take refuge in Truth.\r\nI shall now speak of those Brahmanas who are restrained by one another\r\nand possessed of knowledge, of the orders, and of those who belong to the\r\nfour modes of life. The wise say that Religion or duty is one, (though)\r\nhaving four quarters. Ye regenerate ones, I shall speak to ye now of that\r\npath which is auspicious and productive of good. That path has constantly\r\nbeen trod over by men possessed of wisdom in order to achieve an identity\r\nwith Brahman. I shall speak now of that path which is the highest and\r\nwhich is exceedingly difficult of being understood. Do you understand, in\r\nall its details, ye highly blessed ones, what is the highest seat. The\r\nfirst step has been said to be the mode of life that appertains to\r\nBrahmacharins. The second step is domesticity. After this is the\r\nresidence in the woods. After that it should be known is the highest\r\nstep, viz., that relating to Adhyatma.[102] Light, ether (or space), sun,\r\nwind, Indra, and Prajapati,--one sees these as long as one does not\r\nattain to Adhyatma. I shall declare the means (by which that Adhyatma may\r\nbe attained). Do ye first understand them. The forest mode of life that\r\nis followed by ascetics residing in the woods and subsisting upon fruits\r\nand roots and air is laid down for the three regenerate classes. The\r\ndomestic mode of life is ordained for all the orders. They that are\r\npossessed of wisdom say that Religion or duty has Faith for its (chief)\r\nindication. Thus have I declared to you the paths leading to the deities.\r\nThey are adopted by those that are good and wise by their acts. Those\r\npaths are the causeways of piety. That person of rigid vows who adopts\r\nany one of these modes separately, always succeeds in time to understand\r\nthe production and destruction of all creatures. I shall now declare,\r\naccurately and with reasons, the elements which reside in parts in all\r\nobjects. The great soul, the unmanifest, egoism (consciousness of\r\nidentity), the ten and one organs (of knowledge and action), the five\r\ngreat elements, the specific characteristics of the five elements,--these\r\nconstitute the eternal creation. The number of elements has been said to\r\nbe four and twenty, and one (more). That person of wisdom who understands\r\nthe production and destruction of all these elements, that man among all\r\ncreatures, never meets with delusion. He who understands the elements\r\naccurately, all the qualities, all the deities, succeeds in cleansing\r\nhimself of all sin. Freed from all bonds, such a man succeeds in enjoying\r\nall regions of spotless purity.'\"[103]"

Encompassed by eleven including Mind\r\nwhich distinguishes (objects), and having Understanding for the ruler,\r\nthis is an aggregate of eleven.[104] The three ducts that are in it\r\nsupport it constantly. These are the three Nadis. They run continually,\r\nand have the three qualities for their essence: Darkness, Passion, and\r\nGoodness. These are called the (three) qualities. These are coupled with\r\none another. They exist, depending on one another. They take refuge in\r\none another, and follow one another. They are also joined with one\r\nanother. The five (principal) elements are characterised by (these) three\r\nqualities. Goodness is the match of Darkness. Of Goodness the match is\r\nPassion. Goodness is also the match of Passion, and of Goodness the match\r\nis Darkness. There where Darkness is restrained, Passion is seen to flow.\r\nThere where Passion is restrained, Goodness is seen to flow. Darkness\r\nshould be known to have the night (or obscurity) for its essence. It has\r\nthree characteristics, and is (otherwise) called Delusion. It has\r\nunrighteousness (or sin) also for its indication, and it is always\r\npresent in all sinful acts. This is the nature of Darkness and it appears\r\nalso as confined with others. Passion is said to have activity for its\r\nessence. It is the cause of successive acts. When it prevails, its\r\nindication, among all beings, is production. Splendour, lightness, and\r\nfaith,--these are the form, that is light, of Goodness among all\r\ncreatures, as regarded by all good men. The true nature of their\r\ncharacteristics will now be declared by me, with reasons. These shall be\r\nstated in aggregation and separation. Do ye understand them. Complete\r\ndelusion, ignorance; illiberality, indecision in respect of action,\r\nsleep, haughtiness, fear, cupidity, grief, censure of good acts, loss of\r\nmemory,--unripeness of judgment, absence of faith, violation of all rules\r\nof conduct, want of discrimination, blindness, vileness of behaviour,\r\nboastful assertions of performance when there has been no performance,\r\npresumption of knowledge in ignorance, unfriendliness (or hostility),\r\nevilness of disposition, absence of faith, stupid reasoning, crookedness,\r\nincapacity for association, sinful action, senselessness, stolidity,\r\nlassitude, absence of self-control, degradation,--all these qualities are\r\nknown as belonging to Darkness. Whatever other states of mind, connected\r\nwith delusion, exist in the world, all appertain to Darkness. Frequent\r\nill-speaking of other people, censuring the deities and the Brahmanas,\r\nilliberality, vanity, delusion, wrath, unforgiveness, hostility towards\r\nall creatures, are regarded as the characteristics of Darkness. Whatever\r\nundertakings exist that are unmeritorious (in consequence of their being\r\nvain or useless), what gifts there are that are unmeritorious (in\r\nconsequence of the unworthiness of the donees, the unreasonableness of\r\nthe time, the impropriety of the object, etc.), vain eating,--these also\r\nappertain to Darkness. Indulgence in calumny, unforgiveness, animosity,\r\nvanity, and absence of faith are also said to be characteristics of\r\nDarkness. Whatever men there are in this world who are characterised by\r\nthese and other faults of a similar kind, and who break through the\r\nrestraints (provided by the scriptures), are all regarded as belonging to\r\nthe quality of Darkness. I shall now declare the wombs where these men,\r\nwho are always of sinful deeds, have to take their birth. Ordained to go\r\nto hell, they sink in the order of being. Indeed, they sink into the hell\r\nof (birth in) the brute creation. They become immobile entities, or\r\nanimals, or beasts of burden; or carnivorous creatures, or snakes, or\r\nworms, insects, and birds; or creatures, of the oviparous order, or\r\nquadrupeds of diverse species; or lunatics, or deaf or dumb human beings,\r\nor men that are afflicted by dreadful maladies and regarded as unclean.\r\nThese men of evil conduct, always exhibiting the indications of their\r\nacts, sink in Darkness. Their course (of migrations) is always downwards.\r\nAppertaining to the quality of Darkness, they sink in Darkness. I shall,\r\nafter this, declare what the means are of their improvement and ascent;\r\nindeed, by what means they succeed in attaining to the regions that exist\r\nfor men of pious deeds. Those men who take birth in orders other than\r\nhumanity, by growing up in view of the religious ceremonies of Brahmanas\r\ndevoted to the duties of their own order and desirous of doing good to\r\nall creatures, succeed, through the aid of such purificatory rites, in\r\nascending upwards. Indeed, struggling (to improve themselves), they at\r\nlast attain to the same regions with these pious Brahmanas. Verily, they\r\ngo to Heaven. Even this is the Vedic audition.[105] Born in orders other\r\nthan humanity and growing old in their respective acts, even thus they\r\nbecome human beings that are, of course, ordained to return. Coming to\r\nsinful births and becoming Chandalas or human beings that are deaf or\r\nthat lisp indistinctly, they attain to higher and higher castes, one\r\nafter another in proper turn, transcending the Sudra order, and other\r\n(consequences of) qualities that appertain to Darkness and that abide in\r\nit in course of migrations in this world.[106] Attachment to objects of\r\ndesire is regarded as great delusion. Here Rishis and Munis and deities\r\nbecome deluded, desirous of pleasure. Darkness, delusion, the great\r\ndelusion, the great obscurity called wrath, and death, that blinding\r\nobscurity, (these are the five great afflictions). As regards wrath, that\r\nis the great obscurity (and not aversion or hatred as is sometimes\r\nincluded in the list). With respect then to its colour (nature), its\r\ncharacteristics, and its source, I have, ye learned Brahmanas, declared\r\nto you, accurately and in due order, everything about (the quality of)\r\nDarkness. Who is there that truly understands it? Who is there that truly\r\nsees it? That, indeed, is the characteristic of Darkness, viz., the\r\nbeholding of reality in what is not real. The qualities of Darkness have\r\nbeen declared to you in various ways. Duly has Darkness, in its higher\r\nand lower forms, been described to you. That man who always bears in mind\r\nthe qualities mentioned here, will surely succeed in becoming freed from\r\nall characteristics that appertain to Darkness.'\""

Passion and Goodness and Darkness\r\nare seen existing in a state of union. They are attached to one another.\r\nThey depend on one another. They have one another for their refuge. They\r\nlikewise follow one another. As long as goodness exists, so long does\r\nPassion exist. There is no doubt in this. As long as Darkness and\r\nGoodness exist, so long does Passion exist. They make their journey\r\ntogether, in union, and moving collectively. They, verily, move in body,\r\nwhen they act with cause or without cause. Of all these which act with\r\none another, however, much they may differ in their development, the\r\nmanner in which their increase and diminution take place will now be\r\ndeclared. There where Darkness exists in an increased measure, in the\r\nlower creatures (for example), Passion exists in a smaller measure and\r\nGoodness in a measure that is still less. There where Passion exists in a\r\ncopious measure, in creatures of middle course, Darkness exists in a\r\nsmaller measure and Goodness in a measure that is still less. There where\r\nGoodness exists in a copious measure, in creatures of upward courses,\r\nDarkness should be known to exist in a small measure and Passion in a\r\nmeasure that is still less. Goodness is the spring that causes the\r\nmodifications of the senses. It is the great enlightener. No duty has\r\nbeen laid down that is higher than Goodness. They who abide in Goodness\r\nproceed upwards. They who abide in Passion remain in the middle. They who\r\nabide in Darkness, being characterised by qualities that are low, sink\r\ndownwards. Darkness occurs in the Sudra; Passion in the Kshatriya; and\r\nGoodness, which is the highest, in the Brahmana. The three qualities\r\nexist even thus in the three orders. Even from a distance, the three\r\nqualities of darkness and Goodness and Passion, are seen to exist in a\r\nstate of union and more collectively. They are never seen in a state of\r\nseparation.[110] Beholding the sun rising, men of evil deeds become\r\ninspired with fear. Travellers on their way become afflicted with heat,\r\nand suffer distress. The Sun is Goodness developed, men of evil deeds\r\nrepresent Darkness; the heat which travellers on their way feel is said\r\nto be a quality of Passion. The sun representing light is Goodness; the\r\nheat is the quality of Passion; the shading (or eclipse) of the sun on\r\nParvana days should be known to represent Darkness. Even thus, the three\r\nqualities exist in all luminous bodies. They act by turns in diverse\r\nplaces in diverse ways. Among immobile objects, the quality of Darkness\r\nexists in a very large measure. The qualities appertaining to Passion are\r\nthose properties of theirs which undergo constant changes. Their\r\noleaginous attributes appertain to Goodness.[111] The Day should be\r\nunderstood as threefold. The Night has been ordained to be threefold. So\r\nalso are fortnight, months, years, seasons, and conjunctions.[112] The\r\ngifts that are wide are threefold. Threefold is sacrifice that flows.\r\nThreefold are the worlds; threefold the deities; threefold is knowledge;\r\nand threefold the path or end. The past, the Present. and the Future;\r\nReligion, Wealth. and Pleasure. Prana, Apana, and Udana; these also are\r\nfraught with the three qualities.

Caused by the production of cupidity, not different from one\r\nanother, without reality, connected with flesh and blood, and depending\r\nupon one another, existing outside the soul, these are all helpless and\r\npowerless. Prana and Apana, and Udana and Samana and Vyana,--these five\r\nwinds are always closely attached to the soul. Together with speech,\r\nmind, and understanding, they constitute the universe of eight\r\ningredients. He whose skin, nose, ear, eyes, tongue, and speech are\r\nrestrained, whose mind is pure, and whose understanding deviates not\r\n(from the right path), and whose mind is never burnt by those eight\r\nfires, succeeds in attaining to that auspicious Brahman to which nothing\r\nsuperior exists. Those which have been called the eleven organs and which\r\nhave sprung from Egoism, I shall now, ye regenerate ones, mention\r\nparticularly. They are the ear, the skin, the two eyes, the tongue, the\r\nnose numbering the fifth, the two feet, the lower duct, the organ of\r\ngeneration, the two hands, and speech forming the tenth. These constitute\r\nthe group of organs, with mind numbering as the eleventh. One should\r\nfirst subdue this group. Then will Brahman shine forth (in him). Five\r\namongst these are called organs of knowledge, and five, organs of action.\r\nThe five beginning with the ear are truly said to be connected with\r\nknowledge. The rest, however, that are connected with action, are without\r\ndistinction. The mind should be regarded as belonging to both. The\r\nunderstanding is the twelfth in the top. Thus have been enumerated the\r\neleven organs in due order. Learned men, having understood these, think\r\nthey have accomplished everything. I shall, after this, enumerate all the\r\nvarious organs. Space (or Ether) is the first entity. As connected with\r\nthe soul, it is called the ear. As connected with objects, that is sound.\r\nThe presiding deity (of this) is the quarters. The Wind is the second\r\nentity. As connected with the soul, it is known as the skin. As connected\r\nwith objects, it is known as objects of touch; and the presiding deity\r\nthere is touch. The third is said to be Light. As connected with the\r\nsoul, it is known as the eye. As connected with objects, it is colour;\r\nand the sun is its deity. The fourth (entity) should be known as Water.\r\nAs connected with the soul, it is said to be the tongue. As connected\r\nwith objects, it is taste, and the presiding deity there is Soma. The\r\nfifth entity is Earth. As connected with the soul, it is said to be the\r\nnose. As connected with objects, it is scent; and the presiding deity\r\nthere is the wind. Thus has the manner been declared of how the five\r\nentities are divided into sets of three. After this I shall declare\r\neverything about the diverse (other) organs. Brahmanas conversant with\r\nthe truth say that the two feet are mentioned as connected with the soul.\r\nAs connected with objects, it is motion; and Vishnu is there the\r\npresiding deity. The Apana wind, whose motion is downward, as connected\r\nwith the soul, is called the lower duct. As connected with objects, it is\r\nthe excreta that is ejected; and the presiding deity there is Mitra. As\r\nconnected with the soul, the organ of generation is mentioned, the\r\nproducer of all beings. As connected with objects, it is the vital seed;\r\nand the presiding deity is Prajapati. The two hands are mentioned as\r\nconnected with the soul by persons conversant with the relations of the\r\nsoul. As connected with objects, it is actions; and the presiding deity\r\nthere is Indra. Next, connected with the soul is speech which relates to\r\nall the gods. As connected with objects, it is what is spoken. The\r\npresiding deity there is Agni. As connected with the soul, the mind is\r\nmentioned, which moves within the soul of the five elements.[113] As\r\nconnected with objects, it is the mental operation; and the presiding\r\ndeity is Chandramas (moon). As connected with the soul is Egoism, which\r\nis the cause of the whole course of worldly life. As connected with\r\nobjects, it is consciousness of self; and the presiding deity there is\r\nRudra. As connected with the soul is the understanding, which impels the\r\nsix senses. As connected with objects, it is that which is to be\r\nunderstood, and the presiding deity there is Brahma. Three are the seats\r\nof all existent objects. A fourth is not possible. These are land, water,\r\nand ether. The mode of birth is fourfold. Some are born of eggs; some are\r\nborn of germs which spring upwards, penetrating through the earth; some\r\nare born of filth; and some are born of fleshy balls in wombs. Thus is\r\nthe mode of birth seen to be of four kinds, of all living creatures. Now,\r\nthere are other inferior beings and likewise those that range the sky.\r\nThese should be known to be born of eggs as also those which crawl on\r\ntheir breasts. Insects are said to be born of filth, as also other\r\ncreatures of a like description. This is said to be the second mode of\r\nbirth and is inferior. Those living creatures that take birth after the\r\nlapse of some time, bursting through the earth, are said to be germ-born\r\nbeings, ye foremost of regenerate persons. Creatures of two feet or of\r\nmany feet and those which move crookedly, are the beings born of wombs.\r\nAmong them are some that are deformed, ye best of men. The eternal womb\r\nof Brahma should be known to be of two kinds, viz., penance and\r\nmeritorious acts. Such is the doctrine of the learned.[114] Action should\r\nbe understood to be of various kinds, such as sacrifice, gifts made at\r\nsacrifices, and the meritorious duty of study for every one that is born;\r\nsuch is the teaching of the ancients. He who duly understands this, comes\r\nto be regarded as possessed of Yoga, ye chief of regenerate persons. Know\r\nalso that such a man becomes freed too from all his sins. I have thus\r\ndeclared to you duly the doctrine of Adhyatma.[115] Ye Rishis conversant\r\nwith all duties, a knowledge of this is acquired by those who are\r\nregarded as persons of knowledge. Uniting all these together, viz., the\r\nsenses, the objects of the senses, and the five great entities, one\r\nshould hold them in the mind.[116] When everything is attenuated (by\r\nabsorption) in the mind, one no longer esteems the pleasures of life.\r\nLearned men, whose understandings are furnished with knowledge, regard\r\nthat as true happiness.[117] I shall after this, tell thee of\r\nrenunciation with respect to all entities by means, gentle and hard,\r\nwhich produces attachment to subtle topics and which is fraught with\r\nauspiciousness. That conduct which consists in treating the qualities is\r\nnot qualities, which is free from attachment, which is living alone,\r\nwhich does not recognise distinctions, and which is full of Brahman, is\r\nthe source of all happiness.[118] The learned man who absorbs all desires\r\ninto himself from all sides like the tortoise withdrawing all its limbs,\r\nwho is devoid of passion, and who is released from everything, becomes\r\nalways happy. Restraining all desires within the soul, destroying his\r\nthirst, concentrated in meditation, and becoming the friend of good heart\r\ntowards all creatures, he succeeds in becoming fit for assimilation with\r\nBrahman. Through repression of all the senses which always hanker after\r\ntheir objects, and abandonment of inhabited places, the Adhyatma fire\r\nblazes forth in the man of contemplation. As a fire, fed with fuel,\r\nbecomes bright in consequence of the blazing flames it puts forth, even\r\nso, in consequence of the repression of the senses, the great soul puts\r\nforth its effulgence. When one with a tranquil soul beholds all entities\r\nin one's own heart, then, lighted by one's own effulgence, one attains to\r\nthat which is subtler than the subtle and which is unrivalled in\r\nexcellence. It is settled that the body has fire for colour, water for\r\nblood and other liquids, wind for sense of touch, earth for the hideous\r\nholder of mind (viz., flesh and bones, etc.), space (or ether) for sound;\r\nthat it is pervaded by disease and sorrow; that it is overwhelmed by five\r\ncurrents; that it is made up of the five elements; that it has nine doors\r\nand two deities;[119] that it is full of passion; that it is unfit to be\r\nseen (owing to its unholy character); that it is made up of three\r\nqualities; that it has three constituent elements, (viz., wind, bile and\r\nphelgm); that it is delighted with attachments of every kind, that it is\r\nfull of delusions.[120] It is difficult of being moved in this mortal\r\nworld, and it rests on the understanding as its support. That body is, in\r\nthis world, the wheel of Time that is continually revolving.[121] That\r\n(body), indeed, is a terrible and unfathomable ocean and is called\r\ndelusion. It is this body which stretches forth, contracts, and awakens\r\nthe (whole) universe with the (very) immortals.[122] By restraining the\r\nsenses, one casts off lust, wrath, fear, cupidity, enmity, and falsehood,\r\nwhich are eternal and, therefore, exceedingly difficult to cast off.[123]\r\nHe who has subjugated these in this world, viz., the three qualities and\r\nthe five constituent elements of the body, has the Highest for his seat\r\nin Heaven. By him is Infinity attained. Crossing the river, that has the\r\nfive senses for its steep banks, the mental inclinations for its mighty\r\nwaters, and delusion for its lake, one should subjugate both lust and\r\nwrath. Such a man freed from all faults, then beholds the Highest,\r\nconcentrating the mind within the mind and seeing self in self.\r\nUnderstanding all things, he sees his self, with self, in all creatures,\r\nsometimes as one and sometimes as diverse, changing form from time to\r\ntime.[124] Without doubt he can perceive numerous bodies like a hundred\r\nlights from one light. Verily he is Vishnu, and Mitra, and Varuna, and\r\nAgni, and Prajapati. He is the Creator and the ordainer: he is the Lord\r\npossessed of puissance, with faces turned in all directions. In him, the\r\nheart of all creatures, the great soul, becomes resplendent. Him all\r\nconclaves of learned Brahmanas, deities and Asuras, and Yakshas, and\r\nPisachas, the Pitris, and birds, and bands of Rakshasas, and bands of\r\nghostly beings, and all the great Rishis, praise.'\""

Among vehicles, the elephant (is so); and among denizens\r\nof the forest the lion; among all (sacrificial) animals, the sheep; among\r\nall those that live in holes, is the snake; among cattle, the bovine\r\nbull; among females, the mule.[125] There is no doubt in this that in\r\nthis world, the Nyagrodha, the Jamvu, the Pippala, the Salmali, and\r\nSinsapa, the Meshasringa, and the Kichaka, are the foremost ones among\r\ntrees.[126] Himavat, Patipatra, Sahya, Vindhya, Trikutavat, Sweta, Nila,\r\nBhasa, Koshthavat, Guruskandha, Mahendra and Malayavat,--these are the\r\nforemost of mountains. Likewise the Maruts are the foremost of the Ganas.\r\nSurya is the lord of all the planets, and Chandramas of all the\r\nconstellations. Yama is the lord of the Pitris; Ocean is the lord of all\r\nrivers. Varuna is the king of the waters. Indra is said to be the king of\r\nthe Maruts. Arka is the king of all hot bodies, and Indra of all luminous\r\nbodies. Agni is the eternal lord of the elements, and Vrihaspati of the\r\nBrahmanas. Soma is the lord of (deciduous) herbs, and Vishnu is the\r\nforemost of all that are endued with might. Tashtri is the king of\r\nRudras, and Siva of all creatures. Sacrifice is the foremost of all\r\ninitiatory rites, and Maghavat of the deities. The North is the lord of\r\nall the points of the compass; Soma of great energy is the lord of all\r\nlearned Brahmanas. Kuvera is the lord of all precious gems, and Purandara\r\nof all the deities. Such is the highest creation among all entities.\r\nPrajapati is the lord of all creatures. Of all entities whatever, I, who\r\nam full of Brahman, am the foremost. There is no entity that is higher\r\nthan myself or Vishnu. The great Vishnu, who is full of Brahman, is the\r\nking of kings over all. Know him to be the ruler, the creator, the\r\nuncreated Hari. He is the ruler of men and Kinnaras and Yakshas and\r\nGandharvas, and Snakes and Rakshasas, and deities and Danavas and Nagas.\r\nAmong those that are followed by persons full of desire is the great\r\ngoddess Maheswari of beautiful eyes. She is otherwise called by the name\r\nof Parvati. Know that the goddess Uma is the foremost and the most\r\nauspicious of women. Among women that are a source of pleasure, the\r\nforemost are the Apsaras who are possessed of great splendour.[127] Kings\r\nare desirous of acquiring piety, and Brahmanas are causeways of piety.\r\nTherefore, the king should always strive to protect the twice-born ones.\r\nThose kings in whose dominions good men languish are regarded as bereft\r\nof the virtues of their order. Hereafter they have to go into wrong\r\npaths. Those kings in whose dominions good men are protected, rejoice in\r\nthis world and enjoy happiness hereafter. Verily, those high-souled ones\r\nattain to the highest seat. Understand this, ye foremost of regenerate\r\nones. I shall after this state the everlasting indications of duties.\r\nAbstention from injury is the highest duty. Injury is an indication of\r\nunrighteousness. Splendour is the indication of the deities. Men have\r\nacts for their indications. Ether (or space) has sound for its\r\ncharacteristic. Wind has touch for its characteristic. The characteristic\r\nof lighted bodies is colour, and water has taste for its characteristic.\r\nEarth, which holds all entities, has smell for its characteristic. Speech\r\nhas words for its characteristic, refined into vowels and consonants.\r\nMind has thought for its characteristic. Thought has, again, been said to\r\nbe the characteristic of the understanding. The things thought of by the\r\nmind are ascertained with accuracy by the understanding. There is no\r\ndoubt in this, viz., that the understanding, by perseverance, perceives\r\nall things. The characteristic of mind is meditation. The characteristic\r\nof the good man is to live unperceived.[128] Devotion has acts for its\r\ncharacteristic. Knowledge is the characteristic of renunciation.\r\nTherefore keeping knowledge, before his view, the man of understanding\r\nshould practise renunciation. The man who has betaken himself to\r\nrenunciation and who is possessed of knowledge, who transcends all pairs\r\nof opposites, as also darkness, death, and decrepitude, attains to the\r\nhighest goal. I have thus declared to you duty what the indications are\r\nof duty. I shall, after this, tell you of the seizure (comprehension) of\r\nqualities. Smell, which appertains to earth, is seized by the nose. The\r\nwind, that dwells in the nose is likewise appointed (as an agent) in the\r\nperception of smell. Taste is the essence of water. That is seized by the\r\ntongue. Soma, who resides in the tongue, is appointed likewise in the\r\nperception of taste. The quality of a lighted body is colour. That is\r\nseized by the eye. Aditya who always resides in the eye has been\r\nappointed in the perception of colour. Touch always appertains to the\r\nwind (as its quality). That is perceived by the skin. The wind that\r\nalways resides in the skin has been appointed in apprehending touch. The\r\nquality of ether is sound. That is seized by the ear. All the quarters,\r\nwhich reside in the ear, have been appointed in apprehending sound. The\r\nquality of the mind is thought. That is seized by the understanding. The\r\nupholder of consciousness, residing in the heart, has been appointed in\r\napprehending the mind. The understanding is apprehended in the form of\r\ndetermination or certitude, and Mahat in the form of knowledge. The\r\nunperceived (Prakriti) has been, it is evident, appointed for the seizure\r\nof all things after certitude. There is no doubt in this.[129] The\r\nKshetrajna which is eternal and is destitute of qualities as regards its\r\nessence, is incapable of being seized by symbols. Hence, the\r\ncharacteristic of the Kshetrajna, which is without symbols, is purely\r\nknowledge. The unmanifest resides in the symbol called Kshetra, and is\r\nthat in which the qualities are produced and absorbed. I always see,\r\nknow, and hear it (though) it is hidden. Purusha knows it: therefore is\r\nhe called Kshetrajna. The Kshetrajna perceives also the operations of the\r\nqualities and absence of their operations. The qualities, which are\r\ncreated repeatedly, do not know themselves, being unintelligent, as\r\nentities to be created and endued with a beginning, middle, and end. No\r\none else attains, only the Kshetrajna attains, to that which is the\r\nhighest and great and which transcend the qualities and those entities\r\nwhich are born of the qualities. Hence one who understands duties,\r\ncasting off qualities and the understanding, and having his sins\r\ndestroyed, and transcending the qualities, enters the Kshetrajna. One\r\nthat is free from all pairs of opposites, that never bends his head to\r\nany one, that is divested of Swaha, that is immovable, and homeless, is\r\nthe Kshetrajna. He is the Supreme Lord.\"'"

It has been\r\nsaid that the Day was first, Then arose Night. The Months are said to\r\nhave the lighted fortnights first. The constellations have Sravana for\r\ntheir first; the Seasons have that of dews (viz., Winter) for their\r\nfirst. Earth is the source of all smells; and Water of all tastes. The\r\nsolar light is the source of all colours: the Wind of all sensations of\r\ntouch. Likewise, of sound the source is space (or Ether). These are the\r\nqualities of elements. I shall, after this, declare that which is the\r\nfirst and the highest of all entities. The sun is the first of all\r\nlighted bodies. Fire is said to be the first of all the elements. Savitri\r\nis the first of all branches of learning. Prajapati is the first of all\r\nthe deities. The syllable Om is the first of all the Vedas, and the\r\nlife-wind Prana is the first of all winds. All that is called Savitri\r\nwhich is prescribed in this world.[130] The Gayatri is the first of all\r\nmetres; of all (sacrificial) animals the first is the goat. Kine are the\r\nfirst of all quadrupeds. The twiceborn ones are the first of all human\r\nbeings. The hawk is the first of all birds. Of sacrifices the first is\r\nthe pouring of clarified butter on the fire. Of all reptiles the first, O\r\nforemost of regenerate ones, is the snake. The Krita is the first of all\r\nthe Yugas; there is no doubt in this. Gold is the first of all precious\r\nthings. Barley is the first of all plants. Food is the first of all\r\nthings to be eaten or swallowed. Of all liquid substances to be drunk,\r\nwater is the foremost. Of all immobile entities without distinction,\r\nPlaksha is said to be the first, that ever holy field of Brahman. Of all\r\nthe Prajapatis I am the first. There is no doubt in this. Of\r\ninconceivable soul, the self-existent Vishnu is said to be my\r\nsuperior.[131] Of all the mountains the great Meru is said to be the\r\nfirst-born. Of all the cardinal and subsidiary points of the horizon, the\r\neastern is said to be the foremost and first-born. Ganga of three courses\r\nis said to be the firstborn of all rivers. Likewise, of all wells and\r\nreservoirs of waters, the ocean is said to be the first-born. Iswara is\r\nthe supreme Lord of all the deities and Danavas and ghostly beings and\r\nPisachas, and snakes and Makshasas and human beings and Kinnaras and\r\nYakshas. The great Vishnu, who is full of Brahma, than whom there is no\r\nhigher being in the three worlds, is the first of all the universe. Of\r\nall the modes of life, that of the householder is the first. Of this\r\nthere is no doubt. The Unmanifest is the source of all the worlds as,\r\nindeed, that is the end of every thing. Days end with the sun's setting\r\nand Nights with the sun's rising. The end of pleasure is always sorrow,\r\nand the end of sorrow is always pleasure. All accumulations have\r\nexhaustion for their end, and all ascent have falls for their end. All\r\nassociations have dissociations for their end, and life has death for its\r\nend. All action ends in destruction, and all that is born is certain to\r\nmeet with death. Every mobile and immobile thing in this world is\r\ntransient. Sacrifice, gift, penances, study, vows, observances,--all\r\nthese have destruction for their end. Of Knowledge, there is no end.\r\nHence, one that is possessed of a tranquil soul, that has subjugated his\r\nsenses, that is freed from the sense of meum, that is devoid of egoism,\r\nis released from all sins by pure knowledge.'\""

It has the understanding for\r\nits strength; the mind for the pole (on which it rests); the group of\r\nsenses for its bonds, the (five) great elements for its nave, and home\r\nfor its circumference.[132] It is overwhelmed by decrepitude and grief,\r\nand it has diseases and calamities for its progeny. That wheel relates in\r\ntime and place. It has toil and exercise for its noise. Day and Night are\r\nthe rotations of that wheel. It is encircled by heat and cold. Pleasure\r\nand pain fire its joints, and hunger and thirst are the nails fixed into\r\nit. Sun-shine and shade are the ruts (it causes). It is capable of being\r\nagitated during even such a short space of time as is taken up by the\r\nopening and the closing of the eyelid. It is enveloped in the terrible\r\nwaters of delusion. It is ever revolving and void of consciousness. It is\r\nmeasured by months and half-months. It is not uniform (being\r\never-changing), and moves through all the worlds. Penances and vows are\r\nits mud. Passion's force is its mover. It is illuminated by the great\r\negoism, and is sustained by the qualities. Vexations (caused by the\r\nnon-acquisition of what is desired) are the fastenings that bind it\r\naround. It revolves in the midst of grief and destruction. It is endued\r\nwith actions and the instruments of action. It is large and is extended\r\nby attachments. It is rendered unsteady by cupidity and desire. It is\r\nproduced by variegated Ignorance. It is attended upon by fear and\r\ndelusion, and is the cause of the delusion of all beings. It moves\r\ntowards joy and pleasure, and has desire and wrath for its possession. It\r\nis made up of entities beginning with Mahat and ending with the gross\r\nelements. It is characterised by production and destruction going on\r\nceaselessly. Its speed is like that of the mind, and it has the mind for\r\nits boundary.[133] This wheel of life that is associated with pairs of\r\nopposites and devoid of consciousness, the universe with the very\r\nimmortals should cast away, abridge, and check. That man who always\r\nunderstands accurately the motion and stoppage of this wheel of life, is\r\nnever seen to be deluded, among all creatures. Freed from all\r\nimpressions, divested of all pairs of opposites, released from all sins,\r\nhe attains to the highest goal. The householder, the Brahmacharin, the\r\nforest recluse and the mendicant,--these four modes of life have all been\r\nsaid to have the householder's mode for their foundation. Whatever system\r\nof rules is prescribed in this world, their observance is beneficial.\r\nSuch observance has always been highly spoken of. He who has been first\r\ncleansed by ceremonies, who has duly observed vows, who belongs in\r\nrespect of birth to a race possessed of high qualifications, and who\r\nunderstands the Vedas, should return (from his preceptor's house).[134]\r\nAlways devoted to his wedded spouse, conducting himself after the manner\r\nof the good, with his senses under subjugation, and full of faith, one\r\nshould in this world perform the five sacrifices. He who eats what\r\nremains after feeding deities and guests, who is devoted to the\r\nobservance of Vedic rites, who duly performs according to his means\r\nsacrifices and gifts, who is not unduly active with his hands and feet,\r\nwho is not unduly active with his eye, who is devoted to penances, who is\r\nnot unduly active with his speech and limits, comes under the category of\r\nSishta or the good. One should always bear the sacred thread, wear white\r\n(clean) clothes, observe pure vows, and should always associate with good\r\nmen, making gifts and practising self-restraint. One should subjugate\r\none's lust and stomach, practise universal compassion, and be\r\ncharacterised by behaviour that befits the good. One should bear a\r\nbamboo-stick, and a water-pot filled with water. Having studied, one\r\nshould teach; likewise should also make sacrifices himself and officiate\r\nat the sacrifices of others. One should also make gifts made to oneself.\r\nVerily, one's conduct, should be characterised by these six acts. Know\r\nthat three of these acts should constitute the livelihood of the\r\nBrahmanas, viz., teaching (pupils), officiating at the sacrifices of\r\nothers, and the acceptance of gifts from a person that is pure. As to the\r\nother duties that remain, numbering three, viz., making of gifts, study,\r\nand sacrifice, these are accompanied by merit.[135] Observant of\r\npenances, self-restrained, practising universal compassion and\r\nforgiveness, and looking upon all creatures with an equal eye, the man\r\nthat is conversant with duties should never be heedless with regard to\r\nthose three acts. The learned Brahmana of pure heart, who observes the\r\ndomestic mode of life and practises rigid vows, thus devoted and thus\r\ndischarging all duties to the best of his power, succeeds in conquering\r\nHeaven.'\""

Honouring guests when they\r\ncome, he should give them shelter, and himself subsist upon fruits and\r\nleaves and common roots, and Syamaka. He should, without being slothful\r\nsubsist on such water as he gets, and air, and all forest products. He\r\nshould live upon these, in due order, according to the regulations of his\r\ninitiation.[138] He should honour the guest that comes to him with alms\r\nof fruits and roots.

He\r\nshould eat little, and depend always on the deities. Self-restrained,\r\npractising universal compassion, and possessed of forgiveness, he should\r\nwear both beard and hair (without submitting to the operations of the\r\nbarber). Performing sacrifices and devoting himself to the study of the\r\nscriptures, he should be steady in the observance of the duty of truth.\r\nWith body always in a state of purity, endued with cleverness, ever\r\ndwelling in the forest, with concentrated mind, and senses in subjection,\r\na forest-recluse, thus devoting himself, would conquer Heaven. A\r\nhouseholder, or Brahmacharin, or forest-recluse, who would wish to\r\nachieve Emancipation, should have recourse to that which has been called\r\nthe best course of conduct. Having granted unto all creatures the pledge\r\nof utter abstention from harm, he should thoroughly renounce all action.\r\nHe should contribute to the happiness of all creatures, practise\r\nuniversal friendliness, subjugate all his senses, and be an ascetic.\r\nSubsisting upon food obtained without asking and without trouble, and\r\nthat has come to him spontaneously, he should make a fire. He should make\r\nhis round of mendicancy in a place whence smoke has ceased to curl up and\r\nwhere all the inhabitants have already eaten.[139] The person who is\r\nconversant with the conduct that leads to Emancipation should seek for\r\nalms after the vessels (used in cooking) have been washed. He should\r\nnever rejoice when he obtains anything, and never be depressed if he\r\nobtains nothing. Seeking just what is needed for supporting life, he\r\nshould, with concentrated mind, go about his round of mendicancy, waiting\r\nfor the proper time. He should not wish for earnings in common with\r\nothers, nor eat when honoured. The man who leads the life of mendicancy\r\nshould conceal himself for avoiding gifts with honour. While eating, he\r\nshould not eat such food as forms the remains of another's dish, nor such\r\nas is bitter, or astringent, or pungent. He should not also eat such\r\nkinds of food as have a sweet taste. He should eat only so much as is\r\nneeded to keep him alive. The person conversant with Emancipation should\r\nobtain his subsistence without obstructing any creature. In his rounds of\r\nmendicancy he should never follow another (bent on the same purpose). He\r\nshould never parade his piety; he should move about in a secluded place,\r\nfreed from passion. Either an empty house, or a forest, or the foot of\r\nsome tree, or a river, or a mountain-cave, he should have recourse to for\r\nshelter. In summer he should pass only one night in an inhabited place;\r\nin the season of rains he may live in one place. He should move about the\r\nworld like a worm, his path pointed out by the Sun. From compassion for\r\ncreatures, he should walk on the Earth with his eyes directed towards it.\r\nHe should never make any accumulations and should avoid residence with\r\nfriends. The man conversant with Emancipation should every day do all his\r\nacts with pure water. Such a man should always perform his ablutions with\r\nwater that has been fetched up (from the river or the tank).[140]\r\nAbstention from harm, Brahmacharyya, truth, simplicity, freedom from\r\nwrath, freedom from decrying others, self-restraint, and habitual freedom\r\nfrom backbiting: these eight vows, with senses restrained, he should\r\nsteadily pursue. He should always practise a sinless mode of conduct,\r\nthat is not deceptive and not crooked. Freed from attachment, he should\r\nalways make one who comes as a guest eat (at least) a morsel of food. He\r\nshould eat just enough for livelihood, for the support of life. He should\r\neat only such food as has been obtained by righteous means, and should\r\nnot pursue the dictates of desire. He should never accept any other thing\r\nthan food and clothing only. He should, again, accept only as much as he\r\ncan eat and nothing more. He should not be induced to accept gifts from\r\nothers, nor should he make gifts to others. Owing to the helplessness of\r\ncreatures, the man of wisdom should always share with others. He should\r\nnot appropriate what belongs to others, nor should he take anything\r\nwithout being asked. He should not, having enjoyed anything become so\r\nattached to it as to desire to have it once more. One should take only\r\nearth and water and pebbles and leaves and flowers and fruits, that are\r\nnot owned by any body, as they come, when one desires to do any act. One\r\nshould not live by the occupation of an artisan, nor should one covet\r\ngold. One should not hate, nor teach (one that does not seek to be\r\ntaught); nor should one have any belongings. One should eat only what is\r\nconsecrated by faith. One should abstain from controversies. One should\r\nfollow that course of conduct which has been said to be nectarine. One\r\nshould never be attached to anything, and should never enter into\r\nrelations of intimacy with any creature. One should not perform, nor\r\ncause to perform, any such action as involves expectation of fruit or\r\ndestruction of life or the hoarding of wealth or articles. Rejecting all\r\nobjects, content with a very little, one should wander about (homeless)\r\npursuing an equal behaviour towards all creatures mobile and immobile.\r\nOne should never annoy another being; not should one be annoyed with\r\nanother. He who is trusted by all creatures is regarded as the foremost\r\nof those persons that understand Emancipation. One should not think of\r\nthe past, nor feel anxious about the future. One should disregard the\r\npresent, biding time, with concentrated mind.[141] One should never\r\ndefile anything by eye, mind, or speech. Nor should one do anything that\r\nis wrong, openly or in secret. Withdrawing one's senses like the tortoise\r\nwithdrawing its limbs, one should attenuate one's senses and mind,\r\ncultivate a thoroughly peaceful understanding, and seek to master every\r\ntopic. Freed from all pairs of opposites, never bending one's head in\r\nreverence, abstaining from the rites requiring the utterance of Swaha,\r\none should be free from mineness, and egoism. With cleansed soul, one\r\nshould never seek to acquire what one has not and protect what one has.\r\nFree from expectations, divested of qualities, wedded to tranquillity,\r\none should be free from all attachments and should depend on none.\r\nAttached to one's own self and comprehending all topics, one becomes\r\nemancipated without doubt. Those who perceive the self, which is without\r\nhands and feet and back, which is without head and without stomach, which\r\nis free from the operation of all qualities, which is absolute,\r\nuntainted, and stable, which is without smell, without taste, and touch,\r\nwithout colour, and without sound, which is to be comprehended (by close\r\nstudy), which is unattached, which is without flesh, which is free from\r\nanxiety, unfading, and divine, and, lastly, which though dwelling in a\r\nhouse resides in all creatures, succeed in escaping death. There the\r\nunderstanding reaches not, nor the senses, nor the deities, nor the\r\nVedas, nor sacrifices, nor the regions (of superior bliss), nor penance,\r\nnor vows. The attainment to it by those who are possessed of knowledge is\r\nsaid to be without comprehension of symbols. Hence, the man who knows the\r\nproperties of that which is destitute of symbols, should practise the\r\ntruths of piety.[142] The learned man, betaking himself to a life of\r\ndomesticity, should adopt that conduct which is conformable to true\r\nknowledge. Though undeluded, he should practise piety after the manner of\r\none that is deluded, without finding fault with it. Without finding fault\r\nwith the practices of the good, he should himself adopt such a conduct\r\nfor practising piety as may induce others to always disrespect him. That\r\nman who is endued with such a conduct is said to be the foremost of\r\nascetics. The senses, the objects of the senses, the (five) great\r\nelements, mind, understanding, egoism, the unmanifest, Purusha also,\r\nafter comprehending these duly with the aid of correct inferences, one\r\nattains to Heaven, released from all bonds. One conversant with the\r\ntruth, understanding these at the time of the termination of his life,\r\nshould meditate, exclusively resting on one point. Then, depending on\r\nnone, one attains to Emancipation. Freed from all attachments, like the\r\nwind in space, with his accumulations exhausted, without distress of any\r\nkind, he attains to his highest goal.'\""

It is free from all pairs of opposites, it is divested of all\r\nqualities; it is eternal; it is endued with unthinkable qualities: it is\r\nsupreme. It is by knowledge and penance that those endued with wisdom\r\nbehold that which is the highest. Verily, they that are of untainted\r\nminds, that are cleansed of every sin, and that have transcended all\r\npassion and darkness (succeed in beholding it). They who are always\r\ndevoted to renunciation, and who are conversant with the Vedas, succeed\r\nin attaining to the supreme Lord who is identical with the path of\r\nhappiness and peace, by the aid of penance. Penance, it has been said, is\r\nlight. Conduct leads to piety. Knowledge is said to be the highest.\r\nRenunciation is the best penance. He who understands self through\r\naccurate determination of all topics, which is unperturbed, which is\r\nidentical with Knowledge, and which resides in all entities, succeeds in\r\ngoing everywhere. The learned man who beholds association, and\r\ndissociation, and unity in diversity, is released from misery. He who\r\nnever desires for anything, who despises nothing, becomes eligible, even\r\nwhen dwelling in this world, for assimilation with Brahman. He who is\r\nconversant with the truths about qualities of Pradhana, and understands\r\nthe Pradhana as existing in all entities who is free from mineness and\r\negoism, without doubt becomes emancipated. He who is freed from all pairs\r\nof opposites, who does not bend his head to any body, who has transcended\r\nthe rites of Swadha, succeeds by the aid of tranquillity alone in\r\nattaining to that which is free from pairs of opposites, which is\r\neternal, and which is divested of qualities. Abandoning all action, good\r\nor bad, developed from qualities, and casting off both truth and\r\nfalsehood, a creature, without doubt, becomes emancipated. Having the\r\nunmanifest for the seed of its origin, with the understanding for its\r\ntrunk, with the great principle of egoism for its assemblage of boughs,\r\nwith the senses for the cavities of its little sprouts, with the (five)\r\ngreat elements for its large branches, the objects of the senses for its\r\nsmaller branches, with leaves that are ever present, with flowers that\r\nalways adorn it and with fruits both agreeable and disagreeable always\r\nproduced, is the eternal tree of Brahman which forms the support of all\r\ncreatures. Cutting and piercing that tree with knowledge of truth as the\r\nsword, the man of wisdom, abandoning the bonds which are made of\r\nattachment and which cause birth, decrepitude and death, and freeing\r\nhimself from mineness and egoism, without doubt, becomes emancipated.\r\nThese are the two birds, which are immutable, which are friends, and\r\nwhich should be known as unintelligent. That other who is different from\r\nthese two is called the Intelligent. When the inner self, which is\r\ndestitute of knowledge of nature, which is (as it were) unintelligent,\r\nbecomes conversant with that which is above nature, then, understanding\r\nthe Kshetra, and endued with an intelligence that transcends all\r\nqualities and apprehends everything, one becomes released from all sins.'\""

He who, even for the\r\nshort space of time that is taken by a single breath, when his end comes,\r\nbecomes equable, attaining to the self, fits himself for immortality.\r\nRestraining the self in the self, even for the space of a wink, one goes,\r\nthrough the tranquillity of the self, to that which constitutes the\r\ninexhaustible acquisition of those that are endued with knowledge.\r\nRestraining the life-breaths again and again by controlling them\r\naccording to the method called Pranayama, by the ten or the twelve, he\r\nattains to that which is beyond the four and twenty.

Forgiveness, courage, abstention from harm,\r\nequability, truth, sincerity, knowledge, gift, and renunciation, are said\r\nto be the characteristics of that course of conduct which arises out of\r\nGoodness. It is by this inference that the wise believe in the identity\r\nof Purusha and Goodness, There is no doubt in this. Some learned men that\r\nare devoted to knowledge assert the unity of Kshetrajna and Nature. This,\r\nhowever, is not correct. It is said that Nature is different from\r\nPurusha: that also will imply a want to consideration. Truly, distinction\r\nand association should be known (as applying to Purusha and Nature).\r\nUnity and diversity are likewise laid down. That is the doctrine of the\r\nlearned.

Such differences of views\r\nmay be seen among deities and Brahmanas conversant with Brahman and\r\nendued with perceptions of truth. Some are for taking food; while some\r\nare devoted to fasts.

      "content": "\"Brahmana said, 'Well then, I shall declare to you what you ask. Learn\r\nwhat was told by a preceptor to a disciple that came unto him. Hearing it\r\nall, do you settle properly (what it should be). Abstention from harming\r\nany creature is regarded as the foremost of all duties. That is the\r\nhighest seat, free from anxiety and constituting an indication of\r\nholiness. The ancients who were beholders of the certain truth, have said\r\nthat knowledge is the highest happiness. Hence, one becomes released of\r\nall sins by pure knowledge. They that are engaged in destruction and\r\nharm, they that are infidels in conduct, have to go to Hell in\r\nconsequence of their being endued with cupidity and delusion. Those who,\r\nwithout procrastination, perform acts, impelled thereto by expectation\r\nbecome repeatedly born in this world and sport in joy. Those men who,\r\nendued with learning and wisdom, perform acts with faith, free from\r\nexpectations, and possessed of concentration of mind, are said to\r\nperceive clearly. I shall, after this, declare how the association and\r\nthe dissociation takes place of Kshetrajna and Nature. Ye best of men,\r\nlisten. The relation here is said to be that between the object and the\r\nsubject.[147] Purusha is always the subject; and Nature has been said to\r\nbe the object. It has been explained, by what has been said in a previous\r\nportion of the discourse where it has been pointed out, that they exist\r\nafter the manner of the Gnat and the Udumbara. An object of enjoyment as\r\nit is, Nature is unintelligent and knows nothing. He, however, who enjoys\r\nit, is said to know it. Kshetrajna being enjoyer, Nature is enjoyed. The\r\nwise have said that Nature is always made up of pairs of opposites (and\r\nconsists of qualities). Kshetrajna is, on the other hand, destitute of\r\npairs of opposites, devoid of parts, eternal, and free, as regards its\r\nessence, from qualities. He resides in everything alike, and walks, with\r\nknowledge. He always enjoys Nature, as a lotus leaf (enjoys) water.\r\nPossessed of knowledge, he is never tainted even if brought into contact\r\nwith all the qualities. Without doubt, Purusha is unattached like the\r\nunsteady drop of water on the lotus-leaf. This is the certain conclusion\r\n(of the scriptures) that Nature is the property of Purusha. The relation\r\nbetween these two (viz., Purusha and Nature) is like that existing\r\nbetween matter and its maker. As one goes into a dark place taking a\r\nlight with him, even so those who wish for the Supreme proceed with the\r\nlight of Nature.[148] As long as matter and quality (which are like oil\r\nand wick) exist, so long the light shines. The flame, however, becomes\r\nextinguished when matter and quality (or oil and wick) are exhausted.\r\nThus Nature is manifest; while Purusha is said to be unmanifest.\r\nUnderstand this, ye learned Brahmanas. Well, I shall now tell you\r\nsomething more. With even a thousand (explanations), one that has a bad\r\nunderstanding succeeds not in acquiring knowledge. One, however, that is\r\nendued with intelligence succeeds in attaining happiness, through only a\r\nfourth share (of explanations). Thus should the accomplishment of duty be\r\nunderstood as dependent on means. For the man of intelligence, having\r\nknowledge of means, succeeds in attaining to supreme felicity. As some\r\nman travelling along a road without provisions for his journey, proceeds\r\nwith great discomfort and may even meet with destruction before he\r\nreaches the end of his journey, even so should it be known that ill acts\r\nthere may not be fruits.[149] The examination of what is agreeable and\r\nwhat is disagreeable in one's own self is productive of benefit.[150] The\r\nprogress in life of a man that is devoid of the perception of truth is\r\nlike that of a man who rashly journeys on a long road unseen before. The\r\nprogress, however, of those that are endued with intelligence is like\r\nthat of men who journey along the same road, riding on a car unto which\r\nare yoked (fleet) steeds and which moves with swiftness. Having ascended\r\nto the top of a mountain, one should not cast one's eyes on the surface\r\nof the earth.[151] Seeing a man, even though travelling on a car,\r\nafflicted and rendered insensible by pain, the man of intelligence\r\njourneys on a car as long as there is a car path.[152] The man of\r\nlearning, when he sees the car path end, abandons his car for going on.\r\nEven thus proceeds the man of intelligence who is conversant with the\r\nordinances respecting truth and Yoga (or Knowledge and Devotion).\r\nConversant with the qualities, such a man proceeds, comprehending what is\r\nnext and next.[153] As one that plunges, without a boat, into the\r\nterrible ocean, with only one's two arms, through delusion, undoubtedly\r\nwishes for destruction; while the man of wisdom, conversant with\r\ndistinctions, goes into the water, with a boat equipt with oars, and soon\r\ncrosses the lake without fatigue, and having crossed it attains to the\r\nother shore and casts off the boat, freed from the thought of meum. This\r\nhas been already explained by the illustration of the car and the\r\npedestrian. One who has been overwhelmed by delusion in consequence of\r\nattachment, adheres to it like a fisherman to his boat. Overcome by the\r\nidea of meum, one wanders within its narrow range. After embarking on a\r\nboat it is not possible in moving about on land. Similarly, it is not\r\npossible in moving about on water after one has mounted on a car. There\r\nare thus various actions with regard to various objects. And as action is\r\nperformed in this world, so does it result to those that perform them.\r\nThat which is void of smell, void of taste, and void of touch and sound,\r\nthat which is meditated upon by the sages with the aid of their\r\nunderstanding, is said to be Pradhana. Now, Pradhana is unmanifest. A\r\ndevelopment of the unmanifest is Mahat. A development of Pradhana when it\r\nhas become Mahat is Egoism. From egoism is produced the development\r\ncalled the great elements. And of the great elements respectively, the\r\nobjects of sense are said to be the developments. The unmanifest is of\r\nthe nature of seed. It is productive in its essence. It has been heard by\r\nus that the great soul has the virtues of a seed, and that is a product.\r\nEgoism is of the nature of seed and is a product again and again. And the\r\nfive great elements are of the nature of seed and products. The objects\r\nof the five great elements are endued with the nature of seed, and yield\r\nproducts. These have Chitta for their property. Among them, space has one\r\nquality; wind is said to have two. Light, it is said, is endued with\r\nthree qualities; and water as possessed of four qualities. Earth, teeming\r\nwith mobiles and immobiles, should be known as possessed of five\r\nqualities. She is a goddess that is the source of all entities and\r\nabounds with examples of the agreeable and the disagreeable. Sound,\r\nlikewise touch, colour, taste, and smell numbering the fifth,--these are\r\nthe five qualities of earth, ye foremost of regenerate persons. Smell\r\nalways belongs to earth, and smell is said to be of various kinds. I\r\nshall state at length the numerous qualities of smell. Smell is agreeable\r\nor disagreeable, sweet, sour, pungent, diffusive and compact, oily and\r\ndry, and clear. Thus smell, which belongs to the earth, should be known\r\nas of ten kinds.[154] Sound, touch, likewise colour, and taste have been\r\nsaid to be the qualities of water. I shall now speak of the qualities of\r\nTaste. Taste has been said to be of various kinds. Sweet, sour, pungent,\r\nbitter, astringent, and saline likewise. Taste, which has been said to\r\nappertain to water, is thus of six varieties. Sound, touch, and likewise\r\ncolour,--these are the three qualities which light is said to be\r\npossessed of. Colour is the quality of light, and colour is said to be of\r\nvarious kinds. White, dark, likewise red, blue, yellow, and grey also,\r\nand short, long, minute, gross, square and circular, of these twelve\r\nvarieties in colour which belongs to light. These should be understood by\r\nBrahmanas venerable for years, conversant with duties, and truthful in\r\nspeech. Sound and touch should be known as the two qualities of wind.\r\nTouch has been said to be of various kinds. Rough, cold and like wise\r\nhot, tender and clear, hard, oily, smooth, slippery, painful and soft, of\r\ntwelve kinds is touch, which is the quality of wind, as said by Brahmanas\r\ncrowned with success, conversant with duties, and possessed of a sight of\r\ntruth. Now space has only one quality, and that is said to be sound. I\r\nshall speak at length of the numerous qualities of sound. Shadaja,\r\nRishabha, together with Gandhara, Madhyama, and likewise Panchama; after\r\nthis should be known Nishada, and then Dhaivata.[155] Besides these,\r\nthere are agreeable sounds and disagreeable sounds, compact, and of many\r\ningredients. Sound which is born of space should thus be known to be of\r\nten kinds. Space is the highest of the (five) elements. Egoism is above\r\nit. Above egoism is understanding. Above understanding is the soul. Above\r\nthe soul is the Unmanifest. Above the Unmanifest is Purusha. One who\r\nknows which is superior and inferior among existent creatures, who is\r\nconversant with the ordinances in respect of all acts, and who\r\nconstitutes himself the soul of all creatures, attains to the Unfading\r\nSoul.'\""

All that springs from\r\nthem dissolves, when the time comes, in those very five great elements\r\nlike billows in the ocean. All the great elements are beyond those\r\nelements that compose the universe. He that is released from those five\r\nelements goes to the highest goal. The puissant Prajapati created all\r\nthis by the mind only. After the same manner Rishis attained to the\r\nstatus of deities by the aid of penance. After the same manner, those who\r\nhave achieved perfection, who were capable of the concentration of Yoga,\r\nand who subsist on fruits and roots, likewise perceive the triple world\r\nby penance. Medicines and herbs and all the diverse sciences are acquired\r\nby means of penance alone, for all acquisition has penance for its root.\r\nWhatever is difficult of acquisition, difficult to learn, difficult to\r\nvanquish, difficult to pass through, are all achievable by penance, for\r\npenance is irresistible. One that drinks alcoholic liquors, one that\r\nslays a Brahmana, one that steals, one that destroys a foetus, one that\r\nviolates one's preceptor's bed, becomes cleansed of such sin by penance\r\nwell performed. Human beings, Pitris, deities, (sacrificial) animals,\r\nbeasts and birds, and all other creatures mobile and immobile, by always\r\ndevoting themselves to penances, become crowned with success by penance\r\nalone. In like manner, the deities, endued with great powers of illusion,\r\nhave attained to Heaven. Those who without idleness perform acts with\r\nexpectations, being full of egoism, approach the presence of Prajapati.\r\nThose high-souled ones, however, who are devoid of mineness and freed\r\nfrom egoism through the pure contemplation of Yoga, attain to the great\r\nand highest regions. Those who best understand the self, having attained\r\nto Yoga contemplation and having their minds always cheerful, enter into\r\nthe unmanifest accumulation of happiness. Those persons who are freed\r\nfrom the idea of mineness as also from egoism and who are reborn after\r\nhaving attained to the fullness of Yoga contemplation, enter (when they\r\ndepart from such life) into the highest region reserved for the great,\r\nviz., the Unmanifest. Born from that same unmanifest (principle) and\r\nattaining to the same once more, freed from the qualities of Darkness and\r\nPassion, and adhering to only the quality of Goodness, one becomes\r\nreleased from every sin and creates all things.[157] Such a one should be\r\nknown to be Kshetrajna in perfection. He that knows him, knows the\r\nVeda.[158] Attaining to pure knowledge from (restraining) the mind, the\r\nascetic should sit self-restrained. One necessarily becomes that on which\r\none's mind is set. This is an eternal mystery. That which has the\r\nunmanifest for its beginning and gross qualities for its end, has been\r\nsaid to have Ne-science for its indication. But do you understand that\r\nwhose nature is destitute of qualities? Of two syllables is Mrityu\r\n(death); of three syllable is the eternal Brahman. Mineness is death, and\r\nthe reverse of mineness is the eternal.[159] Some men who are led by bad\r\nunderstanding applaud action. Those, however, that are numbered among the\r\nhigh-souled ancients never applaud action. By action is a creature born\r\nwith body which is made up of the sixteen.[160] (True) Knowledge swallows\r\nup Purusha (Self with consciousness of body). Even this is what is highly\r\nacceptable to eaters of Amrita.[161] Therefore, those whose vision\r\nextends to the other end (of the ocean of life) have no attachment for\r\nactions. This Purusha, however, is full of knowledge and not full of\r\naction.[162] He dies not who understands Him that is immortal, immutable,\r\nincomprehensible, eternal and indestructible--Him that is the restrained\r\nSoul and that transcends all attachments. He who thus understands the\r\nSoul to which there is nothing prior which is uncreated, immutable,\r\nunconquered, and incomprehensible even to those that are eaters of\r\nnectar, certainly becomes himself incomprehensible and immortal through\r\nthese means. Expelling all impressions and restraining the Soul in the\r\nSoul, he understands that auspicious Brahman than which nothing greater\r\nexists. Upon the understanding becoming clear, he succeeds in attaining\r\nto tranquillity. The indication of tranquillity is like what takes place\r\nin a dream.[163] This is the goal of these emancipated ones who are\r\nintent on knowledge. They behold all those movements which are born of\r\nsuccessive developments.[164] This is the goal of those who are\r\nunattached to the world, This is the eternal usage. This is the\r\nacquisition of men of knowledge. This is the uncensured mode of conduct.\r\nThis goal is capable of being attained by one that is alike to all\r\ncreatures, that is without attachment, that is without expectations, and\r\nthat looks equally on all things. I have now declared everything to you,\r\nye foremost of regenerate Rishis. Do you act in this way forthwith; you\r\nwill then acquire success.'\r\n\r\n\"The preceptor continued, 'Thus addressed by the preceptor Brahma, those\r\nhigh-souled sages acted accordingly and then attained to many regions (of\r\ngreat felicity). Do thou also, O blessed one, duly act according to the\r\nwords of Brahma as declared by me, O thou of pure soul. Thou wilt then\r\nattain to success.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said,--'Thus instructed in the principles of high religion by\r\nthe preceptor, the pupil, O son of Kunti, did everything accordingly, and\r\nthen attained to Emancipation. Having done all that he should have done,\r\nthe pupil, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, attained to that seat repairing\r\nwhither one has not to grieve.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Who, indeed, was that Brahmana, O Krishna, and who the\r\npupil, O Janarddana. Truly, if it is fit to be heard by me, do thou then\r\ntell me, O lord!'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'I am the preceptor, O mighty-armed one, and know that\r\nthe mind is my pupil. Through my affection for thee, O Dhananjaya, I have\r\nrelated this mystery to thee. If thou hast any love for me, O perpetuator\r\nof Kuru's race, do thou then, after having heard these instructions\r\nrelating to the Soul, always act duly (according to them), O thou of\r\nexcellent vows. Then when this religion has been duly practised, O mower\r\nof foes, thou wilt become freed from all thy sins and attain to absolute\r\nemancipation. Formerly, when the hour of battle came, this very religion,\r\nO thou of mighty arms, was declared by me (to thee)! Do thou, therefore,\r\nset thy mind on it. And now, O chief of Bharata's race, it is long since\r\nthat I saw the lord my sire. I wish to see him again, with thy leave, O\r\nPhalguna!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto Krishna who had said so, Dhananjaya said\r\nin reply,--We shall go to-day from this town to the city called after the\r\nelephant. Meeting king Yudhishthira of virtuous soul there, and informing\r\nhim (of thy intention) thou shalt then repair to thy own city!'\""

We shall repair\r\nto-day to the city named after the elephant. Thus addressed, O king,\r\nthose troops accoutred themselves, and informed Pritha's son of\r\nimmeasurable energy, saying,--Everything is equipt. Then those two, viz.,\r\nKrishna and the son of Pandu, ascended their car and proceeded on the\r\njourney, the loving friends engaged the while in delightful conversation.\r\nUnto Vasudeva seated on the car, Dhananjaya of great energy once more\r\nsaid these words, O chief of Bharata's race!--O perpetuator of the\r\nVrishni race, the king has obtained victory through thy grace. All his\r\nfoes have been slain, and he has recovered his kingdom without a thorn in\r\nit (to make it disagreeable). O slayer of Madhu, through thee the\r\nPandavas are endued with a powerful protector. Having obtained thee for\r\nour raft we have crossed the Kuru ocean. O thou that hast this universe\r\nfor thy handiwork, salutations to thee, O Soul of the universe, O best of\r\nall beings in the universe. I know thee in that measure in which I am\r\napproved by thee.[165] O slayer of Madhu, the soul of every creature is\r\nalways born of thy energy. Playful sport (in the from of creation,\r\npreservation, and destruction) is thine. Earth and sky, O lord, are thy\r\nillusion. This whole universe, consisting of mobile and immobile objects,\r\nis established on thee. Thou createst, by modification, the four orders\r\nof Being (viz., viviparous, oviparous, filth-born, and vegetables). Thou\r\ncreatest the Earth, the Welkin, and Heaven, O slayer of Madhu. The\r\nstainless lunar light is thy smile. The seasons are thy senses. The\r\never-moving wind is thy breath, and death, existing eternally, is thy\r\nwrath. In thy grace is the goddess of prosperity. Verily, Sree is always\r\nestablished in thee, O thou of the highest intelligence. Thou art the\r\nsport (in which creatures engage); thou art their contentment; thou their\r\nintelligence, thou their forgiveness, thou their inclinations, thou their\r\nbeauty. Thou art the universe with its mobile and immobile objects. At\r\nthe end of the cycle, it is thou, O sinless one, that art called\r\ndestruction. I am incapable of reciting all thy qualities in course of\r\neven a long period. Thou art the Soul and the Supreme Soul. I bow to\r\nthee, O thou of eyes like the petals of the lotus. O thou that art\r\nirresistible, I have learnt it from Narada and Devala and the Island-born\r\n(Vyasa), and the Kuru grandsire also, that all this (universe) rests on\r\nthee. Thou art the one Lord of all creatures. This, O sinless one, that\r\nthou hast declared unto me in consequence of thy favour for myself, I\r\nshall duly accomplish in its entirety, O Janarddana. Exceedingly\r\nwonderful is this which thou hast done from desire of doing what is\r\nagreeable to us, viz., the destruction in battle of the Kaurava (prince),\r\nthe son of Dhritarashtra. Thai host had been burnt by thee which I\r\n(subsequently) vanquished in battle. That feat was achieved by thee in\r\nconsequence of which victory became mine. By the power of thy\r\nintelligence was shown the means by which was duly affected the\r\ndestruction of Duryodhana in battle, as also of Karna, as of the sinful\r\nicing of the Sindhus; and Bhurisravas. I shall accomplish all that which,\r\nO son of Devaki, pleased with me thou hast declared to myself. I do not\r\nentertain any scruple in this. Repairing to king Yudhishthira of\r\nrighteous soul, I shall, O sinless one, urge him to dismiss thee, O thou\r\nthat art conversant with every duty. O lord, thy departure for Dwaraka\r\nmeets with my approbation. Thou shalt soon see my maternal uncle, O\r\nJanarddana. Thou shalt also see the irresistible Valadeva and other\r\nchiefs of the Vrishni race.--Thus conversing with each other, the two\r\nreached the city named after the elephant. They then, with cheerful\r\nhearts, and without any anxiety, entered the palace of Dhritarashtra\r\nwhich resembled the mansion of Sakra. They then saw, O monarch, king\r\nDhritarashtra, and Vidura of great intelligence, and king Yudhishthira\r\nand the irresistible Bhimasena, and the two sons of Madri by Pandu; and\r\nthe unvanquished Yuyatsu, seated before Dhritarashtra and Gandhari of\r\ngreat wisdom, and Pritha, and the beautiful Krishna, and the other ladies\r\nof Bharata's race with Subhadra counting first. They also saw all those\r\nladies that used to wait upon Gandhari. Then approaching king\r\nDhritarashtra, those two chastisers of foes announced their names and\r\ntouched his feet. Indeed, those high-souled ones also touched the feet of\r\nGandhari and Pritha and king Yudhishthira the Just, and Bhima. Embracing\r\nVidura also, they enquired after his welfare. In the company of all those\r\npersons, Arjuna and Krishna then approached king Dhritarashtra (again).\r\nNight came and then king Dhritarashtra of great intelligence dismissed\r\nall those perpetuators of Kuru's race as also Janarddana for retiring to\r\ntheir respective chambers. Permitted by the king all of them entered\r\ntheir respective apartments. Krishna of great energy proceeded to the\r\napartments of Dhananjaya. Worshipped duly and furnished with every object\r\nof comfort and enjoyment, Krishna of great intelligence passed the night\r\nin happy sleep with Dhananjaya as his companion. When the night passed\r\naway and morning came, the two heroes, finishing their morning rites and\r\ndealing their persons properly, proceeded to the mansion of king\r\nYudhishthira the just. There Yudhishthira the just, of great might, sat\r\nwith his ministers. The two high-souled ones, entering that well-adorned\r\nchamber, beheld king Yudhishthira the just like the two Aswins beholding\r\nthe chief of the celestials. Meeting the king, he of Vrishni's race as\r\nalso that foremost hero of Kuru's race, obtaining the permission of\r\nYudhishthira who was highly pleased with them, sat themselves down. Then\r\nthe king, gifted with great intelligence, seeing those two friends,\r\nbecame desirous of addressing them. Soon that best of monarchs, that\r\nforemost of speakers addressed them in the following words.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Ye heroes, ye foremost ones of Yadu's and Kuru's\r\nrace, it seems that ye two are desirous of saying something to me. Do ye\r\nsay what is in your mind. I shall soon accomplish it. Do not hesitate.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed, Phalguna, well conversant with speech, humbly approached\r\nking Yudhishthira the just and then said these words.--'Vasudeva here, of\r\ngreat prowess, O king, is long absent from home. He desires, with thy\r\npermission, to see his sire. Let him go, if thou thinkest it meet, to the\r\ncity of the Anarttas. It behoveth thee; O hero, to grant him permission!'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O lotus-eyed one, blessed be thou. O slayer of\r\nMadhu, do thou go this very day to the city of Dwaravati for seeing, O\r\npuissant one, that foremost one of Sura's race. O mighty-armed Kesava,\r\nthy departure is approved by me. Thou hast not seen my maternal uncle as\r\nalso the goddess Devaki, for a long time. Meeting my maternal uncle and\r\nrepairing to Valadeva also, O giver of honours, thou wilt, O thou of\r\ngreat wisdom, worship both of them at my word as they deserve.[166] Do\r\nthou also think of me daily as also of Bhima, that foremost of mighty\r\nmen, and of Phalguna and Nakula and Sahadeva, O giver of honours. Having\r\nseen the Anarttas, and thy sire, O mighty-armed one, and the Vrishnis,\r\nthou wilt come back to my horse-sacrifice, O sinless one. Do thou then\r\ndepart, taking with thee diverse kinds of gems and various sorts of\r\nwealth. Do thou, O hero of the Satwata race, also take with thee whatever\r\nelse thou likest. It is through thy grace, O Kesava, that the whole\r\nEarth, O hero, has come under our dominion and all our foes have been\r\nslain.'\r\n\r\nWhen king Yudhishthira the just of Kuru's race said so, Vasudeva, that\r\nforemost of men, said these words (in reply).\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'O mighty-armed one, all jewels and gems, all wealth, and\r\nthe entire Earth, are thine and thine alone. Whatever wealth exists in\r\nmy, abode, thou, O lord, art always the owner thereof.' Unto him\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma, said,--'Be it so'--and then duly\r\nworshipped (Krishna) the eldest brother, endued with great energy, of\r\nGada. Vasudeva then proceeded to his paternal aunt (Kunti). Duly\r\nhonouring her, he circumambulated her person. He was properly accosted by\r\nher in return, and then by all the others having Vidura for their first.\r\nThe four-armed eldest brother of Gada then set out from Nagapura on his\r\nexcellent car.[167] Placing his sister, the lady Subhadra, on the car,\r\nthe mighty-armed Janarddana then, with the permission of both\r\nYudhishthira and (Kunti) his paternal aunt, set out, accompanied by a\r\nlarge train of citizens. The hero who had the foremost of apes on his\r\nbanner, as also Satyaki, and the two sons of Madravati, and Vidura of\r\nimmeasurable intelligence, and Bhima himself whose tread resembled that\r\nof a prince of elephants, all followed Madhava. Janarddana of mighty\r\nenergy causing all those extenders of the Kuru kingdom and Vidura also to\r\nreturn, addressed Daraka, and Satyaki, saying,--'Urge the steeds to\r\nspeed.' Then that grinder of hostile masses, viz., Janarddana of great\r\nprowess, accompanied by Satyaki, the foremost one of Sini's race,\r\nproceeded to the city of the Anarttas, after having slain all his foes,\r\nlike He of a hundred sacrifices proceeding to Heaven (after slaughtering\r\nall his foes).'"

Phalguna repeatedly\r\nembraced the Vrishni hero, and as long as he was within the range of\r\nvision, he repeatedly turned his eyes towards him. With great difficulty,\r\nthe son of Pritha withdrew his gaze that had fallen on Govinda. The\r\nunvanquished Krishna also (did the same). The indications that were\r\nmanifested on the occasion of that high-souled one's departure, I shall\r\nnow detail. Do thou listen to me. The wind blew with great speed before\r\nthe car, clearing the path of sand-grains and dust and thorns. Vasava\r\nrained pure and fragrant showers and celestial flowers before the wielder\r\nof Saranga. As the mighty-armed hero proceeded, he came upon the desert\r\nill supplied with water. There he beheld that foremost of ascetics, named\r\nUtanka, of immeasurable energy. The hero of large eyes and great energy\r\nworshipped that ascetic. He was then worshipped by the ascetic in return.\r\nVasudeva then enquired after his welfare. That foremost of Brahmanas,\r\nviz., Utanka, politely accosted by Madhava, honoured him duly and then\r\naddressed him in these words.--'O Saurin, having repaired to the mansions\r\nof the Kurus and the Pandavas, hast thou succeeded in establishing a\r\ndurable understanding between them such as should exist between brothers?\r\nIt behoves thee to tell me everything. Dost thou come, O Kesava, after\r\nhaving united them in peace,--them that are thy relatives and that are\r\never dear to thee, O foremost one of Vrishni's race? Will the five sons\r\nof Pandu, and the children of Dhritarashtra, O scorcher of foes, sport in\r\nthe world in joy with thee? Will all the kings enjoy happiness in their\r\nrespective kingdoms, in consequence of the pacification of the Kauravas\r\nbrought about by thee? Has that trust, O son, which I had always reposed\r\non thee, borne fruit with regard to the Kauravas?'\r\n\r\n\"The blessed and holy one said, 'I strove my best at first, for bringing\r\nabout a good understanding, in regard to the Kauravas. When I could not\r\nby any means succeed in establishing them on peace, it happened that all\r\nof them, with their relatives and kinsmen, met with death. It is\r\nimpossible to transgress destiny by either intelligence or might. O great\r\nRishi, O sinless one, this also cannot be unknown to thee. They (the\r\nKauravas) transgressed the counsels which Bhishma and Vidura gave them\r\nreferring to me.[168] Encountering one another they then became guests of\r\nYama's abode. Only the five Pandavas constitute the remnant of the\r\nunslain, all their friends and all their children having been\r\nslaughtered. All the sons of Dhritarashtra also with their children and\r\nkinsmen, have been slain.' When Krishna had said these words, Utanka,\r\nfilled with wrath, and with eyes expanded in rage, addressed him in these\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said,--'Since, though able, O Krishna, thou didst not rescue\r\nthose foremost ones of Kuru's race, who were thy relatives and,\r\ntherefore, dear to thee, I shall, without doubt, curse thee. Since thou\r\ndidst not forcibly compel them to forbear, therefore, O slayer of Madhu,\r\nI shall, filled with wrath, denounce a curse on thee. It seems, O\r\nMadhava, that though fully able (to save them), thou wert indifferent to\r\nthese foremost of Kurus who, overwhelmed by insincerity and hypocrisy\r\nhave all met with destruction.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'O scion of Bhrigu's race, listen to what I say in\r\ndetail. Do thou accept my apologies also. O thou of Bhrigu's race, thou\r\nart an ascetic. After having heard my words relating to the soul, thou\r\nmayst then utter thy curse. No man is able, by a little ascetic merit, to\r\nput me down. O foremost of ascetics, I do not wish to see the destruction\r\nof all thy penances. Thou hast a large measure of blazing penances. Thou\r\nhast gratified thy preceptors and seniors.[169] O foremost of regenerate\r\nones, I know that thou hast observed the rules of Brahmacharyya from the\r\ndays of thy infancy.

In those forms that I assume for\r\nthe purpose, I am known, O son of Bhrigu's race, in the three worlds as\r\nVishnu and Brahman and Sakra. I am the origin and I am the destruction of\r\nall things. I am the creator of all existent objects and I am their\r\ndestroyer. Knowing no change myself, I am the destroyer of all those\r\ncreatures that live in sinfulness.

Krishna, however, once more said unto\r\nhim--Do not scruple in this matter. This must be done. A sight of my form\r\ncannot be fruitless.'\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said, 'I must accomplish that, O lord, which thou thinkest should\r\nbe done. I desire to have water wherever my wish for it may arise. Water\r\nis scarce in such deserts.' Withdrawing that energy, the Supreme Lord\r\nthen said unto Utanka--Whenever thou wilt require water, think of me!\r\nHaving said so, he proceeded towards Dwaraka. Subsequently, one day, the\r\nillustrious Utanka, solicitous of water and exceedingly thirsty, wandered\r\nover the desert. In course of his wanderings he thought of Krishna of\r\nunfading glory. The intelligent Rishi then beheld in that desert a naked\r\nhunter (of the Chandala class), all besmeared with dirt, surrounded by a\r\npack of dogs. Extremely fierce-looking, he carried a sword and was armed\r\nwith bow and arrows. That foremost of regenerate ones beheld copious\r\nstreams of water issuing from the urinary organs of that hunter. As soon\r\nas Utanka had thought of Krishna, that hunter smilingly addressed him,\r\nsaying,--'O Utanka, O thou of Bhrigu's race, do thou accept this water\r\nfrom me. Beholding thee afflicted by thirst I have felt great compassion\r\nfor thee.' Thus addressed by the hunter, the ascetic showed no\r\ninclination to accept that water. The intelligent Utanka even began to\r\ncensure Krishna of unfading glory. The hunter, how ever, repeatedly\r\naddressed the Rishi, saying,--'Drink!' The ascetic refused to drink the\r\nwater thus offered. On the other hand, with heart afflicted by hunger and\r\nthirst, he even gave way to wrath. Disregarded by the high-souled Rishi\r\nthrough that conviction, the hunter, O king, with his pack of dogs,\r\ndisappeared there and then. Beholding that (wonderful) disappearance,\r\nUtanka became filled with shame. He even thought that Krishna, that\r\nslayer of foes, had beguiled him (in the matter of the boon he had\r\ngranted). Soon after, the holder of the conch and discus and mace, endued\r\nwith great intelligence, came to Utanka by the way (along which the\r\nhunter had come). Addressing Krishna, the Brahmana said,--'O foremost of\r\nbeings, it was scarcely proper for thee to offer water unto foremost of\r\nBrahmanas in the form of a hunter's urine, O lord.' Unto Utanka who said\r\nthese words, Janarddana of great intelligence replied, comforting him\r\nwith many soft words--'That form which it was proper to assume for\r\noffering thee water, in that form was water offered to thee. But, also,\r\nthou couldst not understand it. The wielder of the thunder bolt,\r\nPurandara, was requested by me for thy sake. My words to that puissant\r\ndeity were--'Do thou give nectar in the form of water unto Utanka.' The\r\nchief of the celestials replied to me saying--It is not proper that a\r\nmortal should become immortal. Let some other boon be granted to\r\nUtanka.'--O son of Bhrigu's race, these words were repeatedly addressed\r\nto me. The lord of Sachi, however, was once more requested by me in these\r\nwords, viz., even nectar should be given to Utanka.'--The chief of the\r\ncelestials then, comforting me, said,--'If, O thou of great intelligence,\r\nnectar is to be given to him, I shall then assume the form of a hunter\r\nand give it to that high-souled descendant of Bhrigu's race. If that son\r\nof Bhrigu accepts it thus, I then go to him, O lord, for giving it unto\r\nhim. If, however, he sends me away from disregard,--I shall not then give\r\nit to him on any account,--Having made this compact with me, Vasava\r\nappeared before thee, in that disguise, for giving thee nectar. Thou,\r\nhowever, didst disregard him and send him away, seeing that the\r\nillustrious one had put on the guise of a Chandala. Thy fault has been\r\ngreat. Once more, with regard to thy desire, I am prepared to do what is\r\nin my power. Indeed, this painful thirst of thine, I shall arrange, shall\r\nbe slaked. On those days, O regenerate one, in which thou wilt feel a\r\ndesire for water, clouds well-charged with water will rise over this\r\ndesert. Those clouds, O son of Bhrigu's race, will give thee savoury\r\nwater to drink. Verily, those clouds will become known in the world as\r\nUtanka-clouds.' Thus addressed by Krishna, Utanka became filled with\r\ngladness, and to this day, O Bharata, Utanka-clouds (appear and) shower\r\nrain on and deserts.'\""

He was devoted to his preceptor. Endued with great energy, he\r\nabstained from worshipping anybody else. All the children of the Rishis O\r\nBharata, entertained even this wish, viz., that their devotion to\r\npreceptors should be as great as that of Utanka. Gautama's gratification\r\nwith and affection for Utanka, among his numerous disciples, were very\r\ngreat, O Janamejaya. Indeed, Gautama was highly pleased with the\r\nself-restraint and purity of behaviour that characterised Utanka, and\r\nwith his acts of prowess and the services he rendered to him. One after\r\nanother, thousands of disciples received the preceptor's permission to\r\nreturn home (after the completion of their pupilage). In consequence,\r\nhowever, of his great affection for Utanka, Gautama could not permit him\r\nto leave his retreat. Gradually, in course of time, O son, decrepitude\r\novertook Utanka, that great ascetic. The ascetic, however, in consequence\r\nof his devotion to his preceptor, was not conscious of it. One day, he\r\nset out, O monarch, for fetching fuel for his preceptor. Soon after\r\nUtanka brought a heavy load of fuel. Toil-worn and hungry and afflicted\r\nby the load he bore on his head, O chastiser of foes, he threw the load\r\ndown on the Earth, O king. One of his matted locks, white as silver, had\r\nbecome entangled with the load. Accordingly, when the load was thrown\r\ndown, with it fell on the earth that matted lock of hair. Oppressed as he\r\nhad been by that load and overcome by hunger, O Bharata, Utanka,\r\nbeholding that sign of old age, began to indulge in loud lamentations\r\nfrom excess of sorrow. Conversant with every duty, the daughter of his\r\npreceptor the, who was possessed of eyes that resembled the petals of the\r\nlotus, and of hips that were full and round, at the command of her sire,\r\nsought, with downcast face, to hold Utanka's tears in her hands. Her\r\nhands seemed to burn with those tear-drops that she held. Unable,\r\naccordingly, to hold them longer, she was obliged to throw them down on\r\nthe Earth. The Earth herself was unable to hold those tear-drops of\r\nUtanka. With a gratified heart, Gautama then said unto the regenerate\r\nUtanka,--Why, O son, is thy mind so afflicted with grief today? Tell me\r\ncalmly and quietly, O learned Rishi, for I wish to hear it in detail.'\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said, 'With mind entirely devoted to thee, and wholly bent upon\r\ndoing what is agreeable to thee, with my, heart's devotion turned to\r\nthee, and with thoughts entirely dwelling on thee, (I have resided here\r\ntill) decrepitude has come upon me without my knowing it at all. I have\r\nnot, again, known any happiness. Though I have dwelt with thee for a\r\nhundred years, yet thou hast not granted me permission to depart. Many\r\ndisciples of thine, that were my juniors, have, however, been permitted\r\nby thee to return. Indeed, hundreds and thousands of foremost Brahmanas\r\nhave, equipt with knowledge, been permitted by thee (to depart from thy\r\nretreat and set themselves up as teachers)!'\r\n\r\n\"Gautama said, 'Through my love and affection for thee, and in\r\nconsequence of thy dutiful services to me, a long time has elapsed\r\nwithout my knowing it, O foremost of Brahmanas. If, however, O thou of\r\nBhrigu's race, the desire is entertained by thee of leaving this place,\r\ndo thou go without delay, receiving my permission.'\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said. 'What shall I present to my preceptor? Tell me this, O best\r\nof regenerate persons. Having brought it, I shall go hence, O lord, with\r\nthy permission.'\r\n\r\n\"Gautama said. 'The good that the gratification of the preceptor is the\r\nfinal fee.[171] Without doubt, O regenerate one. I have been highly\r\ngratified with thy conduct. Know, O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, that I\r\nhave been exceedingly gratified with thee for this. If thou becomest a\r\nyoung man today of sixteen years, I shall bestow on thee, O regenerate\r\none, this my own daughter for becoming thy wife. No other woman save this\r\none is capable of waiting upon thy energy.' At these words of Gautama,\r\nUtanka once again became a youth and accepted that famous maiden for his\r\nwife. Receiving the permission of his preceptor, he then addressed his\r\npreceptor's wife, saying,--'What shall I give thee as final fee for my\r\npreceptor? Do thou command me. I desire to accomplish, with wealth or\r\neven my life, what is agreeable and beneficial to thee. Whatever gem,\r\nexceedingly wonderful and of great value, exists in this world, I shall\r\nbring for thee with the aid of my penances. I have no doubt in this.'\r\n\r\n\"Ahalya said, 'I am highly gratified with thee, O learned Brahmana, with\r\nthy unintermitting devotion, O sinless one. This is enough. Blessed be\r\nthou, go whithersoever thou likest.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Utanka, however, O monarch, once more, said\r\nthese words,--Do thou command me, O mother. It is meet that I should do\r\nsomething that is agreeable to thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Ahalya said, 'Blessed be thou, bring for me those celestial ear-rings\r\nthat are worn by the wife of Saudasa. That which is due to thy preceptor\r\nwill then be well-discharged.' Replying unto her 'So be it,'--Utanka\r\ndeparted, O Janamejaya, resolved to bring those ear-rings for doing what\r\nwas agreeable to his preceptor's wife. That foremost of Brahmanas,\r\nUtanka, proceeded without any loss of time to Saudasa who had (through\r\nthe curse of Vasishtha) become a cannibal, in order to solicit the\r\near-rings from him. Gautama meanwhile said unto his wife,--'Utanka is not\r\nto be seen today.' Thus addressed, she informed him how he had departed\r\nfor fetching the jewelled ear-rings (of Saudasa's queen). At this,\r\nGautama said,--'Thou hast not acted wisely. Cursed (by Vasishtha), that\r\nking (who has been transformed into a man-eater) will verily slay Utanka.'\r\n\r\n\"Ahalya said, 'Without knowing this, O holy one, I have set Utanka to\r\nthis task. He shall not, however, incur any danger through thy grace.\r\nThus addressed by her, Gautama said,--'Let it be so!' Meanwhile, Utanka\r\nmet king Saudasa in a deserted forest.'\""

It is impossible for a king\r\nthat is hostile to Brahmanas to continue living in this world or in\r\nattaining to happiness in the next. Hence have I given thee these my\r\njewelled ear-rings which were coveted by thee.[173] Do thou now keep the\r\ncompact which thou hast made with me today.'\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said, 'O king, I shall certainly act according to my promise.

One who behaves wrongly towards\r\nfriends is regarded as vile as a thief.'[174] Thou, again, O king, hast\r\nbecome my friend today. Do thou then, O foremost of men, give me such\r\ncounsel as is approved by the wise. As regards myself, I have now\r\nobtained the fruition of my wishes. Thou, again, art a cannibal. Is it\r\nproper for me to come back to thee or not?'\r\n\r\n\"Saudasa said, 'If it is proper (for me), O foremost of superior\r\nBrahmanas, to say what thou askest, I should then, O best of regenerate\r\nones, tell thee that thou shouldst never come back to me. O perpetuator\r\nof Bhrigu's race, by acting even thus, thou wilt attain to what is\r\nbeneficial to thee. If thou comest back, O learned Brahmana, thou wilt\r\nsurely meet with death.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the intelligent king in\r\nrespect of what was beneficial for him. Utanka took leave of the monarch\r\nand set out for the presence of Ahalya. Desirous of doing what was\r\nagreeable to the wife of his preceptor, he took the ear-rings with him\r\nand set out with great speed for reaching the retreat of Gautama.\r\nProtecting them even in the manner directed by Madayanti, that is,\r\nbinding them within the folds of his black deer-skin, he proceeded on his\r\nway. After he had proceeded for some distance, he became afflicted by\r\nhunger. He there beheld a Vilwa tree bent down with the weight of (ripe)\r\nfruits.[175] He climbed that tree. Causing his deer-skin, O chastiser of\r\nfoes, to hang on a branch, that foremost of regenerate persons then began\r\nto pluck some fruits. While he was employed in plucking those fruits with\r\neyes directed towards them, some of them fell, O king, on that deerskin\r\nin which those ear-rings had been carefully tied by that foremost of\r\nBrahmanas. With the strokes of the fruits, the knot became untied.\r\nSuddenly that deer-skin, with the ear-rings in it, fell down. When the\r\nknot being unfastened, the deer-skin fell down on the ground, a snake who\r\nwas there beheld those jewelled ear-rings. That snake belonged to the\r\nrace of Airavata. With great promptness he took up the ear-rings in his\r\nmouth and then entered an anthill. Beholding the ear-rings taken away by\r\nthat snake, Utanka, filled with wrath and in great anxiety of mind, came\r\ndown from the tree. Taking his staff he began to pierce that anthill.\r\nThat best of Brahmanas, burning with wrath and the desire for revenge,\r\nceaselessly employed himself for five and thirty days in that task. The\r\ngoddess Earth, unable to bear the force of Utanka's walking staff and\r\nwith body torn therewith, became exceedingly anxious. Unto that\r\nregenerate Rishi then, who continued to dig the Earth from desire of\r\nmaking a path to the nether regions inhabited by the Nagas, the chief of\r\nthe celestials, armed with the thunder, came there, on his car drawn by\r\ngreen horses. Endued with great energy, he beheld that foremost of\r\nBrahmanas, as he sat there engaged in his task.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Assuming the garb of a Brahmana afflicted with\r\nthe sorrow of Utanka, the chief of the celestials addressed him, saying,\r\n'This (purpose of thine) is incapable of being achieved. The regions of\r\nthe Nagas are thousands of Yojanas removed from this place. I think that\r\nthy purpose is not capable of being achieved with thy walking staff.'\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said, 'If, O Brahmana, the ear-rings be not recovered by me from\r\nthe regions of the Nagas, I shall cast off my life-breaths before thy\r\neyes, O foremost of regenerate persons!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'When the thunder-armed Indra failed to divert Utanka\r\nfrom his purpose, he united the latter's walking staff with the force of\r\nthunder. Then, O Janamejaya, the Earth, opening with those strokes having\r\nthe force of thunder, yielded a way to the (nether) regions inhabited by\r\nthe Nagas. By that path Utanka entered the world of Nagas. He saw that\r\nthat region lay extended thousands of Yojanas on all sides. Indeed, O\r\nblessed one, it was equipt with many walls made of pure gold and decked\r\nwith jewels and gems. There were many fine tanks of water furnished with\r\nflights of stair-cases made of pure crystal, and many rivers of clear and\r\ntransparent water. He saw also many trees with diverse species of birds\r\nperching on them. That perpetuator of Bhrigu's race behold the gate of\r\nthat region which was full five Yojanas high and a hundred Yojanas in\r\nwidth. Beholding the region of the Nagas, Utanka became very cheerless.\r\nIndeed, he, despaired of getting back the earrings. Then there appeared\r\nunto him a black steed with a white tail. His face and eyes were of a\r\ncoppery hue, O thou of Kuru's race, and he seemed to blaze forth with\r\nenergy. Addressing Utanka, he said, 'Do thou blow into the Apana duct of\r\nmy body. Thou wilt then, O learned Brahmana, get back thy ear-rings which\r\nhave been taken away by a descendant of Airavata's race! Do not loathe to\r\ndo my bidding, O son. Thou didst it often at the retreat of Gautama in\r\nformer days.'\r\n\r\n\"Utanka said, 'How did I know thee in the retreat of my preceptor?\r\nIndeed, I wish to hear how I did in those days what thou biddest me do\r\nnow.'\r\n\r\n\"The steed said, 'Know, O learned Brahmana, that I am the preceptor of\r\nthy preceptor, for I am the blazing Jatavedas (deity of fire). By thee I\r\nwas often worshipped for the sake of thy preceptor, O child of Bhrigu's\r\nrace, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall\r\naccomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus\r\naddressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity\r\nthen, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the\r\npores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick\r\nsmoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty\r\nand wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in\r\ngloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of\r\nthe Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the\r\nAiravatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya. Enveloped\r\nby that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata. These\r\nresembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest. With eyes that\r\nwere red in consequence of that smoke, and afflicted by the energy of the\r\ndeity of fire, the Nagas came out of their mansions to the high-souled\r\nson of Bhrigu's race for ascertaining what was the matter. Having heard\r\nwhat the matter was from that ascetic of immeasurable energy, all the\r\nNagas, with fear depicted on their eyes, offered him their worship\r\naccording to due forms. Indeed, all the Nagas placing the old and the\r\nyoung one's before them, bowed unto him with their heads and joining\r\ntheir hands addressed him, saying, 'Be gratified with us, O holy one!'\r\nHaving gratified that Brahmana and offered him water to wash his feet and\r\nthe ingredients of the Arghya (for honouring him), the Nagas gave him\r\nthose celestial and highly-adored ear-rings. Thus honoured by them,\r\nUtanka of great prowess, circumambulating the deity of fire, started for\r\nthe retreat of his preceptor. Indeed, repairing quickly to Gautama's\r\nasylum, O king, he presented those ear-rings unto the wife of his\r\npreceptor, O sinless one. That best of Brahmanas also told his preceptor\r\neverything about Vasuki and the other Nagas that had occurred. It was\r\neven thus, O Janamejaya, that the high-souled Utanka, having wandered\r\nthrough the three worlds, fetched those jewelled ear-rings (for his\r\npreceptor's wife). Of such prowess, O chief of Bharata's race, was the\r\nascetic Utanka. So austere were the penances with which he was endued. I\r\nhave thus told thee what thou hadst asked me.'\""

Passing many lakes and rivers and\r\nforests and hills, he at last came upon the delightful city of Dwaravati.\r\nIt was at the time, O king, when the festival of Raivataka had begun,\r\nthat he of eyes like lotus-petals arrived with Satyaki as his companion.\r\nAdorned with many beautiful things and covered with diverse Koshas made\r\nof jewels and gems, the Raivataka hill shone, O king, with great\r\nsplendour. That high mountain, decked with excellent garlands of gold and\r\ngay festoons of flowers, with many large trees that looked like the Kalpa\r\ntrees of Indra's garden, and with many golden poles on which were lighted\r\nlamps, shone in beauty through day and night. By the caves and fountains\r\nthe light was so great that it seemed to be broad day. On all sides\r\nbeautiful flags waved on the air with little bells that jingled\r\ncontinuously. The entire hill resounded with the melodious songs of men\r\nand women. Raivataka presented a most charming prospect like Meru with\r\nall his jewels and gems. Men and women, excited and filled with delight,\r\nO Bharata, sang aloud. The swell of music that thus rose from that\r\nforemost of mountains seemed to touch the very heavens. Everywhere were\r\nheard spouts and loud whoops of men who were in all stages of excitement.\r\nThe cackle of thousands of voices made that mountain delightful and\r\ncharming. It was adorned with many shops and stalls filled with diverse\r\nviands and enjoyable articles. There were heaps of cloths and garlands,\r\nand the music of Vinas and flutes and Mridangas was heard everywhere.\r\nFood mixed with wines of diverse kinds was stored here and there. Gifts\r\nwere being ceaselessly made to those that were distressed, or blind, or\r\nhelpless. In consequence of all this, the festival of that mountain\r\nbecame highly auspicious. There were many sacred abodes built on the\r\nbreast of that mountain, O hero, within which resided many men of\r\nrighteous deeds. Even thus did the heroes of Vrishni's race sport in that\r\nfestival of Raivataka. Equipt with those mansions, that mountain shone\r\nlike a second Heaven. At the arrival of Krishna, O chief of Bharata's\r\nrace, that prince of mountains resembled the blessed abode of Indra\r\nhimself. Worshipped (by his relatives), Krishna then entered a beautiful\r\nmansion. Satyaki also went to his own quarters with a delighted soul.\r\nGovinda entered his residence after a long absence, having accomplished\r\nfeats of great difficulty like Vasava amid the Danava host. The heroes of\r\nthe Bhoja, Vrishni, and Andhaka races, all came forward to receive that\r\nhigh-souled one like the deities advancing to receive him of a hundred\r\nsacrifices. Endued with great intelligence, he honoured them in return\r\nand enquired after their welfare. With a gratified heart he then saluted\r\nhis father and mother. The mighty-armed hero was embraced by both of them\r\nand comforted too (by numerous evidences of affection). He then took his\r\nseat with all the Vrishnis sitting around him. Having washed his feet and\r\ndispelled his fatigue, Krishna of mighty energy, as he sat there, then\r\nrecounted the chief incidents of the great battle in answer to the\r\nquestions put to him by his sire.'\""

Indeed,\r\ntell me how that battle took place between the high-souled Pandavas (on\r\nthe one side) and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa and Drona and Salya and\r\nothers (on the other side), between, in fact, numerous other Kshatriyas\r\nwell-skilled in aims, differing from one another in mien and attire, and\r\nhailing from diverse realms.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his sire, he of eyes like\r\nlotus-petals narrated, in the presence of his mother also, how the\r\nKaurava heroes had been slain in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'The feats were highly wonderful that were achieved by\r\nthose high-souled Kshatriyas. In consequence of their large number, they\r\nare incapable of being enumerated in even hundreds of years. I shall\r\nhowever, mention only the foremost of them. Do thou listen, therefore, to\r\nme as I mention in brief those feats achieved by the kings of Earth. O\r\nthou of godlike splendour. Bhishma of Kuru's race became the\r\ngeneralissimo, having eleven divisions of the Kaurava princes under his\r\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\r\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\r\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\r\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\r\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\r\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\r\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\r\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\r\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\r\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\r\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\r\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\r\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\r\nconsisting then of nine Akshauhinis, and protected by Kripa and Vrisha\r\nand others. Dhrishtadyumna conversant with many mighty weapons, and\r\npossessed of great intelligence, became the leader of the Pandavas. He\r\nwas protected by Bhima like Varuna protected by Mitra. That high-souled\r\nhero, always desirous of measuring his strength with Drona, supported by\r\nthe (remnant of the) Pandava army, and recollecting the wrongs inflicted\r\n(by Drona) on his sire (Drupada, the king of the Panchalas), achieved\r\ngreat feats in battle. In that encounter between Drona and the son of\r\nPrishata, the kings assembled from diverse realms were nearly\r\nexterminated. That furious battle lasted for five days. At the conclusion\r\nof that period, Drona, exhausted, succumbed to Dhrishtadyumna. After\r\nthat, Karna became the generalissimo of Duryodhana's forces. He was\r\nsupported in battle by the remnant of the Kaurava host which numbered\r\nfive Akshauhinis. Of the sons of Pandu there were then three Akshauhinis.\r\nAfter the slaughter of innumerable heroes, protected by Arjuna, they came\r\nto battle. The Suta's son Karna, though a fierce warrior, encountering\r\nPartha, came to his end on the second day, like an insect encountering a\r\nblazing fire. After the fall of Karna, the Kauravas became dispirited and\r\nlost all energy. Numbering three Akshauhinis, they gathered round the\r\nruler of the Madras. Having lost many car-warriors and elephants and\r\nhorsemen, the remnant of the Pandava army, numbering one Akshauhini and\r\npenetrated with cheerlessness, supported Yudhishthira (as their leader).\r\nThe king Yudhishthira, in the battle that ensued, achieved the most\r\ndifficult feats and slew, before half the day was over, the king of the\r\nMadras. After the fall of Salya, the high-souled Sahadeva of immeasurable\r\nprowess slew Sakuni, the man who had brought about the quarrel (between\r\nthe Pandavas and the Kurus). After the fall of Sakuni, the royal son of\r\nDhritarashtra, whose army had suffered an extensive carnage and who on\r\nthat account had become exceedingly cheerless, fled from the field, armed\r\nwith his mace. Then Bhimasena of great prowess, filled with wrath,\r\npursued him and discovered him within the waters of the Dwaipayana lake.\r\nWith the remnant of their army, the Pandavas surrounded the lake and,\r\nfilled with joy, encountered Duryodhana concealed within the waters.\r\nTheir wordy shafts, penetrating through the waters, pierced Duryodhana.\r\nRising up from the lake, the latter approached the Pandavas, armed with\r\nhis mace, desirous of battle. Then, in the great battle that ensued, the\r\nroyal son of Dhritarashtra was slain by Bhimasena who put forth his great\r\nprowess, in the presence of many kings. After this the remnant of the\r\nPandava army, as it slept in the camp, was slaughtered at night time by\r\nDrona's son who was unable to put up with the slaughter of his father (at\r\nthe hands of Dhrishtadyumna). Their sons slain, their forces slain, only\r\nthe five sons of Pandu are alive with myself and Yuyudhana. With Kripa\r\nand the Bhoja prince Kritavarman, the son of Drona represents the unslain\r\nremnant of the Kaurava army. Dhritarashtra's son Yuyutsu also escaped\r\nslaughter in consequence of his having adopted the side of the Pandavas.\r\nUpon the slaughter of the Kaurava king (Suyodhana) with all his followers\r\nand allies, Vidura and Sanjaya have come to the presence of king\r\nYudhishthira the just. Even thus did that battle occur, O lord, for eight\r\nand ten days. Many kings of Earth, slain therein, have ascended to\r\nHeaven.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Vrishnis, as they heard, O king, that\r\ndreadful account became filled with grief and sorrow and pain.'"

The motive of the high-souled one was that his sire might not\r\nhear what was highly unpleasant to him. Indeed, the intelligent Krishna\r\ndid not wish that his sire Vasudeva should, on hearing the dreadful\r\nintelligence of the death of his daughter's son, be afflicted with sorrow\r\nand grief. (His sister) Subhadra, noticing that the slaughter of her son\r\nhad not been mentioned, addressed her brother, saying,--Do thou narrate\r\nthe death of my son, O Krishna--and fell down on the earth (in a swoon).\r\nVasudeva beheld his daughter fallen on the ground. As soon as he saw\r\nthis, he also fell down, deprived of his senses by grief. (Regaining his\r\nsenses) Vasudeva, afflicted with grief at the death of his daughter's\r\nson, O king, addressed Krishna, saying, 'O lotus-eyed one, thou art famed\r\non Earth for being truthful in speech. Why, however, O slayer of foes,\r\ndost thou not tell me today of the death of my daughter's son? O puissant\r\none, tell me in detail of the slaughter of thy sister's son. Possessed of\r\neyes resembling thine, alas, how was he slain in battle by foes? Since my\r\nheart does not from grief break into a hundred pieces, it seems, O thou\r\nof the Vrishni's race, that it does not die with men when its hour does\r\nnot come. Oh, at the time of his fall, what words did he utter;\r\napostrophising his mother? O lotus-eyed one what did that darling of\r\nmine, possessed of restless eyes, say unto me? I hope he has not been\r\nslain by foes while retreating from battle with his back towards them? I\r\nhope, O Govinda, that, his face did not become cheerless while fighting?\r\nHe was possessed, O Krishna, of mighty energy. From a spirit of\r\nboyishness, that puissant hero, boasting (of his prowess) in my presence,\r\nused to speak of his skill (in battle). I hope that boy does not lie on\r\nthe field, slain deceitfully by Drona and Karna and Kripa and others? Do\r\nthou tell me this. That son of my daughter always used to challenge\r\nBhishma and that foremost of all mighty warriors, viz., Karna, in\r\nbattle.' Unto his sire who, from excess of grief, indulged in such\r\nlamentations, Govinda, more afflicted than he answered in these words.\r\n'His face did not become cheerless as he fought in the van of battle.\r\nFierce though that battle was, he did not turn his back upon it. Having\r\nslain hundreds and thousands of kings of Earth, he was brought to grief\r\nby Drona and Karna and at last succumbed to the son of Dussasana. If, O\r\nlord, he had been encountered, one to one, without intermission, he was\r\nincapable of being slain in battle by even the wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt. When his sire Arjuna was withdrawn from the main body by the\r\nSamsaptakas (who challenged to fight him separately), Abhimanyu was\r\nsurrounded by the enraged Kaurava heroes headed by Drona in battle. Then,\r\nO sire, after he had slaughtered a very large number of foes in battle,\r\nthy daughter's son at last succumbed to the son of Dussasana. Without\r\ndoubt, he has gone to Heaven. Kill this grief of thine, O thou of great\r\nintelligence. They that are of cleansed understandings never languish\r\nwhen they meet with any calamity. He by whom Drona and Karna and others\r\nwere checked in battle,--heroes that were equal to Indra himself in\r\nmight--why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou\r\nkill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.\r\nThat conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal\r\nwhich depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that\r\nhero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud\r\nlamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met\r\nDraupadi, she asked her in grief,--O reverend lady, where are all our\r\nsons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava\r\nladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her\r\ndaughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,--'O blessed girl, where has thy\r\nhusband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,\r\napprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,\r\nhe used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does\r\nnot thy husband come out today? Alas, O Abhimanyu, thy maternal\r\nuncles--mighty car-warriors--are all hale. They used to bless thee when\r\nthey saw thee come here prepared to go out for battle. Do thou tell me\r\nthe incidents of battle today as before, O chastiser of foes. Oh. why\r\ndost thou not answer me today--me who am weeping so bitterly?'--Hearing\r\nthese lamentations of this daughter of the Vrishni race, Pritha, deeply\r\nafflicted with grief, addressed her and slowly said,--'O Subhadra, though\r\nprotected by Vasudeva and Satyaki and by his own sire, thy youthful son\r\nhas yet been slain. That slaughter is due to the influence of Time! O\r\ndaughter of Yadu's race, mortal thy son was. Do not grieve. Irresistible\r\nin battle, thy son has, without doubt, attained to the highest goal. Thou\r\nart born in a high race of high-souled Kshatriyas. Do not grieve, O thou\r\nof restless glances, O girl of eyes like lotus-petals. Do thou cast thy\r\neyes on Uttara who is quick with child. O blessed lady, do not yield to\r\nsorrow. This auspicious girl will soon bring forth a son to that hero.\r\nHaving comforted her in this way, Kunti, conversant with every duty, O\r\nperpetuator of Yadu's race, casting off her grief, O irresistible one,\r\nmade arrangements for Abhimanyu's obsequial rites, with the acquiescence\r\nof king Yudhishthira and Bhima, and the twins (viz., Nakula and Sahadeva)\r\nwho in prowess resembled Yama himself. She also made many presents unto\r\nthe Brahmanas, and bestowed upon them many kine, O perpetuator of Yadu's\r\nrace, Then the Vrishni dame (Kunti), comforted a little, addressed the\r\ndaughter of Virata, saying,--O faultless daughter of Virata, thou\r\nshouldst not indulge in grief. For the sake of thy husband, O thou of\r\nrotund hips, protect the child in thy womb.--Having said these words, O\r\nthou of great splendour, Kunti ceased. With her permission I have brought\r\nSubhadra here. It was even thus, O giver of honours, that thy daughter's\r\nson met with his death. Cast off thy burning grief, O irresistible one.\r\nIndeed, do not set thy heart on sorrow.'"

Hearing these words of those\r\nBrahmanas, Yudhishthira caused offerings to be duly made unto that deity\r\nwho loved to lie down on mountain-breasts. Gratifying the (sacrificial)\r\nfire with (libations of) sanctified butter according to the ordinance,\r\nthe priest (Dhaumya) cooked Charu with the aid of Mantras and performed\r\nthe necessary rites. He took up many flowers and sanctified them with\r\nMantras, O king. With Modakas and frumenty and meat, he made offerings to\r\nthe deity. With diverse kinds of flowers and with fried paddy, of very\r\nsuperior kind, Dhaumya, well-versed in the Vedas, performed the remaining\r\nrites. He next presented offerings according to the ordinance unto those\r\nghostly beings who formed Mahadeva's train. And offerings were next made\r\nto Kuvera, the chief of the Yakshas, and unto Manibhadra also. Unto the\r\nother Yakshas also and unto them that were the foremost ones among the\r\nghostly companions of Mahadeva, the priest offered due worship, having\r\nfilled many jugs with food, with Krisaras and meat and Nivapas mixed with\r\nsesame seeds. The king gave away unto the Brahmanas thousands of kine. He\r\nthen directed the presentation, according to due rites, of offerings unto\r\nthose night-wandering beings (who live with Mahadeva). Surcharged, as it\r\nwere, with the scent of Dhupas, and filled with the fragrance of flowers,\r\nthat region, sacred to the deity of deities, O king, became exceedingly\r\ndelightful. Having performed the worship of Rudra and of all the Ganas,\r\nthe king, placing Vyasa ahead, proceeded towards the place where the\r\ntreasure was buried. Once more worshipping the Lord of treasures, and\r\nbowing unto him with reverence and saluting him properly, with diverse\r\nkinds of flowers and cakes and Krisara, having worshipped those foremost\r\nof gems, viz., Sankha and Nidhi, and those Yakshas who are the lords of\r\ngems, and having worshipped many foremost of Brahmanas and caused them to\r\nutter blessings, the king endued with great puissance, strengthened by\r\nthe energy and the auspicious benedictions of those Brahmanas, caused\r\nthat spot to be excavated. Then numerous vessels of diverse and\r\ndelightful forms, and Bhringaras and Katahas and Kalasas and\r\nBardhamanakas, and innumerable Bhajanas of beautiful forms, were dug out\r\nby king Yudhishthira the just. The wealth thus dug out was placed in\r\nlarge 'Karaputas' for protection.[182] A portion of the wealth was caused\r\nto be borne upon the shoulders of men in stout balances of wood with\r\nbaskets slung like scales at both ends. Indeed, O king, there were other\r\nmethods of conveyance there for bearing away that wealth of the son of\r\nPandu.[183] There were sixty thousands of camels and a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand horses, and of elephants, O monarch, there were one hundred\r\nthousand. Of cars there were as many, and of carts, too as many, and of\r\nshe-elephants as many. Of mules and men the number was untold. That\r\nwealth which Yudhishthira caused to be dugout was even so much. Sixteen\r\nthousand coins were placed on the back of each camel; eight thousand on\r\neach car; four and twenty thousand on each elephant; (while proportionate\r\nloads were placed on horses and mules and on the backs, shoulder and\r\nheads of men). Having loaded these vehicles with that wealth and once\r\nmore worshipping the great deity Siva, the son of Pandu set out for the\r\ncity called after the elephant, with the permission of the Island-born\r\nRishi, and placing his priest Dhaumya in the van. That foremost of men,\r\nviz., the royal son of Pandu, made short marches everyday, measured by a\r\nGoyuta (4 miles). That mighty host, O king, afflicted with the weight\r\nthey bore, returned, bearing that wealth, towards the capital, gladdening\r\nthe hearts of all those perpetuators of the Kuru race.'\""

While leaving\r\nthat city for returning to his own Dwaraka, he had been requested by the\r\nson of Dharma to come back. Hence, knowing that the time fixed for the\r\nhorse-sacrifice had come, that foremost of men came back (to the Kuru\r\ncapital). Accompanied by the son of Rukmini, by Yuyudhana, by\r\nCharudeshna, by Samva, by Gada, by Kritavarman, by the heroic Sarana, by\r\nNisatha, and by the Unmukha, Vasudeva came with Valadeva at the head of\r\nthe train, with Subhadra also accompanying him. Indeed, that hero came\r\nfor seeing Draupadi and Uttara and Pirtha and for comforting those\r\nKshatriya ladies of distinction who had been bereft of many of their\r\nprotectors. Beholding those heroes come, king Dhritarashtra, as also the\r\nhigh-souled Vidura, received them with due honours. That foremost of men,\r\nviz., Krishna of great energy, well adored by Vidura and Yuyutsu,\r\ncontinued to reside in the Kuru capital. It was while the Vrishni heroes,\r\nO Janamejaya, were residing in the Kuru city, O king, that thy sire, that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, was born. The royal Parikshit, O monarch,\r\nafflicted by the Brahma weapon (of Aswatthaman), upon coming out of the\r\nwomb, lay still and motionless, for life he had not. By his birth he had\r\ngladdened the citizens but soon plunged them into grief. The citizens,\r\nlearning of the birth of the prince, uttered a leonine shout. That noise\r\nproceeded to the utmost verge of every point of the compass. Soon,\r\nhowever, (when it was known that the prince was bereft of life), that\r\nnoise ceased. With great haste Krishna, his senses and mind considerably\r\naffected, with Yuyudhana in his company, entered the inner apartments of\r\nthe palace. He beheld his own paternal aunt (Kunti) coming, loudly\r\nweeping and calling upon him repeatedly. Behind her were Draupadi and the\r\nfamous Subhadra, and the wives of the relatives of the Pandavas, all\r\nweeping piteously. Meeting Krishna, Kunti, that daughter of the Bhoja\r\nrace, said unto him, O foremost of monarchs, these words in a voice\r\nchocked with tears, 'O Vasudeva, O mighty-armed hero, Devaki by having\r\nborne thee, has come to be regarded as an excellent genetrix. Thou art\r\nour refuge, and our glory. This race (of Pandu) depends upon thee for its\r\nprotector. O Yadava hero, O puissant one, this child of thy sister's son,\r\nhas come out of the womb, slain by Aswatthaman. O Kesava, do thou revive\r\nhim. O delighter of the Yadavas, even this was vowed by thee, O puissant\r\none, when Aswatthaman had inspired the blade of grass into a\r\nBrahma-weapon of mighty energy. Indeed, O Kesava, thy words were even\r\nthese, I shall revive that child if he comes out of the womb dead.--That\r\nchild, O son, has been born dead. Behold him, O foremost of men. It\r\nbehoveth thee, O Madhava, to rescue Uttara and Subhadra and Draupadi and\r\nmyself, and Dharma's son (Yudhishthira), and Bhima and Phalguna, and\r\nNakula, and the irresistible Sahadeva. In this child are bound the\r\nlife-breaths of the Pandavas and myself. O thou of the Dasarha race, on\r\nhim depends the obsequial cake of Pandu, as also of my father-in-law, and\r\nof Abhimanyu too, blessed be thou, that darling nephew of thine who was\r\nso very like unto thee. Do thou accomplish today what will be beneficial\r\nto all these. I urge thee earnestly, O Janarddana. Uttara, O slayer of\r\nfoes, always repeats the words said unto her by Abhimanyu. Without doubt,\r\nO Krishna, those words were highly agreeable to her. O thou of the\r\nDasarha race, Arjuna's son said unto this daughter of Virata,--Thy son, O\r\nblessed girl, will go to my maternal uncles. Taking up his residence with\r\nthe Vrishnis and Andhakas, he will obtain from them the science of arms,\r\nindeed, diverse wonderful weapons and the whole of the science of\r\npolitics and morality. Even these were the words, O son, that that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, viz., the son of Subhadra, that irresistible hero,\r\nsaid unto Uttara. from his affection for her. O slayer of Madhu, bowing\r\nour heads unto thee, we pray thee for making those words of Abhimanyu\r\ntrue. In view also of the time that has come, do thou accomplish what is\r\nhighly beneficial. Having said these words unto that hero of the\r\nVrishni's race, Pritha of large eyes, raised her arms upwards and with\r\nthe other ladies in her company, fell down on the Earth. All of them,\r\nwith eyes rendered muddy by tears, repeatedly exclaimed, saying, 'Alas,\r\nthe son of Vasudeva's nephew has been born dead.' After Kunti had said\r\nso, Janarddana took hold of her, O Bharata, and gently raising her from\r\nthe Earth, comforted her as follows.'\""

If only thou wishest it, thou canst revive the three worlds (of\r\nbeing) if dead. What need I say, therefore, of this darling child, born\r\nbut dead, of thy sister's son? I know thy puissance, O Krishna.\r\nTherefore, do I solicit thee. Do thou show this great favour to the sons\r\nof Pandu.

The\r\nhorse that was brought for the horse-sacrifice was let loose, agreeably\r\nto the injunctions of the scriptures, that utterer of Brahma, viz., Vyasa\r\nhimself of immeasurable energy. The king Yudhishthira the just, O\r\nmonarch, after his initiation, adorned with a garland of gold around his\r\nneck, shone in beauty like a blazing fire. Having a black deer skin for\r\nhis upper garment, bearing a staff in hand, and wearing a cloth of red\r\nsilk, the son of Dharma, possessed of great splendour, shone like a\r\nsecond Prajapati seated on the sacrificial altar. All his Ritwijas also,\r\nO king, were clad in similar robes. Arjuna also shone like a blazing\r\nfire. Dhananjaya, unto whose car were yoked white steeds, then duly\r\nprepared, O king, to follow that horse of the complexion of a black deer,\r\nat the command of Yudhishthira. Repeatedly drawing his bow, named\r\nGandiva, O king, and casing his hand in a fence made of iguana skin,\r\nArjuna, O monarch, prepared to follow that horse, O ruler of men, with a\r\ncheerful heart. All Hastinapore, O king, with very children, came out at\r\nthat spot from desire of beholding Dhananjaya, that foremost of the Kurus\r\non the eve of his journey. So thick was the crowd of spectators that came\r\nto behold the horse and the prince who was to follow it, that in\r\nconsequence of the pressure of bodies, it seemed a fire was created. Loud\r\nwas the noise that arose from that crowd of men who assembled together\r\nfor beholding Dhananjaya the son of Kunti, and it seemed to fill all the\r\npoints of the compass and the entire welkin. And they said,--'There goes\r\nthe son of Kunti, and there that horse of blazing beauty. Indeed, the\r\nmighty-armed hero follows the horse, having armed himself with his\r\nexcellent bow.'--Even these were the words which Jishnu of noble\r\nintelligence heard. The citizens also blessed him, saying,--'Let\r\nblessings he thine! Go thou safely and come back, O Bharata.' Others, O\r\nchief of men uttered these words--'So great is the press that we do not\r\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\r\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\r\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\r\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\r\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\r\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\r\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\r\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\r\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\r\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\r\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\r\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\r\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\r\nmany great and wonderful battles were fought between Arjuna and many\r\nkings. These I shall describe to thee. The horse, O king, roamed over the\r\nwhole Earth. Know, O monarch, that from the north it turned towards the\r\nEast. Grinding the kingdoms of many monarchs that excellent horse\r\nwandered. And it was followed slowly by the great car-warrior Arjuna of\r\nwhite steeds. Countless, O monarch, was the fete of Kshatriyas,--of kings\r\nin myriads--who fought with Arjuna on that occasion, for having lost\r\ntheir kinsmen on the geld of Kurukshetra. Innumerable Kiratas also, O\r\nking, and Yavanas, all excellent bowmen, and diverse tribes of Mlechechas\r\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\r\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\r\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\r\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\r\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\r\ncame to encounter him.

'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\r\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\r\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\r\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\r\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\r\nexcellent and well-decked horses, and with quivers on their backs, they\r\nsurrounded that horse, O king, and endeavoured to capture it. The\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade\r\nthose heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.\r\nDisregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of\r\ndarkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,\r\nye unrighteous ones. Life is a benefit (that should not be thrown away).'\r\nAt the time of his setting out, he had been earnestly ordered by king\r\nYudhishthira the just, not to slay those Kshatriyas whose kinsmen had\r\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\r\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\r\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\r\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\r\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\r\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\r\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\r\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\r\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\r\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\r\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\r\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\r\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\r\nKetuvarman, the younger brother of Suryavarman, and possessed of youthful\r\nvigour, fought, for the sake of his brother, against Pandu's son\r\npossessed of great fame. Beholding Ketuvarman approaching towards him for\r\nbattle, Vibhatsu, that slayer of hostile heroes, slew him with many\r\nsharp-pointed arrows. Upon Ketuvarman's fall, the mighty car-warrior\r\nDhritavarman, rushing on his car towards Arjuna, showered a perfect\r\ndownpour of arrows on him. Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by\r\nthe youth Dhritavarman, Gudakesa of mighty energy and great prowess\r\nbecame highly gratified with him. The son of Indra could not see when the\r\nyoung warrior took out his arrows and when he placed them on his\r\nbow-string aiming at him. He only saw showers of arrows in the air. For a\r\nbrief space of time, Arjuna gladdened his enemy and mentally admired his\r\nheroism and skill. The Kuru hero, smiling the while, fought with that\r\nyouth who resembled an angry snake. The mighty armed Dhananjaya, glad as\r\nhe was in beholding the valour of Dhritavarman, did not take his life.\r\nWhile, however, Partha of immeasurable energy fought mildly with him\r\nwithout wishing to take his life, Dhritavarman shot a blazing arrow at\r\nhim. Deeply pierced in the hand by that arrow, Vijaya became stupefied\r\nand his bow Gandiva fell down on the Earth from his relaxed grasp. The\r\nform of that bow, O king, when it fell from the grasp of Arjuna,\r\nresembled, O Bharata, that of the bow of Indra (that is seen in the\r\nwelkin after a shower). When that great and celestial bow fell down, O\r\nmonarch, Dhritavarman laughed loudly in battle. At this, Jishnu, excited\r\nwith rage, wiped the blood from his hand and once more taking up his bow,\r\nshowered a perfect downpour of arrows. Then a loud and confused noise\r\narose, filling the welkin and touching the very heavens as it were, from\r\ndiverse creatures who applauded that feat of Dhananjaya. Beholding Jishnu\r\ninflamed with rage and looking like Yama himself as he appears at the end\r\nof the Yuga, the Trigarta warriors hastily surrounded him, rushing from\r\ntheir posts and desirous of rescuing Dhritavarman. Seeing himself\r\nsurrounded by his foes, Arjuna became more angry than before. He then\r\nquickly despatched eight and ten of their foremost warriors with many\r\nshafts of hard iron that resembled the arrows of the great Indra himself.\r\nThe Trigarta warriors then began to fly. Seeing them retreat, Dhananjaya,\r\nwith great speed, shot many shafts at them that resembled wrathful snakes\r\nof virulent poison, and laughed aloud. The mighty car-warriors of the\r\nTrigartas, with dispirited hearts, fled in all directions, exceedingly\r\nafflicted by Dhananjaya with his arrows. They then addressed that tiger\r\namong men, that slayer of the Samsaptaka host (on the field of\r\nKurukshetra), saying, 'We are your slaves. We yield to thee.[190] Do thou\r\ncommand us, O Partha. Lo, we wait here as the most docile of thy\r\nservants. O delighter of the Kurus, we shall execute all thy commands.'\r\nHearing these words expressive of their submission, Dhananjaya, said unto\r\nthem, 'Do ye, O kings, save your lives, and accept my dominion.'\""

The royal son of\r\nBhagadatta, issuing out of his city, afflicted the steed that was coming\r\n(and seizing it), marched back towards his own place. Marking this, the\r\nmighty-armed chief of the Kuru race, speedily stretched his Gandiva, and\r\nsuddenly rushed towards his foe. Stupefied by the shafts sped from\r\nGandiva, the heroic son of Bhagadatta, letting off loose the steed, fled\r\nfrom Partha.[191] Once more entering his capital, that foremost of kings,\r\nirresistible in battle, cased himself in mail, and mounting on his prince\r\nof elephants, came out. That mighty car-warrior had a white umbrella held\r\nover his head, and was fanned with a milk-white yak-tail. Impelled by\r\nchildishness and folly, he challenged Partha, the mighty car-warrior of\r\nthe Pandavas, famed for terrible deeds in battle, to an encounter with\r\nhim. The enraged prince then urged towards Arjuna that elephant of his,\r\nwhich resembled a veritable mountain, and from whose temples and mouth\r\nissued streams of juice indicative of excitement. Indeed, that elephant\r\nshowered its secretions like a mighty mass of clouds pouring rain.\r\nCapable of resisting hostile feats of its own species, it had been\r\nequipped agreeably to the ordinances of the treatises (on war-elephants).\r\nIrresistible in battle, it had become so infuriate as to be beyond\r\ncontrol. Urged on by the prince with the iron-hook, that mighty elephant\r\nthen seemed (as it advanced) as if it would cut through the welkin (like\r\na flying hill). Beholding it advance towards him, O king, Dhananjaya,\r\nfilled with rage and standing on the earth, O Bharata, encountered the\r\nprince on its back. Filled with wrath, Vajradatta quickly sped at Arjuna\r\na number of broad-headed shafts endued with the energy of fire and\r\nresembling (as they coursed through the air) a cloud of speedily-moving\r\nlocusts. Arjuna, however, with shafts sped from Gandiva, cut off those\r\narrows, some into two and some into three pieces. He cut them off in the\r\nwelkin itself with those shafts of his coursing through the welkin. The\r\nson of Bhagadatta, beholding his broad-headed shafts thus cut off,\r\nquickly sped at Arjuna a number of other arrows in a continuous line.\r\nFilled with rage at this, Arjuna, more quickly than before, shot at\r\nBhagadatta's son a number of straightly coursing arrows equipt with\r\ngolden wings. Vajradatta of mighty energy, struck with great force and\r\npierced with these arrows in that fierce encounter, fell down on the\r\nEarth. Consciousness, however, did not desert him. Mounting on his prince\r\nof elephants again in the midst of that battle the son of Bhagadatta,\r\ndesirous of victory, very coolly sped a number of shafts at Arjuna.\r\nFilled with wrath, Jishnu then sped at the prince a number of arrows that\r\nlooked like blazing flames of fire and that seemed to be so many snakes\r\nof virulent poison.

On the fourth day, Vajradatta of\r\ngreat might laughed loudly and, addressing Arjuna, said these words:\r\n'Wait, wait, O Arjuna. Thou shalt not escape me with life. Slaying thee I\r\nshall duly discharge the water-rite of my sire. My aged sire, Bhagadatta,\r\nwho was the friend of thy sire, was slain by thee in consequence of his\r\nweight of years.

Urged on by\r\nVajradatta of great intelligence, that prince of elephants, as if\r\ndesirous of cutting through the welkin, rushed towards Dhananjaya. That\r\nprince of elephants drenched Arjuna with a shower of juice emitted from\r\nthe end of his trunk, like a mass of blue clouds drenching a hill with\r\nits downpour. Indeed, urged on by the king, elephant, repeatedly roaring\r\nlike a cloud, rushed towards Phalguna, with that deep noise emitted from\r\nits mouth. Verily, urged on by Vajradatta, that prince of elephants\r\nquickly moved towards the mighty car-warrior of the Kurus, with the tread\r\nof one that seemed to dance in excitement. Beholding that beast of\r\nVajradatta advance towards him, that slayer of foes, viz., the mighty\r\nDhananjaya, relying on Gandiva, stood his ground without shaking with\r\nfear. Recollecting what an obstacle Vajradatta was proving to the\r\naccomplishment of his task, and remembering the old enmity of the house\r\n(of Pragjyotisha towards the Pandavas), the son of Pandu became\r\nexceedingly inflamed with wrath against the king.

That prince of elephants possessed\r\nof beauty (of form), thus impeded by Arjuna, stopped in its course, with\r\nbody pierced with many an arrow, like a porcupine with its quills erect.\r\nSeeing his elephant impeded in its course, the royal son of Bhagadatta,\r\ndeprived of sense by rage, shot many whetted arrows at Arjuna. The\r\nmighty-armed Arjuna baffled all those arrows with many foe-slaying shafts\r\nof his. The feat seemed to be exceedingly wonderful. Once more the king\r\nof the Pragjyotishas, inflamed with ire, forcibly urged his elephant,\r\nwhich resembled a mountain, at Arjuna. Beholding the beast once more\r\nadvancing towards him, Arjuna shot with great strength a shaft at it that\r\nresembled a veritable flame of fire. Struck deeply in the very vitals, O\r\nking, by the son of Pandu, the beast suddenly fell down on the Earth like\r\na mountain summit loosened by a thunder-bolt. Struck with Dhartanjaya's\r\nshaft, the elephant, as it lay on the Earth, looked like a huge mountain\r\ncliff lying on the ground, loosened by the bolt of Indra. When the\r\nelephant of Vajradatta was prostrated on the ground, the son of Pandu,\r\naddressing the king who had fallen down with his beast, said,--'Do not\r\nfear. Indeed, Yudhishthira of mighty energy said unto me while\r\ncommissioning me for this task even these words,--'Thou shouldst not, O\r\nDhananjaya, slay those kings (who may encounter thee in battle).

When the day of full\r\nmoon in the month of Chaitra comes, thou shalt, O great king, repair to\r\nthat sacrifice of king Yudhishthira the just, for it takes place on that\r\nday.

Hearing that\r\nhe of white steeds had entered their territories, those Kshatriyas came\r\nout against him, unable to bear that foremost one of Pandu's race. Those\r\nwarriors who were as terrible as virulent poison, finding the horse\r\nwithin their dominion, seized it without being inspired with any fear of\r\nPartha who was the younger brother of Bhimasena. Advancing against\r\nVibhatsu who waited on foot, armed with his bow, upon the sacrificial\r\nsteed, they assailed him from a near point. Defeated in battle before,\r\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\r\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\r\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\r\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\r\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\r\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\r\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\r\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\r\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\r\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\r\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\r\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\r\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\r\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\r\nwith that arrowy shower, Arjuna looked like the sun covered by a cloud.\r\nThat foremost son of Pandu, in the midst of that cloud of arrows,\r\nresembled a bird in the midst of an iron cage, O Bharata. Seeing the son\r\nof Kunti thus afflicted with shafts, cries of Oh and Alas were uttered by\r\nthe three worlds and the Sun himself became shorn of his splendour. Then,\r\nO king, a terrible wind began to blow, and Rahu swallowed up both the Sun\r\nand the Moon at the same time. Many meteors struck the solar disc and\r\nthen shot in different directions. The prince of mountains, viz.,\r\nKailasa, began to tremble. The seven (celestial) Rishis, as also the\r\nother Rishis of Heaven, penetrated with fear, and afflicted with grief\r\nand sorrow, breathed hot sighs. Piercing through the welkin, those\r\nmeteors fell on the lunar disc as well. All the points of the compass\r\nbecame filled with smoke and assumed a strange aspect. Reddish clouds,\r\nwith flashes of lightning playing in their midst and the bow of Indra\r\nmeasuring them from side to side, suddenly covered the welkin and poured\r\nflesh and bloods on the Earth. Even such was the aspect which all nature\r\nassumed when that hero was overwhelmed with showers of shafts. Indeed,\r\nwhen Phalguna, that foremost one among the Bharatas, was thus afflicted,\r\nthose marvels were seen. Overwhelmed by that dense cloud of arrows,\r\nArjuna became stupefied. His bow, Gandiva, fell down from his relaxed\r\ngrip and his leathern fence also slipped down. When Dhananjaya became\r\nstupefied, the Saindhava warriors once more shot at that senseless\r\nwarrior, without loss of time, innumerable other shafts. Understanding\r\nthat the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with\r\nhearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse\r\nbenedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the\r\nregenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of\r\ngiving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence. When at last the\r\nenergy of Partha blazed forth through those acts of the denizens of\r\nHeaven, that hero, who was conversant with celestial weapons of high\r\nefficacy, stood immovable like a hill. The delighter of the Kurus then\r\ndrew his celestial bow. And as he repeatedly stretched the bowstring, the\r\ntwang that followed resembled the loud sound of some mighty machine. Like\r\nPurandara pouring rain, the puissant Arjuna then, with that bow of his,\r\npoured incessant showers of shafts on his foes. Pierced by those shafts\r\nthe Saindhava warriors with their chiefs became invisible like trees when\r\ncovered with locusts. They were frightened at the very sound of Gandiva,\r\nand afflicted by fear they fled away. In grief of heart they shed tears\r\nand uttered loud lamentations. The mighty warrior moved amidst that host\r\nof foes with the celerity of a fiery wheel, all the time piercing those\r\nwarriors with his arrows. Like the great Indra, the wielder of the\r\nthunder-bolt, that slayer of foes, viz., Arjuna, shot from his bow in\r\nevery direction that shower of arrows which resembled a sight produced by\r\nmagic (instead of any human agency). The Kaurava hero, piercing the\r\nhostile host with showers of arrows, looked resplendent like the autumnal\r\nSun when he disperses the clouds with his powerful rays.'\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'The irresistible wielder of Gandiva, addresst for\r\nbattle, stood immovable on the field like Himavat himself. The Saindhava\r\nwarriors, once more rallying, showered in great wrath repeated down-pours\r\nof shifts on him. The mighty-armed hero, laughing at his foes, who had\r\nonce more rallied but who were on the point of death, addressed them in\r\nthese soft words,--'Do ye fight to the best of your power and do ye\r\nendeavour to vanquish me. Do ye however, accomplish all necessary acts,\r\nfor a great danger awaits you all. See, I fight all of you, baffling your\r\nclouds of arrows. Bent as you are on battle, tarry a little. I shall soon\r\nquell your pride.' The wielder of Gandiva, having said these words in\r\nwrath, recollected, however, the words, O Bharata, of his eldest brother.\r\nThose words were,--'Thou shouldst not, O child, slay those Kshatriyas who\r\nwill come against thee for battle. They should, however, be vanquished by\r\nthee. That foremost of men, Phalguna, had been thus addressed by king\r\nYudhishthira the just, of great soul. He, therefore, began to reflect in\r\nthis strain. 'Even thus was I commissioned by my brother. Warriors\r\nadvancing against me should not be slain. I must act in such a way as not\r\nto falsify the words of king Yudhishthira the just.' Having arrived at\r\nthis conclusion, Phalguna, that foremost of men, then said unto those\r\nSaindhavas who were all fierce in battle, these words:--'I say what is\r\nfor your benefit. Though staying before me. I do not wish to slay you. He\r\namongst you who will say unto me that he has been vanquished by me and\r\nthat he is mine, will be spared by me. Having heard these words of mine,\r\nact towards me in that way which may best conduce to your benefit. By\r\nacting in a different way you will place yourselves in a situation of\r\ngreat fear and danger.' Having said these words unto those heroic\r\nwarriors the chief of the Kurus began to fight them. Arjuna was inflamed\r\nwith wrath. His foes, desirous of victory, were equally enraged. The\r\nSaindhavas then, O king, shot hundreds and thousands of straight arrows\r\nat the wielder of Gandiva. Dhananjaya, with his own whetted shafts, cut\r\noff those arrows of sharp and terrible points, resembling snakes of\r\nvirulent poison, before they could come up to him. Having cut off those\r\nsharp arrows equipt with Kanka feathers, Arjuna pierced each of the\r\nwarriors opposed to him with a whetted shaft. The Saindhava Kshatriyas,\r\nrecollecting that it was Dhananjaya who had slain their king Jayadratha,\r\nthen hurled at him darts and javelins with great force. The diadem-decked\r\nDhananjaya of great might baffled their intent by cutting off all those\r\nweapons before any of them could reach him. At length the son of Pandu\r\nbecame highly angry. With many straight and broad-headed arrows, he\r\nfelled the heads of many of those warriors who were rushing at him from\r\ndesire of victory. Many fled, many rushed at Arjuna; many moved not, all\r\nof them, however, uttered such aloud noise (of wrath and grief) that it\r\nresembled the roar of the ocean. As they were slain by Partha of\r\nimmeasurable might, they fought him, each according to his strength and\r\nprowess. Their animals being all exhausted, Partha succeeded in depriving\r\na large number of those warriors of their senses by means of his sharpest\r\nshafts in that battle. Then Dussala, their queen, the daughter of\r\nDhritarashtra, knowing that they were rendered cheerless by Arjuna, took\r\nher grandson in her arms and repaired to Arjuna. The child was the son of\r\nSuratha (the son of Jayadratha). The brave prince proceeded to his\r\nmaternal uncle on his car for the safety of all the Saindhava warriors.\r\nThe queen, arrived at the presence of Dhananjaya, began to weep in\r\nsorrow. The puissant Dhananjaya, seeing her, cast off his bow. Abandoning\r\nhis bow, Partha duly received his sister and enquired of her as to what\r\nhe could do for her. The queen replied unto him, saying,--'O chief of the\r\nBharatas, this child is the son of thy sister's son. He salutes thee, O\r\nPartha. Look at him, O foremost of men.' Thus addressed by her, Partha\r\nenquired after his son (Suratha), saying--'Where is he?' Dussala then\r\nanswered him, saying,--'Burning with grief on account of the slaughter of\r\nhis sire, the heroic father of this child died in great affliction of\r\nheart. Listen to me how he met with his death. 'O Dhananjaya, he had\r\nheard before that his sire Jayadratha had been slain by thee, O sinless\r\none. Exceedingly afflicted with grief at this, and hearing of thy arrival\r\nhere as the follower and protector of the sacrificial horse, he at once\r\nfell down and gave up his life-breaths. Verily, deeply afflicted with\r\ngrief as he was, as go on as he heard of thy arrival he gave up his life.\r\nSeeing him prostrate on the Earth, O lord, I took his infant son with me\r\nand have come to thee, desirous of thy protection.' Having said these\r\nwords, the daughter of Dhritarashtra began to lament in deep affliction.\r\nArjuna stood before her in great cheerlessness of heart. His face was\r\nturned towards the Earth. The cheerless sister then said unto her\r\nbrother, who was equally cheerless, these words: 'Behold thy sister.\r\nBehold the child of thy sister's son. O perpetuator of Kuru's race, O\r\nthou that art fully conversant with every duty, it behoveth thee to show\r\nmercy to this child, forgetting the Kuru prince (Duryodhana) and the\r\nwicked Jayadratha. Even as that slayer of hostile heroes, Parikshit, has\r\nbeen born of Abhimanyu, so has this mighty-armed child, my grandson,\r\nsprung from Suratha. Taking him with me, O chief of men, I have come to\r\nthee, desirous of the safety of all the warriors. Do thou listen to these\r\nwords of mine. This child of that wicked foe of thine hath now come to\r\nthee, O mighty-armed hero. It behoveth thee, therefore to show mercy to\r\nthis infant. O chastiser of foes, this infant seeks to gratify thee by\r\nbending his head. He solicits thee for peace. O mighty-armed hero, be\r\ninclined to make peace. O thou that art conversant with every duty, be\r\nthou gratified with the child whose friends and kinsmen have all been\r\nslain and who himself knows nothing of what has happened. Do not yield to\r\nwrath. Forgetting his disreputable and cruel grandfather, who offended\r\nagainst thee so highly, it behoveth thee to show thy grace towards this\r\nchild.' Recollecting queen Gandhari and king Dhritarashtra, Dhananjaya,\r\nafflicted with grief, addressed Dussala who had said so unto him, and\r\nanswered her, censuring Kshatriya practices the while. 'Fie on\r\nDuryodhana, that mean wight, covetous of kingdom and full of vanity!\r\nAlas, it was for him that all my kinsmen have been despatched by me to\r\nthe abode of Yama.' Having said so, Dhananjaya comforted his sister and\r\nbecame inclined to make peace. Cheerfully he embraced her and then\r\ndismissed her, telling her to return to her palace. Dussala bade all her\r\nwarriors desist from that great battle, and worshipping Partha, she of\r\nbeautiful face retraced her steps towards her abode. Having vanquished\r\nthose heroes, viz., the Saindhavas, thus, Dhananjaya began to follow that\r\nsteed which roved at its will. The heroic Arjuna duly followed that\r\nsacrificial horse even as the divine wielder of Pinaka had in days of\r\nyore followed the deer through the firmament.[193] The steed, at its\r\nwill, wandered through various realms one after another, enhancing the\r\nfeats of Arjuna. In course of time, O chief of men, the horse wandering\r\nat its pleasure, at last arrived within the dominions of the ruler of\r\nManipura, followed by the son of Pandu.'\""

The righteous-souled Phalguna angrily said, 'This conduct\r\nof thine is not becoming. Thou hast certainly fallen away from Kshatriya\r\nduties. I have come here as the protector of Yudhishthira's sacrificial\r\nhorse. Why, O son, wilt thou not fight me, seeing that I have come within\r\nthy dominions? Fie on thee, O thou of foolish understanding, fie on thee\r\nthat hast fallen away from Kshatriya duties! Fie on thee that would\r\nreceive me peacefully, even though I have come here for battling with\r\nthee. In thus receiving me peacefully thou actest like a woman. O thou of\r\nwretched understanding, if I had come to thee, leaving aside my arms,\r\nthen would this behaviour of thine have been fit, O worst of men.'\r\nLearning that these words were addressed by her husband, the daughter of\r\nthe Snake-king, viz., Ulupi unable to tolerate it, pierced through the\r\nEarth and came up to that spot.[195] She beheld her son standing there\r\nperfectly cheerless and with face hanging down. Indeed, the prince was\r\nrepeatedly rebuked by his sire who was desirous of battle with him, O\r\nmonarch. The daughter of the snake, with every limb possessed of beauty,\r\nviz., Ulupi, said these words consistent with righteousness and duty unto\r\nthe prince who was conversant with righteousness and duty,--'Know that I\r\nam thy mother Ulupi that am the daughter of a snake. Do thou accomplish\r\nmy behest, O son, for thou wouldst then attain to great merit. Fight thy\r\nfather, this foremost one of Kuru's race, this hero that is irresistible\r\nin battle. Without doubt, he will then be gratified with thee.' In this\r\nway was king Vabhruvahana incited against his sire by his (step) mother.\r\nAt last, endued as he was with great energy, he made up his mind, O chief\r\nof the Bharata's, to fight Dhananjaya. Putting on his armour of bright\r\ngold and his effulgent head-gear, he ascended an excellent car which had\r\nhundreds of quivers ready on it. That car was equipt with necessaries for\r\nbattle and had steeds yoked to it that were endued with the speed of the\r\nmind. It had excellent wheels and a strong Upashkara, and was adorned\r\nwith golden ornaments of every kind. Raising his standard which was\r\ndecorated most beautifully and which bore the device of a lion in gold,\r\nthe handsome prince Vabhruvahana proceeded against his sire for battle.\r\nCoining upon the sacrificial steed which was protected by Partha, the\r\nheroic prince caused it to be seized by persons well-versed in\r\nhorse-lore. Beholding the steed seized, Dhananjaya became filled with\r\njoy. Standing on the Earth, that hero began to resist the advance of his\r\nson who was on his car. The king afflicted the hero with repeated showers\r\nof shafts endued with whetted points and resembling snakes of virulent\r\npoison. The battle that took, place between sire and son was\r\nincomparable. It resembled the encounter between the deities and the\r\nAsuras of old. Each was gratified with obtaining the other for an\r\nantagonist. Then Vabhruvahana, laughing, pierced the diadem-decked\r\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\r\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\r\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\r\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\r\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\r\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\r\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\r\npraised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra\r\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O\r\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\r\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\r\n(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes\r\nshot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with\r\nhis own broad-headed shafts, cut all those arrows which were shot from\r\nGandiva and which resembled the thunder-bolt of Indra in splendour, some\r\nin twain and some into three parts. Then the standard, decked with gold\r\nand resembling a golden palmyra, on the king's car was cut off by Partha\r\nwith some excellent shafts of his. The son of Pandu, laughing, next slew\r\nthe king's steeds endued with large size and great speed. Descending from\r\nhis car, the king inflamed with rage, fought his sire on foot. Gratified\r\nwith the prowess of his son, that foremost one of the sons of Pritha,\r\nviz., the son of the wielder of the thunder-bolt, began to afflict him\r\ngreatly. The mighty Vabhruvahana, thinking that his father was no longer\r\nable to face him, again afflicted him with many shafts resembling snakes\r\nof virulent poison. From a spirit of boyishness he then vigorously\r\npierced his father in the breast with a whetted shaft equipt with\r\nexcellent wings. That shaft, O king, penetrated the body of Pandu's son\r\nand reaching his very vital caused him great pain. The delighter of the\r\nKurus, Dhananjaya, deeply pierced therewith by his son, then fell down in\r\na swoon on the Earth, O king. When that hero, that bearer of the burthens\r\nof the Kuru's fell down, the son of Chitrangada also became deprived of\r\nhis senses. The latter's swoon was due to his exertions in battle as also\r\nto his grief at seeing his sire slain. He had been pierced deeply by\r\nArjuna with clouds of arrows. He, therefore, fell down at the van of\r\nbattle embracing the Earth. Rearing that her husband had been slain and\r\nthat her son had fallen down on the Earth, Chitrangada, in great\r\nagitation of mind, repaired to the field of battle. Her heart burning\r\nwith sorrow, weeping piteously the while, and trembling all over, the\r\nmother of the ruler of Manipura saw her slain husband.\"'"

Regaining consciousness and seeing Ulupi, the\r\ndaughter of the snake chief, queen Chitrangada endued with celestial\r\nbeauty, said unto her these words, 'Behold. O Ulupi, our ever-victorious\r\nhusband slain in battle, through thee, by my son of tender years. Art\r\nthou conversant with the practices of the respectable? Art thou a wife\r\ndevoted to thy lord? It is through thy deed that thy husband is laid low,\r\nslain in battle. If Dhananjaya hath offended against thee in every\r\nrespect, do thou forgive him I solicit thee, do thou revive that hero. O\r\nrighteous lady, thou art conversant with piety. Thou art, O blessed one,\r\nknown (for thy virtues) over the three worlds. How is it that having\r\ncaused thy husband to be slain by my son, thou dost not indulge in grief?\r\nO daughter of the snake chief, I do not grieve for my slain son. I grieve\r\nfor only my husband who has received this hospitality from his son.'\r\nHaving said these words unto the queenly Ulupi, the daughter of the snake\r\nchief, the illustrious Chitrangada proceeded to where her husband lay on\r\nthe Earth and addressing him, said, 'Rise, O dear lord, thou occupiest\r\nthe foremost place in the affections of the Kuru king (Yudhishthira).\r\nHere is that steed of thine. It has been set free by me. Verily, O\r\npuissant one, this sacrificial steed of king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nshould be followed by thee. Why then dost thou lie still on the Earth? My\r\nlife-breaths depend on thee, O delighter of the Kurus. How is it that he\r\nwho is the giver of other people's life-breaths casts off his own\r\nlife-breaths today? Behold, O Ulupi, this goodly sight of thy husband\r\nlying prostrate on the ground. How is it that thou dost not grieve,\r\nhaving caused him to be slain through my son when thou didst excite with\r\nthy words? It is fit that this boy should succumb to the power of death\r\nand lie thus on the ground beside his own sire. Oh, let Vijaya, let him\r\nthat is called Gudakesa, let this hero with reddish eyes, come back O\r\nlife. O blessed lady, polygamy is not fault with men. Women only incur\r\nfault by taking more than one husband. Do not, therefore, harbour such\r\nthoughts (of vengeance).[196] This relationship was ordained by the\r\nSupreme ordainer himself. It is, besides, an eternal and unchangeable\r\none. Do thou attend to that relationship. Let thy union (with Dhananjaya)\r\nbe made true. If, having slain thy husband through my son, thou dost not\r\nrevive him today before my eyes, I shall then cast off my life-breaths.\r\nWithout doubt, O reverend lady, afflicted as I am with grief and deprived\r\nas I am of both husband and son, I shall sit here today in Praya in thy\r\nvery sight!' Having said so unto the daughter of the snake chief, who was\r\na co-wife with her to Arjuna, the princess Chaitravahini sat in Praya, O\r\nking, restraining speech.'[197]\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Ceasing to lament, the cheerless queen, taking\r\nupon her lap the feet of her husband, sat there, sighing heavily and\r\nwishing also the restoration of her son to life. King Vabhruvahana then,\r\nregaining consciousness, saw his mother seated in that guise on the field\r\nof battle. Addressing her he said, 'What can be more painful than the\r\nsight of my mother, who has been brought up in luxury, lying on the bare\r\nground beside her heroic husband stretched thereon? Alas, this slayer of\r\nall foes, this foremost of all wielders of weapons, hath been slain by me\r\nin battle, It is evident that men do not die till their hour comes.[198]\r\nOh, the heart of this princess seems to be very hard since it does not\r\nbreak even at the sight of her mighty-armed and broad-chested husband\r\nlying dead on the ground. It is evident that one does not die till one's\r\nhour comes, since neither myself, nor my mother is deprived of life (at\r\neven such a sight). Alas, alas, the golden coat of mail of this foremost\r\nhero of Kuru's race, slain by me, his son, knowingly, is lying on the\r\nground, cut off from his body. Alas, ye Brahmanas, behold my heroic sire\r\nlying prostrate on the Earth, on a hero's bed, slain by his son. What\r\nbenefit is done to this hero, slain by me in battle, by those Brahmanas\r\nwho were commissioned to attend upon this foremost one of Kuru's race\r\nengaged in following the steed? Let the Brahmanas direct what expiation\r\nshould now be undergone by me, a cruel and sinful wretch, that has slain\r\nhis own sire in battle. Having slain my own sire, I should, suffering\r\nevery kind of misery, wander over the Earth, cruel that I am, covering\r\nmyself with his skin. Give me the two halves of my sire's head to day,\r\n(so that I may wander over the Earth with them for that period), for\r\nthere is no other expiation for me that have slain my own sire. Behold, O\r\ndaughter of the foremost of snakes, thy husband slain by me. Verily, by\r\nslaying Arjuna in battle I have accomplished what is agreeable to thee. I\r\nshall today follow in the track by which my sire has gone. O blessed one,\r\nI am unable to comfort myself. Be happy today, O mother, seeing myself\r\nand the wielder of Gandiva both embrace death today. I swear to thee by\r\ntruth itself (that I shall castoff my life-breaths).' Having said these\r\nwords, the king, deeply afflicted with grief, O monarch, touched water,\r\nand exclaimed in sorrow, 'Let all creatures, mobile and immobile, listen\r\nto me. Do thou also listen to me, O mother. I say the truth, O best of\r\nall daughters of the snakes. If this best of men, Jaya, my sire, does not\r\nrise up, I shall emaciate my own body, sitting on the field of battle.\r\nHaving slain my sire, there is no rescue for me (from that dire sin).\r\nAfflicted as I am with the sin of slaying my sire, I shall without doubt\r\nhave to sink in Hell. By slaying a heroic Kshatriya one becomes cleansed\r\nby making a gift of a hundred kine. By slaying my sire, however, so dire\r\nhas been my sin that my I rescue is impossible. This Dhananjaya, the son\r\nof Pandu, was the one hero endued with mighty energy. Possessed of\r\nrighteous soul, he was the author of my being. How can I be rescued after\r\nhaving slain him? Having uttered these lamentations, the high-souled son\r\nof Dhananjaya, king Vabhruvahana, touched water and became silent, vowing\r\nto starve himself to death.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the king of Manipura, that chastiser of\r\nfoes, afflicted with grief, along with his mother, sat down to starve\r\nhimself to death, Ulupi then thought of the gem that has the virtue of\r\nreviving a dead man. The gem, the great refuge of the snakes, thus\r\nthought of, came there. The daughter of the prince of snakes taking it\r\nup, uttered these words that highly gladdened the combatants standing on\r\nthe field. 'Rise up, O son. Do not grieve. Jishnu has not been vanquished\r\nby thee. This hero is incapable of being vanquished by men as also by the\r\ndeities with Vasava himself at their head I have exhibited this illusion,\r\ndeceiving your senses, for the benefit of this foremost of men, viz., thy\r\nillustrious sire. O thou of Kuru's race, desirous of ascertaining the\r\nprowess of thyself, his son, this slayer of hostile heroes, O king, came\r\nhere for battling with thee. It was for that reason, O son, that thou\r\nwert urged by me to do battle. O puissant king, O son, do not suspect\r\nthat thou hast committed any, even the least, fault, by accepting his\r\nchallenge. He is a Rishi, of a mighty soul, eternal and indestructible. O\r\ndear son, Sakra himself is incapable of vanquishing him in battle. This\r\ncelestial gem has been brought by me, O king. It always revives the\r\nsnakes as often as they die. O puissant king, do thou place this gem on\r\nthe breast of thy sire. Thou shalt then see the son of Pandu revived.'\r\nThus addressed, the prince who had committed no sin, moved by affection\r\nfor his sire, then placed that gem on the breast of Pritha's son of\r\nimmeasurable energy. After the gem had been placed on his breast; the\r\nheroic and puissant Jishnu became revived. Opening his red eyes he rose\r\nup like one who had slept long. Beholding his sire, the high-souled hero\r\nof great energy, restored to consciousness and quite at his ease,\r\nVabhruvahana worshipped him with reverence. When that tiger among men, O\r\npuissant one, awoke from the slumber of death with every auspicious sign\r\nof life, the chastiser of Paka rained down celestial flowers.\r\nKettle-drums struck by nobody, produced their music deep as the roar of\r\nthe cloud. A loud uproar was heard in the welkin consisting of the\r\nwords--Excellent, Excellent! The mighty-armed Dhananjaya, rising up and\r\nwell-comforted, embraced Vabhruvahana and smelled his head. He saw\r\nsitting at a distance from his son, this latter's mother afflicted with\r\ngrief, in the company of Ulupi. Dhananjaya asked,--'Why is it that every\r\nthing in the field of battle seems to bear the indications of grief,\r\nwonder, and joy? If, O slayer of foes, the cause is known to thee, do\r\nthou then tell me. Why has thy mother come to the field of battle? Why\r\nalso has Ulupi, the daughter of the prince of snakes, come here? I know\r\nthat thou hadst fought this battle with me at my own command. I desire to\r\nknow what the cause is that has brought out the ladies.' The intelligent\r\nruler of Manipura, thug questioned by Dhananjaya, gratified him by\r\nbending his head in reverence, and then said,--'Let Ulupi be questioned.'"

Unto him, the daughter of the prince of snakes answered\r\nsmilingly, 'Thou hast not offended me, nor has Vabhruvahana done me any\r\nwrong; nor this prince's mother who is always obedient to me as a\r\nhand-maid. Listen, how all this has been brought about by me. Thou\r\nshouldst not be angry with me. Indeed, I seek to gratify thee by bending\r\nmy head in reverence. O thou of Kuru's race, all this has been done by me\r\nfor thy good, O puissant one. O mighty-armed Dhananjaya, hear all that I\r\nhave done. In the great battle of the Bharata princes, thou hadst slain\r\nthe royal son of Santanu by unrighteous ways. What I have done has\r\nexpiated thy sin. Thou didst not overthrow Bhishma while battling with\r\nthee. He was engaged with Sikhandin. Relying on him as thy help, thou\r\ndidst compass the overthrow of Santanu's son. If thou hadst died without\r\nhaving expiated thy sin, thou wouldst then have fallen without doubt into\r\nHell in consequence of that sinful act of thine. Even this which thou\r\nhast got from thy son is the expiation of that sin. Formerly, O ruler of\r\nEarth, I heard this said by the Vasus while they were in the company of\r\nGanga, O thou of great intelligence. After the fall of Santanu's son,\r\nthose deities, viz., the Vasus, coming to the banks of Ganga, bathed in\r\nher waters, and calling the goddess of that stream, they uttered these\r\nterrible words having the sanction of Bhagirathi herself,\r\nviz.,--Santanu's son Bhishma has been slain by Dhananjaya. Verily, O\r\ngoddess, Bhishma then was engaged with another, and had ceased to fight.\r\nFor this fault we shall today denounce a curse on Dhananjaya.--To this,\r\nthe goddess Ganga readily assented, saying,--Be it so!--Hearing these\r\nwords I became very much afflicted and penetrating into the nether\r\nregions represented everything to my sire. Informed of what had happened,\r\nmy sire became plunged in grief. Repairing to the Vasus, he solicited\r\nthem for thy sake, repeatedly gratifying them by every means in his\r\npower. They then said unto him, 'Dhananjaya has a highly blessed son who,\r\nendued with youth, is the ruler of Manipura. He will, standing on the\r\nfield of battle, cast Dhananjaya down on the Earth. When this will\r\nhappen, O prince of snakes, Arjuna will be freed from our curse. Do thou\r\ngo back.--Thus addressed by the Vasus, he came back and informed me of\r\nwhat had happened. Having learnt all this, O hero, I have freed thee from\r\nthe curse of the Vasus even in this way. The chief of the deities himself\r\nis incapable of vanquishing thee in battle. The son is one's own self. It\r\nis for this that thou hast been vanquished by him. I cannot be held, O\r\npuissant one, to have committed any fault. How, indeed, wouldst thou hold\r\nme censurable?'--Thus addressed (by Ulupi), Vijaya became cheerful of\r\nheart and said unto her, 'All this that thou hast done, O goddess, is\r\nhighly agreeable to me.' After this, Jaya addressed his son, the ruler of\r\nManipura, and said unto him in the hearing of Chitrangada, the daughter\r\n(-in-law) of Kuru's house, the Horse-sacrifice of Yudhishthira will take\r\nplace on the day of full moon in the coming month of Chaitra. Come there,\r\nO king, with thy mother and thy counsellors and officers.' Thus addressed\r\nby Partha, king Vabhruvahana of great intelligence, with tearful eyes,\r\nsaid these words to his sire, 'O thou that art conversant with every\r\nduty, I shall certainly repair, at thy command, to the great\r\nHorse-sacrifice, and take upon myself the task of distributing food among\r\nthe regenerate ones. For, however, showing thy grace towards me, thou\r\nenter thy own city with thy two wives. Let no scruple, be thine as\r\nregards this, O thou that art fully acquainted with every duty. O lord,\r\nhaving lived for one night in thy own mansion in happiness, thou mayst\r\nthen follow the steed, O foremost of victorious warriors. The\r\nape-bannered son of Kunti, thus addressed by his son, answered the child\r\nof Chitrangada, saying 'Thou knowest, O mighty-armed one, what vow I am\r\nobserving. O thou of large eyes, till the termination of this my vow, I\r\ncannot enter thy city. O foremost of men, this sacrificial horse wanders\r\nat will. (I have to follow it always.) Blessings on thee! I must go away.\r\nPlace I have none wherein to rest for even a short while.' The son of the\r\nchastiser of Paka then, duly worshipped by his son and obtaining the\r\npermission of his two wives, left the spot and proceeded on his way.'\""

Following as he did that horse, the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna also turned his face towards the Kuru capital.\r\nWandering at his will, the steed then came to the city of Rajagriha.\r\nBeholding him arrived within his dominion, O monarch, the heroic son of\r\nSahadeva, observant of Kshatriya duties, challenged him to battle. Coming\r\nout of his city, Meghasandhi, mounted on his car and equipt with bow and\r\narrows and leathern fence, rushed towards Dhananjaya who was on foot.\r\nPossessed of great energy, Meghasandhi approaching Dhananjaya, O king,\r\nsaid these words from a spirit of childishness and without any skill.\r\n'This steed of thine, O Bharata, seems to move about, protected by women\r\nonly. I shall take away the horse. Do thou strive to free him. Although\r\nmy sires did not teach thee in battle, I, however, shall do the duties of\r\nhospitality to you. Do thou strike me, for I shall strike thee.' Thus\r\naddressed, the son of Pandu, smiling the while, answered him, saying, 'To\r\nresist him who obstructs me is the vow cast on me by my eldest brother.\r\nWithout doubt, O king, this is known to thee. Do thou strike me to the\r\nbest of thy power. I have no anger.' Thus addressed, the ruler of Magadha\r\nfirst struck the son of Pandu, showering his arrows on him like the\r\nthousand-eyed Indra showering heavy downpour of rain. Then, O chief of\r\nBharata's race, the heroic wielder of Gandiva, with shafts sped from his\r\nexcellent bow, baffled all the arrows shot carefully at him by his\r\nantagonist. Having thus baffled that cloud of arrows, the ape-bannered\r\nhero sped a number of blazing arrows at his foe that resembled snakes\r\nwith fiery mouths. These arrows he shot at his flag and flag-staff and\r\ncar and poles and yoke and the horses, sparing the body of his foe and\r\nhis car-driver. Though Partha who was capable of shooting the bow with\r\nthe left hand (as well as with the right) spared the body of the prince\r\nof Magadha, yet the latter thinking that his body was protected by his\r\nown prowess, shot many arrows at Partha. The wielder of Gandiva, deeply\r\nstruck by the prince of Magadha, shone like a flowering Palasa (Butea\r\nfrondosa) in the season of spring. Arjuna had no desire of slaying the\r\nprince of Magadha. It was for this that, having struck the son of Pandu,\r\nhe succeeded in remaining before that foremost of heroes. Then\r\nDhananjaya, becoming angry, drew his bow with great force, and slew his\r\nantagonist's steeds and then struck off the head of his car-driver. With\r\na razor-headed shaft he then cut off Meghasandhi's large and beautiful\r\nbow, and then his leathern fence. Then cutting off his flag and\r\nflag-staff, he caused it to fall down. The prince of Magadha, exceedingly\r\nafflicted, and deprived of his steeds and bow and driver, took up a mace\r\nand rushed with great speed at the son of Kunti. Arjuna then with many\r\nshafts of his equipt with vulturine feathers cut off into fragments, that\r\nmace of his advancing foe which was adorned with bright gold. Thus cut\r\noff into fragments, that mace with its begemmed bonds and knots all\r\nsevered, fell on the Earth like a she-snake helplessly hurled down by\r\nsomebody. When his foe became deprived of his car, his bow, and his mace,\r\nthat foremost of warriors, viz., the intelligent Arjuna, did not wish to\r\nstrike him. The ape-bannered hero then, comforting his cheerless foe who\r\nhad been observant of Kshatriya duties, said unto him these words, 'O\r\nson, thou hast sufficiently displayed thy adherence to Kshatriya duties.\r\nGo now. Great have been the feats, O king, which thou hast accomplished\r\nin battle although thou art very young in years. The command I received\r\nfrom Yudhishthira was that kings who oppose me should not be slain. It is\r\nfor this thou livest yet, O monarch, although thou hast offended me in\r\nbattle. Thus addressed, the ruler of Magadha considered himself\r\nvanquished and spared. Thinking then that it was his duty to do so, he\r\napproached Arjuna and joining his hands in reverence worshipped him. And\r\nhe said, 'Vanquished have I been by thee. Blessed be thou, I do not\r\nventure to continue the battle. Tell me what I am to do now for thee.\r\nRegard thy behest as already accomplished. Comforting him again, Arjuna\r\nonce more said unto him, 'Thou shouldst repair to the Horse-sacrifice of\r\nour king which takes place at the coming full moon of Chaitra.' Thus\r\naddressed by him, the son of Sahadeva said, 'So be it,'--and then duly\r\nworshipped that horse as also Phalguna, that foremost of warriors. The\r\nsacrificial horse then, equipt with beautiful manes, proceeded at his\r\nwill along the sea-coast, repairing to the countries of the Bangas, the\r\nPundras, and the Kosalas. In those realms Dhananjaya, with his bow\r\nGandiva, O king, vanquished innumerable Mlechecha armies one after\r\nanother.'\""

Turning round in course of his\r\nwanderings at will, the mighty steed came upon the beautiful city of the\r\nChedis called after the oyster.[199] Sarabha, the son of Sisupala, endued\r\nwith great strength, first encountered Arjuna in battle and then\r\nworshipped him with due honours. Worshipped by him, O king, that best of\r\nsteeds then proceeded to the realms of the Kasis, the Angas, the Kosalas,\r\nthe Kiratas, and the Tanganas. Receiving due honours in all those realms,\r\nDhananjaya turned his course. Indeed, the son of Kunti then proceeded to\r\nthe country of the Dasarnas. The ruler of that people was Chitrangada who\r\nwas endued with great strength and was a crusher of foes. Between him and\r\nVijaya occurred a battle exceedingly terrible. Bringing him under his\r\nsway the diadem-decked Arjuna, that foremost of men, proceeded to the\r\ndominions of the Nishada king, viz., the son of Ekalavya. The soon of\r\nEkalavya received Arjuna in battle. The encounter that took place between\r\nthe Kuru hero and the Nishadas was so furious as to make the hair stand\r\non end. Unvanquished in battle, the valiant son of Kunti defeated the\r\nNishada king who proved an obstacle to the sacrifice. Having subjugated\r\nthe son of Ekalavya, O king, the son of Indra, duly worshipped by the\r\nNishadas, then proceeded towards the southern ocean. In those regions\r\nbattle took place between the diadem-decked hero and the Dravidas and\r\nAndhras and the fierce Mahishakas and the hillmen of Kolwa. Subjugating\r\nthose tribes without having to accomplish any fierce feats, Arjuna\r\nproceeded to the country of the Surashtras, his footsteps guided by the\r\nhorse. Arrived at Gokarna, he repaired thence to Prabhasa. Next he\r\nproceeded to the beautiful city of Dwaravati protected by the heroes of\r\nthe Vrishni race. When the beautiful sacrificial horse of the Kuru king\r\nreached Dwaravati, the Yadava youths, used force against that foremost of\r\nsteeds. King Ugrasena, however, soon went out and forbade those youths\r\nfrom doing what they meditated. Then the ruler of the Vrishnis and the\r\nAndhakas, issuing out of his palace, with Vasudeva, the maternal uncle of\r\nArjuna, in his company, cheerfully met the Kuru hero and received him\r\nwith due rites. The two elderly chiefs honoured Arjuna duly. Obtaining\r\ntheir permission, the Kuru prince then proceeded to where the horse he\r\nfollowed, led him. The sacrificial steed then proceeded along the coast\r\nof the western ocean and at last reached the country of the five waters\r\nwhich swelled with population and prosperity. Thence, O king, the steed\r\nproceeded to the country of Gandharas. Arrived there, it wandered at\r\nwill, followed by the son of Kunti.

Unable to bear and, therefore, burning to avenge, the slaughter\r\nof their king Sakuni, those warriors, armed with bows, rushed together at\r\nPartha. The unvanquished Vibhatsu of righteous soul addressed them\r\npeacefully, but they were unwilling to accept the beneficial words of\r\nYudhishthira (through Arjuna). Though forbidden by Partha with sweet\r\nwords, they still gave themselves up to wrath and surrounded the\r\nsacrificial steed. At this, the son of Pandu became filled with wrath.\r\nThen Arjuna, carelessly shooting from Gandiva many shafts with razor-like\r\nheads that blazed with splendour, cut off the heads of many Gandhara\r\nwarriors. While thus slaughtered by Partha, the Gandharas, O king,\r\nexceedingly afflicted, set free the horse, moved by fear and desisted\r\nfrom battle. Resisted, however, by those Gandhara combatants who still\r\nsurrounded him on every side, the son of Pandu, possessed of great\r\nenergy, felled the heads of many, previously naming those whom he thus\r\ndespatched. When the Gandhara warriors were thus being slain all around\r\nhim in battle, the royal son of Sakuni came forward to resist the son of\r\nPandu. Unto the Gandhara king who was fighting with him, impelled by\r\nKshatriya duty, Arjuna said, 'I do not intend to slay the kings who fight\r\nwith me, in consequence of the commands of Yudhishthira. Cease, O hero,\r\nto fight with me. Do not court defeat.' Thus addressed the son of Sakuni,\r\nstupefied by folly, disregarded that advice and covered with many swift\r\narrows the Kuru hero who resembled Sakra himself in the feats he\r\naccomplished in battle. Then Partha, with a crescent-shaped arrow, cut\r\noff the head-gear of his foe. Of immeasurable soul, he also caused that\r\nhead-gear to be borne along a great distance like the head of Jayadratha\r\n(after he had cut it off in the battle of Kurukshetra). Beholding this\r\nfeat, all the Gandhara warriors became filled with wonder. That Arjuna\r\nvoluntarily spared their king was well understood by them. The prince of\r\nthe Gandharas then began to fly away from the field, accompanied by all\r\nhis warriors who resembled a flock of frightened deer. The Gandharas,\r\nthrough fear, lost their senses and wandered over the field, unable to\r\nescape. Arjuna, with his broad-headed shafts, cut off the heads of many.\r\nMany there were who lost their arms in consequence of Arjuna's arrows,\r\nbut so stupefied were they with fear that they were not aware of the loss\r\nof that limb. Verity, the Gandhara army was exceedingly afflicted with\r\nthose large shafts which Partha sped from Gandiva. That army, which then\r\nconsisted of frightened men and elephants and horses, which lost many\r\nwarriors and animals, and which had been reduced to a rabble and put to\r\nrout, began to wander and wheel about the field repeatedly. Among those\r\nfoes who were thus being slaughtered none could be seen standing in front\r\nof the Kuru hero famed for foremost of feats. No one could be seen who\r\nwas able to bear the prowess of Dhananjaya. Then the mother of the ruler\r\nof the Gandharas, filled with fear, and with all the aged ministers of\r\nstate, came out of her city, bearing an excellent Arghya for Arjuna. She\r\nforbade her brave son of steady heart from fighting any longer, and\r\ngratified Jishnu who was never fatigued with toil. The puissant Vibhatsu\r\nworshipped her and became inclined to show kindness towards the\r\nGandharas. Comforting the son of Sakuni, he said, 'Thou hast not, O\r\nmighty-armed hero, done what is agreeable to me by getting thy heart upon\r\nthese measures of hostility. O slayer of heroes, thou art my brother, O\r\nsinless one.[201] Recollecting my mother Gandhari, and for the sake of\r\nDhritarashtra also, I have not taken thy life. It is for this, O king,\r\nthat thou livest still. Many of thy followers, however, have been slain\r\nby me. Let not such a thing happen again. Let hostilities cease. Let not\r\nthy understanding again go astray. Thou shouldst go to the\r\nHorse-sacrifice of our king which comes off on the day of full moon of\r\nthe month of Chaitra.'"

And hearing also that Arjuna was hale and hearty, he became\r\nfilled with joy.[202] Hearing also the feats, accomplished by Vijaya in\r\nthe country of the Gandharas as also in another realms, the king became\r\nexceedingly glad. Meanwhile, king Yudhishthira the just, seeing that the\r\ntwelfth day of the lighted fortnight in the month of Magha had come, and\r\nnoticing also that the constellation was favourable, summoned all his\r\nbrothers, viz., Bhima and Nakula and Sahadeva. Endued with great energy,\r\nthe king, O thou of Kuru's race, that foremost of all persons conversant\r\nwith duties, said these words in proper time. Indeed, that foremost of\r\nall speakers, addressing Bhima, the first of all smiters, said;--'Thy\r\nyounger brother (Arjuna), O Bhimasena, is coming back with the horse. I\r\nhave learnt this from those men who had followed Arjuna. The time (for\r\nthe sacrifice) is come. The sacrificial horse is near. The day of full\r\nmoon of the month of Magha is at hand. The month is about to expire, O\r\nVrikodara. Let, therefore, learned Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas\r\nlook for a sacrificial spot for the successful accomplishment of the\r\nHorse-sacrifice.' Thus addressed, Bhima obeyed the royal behest. He\r\nbecame very glad upon hearing that Arjuna of curly hair was about to come\r\nback. Then Bhima went out with a number of men well conversant with the\r\nrules of laying out sacrificial grounds and constructing buildings. And\r\nhe took with him many Brahmanas well-versed in all the rites of\r\nsacrifices. Bhima selected a beautiful spot and caused it to be duly\r\nmeasured out for laying the sacrificial compound. Numerous houses and\r\nmansions were constructed on it and high and broad roads also were laid\r\nout. Soon enough the Kaurava hero caused that ground to teem with\r\nhundreds of excellent mansions. The surface was levelled and made smooth\r\nwith jewels and gems, and adorned with diverse structures made of gold.\r\nColumns were raised, ornamented with bright gold, and high and wide\r\ntriumphal arches also were constructed on that sacrificial compound. All\r\nthese were made of pure gold. The righteous-souled prince also caused\r\napartments to be duly constructed for the accommodation of ladies and of\r\nthe numerous kings who, hailing from many realms, were expected to grace\r\nthe sacrifice with their presence. The son of Kunti also caused many\r\nmansions to be duly erected for Brahmanas who were expected to come from\r\ndiverse realms. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, at the command of the\r\nking, sent out messengers to the great kings of the Earth. Those best of\r\nkings, came to the Horse-sacrifice of the Kuru monarch for doing what was\r\nagreeable to him. And they brought many gems with them and many female\r\nslaves and horses and weapons. The sounds that arose from those\r\nhigh-souled kings who resided within those pavilions touched the very\r\nheavens and resembled the noise made by the roaring ocean. King\r\nYudhishthira, the delighter of the Kurus, assigned unto the monarchs who\r\nthus came to his sacrifice diverse kinds of food and drink, and beds also\r\nof celestial beauty. The chief of the Bharatas, viz., king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, assigned several stables well filled with different kinds of\r\ncorn and sugarcane and milk to the animals (that came with the guests).\r\nTo that great sacrifice of king Yudhishthira the just who was possessed\r\nof high intelligence, there also came a large number of Munis all of whom\r\nwere utterers of Brahman. Indeed, O lord of Earth, all the foremost ones\r\namong the regenerate class that were then alive, came to that sacrifice,\r\naccompanied by their disciples. The Kuru king received them all. King\r\nYudhishthira of mighty energy, casting off all pride, himself followed\r\nall his guests to the pavilions that had been assigned for their\r\nresidence. Then all the mechanics and engineers, having completed the\r\narrangements of the sacrifice informed king Yudhishthira of it. Hearing\r\nthat everything was ready, king Yudhishthira the just, full of alertness\r\nand attention, became highly glad along with his brothers all of whom\r\nhonoured him duly.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the great sacrifice of Yudhishthira\r\ncommenced, many eloquent dialecticians started diverse propositions and\r\ndisputed thereon, desirous of vanquishing one another.[203] The (invited)\r\nkings beheld the excellent preparations of that sacrifice, resembling\r\nthose of the chief himself of the deities, made, O Bharata, by Bhimasena.\r\nThey beheld many triumphal arches made of gold, and many beds and seats\r\nand other articles of enjoyment and luxury, and crowds of men collected\r\nat different sports. There were also many jars and vessels and cauldrons\r\nand jugs and lids and covers. The invited kings saw nothing there that\r\nwas not made of gold. Many sacrificial stakes also were set up, made,\r\naccording to the directions of the scriptures of wood, and adorned with\r\ngold. Endued with great effulgence, these were duly planted and dedicated\r\n(with scriptural Mantras). The king saw all animals, again, which belong\r\nto land and all those which belong to water, collected there on the\r\noccasion. And they also beheld many kine and many buffaloes and many old\r\nwomen, and many aquatic animals, many beasts of prey and many species of\r\nbirds, and many specimens of viviparous and oviparous creatures, and many\r\nthat are filth-born, and many belonging to the vegetable kingdom, and\r\nmany animals and plants that live or grow on mountains. Beholding the\r\nsacrificial compound thus adorned with animals and kine and corn, the\r\ninvited kings became filled with wonder. Large heaps of costly\r\nsweet-meats were kept ready for both the Brahmanas and the Vaisyas. And\r\nwhen the feeding was over of a hundred thousand Brahmanas, drums and\r\ncymbals were beat. And so large was the number fed that the sounds of\r\ndrums and cymbals were repeatedly heard, indeed, from day to day those\r\nsounds continued. Thus was performed that sacrifice of king Yudhishthira\r\nof great intelligence. Many hills of food, O king, were dedicated on the\r\noccasion. Many large tanks were seen of curds and many lakes of ghee. In\r\nthat great sacrifice, O monarch, was seen the entire population of\r\nJamvudwipa, with all its realms and provinces, collected together.\r\nThousands of nations and races were there. A large number of men, O chief\r\nof Bharata's race, adorned with garlands and wearing bright ear-rings\r\nmade of gold, taking innumerable vessels in their hands, distributed the\r\nfood unto the regenerate classes by hundreds and thousands. The\r\nattendants of the Pandavas gave away unto the Brahmanas diverge kinds of\r\nfood and drink which were, besides, so costly as to be worthy of being\r\neaten and drunk by kings themselves.'\""

On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\r\nking's eyes. Large gifts were made to the messenger for the very\r\nagreeable tidings he had brought. On the second day from that date, a\r\nloud din was heard when that foremost of men, that chief of the Kurus,\r\ncame. The dust raised by the hoofs of that horse as it walked in close\r\nadjacence to Arjuna, looked as beautiful as that raised by the celestial\r\nsteed Uchchaisravas. And as Arjuna advanced he heard many gladdening\r\nwords uttered by the citizens. 'By good luck, O Partha, thou art out of\r\ndanger. Praise to you and king Yudhishthira! Who else than Arjuna could\r\ncome back after having caused the horse to wander over the whole Earth\r\nand after having vanquished all the kings in battle? We have not heard of\r\nsuch a feat having been achieved by even Sagara and other high-souled\r\nkings of antiquity. Future kings also will never be able to accomplish so\r\ndifficult a feat, O foremost one of Kuru's race, as this which thou hast\r\nachieved.' Listening to such words, agreeable to the ear, of the\r\ncitizens, the righteous-souled Phalguna entered the sacrificial compound.\r\nThen king Yudhishthira with all his ministers, and Krishna, the delighter\r\nof the Yadus, placing Dhritarashtra in their van, went out for receiving\r\nDhananjaya. Saluting the feet of his sire (Dhritarashtra), and then of\r\nking Yudhishthira the just of great wisdom, and then worshipping Bhima\r\nand others, he embraced Kesava. Worshipped by them all and worshipping\r\nthem in return according to due rites, the mighty-armed hero, accompanied\r\nby those princes, took rest like a ship-wrecked man tossed on the waves\r\nresting on reaching the shore. Meanwhile king Vabhruvahan of great\r\nwisdom, accompanied by his mothers (Chitrangada and Ulupi), came to the\r\nKuru capital. The mighty-armed prince duly saluted all his seniors of\r\nKuru's race and the other kings present there, and was honoured by them\r\nall in return. He then entered the excellent abode of his grand-mother\r\nKunti.\"'"

Then queen\r\nChitrangada, and (Ulupi) the daughter of (the snake) Kauravya, together\r\napproached Partha and Krishna with humility. They then met Subhadra and\r\nthe other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them\r\nmany gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies\r\nof Kuru's race all made presents to them. The two ladies took up their\r\nresidence there, using costly beds and seats, treated with affection and\r\nrespect by Kunti herself from desire of doing what was agreeable to\r\nPartha. King Vabhruvahana of great energy, duly honoured (by Kunti), then\r\nmet Dhritarashtra according to due rites. Repairing then to king\r\nYudhishthira and Bhima and the other Pandavas, the mighty prince of\r\nManipura saluted them all with humility. They all embraced him with great\r\naffection and honoured him duly. And those mighty car-warriors highly\r\ngratified with him, made large gifts of wealth unto him. The king of\r\nManipura then humbly approached Krishna, that hero armed with the discus\r\nand the mace, like a second Pradyumna approaching his sire. Krishna gave\r\nunto the king a very costly and excellent car adorned with gold and unto\r\nwhich were yoked excellent steeds. Then king Yudhishthira the just, and\r\nBhima, and Phalguna, and the twins, each separately honoured him and made\r\ncostly presents unto him. On the third day, the sage Vyasa, the son of\r\nSatyavati, that foremost of eloquent men, approaching Yudhishthira\r\nsaid,--'From this day, O son of Kunti, do thou begin thy sacrifice. The\r\ntime for it has come. The moment for commencing the rite is at hand. The\r\npriests are urging thee. Let the sacrifice be performed in such a way\r\nthat no limb may become defective. In consequence of the very large\r\nquantity of gold that is required for this sacrifice, it has come to be\r\ncalled the sacrifice of profuse gold. Do thou also, O great king, make\r\nthe Dakshina of this sacrifice three times of what is enjoined. Let the\r\nmerit of thy sacrifice increase threefold. The Brahmanas are competent\r\nfor the purpose.[205] Attaining to the merits then of three\r\nHorse-sacrifices, each with profuse presents, thou shalt be freed, O\r\nking, from the sin of having slain thy kinsmen. The bath that one\r\nperforms upon completion of the Horse-sacrifice, O monarch, is highly\r\ncleansing and productive of the highest merit. That merit will be thine,\r\nO king of Kuru's race. Thus addressed by Vyasa of immeasurable\r\nintelligence, the righteous-souled Yudhishthira of great energy underwent\r\nthe Diksha for performance of the Horse-sacrifice.[206] The mighty-armed\r\nmonarch then performed the great Horse-sacrifice characterised by gifts\r\nof food and presents in profusion and capable of fructifying every wish\r\nand producing every merit. The priests, well conversant with the Vedas,\r\ndid every rite duly, moving about in all directions. They were all\r\nwell-trained, and possessed of omniscience. In nothing was there a\r\nswerving from the ordinances and nothing was down improperly. Those\r\nforemost of regenerate persons followed the procedure as laid down (in\r\nthe scriptures) and as it should be followed in those points about which\r\nno directions are given.[207] Those best of regenerate ones, having first\r\nperformed the rite called Pravargya, otherwise called Dharma, then duly\r\nwent through the rite of Abhishava, O king.[208] Those foremost of\r\nSoma-drinkers, O monarch, extracting the juice of the Soma, then\r\nperformed the Savana rite following the injunctions of the scriptures.\r\nAmong those that came to that sacrifice none could be seen who was\r\ncheerless, none who was poor, none who was hungry, none who was plunged\r\ninto grief, and none that seemed to be vulgar. Bhimasena of mighty energy\r\nat the command of the king, caused food to be ceaselessly distributed\r\namong those that desired to eat. Following the injunctions of the\r\nscriptures, priests, well-versed in sacrificial rites of every kind,\r\nperformed every day all the acts necessary to complete the great\r\nsacrifice. Amongst the Sadasayas of king Yudhishthira of great\r\nintelligence there was none who was not well conversant with the six\r\nbranches of (Vedic). learning. There was none among them that was not an\r\nobserver of vows, none that was not an Upadhyaya; none that was not well\r\nversed in dialectical disputations. When the time came for erecting the\r\nsacrificial stake, O chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that\r\nwere made of Vilwa,[209] six that were made of Khadira, and six that were\r\nmade of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by the priests that were made\r\nof Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru king, and one that was made of\r\nSleshmataka. At the command of the king, Bhima caused some other stakes\r\nto be set up, for the sake of beauty only, that were made of gold.\r\nAdorned with fine cloths supplied by the royal sage, those stakes shone\r\nthere like Indra and the deities with the seven celestial Rishis standing\r\naround them in Heaven. A number of golden bricks were made for\r\nconstructing therewith a Chayana. The Chayana made resembled in beauty\r\nthat which had been made for Daksha, the lord of creatures (on the\r\noccasion of his great sacrifice). The Chayana measured eight and ten\r\ncubits and four stories or lairs. A golden bird, of the shape of Garuda,\r\nwas then made, having three angles.[210] Following the injunctions of the\r\nscriptures, the priests possessed of great learning then duly tied to the\r\nstakes both animals and birds, assigning each to its particular\r\ndeity.[211] Bulls, possessed of such qualifications as are mentioned in\r\nthe scriptures, and aquatic animals were properly tied to the stakes\r\nafter the rites relating to the sacrificial fire had been performed. In\r\nthat sacrifice of the high-souled son of Kunti, three hundred animals\r\nwere tied to the stakes setup, including that foremost of steeds. That\r\nsacrifice looked exceedingly beautiful as if adorned with the celestial\r\nRishis, with the Gandharvas singing in chorus and the diverse tribes of\r\nApsaras dancing in merriment. It teemed, besides, with Kimpurushas and\r\nwas adorned with Kinnaras. All around it were abodes of Brahmanas crowned\r\nwith ascetic success. There were daily seen the disciples of Vyasa, those\r\nforemost of regenerate ones, who are compilers of all branches of\r\nlearning, and well conversant with sacrificial rites. There was Narada,\r\nand there was Tumvuru of great splendour. There were Viswavasu and\r\nChitrasena and others, all of whom were proficient in music. At intervals\r\nof the sacrificial rites, those Gandharvas, skilled in music and well\r\nversed in dancing, used to gladden the Brahmanas who were engaged in the\r\nsacrifice.'\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'Having cooked, according to due rites, the other\r\nexcellent animals that were sacrificed, the priests then sacrificed,\r\nagreeably to the injunctions of the scriptures, that steed (which had\r\nwandered over the whole world). After cutting that horse into pieces,\r\nconformably to scriptural directions, they caused Draupadi of great\r\nintelligence, who was possessed of the three requisites of mantras,\r\nthings, and devotion, to sit near the divided animal. The Brahmanas then\r\nwith cool minds, taking up the marrow of that steed, cooked it duly, O\r\nchief of Bharata's race. King Yudhishthira the just, with all his younger\r\nbrothers, then smelled, agreeably to the scriptures, the smoke, capable\r\nof cleansing one from every sin, of the marrow that was thus cooked. The\r\nremaining limbs, O king, of that horse, were poured into the fire by the\r\nsixteen sacrificial priests possessed of great wisdom. Having thus\r\ncompleted the sacrifice of that monarch, who was endued with the energy\r\nof Sakra himself, the illustrious Vyasa with his disciples eulogised the\r\nking greatly. Then Yudhishthira gave away unto the Brahmanas a thousand\r\ncrores of golden nishkas, and unto Vyasa he gave away the whole Earth.\r\nSatyavati's son Vyasa, having accepted the Earth, addressed that foremost\r\none of Bharata's race, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, and said, 'O\r\nbest of kings, the Earth which thou hast given me I return unto thee. Do\r\nthou give me the purchasing value, for Brahmanas are desirous of wealth\r\n(and have no use with the Earth).' The high-souled Yudhishthira of great\r\nintelligence staying with his brothers in the midst of the kings invited\r\nto his sacrifice, said unto those Brahmanas, The 'Dakshina ordained in\r\nthe scriptures for the great Horse-sacrifice is the Earth. Hence, I have\r\ngiven away unto the sacrificial priests the Earth conquered by Arjuna. Ye\r\nforemost of Brahmanas, I shall enter the woods. Do ye divide the Earth\r\namong yourselves. Indeed, do you divide the Earth into four parts\r\naccording to what is done in the Chaturhotra sacrifice. Ye best of\r\nregenerate ones I do not desire to appropriate what now belongs to the\r\nBrahmanas. Even this, ye learned Brahmanas, has been the intention always\r\ncherished by myself and my brothers.' When the king said these words, his\r\nbrothers and Draupadi also said, 'Yes, it is even so.' Great was the\r\nsensation created by this announcement. Then, O Bharata, an invisible\r\nvoice was heard in the welkin, saying,--'Excellent, Excellent!' The\r\nmurmurs also of crowds of Brahmanas as they spoke arose. The Island-born\r\nKrishna, highly applauding him, once more addressed Yudhishthira, in the\r\npresence of the Brahmanas, saying, 'The Earth has been given by thee to\r\nme. I, however, give her back to thee. Do thou give unto these Brahmanas\r\ngold. Let the Earth be thine.' Then Vasudeva, addressing king\r\nYudhishthira the just, said, 'It behoveth thee to do as thou art bid by\r\nthe illustrious Vyasa.' Thus addressed, the foremost one of Kuru's race,\r\nalong with all his brothers, became glad of soul, and gave away millions\r\nof golden coins, in fact, trebling the Dakshina ordained for the\r\nHorse-sacrifice. No other king will be able to accomplish what the Kuru\r\nking accomplished on that occasion after the manner of Marutta. Accepting\r\nthat wealth, the Island-born sage, Krishna, of great learning, gave it\r\nunto the sacrificial priests, dividing it into four parts. Having paid\r\nthat wealth as the price of the Earth, Yudhishthira, cleansed of his sins\r\nand assured of Heaven rejoiced with his brothers. The sacrificial\r\npriests, having got that unlimited quantity of wealth, distributed it\r\namong the Brahmanas gladly and according to the desire of each recipient.\r\nThe Brahmanas also divided amongst themselves, agreeably to\r\nYudhishthira's permission, the diverse ornaments of gold that were in the\r\nsacrificial compound, including the triumphal arches, the stakes, the\r\njars, and diverse kinds of vessels. After the Brahmanas had taken as much\r\nas they desired, the wealth that remained was taken away by Kshatriyas\r\nand Vaisyas and Sudras and diverse tribes of Mlechechas. Thus gratified\r\nwith presents by king Yudhishthira of great intelligence, the Brahmanas,\r\nfilled with joy, returned to their respective abodes. The holy and\r\nillustrious Vyasa respectfully presented his own share, which was very\r\nlarge, of that gold unto Kunti. Receiving that gift of affection from her\r\nfather-in-law, Pritha became glad of heart and devoted it to the\r\naccomplishment of diverge acts of merit. King Yudhishthira, having bathed\r\nat the conclusion of his sacrifice and become cleansed of all his sins,\r\nshone in the midst of his brothers, honoured by all, like the chief of\r\nthe celestials in the midst of the denizens of Heaven. The sons of Pandu,\r\nsurrounded by the assembled kings, looked as beautiful, O king, as the\r\nplanets in the midst of the stars. Unto those kings they made presents of\r\nvarious jewels and gems, and elephants and horses and ornaments of gold,\r\nand female slaves and cloths and large measures of gold. Indeed, Pritha's\r\nson by distributing that untold wealth among the invited monarchs, shone,\r\nO king, like Vaisravana, the lord of treasures. Summoning next the heroic\r\nking Vabhruvahana, Yudhishthira gave unto him diverse kinds of wealth in\r\nprofusion and gave him permission to return home. The son of Pandu, for\r\ngratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his\r\npaternal kingdom. The Kuru king Yudhishthira, having a full control over\r\nhis senses, then dismissed the assembled kings all of whom had been\r\nproperly classed and honoured by him.[212] The illustrious son of Pandu,\r\nthat chastiser of foes, then duly worshipped the high-souled Govinda and\r\nValadeva of great might, and the thousands of other Vrishni heroes having\r\nPradyumna for their first. Assisted by his brothers, he then dismissed\r\nthem for returning to Dwaraka. Even thus was celebrated that sacrifice of\r\nking Yudhishthira the just, which was distinguished by a profuse\r\nabundance of food and wealth and jewels and gems, and oceans of wines of\r\ndifferent kinds. There were lakes whose mire consisted of ghee, and\r\nmountains of food. There were also, O chief of Bharata's race, miry\r\nrivers made of drinks having the six kinds of taste. Of men employed in\r\nmaking and eating the sweetmeats called Khandavaragas, and of animals\r\nslain for food, there was no end.[213] The vast space abounded with men\r\ninebriated with wine, and with young ladies filled with joy. The\r\nextensive grounds constantly echoed with the sounds of drums and the\r\nblare of conches. With all these, the sacrifice became exceedingly\r\ndelightful. 'Let agreeable things be given away,'--'Let agreeable food be\r\neaten,'--these were the sounds that were repeatedly heard day and night\r\nin that sacrifice. It was like a great festival, full of rejoicing and\r\ncontented men. People of diverse realms speak of that sacrifice to this\r\nday. Having showered wealth in torrents, and diverse objects of desire,\r\nand jewels and gems, and drinks of various kinds, the foremost one of\r\nBharata's race, cleansed of all his sins, and his purpose fulfilled,\r\nentered his capital.

After all the foremost of Brahmanas and all the kinsmen\r\nand relatives and friends, and all the poor, the blind, and the helpless\r\nones had been gratified, O chief of Bharata's race, when the gifts made\r\nin profusion were being spoken of on all sides, indeed, when flowers were\r\nrained down on the head of king Yudhishthira the just, a blue-eyed\r\nmongoose, O sinless one, with one side of his body changed into gold,\r\ncame there and spoke in a voice that was as loud and deep as thunder.\r\nRepeatedly uttering such deep sounds and thereby frightening all animals\r\nand birds, that proud denizen of a hole, with large body, spoke in a\r\nhuman voice and said, 'Ye kings, this great sacrifice is not equal to a\r\nprastha of powdered barley given away by a liberal Brahmana of\r\nKurukshetra who was observing the Unccha vow.' Hearing these words of the\r\nmongoose, O king, all those foremost of Brahmanas became filled with\r\nwonder. Approaching the mongoose, they then asked him, saying, 'Whence\r\nhast thou come to this sacrifice, this resort of the good and the pious?\r\nWhat is the extent of thy might? What thy learning? And what thy refuge?\r\nHow should we know thee that thus censurest this our sacrifice? Without\r\nhaving disregarded any portion of the scriptures, everything that should\r\nbe done has been accomplished here according to the scriptures and\r\nagreeably to reason, with the aid of diverse sacrificial rites. Those who\r\nare deserving of worship have been duly worshipped here according to the\r\nway pointed out by the scriptures. Libations have been poured on the\r\nsacred fire with the aid of proper mantras. That which should be given\r\nhas been given away without pride. The regenerate class have been\r\ngratified with gifts of diverse kinds. The Kshatriyas have been gratified\r\nwith battles fought according to just methods. The grandsires have been\r\ngratified with Sraddhas. The Vaisyas have been gratified by the\r\nprotection offered to them, and many foremost of women have been\r\ngratified by accomplishing their desires. The Sudras have been gratified\r\nby kind speeches, and others with the remnants of the profuse wealth\r\ncollected on the spot. Kinsmen and relatives have been gratified by the\r\npurity of behaviour displayed by our king. The deities have been\r\ngratified by libations of clarified butter and acts of merit, and\r\ndependants and followers by protection. That therefore, which is true, do\r\nthou truly declare unto these Brahmanas. Indeed, do thou declare what is\r\nagreeable to the scriptures and to actual experience, asked by the\r\nBrahmanas who are eager to know. Thy words seem to demand credit. Thou\r\nart wise. Thou bearest also a celestial form. Thou hast come into the\r\nmidst of learned Brahmanas. It behoveth thee to explain thyself.' Thus\r\naddressed by those regenerate persons, the mongoose, smiling, answered\r\nthem as follows. 'Ye regenerate ones, the words I have uttered are not\r\nfalse. Neither have I spoken them from pride. That which I have said may\r\nhave been heard by you all. Ye foremost of regenerate persons, this\r\nsacrifice is not equal in merit to the gift of a prastha of powdered\r\nbarley. Without doubt, I should say this, ye foremost of Brahmanas.\r\nListen to me with undivided attention as I narrate what happened to thee\r\ntruly. Wonderful and excellent was the occurrence that fell out. It was\r\nwitnessed by me and its consequences were felt by me. The incident\r\nrelates to a liberal Brahmana dwelling in Kurukshetra in the observance\r\nof the Unccha vow. In consequence of that incident he attained to Heaven,\r\nye regenerate ones, along with his wife and son and daughter-in-law. And\r\nin consequence of what then happened half my body became transformed into\r\ngold.'\r\n\r\n\"The Mongoose continued, 'Ye regenerate ones, I shall presently tell you\r\nwhat the excellent fruit was of the gift, made by a Brahmana, of a very\r\nlittle measure (of powdered barley) obtained by lawful means. On that\r\nrighteous spot of ground known by the name of Kurukshetra, which is the\r\nabode of many righteous persons, there lived a Brahmana in the observance\r\nof what is called the Unccha vow. That mode of living is like unto that\r\nof the pigeon.[214] He lived there with his wife and son and\r\ndaughter-in-law and practised penances. Of righteous soul, and with\r\nsenses under complete control, he adopted the mode of living that is\r\nfollowed by a parrot. Of excellent vows, he used to eat everyday at the\r\nsixth division.[215] If there was nothing to eat at the sixth division of\r\nthe day, that excellent Brahmana would fast for that day and eat the next\r\nday at the sixth division. On one occasion, ye Brahmanas, there occurred\r\na dreadful famine in the land. During that time there was nothing stored\r\nin the abode of that righteous Brahmana. The herbs and plants were all\r\ndried up and the whole realm became void of foodstore. When the\r\naccustomed hours came for eating, the Brahmana had nothing to eat. This\r\noccurred day after day. All the members of his family were afflicted with\r\nhunger but were obliged to pass the days as best they could. One day, in\r\nthe month of Jaishtha, while the Sun was in the meridian, the Brahmana\r\nwas engaged in picking up grains of corn. Afflicted by heat and hunger,\r\nhe was practising even this penance. Unable to obtain grains of corn, the\r\nBrahmana soon became worn out with hunger and toil. Indeed, with all the\r\nmembers of his family, he had no food to eat. That best of Brahmanas\r\npassed the days in great suffering. One day, after the sixth division\r\ncame, he succeeded in obtaining a prastha of barley. That barley was then\r\nreduced by those ascetics to powder for making what is called Saktu of\r\nit. Having finished their silent recitations and other daily rites, and\r\nhaving duly poured libations on the sacred fire, those ascetics divided\r\nthat little measure of powdered barley amongst themselves so that the\r\nshare of each came up to the measure of a Kudava.[216] As they were about\r\nto sit down for eating, there came unto their abode a guest. Beholding\r\nthe person who came as a guest, all of them became exceedingly glad.\r\nIndeed, seeing him, they saluted him and made the usual enquiries of\r\nwelfare. They were of pure minds, self-restrained, and endued with faith\r\nand control over the passions. Freed from malice, they had conquered\r\nwrath. Possessed of piety, they were never pained at the sight of other\r\npeople's happiness. They had cast off pride and haughtiness and anger.\r\nIndeed, they were conversant with every duty, ye foremost of regenerate\r\nones. Informing their guest of their own penances and of the race or\r\nfamily to which they belonged, and ascertaining from him in return those\r\nparticulars, they caused that hungry guest of theirs to enter their\r\ncottage. Addressing him they said, 'This is the Arghya for thee. This\r\nwater is for washing thy feet. There are scattered some Kusa grass for\r\nthy seat, O sinless one. Here is some clean Saktu acquired by lawful\r\nmeans, O puissant one. Given by us, O foremost of regenerate persons, do\r\nthou accept it,' Thus addressed by them, that Brahmana accepted the\r\nKudava of powdered barley that was offered to him and ate it all. But his\r\nhunger, O king, was not appeased by what he ate. The Brahmana in the\r\nobservance of the Unccha vow, seeing that his guest's hunger was still\r\nunappeased, began to think of what other food he could place before him\r\nfor gratifying him. Then his wife said unto him,--'Let my share be given\r\nunto him. Let this foremost of regenerate persons be gratified and let\r\nhim then go whithersoever he will.' Knowing that his chaste wife who said\r\nso was herself afflicted by hunger, that best of Brahmanas could not\r\napprove of her share of the powdered barley being given to the guest.\r\nIndeed, that best of Brahmanas possessed of learning, knowing from his\r\nown state that his aged, toil-worn, cheerless, and helpless wife was\r\nherself afflicted by hunger and seeing that lady who had been emaciated\r\ninto mere skin and bone was quivering with weakness, addressed her and\r\nsaid, 'O beautiful one, with even animals, with even worms and insects,\r\nwives are fed and protected. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to say so.\r\nThe wife treats her lord with kindness and feeds and protects him.\r\nEverything appertaining to religion, pleasure, and wealth, careful\r\nnursing, offspring for perpetuating the race, are all dependent on the\r\nwife. Indeed, the merits of a person himself as also of his deceased\r\nancestors depend also on her. The wife should know her lord by his acts.\r\nVerily, that man who fails to protect his wife earns great infamy here\r\nand goes into Hell hereafter. Such a man falls down from even a position\r\nof great fame and never succeeds in acquiring regions of happiness\r\nhereafter.' Thus addressed, she answered him, saying, 'O regenerate one,\r\nour religious acts and wealth are united. Do thou take a fourth of this\r\nbarley. Indeed, be gratified with me. Truth, pleasure, religious merit,\r\nand Heaven as acquirable, by good qualities, of women, as also all the\r\nobjects of their desire, O foremost of regenerate ones, are dependent on\r\nthe husband. In the production of offspring the mother contributes her\r\nblood. The father contributes his seed. The husband is the highest deity\r\nof the wife. Through the grace of the husband, women obtain both pleasure\r\nand offspring as the reward. Thou art my Pati (lord) for the protection\r\nthou givest me. Thou art my Bhartri for the means of sustenance thou\r\ngivest me. Thou art, again, boon-giver to me in consequence of thy having\r\npresented me a son. Do thou, therefore, (in return for so many favours),\r\ntake my share of the barley and give it unto the guest. Overcome by\r\ndecrepitude, thou art of advanced years. Afflicted by hunger thou art\r\nexceedingly weakened. Worn out with fasts, thou art very much emaciated.\r\n(If thou couldst part with thy share, why should not I part with mine)'\r\nThus addressed by her, he took her share of the powdered barley and\r\naddressing his guest said,--'O regenerate one, O best of men, do thou\r\naccept this measure of powdered barley as well.' The Brahmana, having\r\naccepted that quantity, immediately ate it up, but his hunger was not yet\r\nappeased. Beholding him ungratified, the Brahmana in the observance of\r\nthe Unccha vow became thoughtful. His son then said unto him, 'O best of\r\nmen, taking my share of the barely do thou give it to the guest. I regard\r\nthis act of mine as one of great merit. Therefore, do it. Thou shouldst\r\nbe always maintained by me with great care. Maintenance of the father is\r\na duty which the good always covet. The maintenance of the father in his\r\nold age is the duty ordained for the son. Even this is the eternal sruti\r\n(audition) current in the three worlds, O learned Rishi. By barely living\r\nthou art capable of practising penances. The life-breath is the great\r\ndeity that resides in the bodies of all embodied creatures.'[217]\r\n\r\n\"The father, at this, said, 'If thou attainest to the age of even a\r\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\r\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\r\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\r\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\r\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\r\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\r\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\r\n\r\n\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\r\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\r\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\r\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\r\n\r\n\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\r\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\r\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\r\nson.' Having said this, that foremost of regenerate persons cheerfully\r\ntook his son's share of the barley and smilingly presented it to his\r\nregenerate guest. Having eaten that barley also, the guest's hunger was\r\nnot appeased. The righteous-souled host in the observance of the unccha\r\nvow became ashamed (at the thought that he had nothing more to give).\r\nDesirous of doing what was agreeable to him, his chaste daughter-in-law\r\nthen, bearing her share of the barley, approached him and said, 'Through\r\nthy son, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain a son. Do thou, therefore,\r\ntake my share of the barley and give it unto this guest. Through thy\r\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\r\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\r\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\r\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\r\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\r\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\r\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\r\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\r\n\r\n\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\r\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\r\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\r\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\r\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\r\nsake of those auspicious results for which every family must strive.[218]\r\nO auspicious damsel, how can I behold thee: at even this, the sixth\r\ndivision of the day, abstaining from food and observing vows? Thou art\r\nendued with purity and good conduct and penances. Alas, even thou hast to\r\npass thy days in so much misery. Thou art a child, afflicted by hunger,\r\nand belongest to the softer sex. Thou shouldst be always protected by me.\r\nAlas, I have to see thee worn out with fasts, O thou that art the\r\ndelighter of all thy kinsmen.'\r\n\r\n\"The daughter-in-law said, 'Thou art the senior of my senior since thou\r\nart the deity of my deity. Thou art verily the god of my god. Do thou,\r\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\r\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\r\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\r\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\r\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\r\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\r\ntake this my share of the barley.'\r\n\r\n\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\r\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\r\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\r\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\r\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\r\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\r\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\r\nsaid so unto her, the Brahmana took her share of the barley and gave it\r\nunto his guest. At this the guest became gratified with the high-souled\r\nBrahmana endued with great piety. With gratified soul, that first of\r\nregenerate person, possessed of great eloquence, who was none else than\r\nthe deity of Righteousness in a human form, then addressed that foremost\r\nof Brahmanas and said, 'O best of regenerate ones, I am exceedingly\r\ngratified with this pure gift of thine, this gift of what was acquired by\r\nlawful means by thee, and which thou didst freely part with, agreeably to\r\nthe rules of righteousness. Verily, this gift of thine is being bruited\r\nabout in Heaven by the denizens of that happy region. Behold, flowers\r\nhave been rained down from the firmament on the Earth. The celestial\r\nRishis, the deities, the Gandharvas, those who walk before the deities,\r\nand the celestial messengers, are all praising thee, struck with wonder\r\nat thy gift. The regenerate Rishis who dwell in the regions of Brahma,\r\nseated on their cars, are solicitous of obtaining thy sight. O foremost\r\nof regenerate persons, go to Heaven. The Pitris residing in their own\r\nregion have all been rescued by thee. Others also who have not attained\r\nto the position of Pitris have equally been rescued by thee for countless\r\nYugas. For thy Brahmacharyya, thy gifts, thy sacrifices, thy penances,\r\nand thy acts of piety done with a pure heart, go thou to Heaven. O thou\r\nof excellent vows, thou practisest penances with great devotion. Thy\r\ngifts have, therefore, gratified the deities highly, O best of regenerate\r\nones. Since thou hast made this gift, in a season of great difficulty,\r\nwith a pure heart, thou hast, by this act of thine, conquered Heaven.\r\nHunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's righteous\r\nunderstanding. One whose intelligence is overwhelmed by hunger casts off\r\nall fortitude. He, therefore, that conquers hunger conquers Heaven\r\nwithout doubt. One's righteousness is never destroyed as long as one\r\ncherishes the inclination of making gifts. Disregarding filial affection,\r\ndisregarding the affection one feels for one's wife, and reckoning\r\nrighteousness as the foremost, thou hast paid no heed to the cravings of\r\nnature. The acquisition of wealth is an act of slight merit. Its gift to\r\na deserving person is fraught with greater merit. Of still greater merit\r\nis the (proper) time. Lastly, devotion (in the matter of gift) is fraught\r\nwith the highest merit. The door of Heaven is very difficult to see.\r\nThrough heedlessness men fail to obtain a sight of it. The bar of\r\nHeaven's door has cupidity for its seed. That bar is kept fastened by\r\ndesire and affection. Verily, Heaven's door is unapproachable. Those men\r\nwho subdued wrath and conquered their passions, those Brahmanas who are\r\nendued with penances and who make gifts according to the measure of their\r\nability, succeed in beholding it. It has been said that he that gives\r\naway a hundred, having a thousand, he that gives away ten, having a\r\nhundred, and he that gives a handful of water, having no wealth, are all\r\nequal in respect of the merit they earn. King Rantideva, when divested of\r\nall his wealth, gave a small quantity of water with a pure heart. Through\r\nthis gift, O learned Brahmana, he went to Heaven. The deity of\r\nrighteousness is never gratified so much with large gifts of costly\r\nthings as with gifts of even things of no value, if acquired lawfully and\r\ngiven away with devotion and faith. King Nriga had made gifts of\r\nthousands of kine unto the regenerate class. By giving away only one cow\r\nthat did not belong to him, he fell into Hell. Usinara's son Sivi of\r\nexcellent vows, by giving away the flesh of his own body, is rejoicing in\r\nHeaven, having attained to the regions of the righteous. Mere wealth is\r\nnot merit. Good men acquire merit by exerting to the best of their power\r\nand with the aid of pious meals. One does not acquire such merit by means\r\nof even diverse sacrifices as with even a little wealth that has been\r\nearned lawfully. Through wrath, the fruits of gifts are destroyed.\r\nThrough cupidity one fails to go to Heaven. One conversant with the\r\nmerits of gift, and leading a just course of conduct succeeds, through\r\npenances, in enjoying Heaven. The fruit, O Brahmana, of this gift made by\r\nthee (of a prastha of powdered barley) is much greater than what one\r\nacquires by many Rajasuya sacrifices with profuse gifts or many\r\nHorse-sacrifices. With this prastha of powdered barley thou hast\r\nconquered the eternal region of Brahman. Go thou in happiness, O learned\r\nBrahmana, to the abode of Brahman that is without the stain of darkness.\r\nO foremost of regenerate persons, a celestial car is here for all of you.\r\nDo thou ascend it as pleasest thee, O Brahmana, I am the deity of\r\nRighteousness. Behold me! Thou hast rescued thy body. The fame of thy\r\nachievement will last in the world. With thy wife, thy son, and thy\r\ndaughter-in-law, go now to Heaven.'--After the deity of Righteousness had\r\nsaid these words, that Brahmana, with his wife, son and daughter-in-law,\r\nproceeded to Heaven. After that learned Brahmana, conversant with all\r\nduties, had thus ascended to Heaven with his son, daughter-in-law, and\r\nwife numbering the fourth, I came out of my hole. There with the scent of\r\nthat powdered barley, with the mire caused by the water (which the\r\nBrahmana had given to his guest), with the contact (of my body) with the\r\ncelestial flowers that had been rained down, with the particles of the\r\nbarley-powder which that good man had given away, and the penances of\r\nthat Brahmana, my head became gold, Behold, in consequence of the gift of\r\nthat Brahmana who was firm in truth, and his penances, half of this my\r\nample body has become golden. Ye regenerate ones, for converting the rest\r\nof my body into gold I repeatedly repair, with a cheerful heart, to the\r\nretreats of ascetics and the sacrifices performed by kings. Hearing of\r\nthis sacrifice of the Kuru king endued with great wisdom, I came hither\r\nwith high hopes. I have not, however, been made gold. Ye foremost of\r\nBrahmanas, it was for this that I uttered those words, viz., that this\r\nsacrifice can by no means compare with (the gift of) that prastha of\r\npowdered barley. With the grains of that prastha of powdered barley, I\r\nwas made gold on that occasion. This great sacrifice however, is not\r\nequal to those grains. Even this is my opinion.' Having said those words\r\nunto all those foremost of Brahmanas, the mongoose disappeared from their\r\nsight. Those Brahmanas then returned to their respective homes.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'O conquerer of hostile towns, I have now told\r\nthee all relating to that wonderful incident which occurred in that great\r\nHorse-sacrifice. Thou shouldst not, O king, think highly of sacrifice.\r\nMillions of Rishis have ascended to Heaven with the aid of only their\r\npenances. Abstention from injury as regards all creatures, contentment,\r\nconduct, sincerity, penances, self-restraint, truthfulness, and gifts are\r\neach equal in point of merit to sacrifice.\"'"

      "content": "\"Janamejaya said, 'O puissant Rishi, kings are attached to sacrifices.\r\nThe great Rishis are attached to penances. Learned Brahmanas are\r\nobservant of tranquillity of mind, peacefulness of behaviour, and\r\nself-restraint. Hence it seems that nothing can be seen in this world\r\nwhich can compare with the fruits of sacrifices. Even this is my\r\nconviction. That conviction, again, seems to be undoubtedly correct.\r\nInnumerable kings, O best of regenerate persons, having worshipped the\r\ndeities in sacrifices, earned high fame here and obtained Heaven\r\nhereafter. Endued with great energy, the puissant chief of the deities\r\nviz., Indra of a thousand eyes, obtained the sovereignty over the deities\r\nthrough the many sacrifices he performed with gifts in profusion and\r\nattained to the fruition of all his wishes. When king Yudhishthira, with\r\nBhima and Arjuna by him, resembled the chief of the deities himself in\r\nprosperity and prowess, why then did that mongoose depreciate that great\r\nHorse-sacrifice of the high-souled monarch?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Do thou listen to me, O king, as I discourse to thee\r\nduly, O Bharata, on the excellent ordinances relating to sacrifice and\r\nthe fruits also, O ruler of men, that sacrifice yields. Formerly, on one\r\noccasion Sakra performed a particular sacrifice. While the limbs of the\r\nsacrifice were spread out, the Ritwijas became busy in accomplishing the\r\ndiverse rites ordained in the scriptures. The pourer of libations,\r\npossessed of every qualification, became engaged in pouring libations of\r\nclarified butter. The great Rishis were seated around. The deities were\r\nsummoned one by one by contented Brahmanas of great learning uttering\r\nscriptural Mantras in sweet voices. Those foremost of Adhwaryyus, not\r\nfatigued with what they did, recited the Mantras of the Yajurveda in soft\r\naccents. The time came for slaughtering the animals. When the animals\r\nselected for sacrifice were seized, the great Rishis, O king, felt\r\ncompassion for them. Beholding that the animals had all become cheerless,\r\nthose Rishis, endued with wealth of penances, approached Sakra and said\r\nunto him, 'This method of sacrifice is not auspicious. Desirous of\r\nacquiring great merit as thou art, this is verily an indication of thy\r\nunacquaintance with sacrifice. O Purandara, animals have not been\r\nordained to be slaughtered in sacrifices. O puissant one, these\r\npreparations of thine are destructive of merit. This sacrifice is not\r\nconsistent with righteousness. The destruction of creatures can never be\r\nsaid to be an act of righteousness. If thou wishest it, let thy priests\r\nperform thy sacrifice according to the Agama. By performing a sacrifice\r\naccording to the (true import of the) scriptural ordinances, great will\r\nbe the merit achieved by thee. O thou of a hundred eyes, do thou perform\r\nthe sacrifice with seeds of grain that have been kept for three years.\r\nEven this, O Sakra, would be fraught with great righteousness and\r\nproductive of fruits of high efficacy.' The deity of a hundred\r\nsacrifices, however, influenced by pride and overwhelmed by stupefaction,\r\ndid not accept these words uttered by the Rishis. Then, O Bharata, a\r\ngreat dispute arose in that sacrifice of Sakra between the ascetics as to\r\nhow sacrifices should be performed, that is, should they be performed\r\nwith mobile creatures or with immobile objects. All of them were worn out\r\nwith disputation. The Rishis then, those beholders of truth, having made\r\nan understanding with Sakra (about referring the matter to arbitration)\r\nasked king Vasu, 'O highly blessed one, what is the Vedic declaration\r\nabout sacrifices? Is it preferable to perform sacrifices with animals or\r\nwith steeds and juices? Hearing the question, king Vasu, without all\r\njudging of the strength or weakness of the arguments on the two sides, at\r\nonce answered, saying, 'Sacrifices may be performed with whichever of the\r\ntwo kinds of objects is ready.' Having answered the question thus, he had\r\nto enter the nether regions. Indeed the puissant ruler of the Chedis had\r\nto undergo that misery for having answered falsely. Therefore, when a\r\ndoubt arises, no person, however wise, should singly decide the matter,\r\nunless he be the puissant and self-born Lord himself of creatures. Gifts\r\nmade by a sinner with an impure understanding, even when they are very\r\nlarge, become lost. Such gifts go for nothing. By the gifts made by a\r\nperson of unrighteous conduct,--one, that is, who is of sinful soul and\r\nwho is a destroyer, just fame is never acquired either here or hereafter.\r\nThat person of little intelligence who, from desire of acquiring merit,\r\nperforms sacrifices with wealth acquired by unrighteous means, never\r\nsucceeds in earning merit. That low wretch of sinful soul, who\r\nhypocritically assuming a garb of righteousness mikes gifts unto\r\nBrahmanas, only creates the conviction in men about his own righteousness\r\n(without earning true merit). That Brahmana of uncontrolled conduct, who\r\nacquires wealth by sinful acts, over overwhelmed by passion and\r\nstupefaction, attains at last to the goal of the sinful. Someone,\r\noverwhelmed by cupidity and stupefaction, becomes bent on strong wealth.\r\nHe is seen to persecute all creatures, urged by a sinful and impure\r\nunderstanding. He who, having acquired wealth by such means, makes gifts\r\nor performs sacrifices therewith, never enjoys the fruits of those gifts\r\nor sacrifices in the other world in consequence of the wealth having been\r\nearned by unrighteous means. Men endued with wealth of penances, by\r\ngiving away, to the best of their power, grains of corn picked up from\r\nthe fields or roots or fruits or pot-herbs or water or leaves, acquire\r\ngreat merit and proceed to Heaven. Even such gifts, as also compassion to\r\nall creatures, and Brahmacharyya, truthfulness of speech and kindness,\r\nand fortitude, and forgiveness, constitute the eternal foundations of\r\nRighteousness which itself is eternal. We hear of Visvamitra and other\r\nkings of ancient times. Indeed, Visvamitra, and Asita, and king Janaka,\r\nand Kakshasena and Arshtisena, and king Sindhudwipa,--these and many\r\nother kings, endued with wealth of penances, having made gifts of\r\narticles acquired lawfully, have attained to high success. Those amongst\r\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras who betake themselves to\r\npenances, O Bharata, and who purify themselves by gifts and other acts of\r\nrighteousness, proceed to Heaven.\""

      "content": "\"Janamejaya said, 'If, O illustrious one, Heaven is the fruit of wealth\r\nacquired by lawful means, do thou discourse to me fully on it. Thou art\r\nwell-conversant with the subject and therefore, it behoveth thee to\r\nexplain it. O regenerate one, thou hast said unto me what the high fruit\r\nwas that accrued unto that Brahmana, who lived according to the Unccha\r\nmode, through his gift of powdered barley. Without doubt, all thou hast\r\nsaid is true. In what way, however, was the attainment held certain of\r\nthe highest end in all sacrifices? O foremost of regenerate persons, it\r\nbehoveth thee to expound this to me in all its details.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'In this connection is cited this old narrative, O\r\nchastiser of foes, of what occurred in former days in the great sacrifice\r\nof Agastya. In olden days, O king, Agastya of great energy, devoted to\r\nthe good of all creatures, entered into a Diksha extending for twelve\r\nyears.[219] In that sacrifice of the high-souled Rishi many Hotris were\r\nengaged that resembled blazing fires in the splendour of their bodies.\r\nAmong them were men that subsisted upon roots or fruits, or that used two\r\npieces of stone only for husking their corn, or that were supported by\r\nonly the rays (of the moon). Among them were also men who never took any\r\nfood unless it was placed before them by others solicitous of feeding\r\nthem, and those who never ate anything without having first served the\r\ndeities, the Pitris, and guests, and those who never washed the food\r\nwhich they took. There were also Yatis and Bikshus among them, O king.\r\nAll of them were men who had obtained a sight of the deity of\r\nRighteousness in his embodied form. They had subjugated wrath and\r\nacquired a complete mastery over all their senses. Living in the\r\nobservance of self-restraint, they were freed from pride and the desire\r\nof injuring others. They were always observant of a pure conduct and were\r\nnever obstructed (in the prosecution of their purposes) by their senses.\r\nThose great Rishis attended that sacrifice and accomplished its various\r\nrites. The illustrious Rishi (Agastya) acquired the food that was\r\ncollected in that sacrifice and that came up to the required measure, by\r\nlawful means according to the best of his power. Numerous other ascetics\r\nat that time performed large sacrifices. As Agastya, however, was engaged\r\nin that sacrifice of his, the thousand-eyed Indra, O best of the\r\nBharatas, ceased to pour rain (on the Earth). At the intervals, O king,\r\nof the sacrificial rites, this talk occurred among those Rishis of\r\ncleansed souls about the high-souled Agastya, viz., 'This Agastya,\r\nengaged in sacrifice, is making gifts of food with heart purged of pride\r\nand vanity. The deity of the clouds, however, has ceased to pour rain.\r\nHow, indeed, will food grow? This sacrifice of the Rishi, ye Brahmanas,\r\nis great and extends for twelve years. The deity will not pour rain for\r\nthese twelve years. Reflecting on this, it behoveth you to do some favour\r\nunto this Rishi of great intelligence, viz., Agastya of severe penances.'\r\nWhen these words were said, Agastya of great prowess, gratifying those\r\nascetics by bending his head, said, 'If Vasava does not pour rain for\r\nthose twelve years, I shall then perform the mental sacrifice. Even this\r\nis the eternal ordinance. If Vasava does not pour rain for these twelve\r\nyears, I shall then perform the Touch-sacrifice. Even this is the eternal\r\nsacrifice. If Vasava does not pour rain for these twelve years, I shall\r\nthen, putting forth all my exertion, make arrangements for other\r\nsacrifices characterised by the observance of the most difficult and\r\nsevere vows. This present sacrifice of mine, with seeds, has been\r\narranged for by me with labour extending for many years.[220] I shall,\r\nwith seeds, accomplish much good. No impediment will arise. This my\r\nsacrifice is incapable of being baffled. It matters little whether the\r\ndeity pours rains or no downpours happen. Indeed, if Indra does not, of\r\nhis own will, show any regard for me, I shall, in that case, transform\r\nmyself into Indra and keep all creatures alive. Every creature, on\r\nwhatever food he has been nourished, will continue to be nourished on it\r\nas before. I can even repeatedly create a different order of things. Let\r\ngold and whatever else of wealth there is, come to this place today. Let\r\nall the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own\r\naccord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along\r\nwith the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),\r\napproach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the\r\nNorthern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices. Let Heaven,\r\nand all those who have Heaven for their home, and Dharma himself, come\r\nhither.'--After the ascetic had uttered these words, everything happened\r\nas he wished, in consequence of his penances, for Agastya was endued with\r\na mind that resembled a blazing fire and was possessed of extraordinary\r\nenergy. The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with\r\nrejoicing hearts. Filled with wonder they then said these words of grave\r\nimport.'\r\n\r\n\"The Rishis said, 'We have been highly gratified with the words thou hast\r\nuttered. We do not, however, wish that thy penances should suffer any\r\ndiminution. Those sacrifices are approved by us which are performed by\r\nlawful means. Indeed, we desire duly those sacrifices which rest on\r\nlawful means.[221] Earning our food by lawful means and observant of our\r\nrespective duties, we shall seek to go through sacrificial initiations\r\nand the pouring of libations on the sacred fire and the other religious\r\nrites. We should adore the deities, practising Brahmacharyya by lawful\r\nmeans. Completing the period of Brahmacharyya we have come out of our\r\nabode, observing lawful methods. That understanding, which is freed from\r\nthe desire of inflicting any kind of injury on others, is approved by us.\r\nThou shouldst always, O puissant one, command such abstention from injury\r\nin all sacrifices. We shall then be highly gratified, O foremast of\r\nregenerate ones. After the completion of thy sacrifice, when dismissed by\r\nthee, we shall then, leaving this place, go away.' As they were saying\r\nthese words, Purandara, the chief of the deities, endued with great\r\nenergy, beholding the power of Agastya's penances, poured rain. Indeed, O\r\nJanamejaya, till the completion of the sacrifice of that Rishi of\r\nimmeasurable prowess, the deity of rain poured rain that met the wishes\r\nof men in respect of both quantity and time. Placing Vrihaspati before\r\nhim, the chief of the deities came there, O royal sage, and gratified the\r\nRishi Agastya. On the completion of that sacrifice, Agastya, filled with\r\njoy, worshipped those great Rishis duly and then dismissed them all.'\r\n\r\n\"Janamejaya said, 'Who was that mongoose with a golden head, that said\r\nall those words in a human voice? Asked by me, do thou tell me this.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Thou didst not ask me before and, therefore, I did\r\nnot tell thee. Hear as I tell thee who that mongoose was and why he could\r\nassume a human voice. In former times, the Rishi Jamadagni proposed to\r\nperform a Sraddha. His Homa cow came to him and the Rishi milked her\r\nhimself. He then placed the milk in a vessel that was new, durable and\r\npure. The deity Dharma, assuming the form of Anger, entered that vessel\r\nof milk. Indeed, Dharma was desirous of ascertaining what that foremost\r\nof Rishis would do when seeing some injury done to him. Having reflected\r\nthus, Dharma spoiled that milk. Knowing that the spoiler of his milk was\r\nAnger, the ascetic was not at all enraged with him. Anger, then, assuming\r\nthe form of a Brahmana lady, showed himself to the Rishi. Indeed, Anger,\r\nfinding that he had been conquered by that foremost one of Bhrigu's race,\r\naddressed him, saying, 'O chief of Bhrigu's race, I have been conquered\r\nby thee. There is a saying among men that the Bhrigus are very wrathful.\r\nI now find that that saying is false, since I have been subdued by thee.\r\nThou art possessed of a mighty soul. Thou art endued with forgiveness. I\r\nstand here today, owning thy sway. I fear thy penances, O righteous one.\r\nDo thou, O puissant Rishi, show me favour.'\r\n\r\n\"Jamadagni said, 'I have seen thee, O Anger, in thy embodied form. Go\r\nthou whithersoever thou likest, without any anxiety. Thou hast not done\r\nme any injury today. I have no grudge against thee. Those for whom I had\r\nkept this milk are the highly blessed Pitris. Present thyself before them\r\nand ascertain their intentions.' Thus addressed, penetrated with fear,\r\nAnger vanished from the sight of the Rishi. Through the curse of the\r\nPitris he became a mongoose. He then began to gratify the Pitris in order\r\nto bring about an end of his curse. By them he was told these words, 'By\r\nspeaking disrespectfully of Dharma thou shalt attain to the end of thy\r\ncurse.' Thus addressed by them he wandered over places where sacrifices\r\nwere performed and over other sacred places, employed in censuring great\r\nsacrifices. It was he that came to the great sacrifice of king\r\nYudhishthira. Dispraising the son of Dharma by a reference to the prastha\r\nof powdered barley, Anger became freed from his curse, for Yudhishthira\r\n(as Dharma's son) was Dharma's self. Even this is what occurred in the\r\nsacrifice of that high-souled king. Mongoose disappeared there in our\r\nvery sight.'\"[222]\r\n\r\nThe end of Aswamedha Parva\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1. Mahavahu occurs twice in this passage. One of the epithets is left out\r\non the score of redundancy.\r\n\r\n2. i.e., human sacrifice.

Nirakarasritena is explained by Nilakantha as\r\nAsamprajnatas-samadhi-samadhigamya Brhamabhavasritena, implying reliance\r\non Brahman by having recourse to Samadhi or a suspension of all functions\r\nof both body and mind (through Yoga) and arrival at that state which is\r\none of perfect unconsciousness.'\r\n\r\n9. The dissolution here spoken of is the Mahapralaya and not the Khanda\r\nor Avantara Pralayas. Till then, the sage will look upon all beings,\r\ni.e., their repeated migrations.\r\n\r\n10. The commentator explains that altogether seven questions are asked.\r\nThe first is about the dissolution of the body. The second relates to the\r\nmanner of re-acquiring a body. The third has reference to the manner in\r\nwhich rebirth may be avoided. The fourth relates to the causes that\r\noperate for giving a body to Jiva. By Prakriti is meant Nature or that\r\nNescience which is the cause of body. The fifth relates to the Anyat or\r\nParam, viz., how final Emancipation or absorption into Brahman takes\r\nplace. The sixth pertains to the manner in which the fruits of acts are\r\nenjoyed or endured. The seventh enquires after the way in which acts\r\nattach to Jiva even when devoid of a body.\r\n\r\n11. Kala here means both the season of the year and the age of the\r\nperson. Food that is beneficial in summer is not so in winter, or that\r\nwhich is beneficial in youth is otherwise at old age. All the texts that\r\nI have seen have viditwa and not aviditiwa which Telang takes in his\r\nversion for the Sacred Books of the East. Kala is always interpreted by\r\nthe commentators of Charaka as referring to either period of life or\r\nperiod of the year. This, as well as the following verses, relates to the\r\nlaws of health as expounded by Charaka.\r\n\r\n12. The faults are three, viz., Wind, Bile, and Phlegm. When existing in\r\na state of harmony, they produce health. When one is excited or two, or\r\nall, indisposition sets in. They are called dosha or faults, because of\r\ntheir liability to be excited and product, disease. Telang, not\r\nsuspecting that the whole passage is a reproduction of a passage in the\r\nancient work edited by Charaka, misunderstands some expressions and\r\nwrongly renders doshan into 'disorders.'\r\n\r\n13. Jivitam in the second line seems to be an objective of sariram in the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n14. Garbha-sankramane is explained by Nilakantha as 'entering the foetus\r\nin the womb after casting off the body appertaining to the other world. I\r\nthink Telang is not correct in his version of 19 and 20. Atisarpana can\r\nnever imply 'exhaustion'; hence, karmanam can never be the reading he\r\nadopts. Besides tadrisam seems to settle the question. The tortures felt\r\nat death are similar to those at birth.\r\n\r\n15. Sambutatwam is sanhatatwam. Niyachachati is nasyyati Vayu is\r\nunderstood in the second line, or that in the first line of the next\r\nverse may be taken as the nom. of niyachachati.\r\n\r\n16. Pachante is phalam prayachhanti.\r\n\r\n17. Nilakantha explains this verse in a different way. According to him\r\nit means,--'in consequence of his subtlety and imperceptibility, Jiva\r\ndoes not become attached to anything. For this reason, one possessed of a\r\nknowledge of Brahman, having become cognisant of Brahman and attained the\r\ngreat object of his desire, succeeds in becoming so (i.e., dissociated\r\nfrom all things). This interpretation seems to be a little far-fetched.\r\n\r\n18. Chetasa indicates upadhibhutena, for previously, Jiva was without\r\nupadhi. Pranasthaneshu implies Indriyagolokeshu or those vital parts\r\nwhich constitute the seats of the senses. Chetana does not, I think, mean\r\n'consciousness.' It implies mind.\r\n\r\n19. Causes them to grow. I do not follow Nilakantha here.\r\n\r\n20. Nilakantha points out that one of the cha's indicates the reason or\r\ncause. Hence, the use of 'therefore' in the text.\r\n\r\n21. Vikrita does not necessarily mean degraded. It implies 'changed or\r\naltered.' Jiva, who is pure and immaculate, takes birth in this world,\r\nfailing away from his true status of Brahman owing to his acts. Acts,\r\nagain, are eternal, no beginning being conceivable.\r\n\r\n22. Parantwa-maritam-aksharam indicates two things, viz., Amritam and\r\nAksharam. The first line speaks of Kshara, or the material case, or body;\r\nthen of that which is para or other. This other is of two kinds, viz.,\r\nAmritam or suddha-chaitanyam, implying Brahman in its condition of\r\npurity; and Aksharamt or Jiva as existing in the material case. In the\r\nsecond line, trayanam refers to Kshara, Amrita, and Akshara. Mithunam is\r\nduality, referring to that which is composed of Kshara and Akshara. What\r\nis stated in this verse is that every Purusha is a duality, made up of\r\nKshara and Akshara. Telang gives a different version of the verse. He\r\nignores the word trayanam totally, and takes Mithunam as implying a\r\ncouple (male and female). All the texts I have seen contain trayanam.\r\n\r\n23. Atra purvajamnani (vishaye) yatha kaschit Medhavi etc., (vadet).\r\nseems to be the correct order of the words. Telang translates the first\r\nline differently.\r\n\r\n24. Ekayana is the one receptacle of all things, viz., Brahman. Tushni\r\nimplies ahamevedam sarvamasmityabhimanamapyakurvan i.e., 'without even\r\nretaining the consciousness of his own identity with everything.'\r\nKinchikachintayan--i.e., not even thinking that he is existing. Purvam\r\npurvam parityajya implies the gradual merging of the grosser in the\r\nsubtler. i.e., the successive stages of Yoga before absorption into\r\nBrahman. I follow Nilakantha.\r\n\r\n25. The first half of the second line of 8 is read differently in the\r\nBengal texts. Aswasthamavasam mudham implies 'without ease or happiness,\r\nendued with slavery and ignorance.'\r\n\r\n26. The Soul being destitute of these becomes Chinmatra, i.e., a pure\r\nChit without the attributes superinduced upon it by Ne-science or\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n27. Formlessness implies subtlety. 'Without cause' implies increate or as\r\nidentical with eternal Brahman. Dissociation from attributes while\r\nenjoying them implies an emancipate condition.\r\n\r\n28. Nirvana, according to orthodox commentators, implies the annihilation\r\nor cessation of separate or individual existence by absorption into\r\nuniversal and eternal Brahman.\r\n\r\n29. The impressions caused by objects outside self are destroyed by those\r\nbelonging to contemplation. The latter, again, should be destroyed before\r\nabsorption into Brahman can occur.\r\n\r\n30. Siddham is explained as 'destitute of the errors due to Ne-science.'\r\n\r\n31. Attnanam is Chittam; atmani is dehe; charayan is antarmukham kritwa;\r\nnityam is adyantasunyam. So Nilakantha.\r\n\r\n32. 'Fixing the mind upon the soul' is that concentration which leads to\r\nEmancipation. This becomes possible in consequence of severe austerities\r\nundergone previously.\r\n\r\n33. I expand the verse a little to make it intelligible. The sense is\r\nthis: having seen the supreme Soul in Samadhi, upon awaking from it, he\r\nrecognises it in the universe, i.e., regards the universe to be nothing\r\nelse than the Supreme Soul.\r\n\r\n34. This may also mean 'he has none superior to him; not even he that is\r\nthe Lord of the universe.'\r\n\r\n35. The first line seems to be doubtful. The sense, as I understand it,\r\nis,--such a person becomes the god of the very gods. The causal verb\r\nkarayate may be taken as equivalent to karoti.\r\n\r\n36. I follow Nilakantha in rendering the second line. The sense is clear,\r\nviz., that one should not fall away from the practice of Yoga, tempted by\r\nthe puissance that Yoga brings. Telang renders the line 'one practising\r\nconcentration should never become despondent.' I think, Nilakantha is\r\nright.\r\n\r\n37. Nilakantha notes that this indicates that only that Yogin who has not\r\nadvanced much may be tempted by the desire of enjoyment. He, however, who\r\nhas adequately devoted himself to Yoga feels no regard for Indra himself\r\nbut can turn him away like Diogenes dismissing Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n38. I have endeavoured to render verses 33 to 37 as literally as\r\npossible, under the guide of Nilakantha, omitting his inferences. The\r\npassage relates to the mysteries of Yoga. In the second line of 33,\r\ndrishtapurvam disam, which has been rendered 'that point of the compass\r\nwhich has the Sun behind it,' means the instructions laid down in the\r\nVedanta as based upon Srutis. Drishtam implies 'Sruti', for it is as\r\nauthoritative as anything seen. 'Pura' implies a city, a citadel, or a\r\nmansion. Here it refers to the body. The avasatha within the pura refers\r\nto the chakra or nervous centres beginning with what is called the\r\nmuladhara. At the time when Brahman is realised, the whole universe\r\nappears as Brahman and so nothing exists, besides Brahman, upon which the\r\nmind can then dwell. Telang, I think, is not correct in rendering\r\nmanaschasya ... vahyatah as 'his mind should not any way wander outside'.\r\nThe correct version would 'the mind is then nowhere,' implying that at\r\nthat time the mind has nothing else to dwell upon. Kayamabhyantaram is\r\nkayamabhi and antaram, i.e., both within and without the body. The\r\nseveral parts of the body named, beginning with teeth, etc, refer to\r\neating and other operations, all of which influence the mind and dispose\r\nit for purity and otherwise.\r\n\r\n39. i.e., that from which the entire universe has been created.\r\n\r\n40. Probably, 'by any of the senses'. The plural form occurs in the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n41. This answers the questions respecting the form of the Soul, says\r\nNilakantha.\r\n\r\n42. I render this verse, following Nilakantha's gloss. The second line of\r\n50, according to that commentator, refers to the ascension of the Yogin\r\nfrom Brahma vested with attributes to Brahma divested of all attributes.\r\nThe tam does not refer to body, as Telang takes it, but to Brahma as\r\nendued with hands and feet on all sides, etc. Deheswam dharayan means\r\n'restraining the mind within the body'. Kevalam Brahma is Brahma without\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\n43. The speaker here is the regenerate visitor of Krishna. The latter is\r\nrepeating the words of that visitor. In this verse, Krishna, forgetting\r\nthat he is merely reciting the words of another, refers to himself as the\r\nSupreme Brahman in whom one must merge for attaining to Emancipation.\r\n\r\n44. The second line of 56 is read variously.\r\n\r\n45. Heaven is the reward of those who follow the religion of Pravritti or\r\nacts, such as sacrifices, religious observances, etc. The followers,\r\nhowever, of the religion of Nivritti or inaction, i.e., they who betake\r\nthemselves to the path of knowledge, become emancipated. The deities\r\nderive their sustenance from the former and become even jealous of the\r\nlatter, for the emancipate state is higher than that of the deities\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n46. Avichakshanam is undiscerning, in the sense of the husband's not\r\nknowing that the interrogatrix as wife, has no other refuge than her lord\r\nwith all his defects.\r\n\r\n47. I follow Nilakantha. Telang adopts the views or Arjuna Misra and\r\nrenders the first line as 'whatever acts are seized (by the touch, or\r\nseen, or heard, etc.') Grahyam, according to Nilakantha, implies those\r\nacts, like Diksha, etc, which are adopted with the aid of others.\r\n\r\n48. This seat, says Nilakantha, is called Avimukta and lies between the\r\neyebrows and the nose.\r\n\r\n49. Nilakantha interprets this mystically. By Soma he understands the\r\nartery or duct called Ida, and by Agni the duct called Pingala. Dhira is\r\nBuddipreraka; vyavayam is sancharam. Dhirobhutani dharayan nityam\r\nvyavayam kurute is the order of the words. The sense is this: in this\r\nspot is seated Brahman; there Ida and Pingala meet; and there also is\r\nVayu which urges the understanding and upholds all living creatures.\r\n\r\n50. Yatra is not to be taken as a locative here. It is equivalent to\r\nyatah or for which.\r\n\r\n51. Tasmin is taken, by Nilakantha as Apana sahite Prane.\r\n\r\n52. Utkarshena anayati, hence Udana, says Nilakantha. The sense of the\r\nwhole passage seems to be this. Worldly life is regulated by the\r\nlife-breaths. These are attached to the Soul and lead to its individual\r\nmanifestations. Udana controls all the breaths. Udana is controlled by\r\npenance. It is penance then that destroys the round of rebirths and leads\r\nto absorption into Brahman.\r\n\r\n53. The meaning seems to be this: they who renounce sensuous objects can\r\ncreate them when they like. One casting off smell that has earth for its\r\nobject can create earth when he likes.\r\n\r\n54. What is stated in this passage is, shortly, this: the ear, etc, are\r\nthe Hotris or sacrificing priests who are to pour libations on the\r\nsacrificial fire. The perceptions and functions of those organs\r\nconstitute the Havi or libations that are to be poured. The points, wind,\r\netc, are the Agni or sacred fires on which they are to be poured. These\r\nstatements are recapitulated in verse 5. The objects of the senses, of\r\nthe same as those in verse 3, are the fuel, previously described as Havi\r\nor libations, which are to be burnt off by being cast into the fires.\r\n\r\n55. The Hridaya or heart is the Garhapatya fire. From it is produced\r\nanother fire, the Ahavaniya, viz., the mind. 'The heart was pierced. From\r\nthe heart arose mind, for the mind arose Chandramas,' is the declaration\r\nof the Sruti cited by Nilakantha. The Ahavaniya fire or mind is the\r\nmouth. Asyam ahavaniya is the Sruti. Annamayam hi Somya manas, apomayah\r\npranah, tejomayi vak is the Sruti that bears upon this. Food or fire,\r\npoured into the mouth develops into speech or word. Vachaspati implies\r\nthe Veda or word. First arises the word, the mind sets itself upon it,\r\ndesirous of creation. This corresponds with the Mosaic Genesis.--'God\r\nsaid; let there be light, and there was light.' The word was first.\r\n\r\n56. The last question seems to be this: in dreamless slumber, the mind\r\ndisappears totally. If it is the mind upon which Prana rests, why does\r\nnot Prana also disappear? It is seen to separate itself from mind, for it\r\ncontinues to exist while mind does not exist. If so, i.e., if existing,\r\nas it must be admitted to do, why does it not apprehend objects? What is\r\nit that restrains its powers of apprehension?\r\n\r\n57. Bhutatmanam is ordinary Prajapati. Nilakantha takes it to mean here\r\nindividual Jiva or self.\r\n\r\n58. It is, through words that desirable fruits, visible and invisible,\r\nare acquired. Of course, word means both ordinary speech and Vedic\r\nMantras.\r\n\r\n59. The speaker is the Brahmana, which Nilakantha explains to mean 'the\r\nBrahmana named Manas or Mind'. Instead of such a learned interpretation,\r\nwe may take it as implying that the Brahmana is repeating the answer\r\nwhich Bhutatman, i.e., Prajapati or Jiva, made to Word. The Brahmana is\r\nthe real speaker. He recites the words of Jiva. Immovable, according to\r\nNilakantha, means 'that which is seizable by the external senses'; and\r\n'movable', that which is beyond the ken of the senses, such as heaven,\r\netc. The external world being only a manifestation of the mind, it is\r\nspoken of here as identical with it. So, the ideas in the mind which are\r\nnot due to the senses, are only the mind. This is the movable mind. That\r\nmind depends on word or the scriptures.\r\n\r\n60. Telang gives a different version of this verse. I offer a verbal\r\ntendering, without attempting to explain it.\r\n\r\n61. i.e., as noisy or noiseless.\r\n\r\n62. I have given as close a verbal rendering of the passage as possible.\r\nThe sense, however, is not very intelligible to me. The gloss of\r\nNilakantha is as unintelligible as the text. Telang also has given a\r\nverbal rendering which differs from the above slightly. His foot-notes do\r\nnot, I think, bring out the meaning at all. As regards the two vernacular\r\nversions, both are useless.\r\n\r\n63. The correct reading is cha after arthan and not twam after it. Hence,\r\nthe Senses say that, without ourselves and without those which are our\r\nobjects, thou canst not have thy enjoyments.'\r\n\r\n64. Thus creatures may exist through us, even though mind may be out of\r\norder.\r\n\r\n65. Both mental purposes and dreams having failed to gratify him.\r\n\r\n66. The reading sarvam in the second line is incorrect, though Nilakantha\r\nadopts it. The different portions of the fire are indicated as the\r\ndifferent attributes. The smoke is of the form of Darkness (Tamas): the\r\nashes are the attributes of Passion; while the blazing flame, that into\r\nwhich the oblation is thrown, is the attribute of Goodness.\r\n\r\n67. I give a close rendering of these verses, without endeavouring to\r\nbring out the sense as explained by the commentators. The printed texts\r\nare not correct. The text adopted by Nilakantha differs from that of\r\nArjuna Misra. The very order of the verses is not uniform in all the\r\ntexts.\r\n\r\n68. 'These' refers to action, agent and instrument. The qualities of\r\nwhich they are possessed are goodness, passion, and darkness.\r\n\r\n69. What is stated in these two verses is this: it is the Senses that\r\nenjoy; and not the Soul. This is well known to those that are learned. On\r\nthe other hand, those that are not learned, regard this or that to be\r\ntheirs, when in reality they are different from them. They are their\r\nselves, and not their senses, although they take themselves for the\r\nlatter, ignorantly identifying themselves with things which they are not.\r\n\r\n70. What is stated here is this: Restraining the senses and the mind, the\r\nobjects of those senses and the mind should be poured as libations on the\r\nsacred fire of the Soul that is within the body.\r\n\r\n71. i.e., truth is the Sastra of the Prasastri.\r\n\r\n72. Narayana is taken by Nilakantha to stand here for either the Veda or\r\nthe Soul. The animals offered up to Narayana in days of old were the\r\nsenses offered up as sacrifices.\r\n\r\n73. Srota here means preceptor or dispeller of doubts. Amaratwam is the\r\nstatus of the immortal head of all.\r\n\r\n74. I think Telang is not correct in his rendering of this verse. What is\r\nstated here is plain, viz., that it is He who is the preceptor and the\r\ndisciple. Ayam srinoti,--'prochyamanam grihnati,--'tat prichcchatah ato\r\nbhuyas anye srinanti is the grammar of the construction. The conclusion\r\nthen comes--'gururanyo na vidyate'.\r\n\r\n75. One who understands the truth.\r\n\r\n76. The seven large trees are the five senses, the mind, and the\r\nunderstanding. The fruits are the pleasures and pains derived from or\r\nthrough them. The guests are the powers of each sense, for it is they\r\nthat receive those pleasures and pains. The hermitages are those very\r\ntrees under which the guests take shelter. The seven forms of Yoga are\r\nthe extinctions of the seven senses. The seven forms of initiation are\r\nthe repudiation, one after another, of the actions of the seven senses.\r\n\r\n77. The correct reading is bhavantyanityah and vahuswabhavan.\r\n\r\n78. Swabhava is explained by Nilakantha as sutaram abhava.\r\n\r\n79. The sense seems to be this; the life-winds indicate the operations of\r\nthe several organs of action: the tongue, which stands here for all the\r\norgans of perception, of the sensual perceptions; the mind, of all the\r\ninternal operations; the quality of goodness, of all pleasure; and the\r\nquality of passion, of all kinds of pain. These, therefore include the\r\nwhole external and the internal worlds. He that is free from these,\r\ntranscends sin, for sin is destroyed by freedom from these, knowledge\r\nbeing the means of attaining to that freedom.\r\n\r\n80. 'I have no fault etc.'--The sense seems to be that by doing these\r\nrites with the aid of Mantras I have done that which has been approved\r\nfrom ages past by those who have always been regarded wise. My eyes,\r\nhowever, have now been opened by thee. I should not be held responsible\r\nfor what I did while I was ignorant.\r\n\r\n81. Kshatriyas always require Brahmanas for assisting them in their acts.\r\nThese particular Kshatriyas, through fear of Rama, fled to the forests\r\nand mountains. They could not, accordingly, find Brahmanas for assisting\r\nthem. Their children, therefore, fell away from the status of Kshatriyas\r\nand became Vrishalas or Sudras.\r\n\r\n82. Kshatriya-bandhu always implies low or inferior Kshatriyas, as\r\nBrahma-bandhu implies low or inferior Brahmanas. The expression, very\r\nprobably, is similar to Brahman-sangat in current Bengali. It does not\r\nsurely mean 'kinsmen of Kshatriyas'.\r\n\r\n83. The vocative, 'O foremost of regenerate ones' applies to Jamadagni's\r\nson. The narration is that of the Pitris. All the copies, however,\r\nrepresent this as the Brahmana's speech to his wife. Indeed, the Brahmana\r\nis only reciting to his wife the speech of the Pitris to Rama. The Yoga\r\nhere spoken of is, as Nilakantha explains the Raja-Yoga. Previously,\r\nAlarka had been bent upon Hatha-Yoga which frequently ends in the\r\ndestruction of the person practising it.\r\n\r\n84. Praharsha, rendered 'exultation', is explained by Nilakantha as the\r\njoy that is felt at the certainty of attaining what is desired. Priti is\r\nthat satisfaction which is felt when the object desired is attained.\r\nAnanda is what arises while enjoying the attained object.\r\n\r\n85. The sense seems to be this. Having first conquered the internal foes\r\nmentioned, the man of intelligence, bent on effecting his deliverance,\r\nshould then seek to vanquish all external foes standing in his way.\r\n\r\n86. Nilakantha explains that dosha here refers to attachment, cupidity\r\nand the rest; while Sadhu implies not men but the virtues of tranquillity\r\nand the rest.\r\n\r\n87. think Telang renders this verse wrongly. Samhatadehabandhanah does\r\nnot mean 'with bodily frame destroyed' but 'with bodily frame united.' If\r\nsamhata be taken as destroyed, the compound bhinna-vikirna-dehah in the\r\nsecond line would be a useless repetition. The meaning is that with\r\nbodily frame or the bonds of body united, he takes birth. When he dies,\r\nthat frame becomes dismembered and scattered.\r\n\r\n88. The conditions referred to are affluence and indigence, as explained\r\nby Nilakantha.\r\n\r\n89. This is, rather, obscure. Nilakantha observes that the Vedic text\r\nreferred to is: 'Do not covet anybody's property.' What Janaka says seems\r\nto be this: Thinking of this prohibition about coveting other people's\r\nproperty, I thought how could it be ascertained what belongs to others.\r\n\r\n90. The sense seems to be this: the property of smell attaches to earth.\r\nI do not desire smell for my own enjoyment. If it is perceived, it is\r\nperceived by the organ of smell. The earth, therefore, is subject to me,\r\nnot I to the earth. I have transcended my sensations, and, therefore, the\r\nobjects to which they inhere. The whole world represents only the objects\r\nof the sensations. The latter being mastered, the whole world has been\r\nmastered by me.\r\n\r\n91. i.e., I live and act for these and not my own self.\r\n\r\n92. Nilakantha's reading is erroneous, Brahma-labhasya should be\r\nBrahmana-bhasya. So also durvarasya is incorrect. Nemi may also mean the\r\nline or track that is made by a wheel as it moves. If taken in this\r\nsense, it would mean 'that is confined to, or that cannot deviate from\r\nthe track constituted by goodness'. The nave, Brahman, is, of course, the\r\nVedas.\r\n\r\n93. The sense seems to be this. The sovereignty of the whole Earth or of\r\nHeaven, and this knowledge of my identity with the universe--of these two\r\nalternatives, I would freely choose the latter. Hence, he says--'This\r\nknowledge is my wealth.'\r\n\r\n94. These are different modes of life.\r\n\r\n95. The sense is this: the knowledge to be acquired is that all is one.\r\nDiverse ways there are for acquiring it. Those, again, that have attained\r\nto tranquillity have acquired it.\r\n\r\n96. Actions are perishable and can lead to no lasting result. It is by\r\nthe understanding that that knowledge, leading to what is permanent, is\r\nto be attained.\r\n\r\n97. I expand this verse a little for making it intelligible. A literal\r\nversion would run as follows: Good means may be seen, perceived as by\r\nbees. Action is (cleansed) understanding; through folly it is invested\r\nwith the symbols of knowledge. Karmabudhhi never means 'action and\r\nknowledge' as rendered by Telang. Abudhitwatt means 'through ignorance.'\r\nThis ignorance is of those persons whose understandings have not been\r\ncleansed by action.\r\n\r\n98. What is stated here is this. In the matter of achieving Emancipation,\r\nno ordinances have been laid down, positive or negative, like those in\r\nrespect of other things. If one wishes to attain to Heaven, he should do\r\nthis and abstain from the other. For achieving Emancipation, however,\r\nonly seeing and hearing are prescribed. Seeing implies contemplation, and\r\nhearing, the receiving of instructions from the preceptor. Nilakantha\r\nexplains hearing as Vedantadisravanam (vide his comment on the word\r\n'srutam' in verse 3 above).\r\n\r\n99. The speaker wishes to inculcate that one should first contemplate an\r\nobject of direct perception, such as earth, etc. Then on such\r\n'unperceived' objects as operations of the mind. Such contemplation will\r\ngradually lead to that which is Supreme. The abhyasa or practice referred\r\nto in the second line is the practice of sama, dama, etc. I do not think\r\nthat Telang's version of 8 and 9 brings out the meaning clearly.\r\n\r\n100. The sense is that when her individual soul became merged into the\r\nSupreme soul, she became identified with Brahman. This, was, of course,\r\ndue to the knowledge of Kshetra as something separate from Kshetrajna.\r\n\r\n101. Their origin is Brahman or Truth. They live, dissociated from their\r\norigin, in consequence of their acts. When their acts cease, they return\r\nto and become merged in Brahman.\r\n\r\n102. i.e., that course of life which has for its object the acquisition\r\nof knowledge relating to the soul. This, of course, includes the\r\nknowledge that is needed for achieving identification with the Supreme\r\nSoul or Brahman.\r\n\r\n103. The specific characteristics of the five elements are, as frequently\r\nreferred before, smell attaching to earth, sound to ether, taste, to\r\nwater, etc. The deities referred to in the last verse are probably the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n104. The total eleven is made up of the three qualities, the five\r\nelements, the group of organs and senses as one, egoism and understanding.\r\n\r\n105. Anyatha pratipannah is explained by Nilakantha as 'born in other\r\norders'. Telang takes it as 'Behaving in a contrary way.' 'How can goats\r\nand sheep behave otherwise?' The sense seems to be that those born as\r\ngoats, succeed in ascending upwards through the efficacy of the religious\r\nacts of the Brahmanas. By becoming sacrificial victims they regain their\r\ntrue position.\r\n\r\n106. Qualities abiding in Darkness etc, imply those qualities that are\r\npermanently attached to Darkness.\r\n\r\n107. Some texts read Santapah and not Sanghatah. The meaning then will be\r\ngrief or sorrow.\r\n\r\n108. This may refer to the exposure of other people's weaknesses by\r\ntearing open their veils or covers.\r\n\r\n109. Vibhajanti implies enjoyments in this connection. Telang starts a\r\nneedless objection to this word.\r\n\r\n110. 'From even a distance.' implies that upon even a cursory view;\r\nwithout even being examined minutely.\r\n\r\n111. What is said here is this: the three qualities exist in even the\r\nimmobile objects of the universe. As regards Darkness, it predominates in\r\nthem. As regards Passion, it dwells in such properties of theirs as\r\npungency, sourness, sweetness, etc, which change with time or in\r\nconsequence of cooking or through admixture. Their only properties are\r\nsaid to appertain to Goodness. Tiryagbhavagatam is explained by\r\nNilakantha as adhikyam gatam. Telang thinks this is unwarrantable. His\r\nown version, however, of the first line is untenable. What can be the\r\ntiryagbhava or 'form of lower species' of immobile objects? Telang\r\nfrequently forgets that Nilakantha represents a school of interpretation\r\nnot founded by him but which existed from a time long anterior to him.\r\n\r\n112. 'Conjunctions' are evidently the periods joining the seasons, i.e.,\r\nthe close of one season and the beginning of another.\r\n\r\n113. This probably implies that the mind, through the aid of the senses,\r\nenters into all things or succeeds in knowing them.\r\n\r\n114. The sense seems to be that through these one succeeds in taking\r\nbirth as a Brahmana.\r\n\r\n115. A repetition occurs here of about 5 verses. The passage is evidently\r\nan interpolation originally caused by carelessness.\r\n\r\n116. Nilakantha explains that this implies that one should regard these\r\nas really undistinguished from the mind. Indeed, created by the mind\r\nitself, these should always be taken as having no real existence beyond\r\nthe mind.\r\n\r\n117. 'That' here refers to the attenuation of all things by absorption\r\ninto the mind.\r\n\r\n118. Gunagunam is treating the qualities as not qualities; i.e.,\r\nregarding bravery, magnanimity, etc, as really not merits, for these lead\r\nto pride. Ekacharyyam is ekantavasam, i.e., life in seclusion, or living\r\nwithout depending upon others. Anantaram is nirastasamastabheda or\r\nnon-recognition of all distinctions. Some texts read Brahmamatah meaning\r\n'existing among Brahmanas'. Ekapadam sukham is samastasukhagarbham, i.e.,\r\nthe source or fountain of all happiness.\r\n\r\n119. The two deities are Jiva and Iswara.\r\n\r\n120. The correct reading, in 53 seems to be samsargabhiratam and not\r\nsamsayabhiratam.\r\n\r\n121. In the second line, the correct words are martya and sarva. The\r\nsense of the second line seems to be that this body is ceaselessly\r\nrevolving, for Emancipation is difficult to achieve. Hence this body is,\r\nas it were, the wheel of Time. Nilakantha's explanation does not seem to\r\nbe satisfactory.\r\n\r\n122. I do not think that Telang is correct in his version of this verse.\r\nWhat is said here seems to be this. The body is, as it were the wheel of\r\nTime; the body is the ocean of delusion; the body is the creator,\r\ndestroyer and reawakener of the universe. Through the body creatures act,\r\nand hence creation, destruction, and re-creation are due to the body.\r\nThis accords with what is said elsewhere regarding the body.\r\n\r\n123. It would be wrong to take satah as implying 'the good,' the finite\r\nverses in every text being singular.\r\n\r\n124. The correct reading seems to be atmana as the last word of the first\r\nline, and not atman.\r\n\r\n125. What is said here is that the quality of passion predominates in\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n126. Nyagrodha is the Ficus Bengalensis, Linn. Jamvu is Eugenia\r\nJambolana, Lamk. Pippala is Ficus religiosa, Linn. Salmali is Bombax\r\nMalabaricum. Sinsapa is Dalbergia Sissoo, Roxb. Meshasringa is Asclepia\r\ngeminata, Roxb. Kichaka is a variety of mountain bamboo. Here however it\r\nevidently implies the Nimba or Melia Azadirachta, Linn.\r\n\r\n127. Nilakantha is for taking the second line as consisting of two\r\npropositions. It would be better to take satinam as referring to strinam,\r\nand vasumatyah, as an adjective of Apsarasah.\r\n\r\n128. The sense seems to be that good men never allow others to know what\r\ntheir acts are. They are strangers to ostentation.\r\n\r\n129. The sense seems to be that the knowledge of one's own identity and\r\nof things as discriminated from one another is presided over by Prakriti.\r\nIf the question is asked whence is the knowledge--'I am so,' and that\r\n'this is so,' the answer is that it comes from Prakriti or Nature.\r\n\r\n130. As explained by Nilakantha, the word Savitri is used here to imply\r\nall forms of worship observed by Brahmanas, etc, and the Mlecchas as\r\nwell. This turning back to explain a word used before is said to be an\r\ninstance of \"looking back like the lion\".\r\n\r\n131. Telang, I think, renders this verse wrongly. In the first line it is\r\nsaid that Brahman is superior to the Prajapatis. In the second it is\r\npointed out that Vishnu is superior to Brahman.\r\n\r\n132. It is difficult to understand which part of the wheel is intended to\r\nbe expressedly 'bandhanam' or the bond; I take it for the spokes.\r\nPariskandha is Samuha or the materials that together compose an object.\r\nHere it may be taken for the nave or centre. Home is called the\r\ncircumference, because, as the circumference limits the wheel, even so\r\nhome (wife and children) limits the affections and acts of life.\r\n\r\n133. The words Kalachakram pravartate have been rendered in the first\r\nverse of this lesson. In verse 9, the words asaktaprabhavapavyam are\r\nexplained by Nilakantha differently. Manas-krantam, I take, is equivalent\r\nto 'be bounded by the mind,' I do not know whence Telang gets 'never\r\nfatigued' as the substitute of this word.\r\n\r\n134. Implying that he should go to the house of his preceptor, study and\r\nserve there, and after completing his course, return for leading a life\r\nof domesticity.\r\n\r\n135. The sense seems to be that these last three duties are productive of\r\nmerit and should, therefore, be performed. The first three however, are\r\nsources of living.\r\n\r\n136. Havishya is food cooked in a particular way and offered to the\r\ndeities. It must be free from meat. There may be milk or ghee in it, but\r\nthe cooking must be done in a single pot or vessel continuously; no\r\nchange of vessels is allowed.\r\n\r\n137. Vilwa is the Aegle marmelos, and Palasa is the Butea frondosa of\r\nRoxburgh.\r\n\r\n138. At first he should live on fruits and roots and leaves, etc. Next on\r\nwater, and then on air. There are different sects of forests recluses.\r\nThe course of life is settled at the time of the initiatory rites.\r\n\r\n139. What is stated here is this. The Sannyasin should not ask for alms:\r\nor, if he ever seeks for aims, he should seek them in a village or house\r\nwhere the cooking has been already done and where every one has already\r\neaten. This limitation is provided as otherwise the Sannyasin may be fed\r\nto his fill by the householder who sees him.\r\n\r\n140. He should never plunge into a stream or lake or tank for bathing.\r\n\r\n141. Kalakankhi implies, probably 'simply biding time', i.e., allowing\r\ntime to pass indifferently over him.\r\n\r\n142. The sense seems to be this; the self or soul is without qualities.\r\nHe who knows the self, or rather he who pursues the self with the desire\r\nof knowing it, should practise the truths of Piety laid down above. They\r\nconstitute the path that leads to the self.\r\n\r\n143. 'That which has Brahman for its origin' implies the Vedas.\r\n\r\n144. Commentators differ about what is implied by the ten or the twelve.\r\nNilakantha thinks that the ten mean the eight characteristics of Yoga,\r\nviz., Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana,\r\nSamadhi, and Tarka and Vairagya. The twelve would imply the first eight,\r\nand these four, viz., Maitri, Karuna, Mudita, and Upeksha. If ten plus\r\ntwelve or two and twenty be taken, then that number would be made up by\r\nthe five modes of Yama, the five of Niyama, the remaining six of Yoga\r\n(beginning with Asana and ending with Samadhi), the four beginning with\r\nMaitri, and the two, viz., Tarka and Vairagya.\r\n\r\n145. What is said in this Lesson seems to be this: the Unmanifest or\r\nPrakriti is that condition in which all the three qualities of Goodness,\r\nPassion, and Darkness exist in a state of combination. The unmanifest is\r\nthe condition existing before creation. When one particular quality,\r\nviz., Goodness prevails over the others, there arises Purusha, viz., that\r\nfrom whom everything flows. The relation of Purusha and Nature is both\r\nunity and diversity. The three illustrations of the Gnat and the Udumbara\r\nthe fish and water, and water drops and the lotus leaf, explain the\r\nrelation between Purusha and Nature. He is in Nature, yet different from\r\nit. There is both association and dissociation.\r\n\r\n146. The doubts appertain to duties, that is whether they should be done\r\nor not, and whether they have any effects here and hereafter.\r\n\r\n147. The thinking or enjoying agent is subject, and that which is thought\r\nor enjoyed is object. Subject and object an two well known words in Sir\r\nW. Hamilton's philosophy. I follow Telang in adopting them.\r\n\r\n148. Sattawa pradipa, rendered 'light of Nature,' implies, as Nilakantha\r\nexplains, knowledge, which is a manifestation of Nature. Arjuna Misra's\r\ninterpretation seems to be better. He says that knowledge,--that is,\r\nknowledge of truth,--is acquired by the self through Nature.\r\n\r\n149. The sense seems to be this: one who proceeds, on a journey must\r\nprovide oneself with the necessary means, otherwise one is sure to feel\r\ndiscomfort or meet with even destruction. So, in the journey of life, one\r\nmust provide oneself with knowledge as the means. One may then avoid all\r\ndiscomfort and danger. Action does not constitute the proper means. It\r\nmay or may not produce fruits.\r\n\r\n150. i.e., one should not care for the external.\r\n\r\n151. i.e., one need not do acts enjoined by the scriptures after one has\r\nattained to knowledge which is the highest seat.\r\n\r\n152. The sense is this: riding on a car may not always be comfortable. As\r\nlong as there is a car path, one should travel on one's car. If, however,\r\nthe road be such as not to be fit for a car to proceed along it, one\r\nshould avoid a car in going over it, for the car instead of conducing to\r\ncomfort, would, on such a path, be productive of only discomfort.\r\n\r\n153. i.e., first action with desire: then action without desire; then\r\nknowledge, according to Arjuna Misra. Nilakantha explains that action is\r\nfirst, then Yoga; then the state of Hansa or Paramahansa.\r\n\r\n154. Katu is not bitter but pungent or sharp, as that which is attached\r\nto chillies.\r\n\r\n155. These are the notes of the Hindu Gamut.\r\n\r\n156. The understanding operates on what is placed before it by the mind.\r\nThe understanding, therefore, is, as it were, the lord exercising power\r\nor sovereignty, being served by the mind.\r\n\r\n157. Sarvan srijati i.e., creates all things by attaining to the\r\ncondition of the universal cause, for the unmanifest is the universal\r\ncause. Between such a one and the Supreme Soul there is no difference.\r\nEven this is said in the last sentence.\r\n\r\n158. The man who reads the book called Veda is not truly conversant with\r\nthe Veda. He, however, who knows Kshetrajna, is regarded as truly knowing\r\nthe Veda.\r\n\r\n159. The argument is that Mrityu or death being of two syllables, the\r\ncorrespondence is justifiable between it and Mama or mineness which also\r\nis of two syllables. So in the case of Brahman and na-mama. Of course,\r\nwhat is meant by mineness being death and not-mineness being Brahman or\r\nemancipation, cannot be unintelligible to one who has carefully read the\r\npreceding sections.\r\n\r\n160. i.e., the five great elements, four organs of knowledge with mind,\r\nand the four organs of action.\r\n\r\n161. The word Purusha here is used in the sense of dehabhimani Jiva or\r\nindividual self with consciousness of body. True knowledge destroys this\r\ncondition of Jiva, for the man of knowledge identifies himself with the\r\nuniverse and thereby assimilates himself to Brahman. By eaters of Amrita\r\nare meant they who never take any food without offering portions thereof\r\nto the deities, Pitris, and guests. Of course, Yogins of piety are\r\nimplied by it.\r\n\r\n162. Purusha here implies Jiva divested of consciousness of body.\r\n\r\n163. The meaning is this: in a dream what is seen is all unreal. So, when\r\ntranquillity has been attained, all the surroundings become unreal.\r\nNilakantha gives a slightly different interpretation; it is this: when\r\ntranquillity has been attained, the Soul lives without attachment to the\r\nbody and all external objects. Indeed, the Soul then lives completely in\r\nitself even as it works in course of a dream.\r\n\r\n164. The sense is that they behold all worldly objects, present, past and\r\nfuture, which are, of course, due to development of previous causes.\r\n\r\n165. This line is rather obscure. The sense seems to be this: no one can\r\nknow the Supreme Deity if it is not the latter's pleasure to be known.\r\nOne, therefore, understands Him in exactly that measure in which it is\r\nHis pleasure to be known.\r\n\r\n166. Krishna's father Vasudeva is maternal uncle. Yudhishthira asks\r\nKrishna to worship Vasudeva and Valadeva on his behalf, i.e., he charges\r\nKrishna to bear to them a message of respect and love from him.\r\n\r\n167. The city of Hastinapura is sometimes called Nagapura, both Hasti and\r\nNaga being words expressive of the elephant. 'The city called after the\r\nelephant' is the usual description of the Kuru capital.\r\n\r\n168. Mahyam is equal to 'mam uddisya' i.e., referring to my divine nature.\r\n\r\n169. An ascetic loses his penances by cursing another rightly or wrongly.\r\nHence, forgiveness was always practised by the Brahmanas who were\r\nascetics. A Brahmana's strength consisted in forgiveness. The more\r\nforgiving he was, the more powerful he became.\r\n\r\n170. The first asat or non-existent refers to such objects as the horns\r\nof the hare. The second, viz., sadasat, or existent and non-existent\r\nrefers to such objects as exist and meet with destruction. Sadasat param\r\nor that which transcends the existent and non-existent, refers to the\r\nunmanifest. The universe consists of these three. All this is from\r\nVasudeva.\r\n\r\n171. To this day preceptors in India have to feed and teach their\r\ndisciples without any pecuniary compensation. In fact, the sale of\r\nknowledge has been strictly forbidden. Pupils, however, after completing\r\ntheir studies, had to give the final Dakshina which varied according to\r\ntheir means. The kings and princes of India thought themselves honoured\r\nif solicited by pupils in search of the final Dakshina. What Gautama says\r\nhere is that the object of the final present is to gratify the preceptor.\r\nHe (Gautama), however, had already been gratified with the dutiful\r\nconduct of Utanka. There was no need, therefore, of any present.\r\n\r\n172. These words of the king are intended to be reported to his queen who\r\nwould understand the allusion. The sense is this: cursed by Vasishtha, I\r\nhave become a cannibal. My condition is intolerable. By this gift of the\r\near-rings to a deserving Brahmana, much merit may arise. That merit may\r\nrelieve me.\r\n\r\n173. This also is an allusion to the dreadful curse of Vasishtha. The\r\nking refers to Madayanti as his only refuge. She may save him by doing an\r\nact or special merit, viz., giving away her costly ear-rings to a truly\r\ndeserving Brahmana.\r\n\r\n174. The sense is this: a Brahmana is never loose of tongue. He is\r\ntruthful. Hence, having passed my word to thee about my return, thou\r\nmayst be sure that I would keep my word. One, again, that acts improperly\r\ntowards a friend, comes to be regarded as a thief. By this, Utanka\r\nreminds the king that he should not inflict any wrong on him by carrying\r\nout his intention of eating him up.\r\n\r\n175. Vilwa is the Aegle marmalos.\r\n\r\n176. Chamu here is used in a general sense, viz., a division. Of course\r\nit stands for an Akshauhini.\r\n\r\n177. Kavi or Kavya is another name of Sukra, the preceptor of the Daityas.\r\n\r\n178. Krishna implies Vyasa here. The great Rishi was called 'the\r\nisland-born Krishna'.\r\n\r\n179. The commentator explains that by the constellation Dhruba is implied\r\nRohini and the Uttaras numbering three. Sunday, again is called the\r\nDhruba-day.\r\n\r\n180. Agnivesya was another name of Dhaumya.\r\n\r\n181. Three roads running north to south, and three running cast to west\r\nand intersecting the former, are the six roads that are directed to be\r\nlaid out in pitching encampments. Those give nine squares with two\r\nboundary lines at right angles with each other.\r\n\r\n182. Karaputa is made up of two wooden chests united with each other by\r\nchains or cords and intended to be borne by camels and bullocks.\r\n\r\n183. The first line of 17 is exceedingly terse. Literally rendered, it\r\nruns,--'Each vessel was united with another, and became half the (total)\r\nweight slung on balance.'\r\n\r\n184. Vilava is Arjuna.\r\n\r\n185. Before performing any rite or act of a grave nature, Hindus are\r\nrequired to touch water or perform what is called the 'achamana'. A\r\nlittle quantity of water is taken on the palm of the right hand, and with\r\nit are touched the lips, the nostrils, the ears, and the eyes.\r\n\r\n186. The abode of Vaisravana is called Alaka. Vaisravana is, of course,\r\nKuvera, the lord of treasures, friend of Mahadeva, and chief of the\r\nYakshas.\r\n\r\n187. The last line is slightly expanded.\r\n\r\n188. The sense is this: thou art the eldest brother of the Pandavas; if\r\nthou sacrificest, thy brothers also will come to be regarded as\r\nsacrificing with thee.\r\n\r\n189. Sphya was a wooden sword or scimitar, used for slaying the\r\nsacrificial animal. Kurcha is a handful of Kusa grass. All these things\r\nare directed by Vyasa to be made of pure gold.\r\n\r\n190. It will be remembered that the Samsaptaka host which had engaged\r\nArjuna for several days on the field of Kurukshetra, all consisted of\r\nTrigarta warriors led by their king Susarman, Samsaptaka means 'sworn'.\r\nThose soldiers who took the oath that they would either conquer or die,\r\nwore called by that name.\r\n\r\n191. The reading in every edition seems to be vicious. For obvious\r\nreasons, I read Parthadupadravat instead of Parthamupadravat.\r\n\r\n192. Bhagadatta was the friend of Indra, the father of Arjuna.\r\n\r\n193. The allusion is to Mahadeva's pursuing Sacrifice when the latter\r\nfled from him in the form of a deer.\r\n\r\n194. The Brahmanas were to receive Arjuna duly and the treasure was\r\nintended as a present or offering of respect.\r\n\r\n195. Ulupi was one of the wives of Arjuna. She was, therefore, the\r\nstep-mother of Vabhruvahana.\r\n\r\n196. Yahubharyyata, meaning polygamy in the first line, should, as the\r\nnoun of reference for Eshah be taken as vahunam bharyyata, i.e.,\r\npolyandry, in the second line.\r\n\r\n197. To sit in Praya is to remain seated in a particular spot, abstaining\r\nfrom food and drink with a view to cast off one's life-breaths.\r\n\r\n198. The sense is, that 'grief does not kill; one does not die till one's\r\nhour comes. If it were otherwise, I would have died, so heavy is the load\r\nof my affliction.'\r\n\r\n199. The name of the city was Suktimati.\r\n\r\n200. The etymology of Gudakesa as the lord of Gudaka or sleep, is\r\nfanciful.\r\n\r\n201. Sakuni was the maternal uncle of Duryodhana and, therefore, of\r\nArjuna also. Sakuni's son and Arjuna, hence, were cousins.\r\n\r\n202. The word chara does not mean always a spy. The ancient kings of\r\nIndia had their spies it is true, but they had a regular intelligence\r\ndepartment. It was the business of these men to send correct reports to\r\nthe king of every important occurrence. The news letter-writers of the\r\nMussalman time, or Harkaras, were the successors of the charas of Hindu\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n203. Hetuvadins are dialecticians or philosophers who dispute on the\r\nreasons of things.\r\n\r\n204. It is worthy of note that Draupadi was always styled by Krishna as\r\nhis sakhi or 'friend'. Krishna was highly chivalrous to the other sex at\r\nan age when women were universally regarded as the inferiors of men.\r\n\r\n205. The sense is this: for a horse-sacrifice, the Dakshina or\r\nsacrificial present, payable to the principal Ritwija or to be\r\ndistributed among all the Ritwijas including the other Brahmanas, is\r\nenjoined to be of a certain measure. Vyasa advises Yudhishthira to make\r\nthat Dakshina triple of what the enjoined measure is. By thus increasing\r\nthe Dakshina, the merit of the sacrificer will increase correspondingly.\r\n\r\n206. The Diksha is the ceremony of initiation. Certain mantras are\r\nuttered in which the intention is declared of performing what is desired\r\nto be performed.\r\n\r\n207. The Karma of a sacrifice or religious rite is the procedure. It is,\r\nof course, laid down in the scriptures on the ritual. There are certain\r\nacts, however, which, though not laid down, should be done agreeably to\r\nreasonable inferences. What is said, therefore, in the second line of 20\r\nis that the procedure was fully followed, both as laid down and as\r\nconsistent with inferences.\r\n\r\n208. Pravargya is a special preliminary rite performed in a sacrifice.\r\n'Abhishva' is the extraction of the juice of the Soma plant after its\r\nconsecration with Mantras.\r\n\r\n209. Vitwa is the Aegle marmelos, Linn. Khadira is Acacia catechu, Linn,\r\nor Mimosa catechu; Saravarnin is otherwise called, as explained by\r\nNilakantha, Palasa. It is the Butea frondosa of Roxburgh. Devadaru is\r\nPinus Deodara of Roxburgh, or Cedruz Deodara. Sleshmataka is a small tree\r\nidentified with the Cordia latifolia. Here probably, some other tree is\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n210. It is difficult to understand what these constructions or figures\r\nwere. They were probably figures drawn on the sacrificial altar, with\r\ngold-dust. At the present day, powdered rice, coloured red, yellow, blue,\r\netc, is used.\r\n\r\n211. Each animal is supposed to be agreeable to a particular deity.\r\n\r\n212. Suvibhaktan implies that they were properly classed or grouped so\r\nthat there was no dispute or dissatisfaction among them regarding\r\nquestions of precedence.\r\n\r\n213. Nilakantha explains that Khandavaraga was made of piper longum and\r\ndried ginger (powdered), and the juice of Phaseolus Mungo, with sugar.\r\nProbably, it is identical with what is now called Mungka laddu in the\r\nbazars of Indian towns.\r\n\r\n214. The unccha vow consists of subsisting upon grains of corn picked up\r\nafter the manner of the pigeon from the field after the crops have been\r\ncut and removed by the owners.\r\n\r\n215. The day of 12 hours is divided into 8 divisions.\r\n\r\n216. A prastha is made up of four Kudavas. A Kudava is equal to about\r\ntwelve double handfuls.\r\n\r\n217. This verse is rather obscure. I am not sure that I have understood\r\nit correctly. The sense seems to be this: thou art capable of enduring\r\nmuch. Indeed, by barely living, thou art capable of capable of earning\r\nreligious merit, for life-breath is a great deity. He should not be cast\r\noff. Thy life is at stake, for if this guest be not gratified, the\r\nthought of it will kill thee. Do thou, therefore, protect thy life by\r\ngratifying this guest with my share of the barley.\r\n\r\n218. The sense is this: for the sake of those auspicious results after\r\nwhich every family should strive, the daughter-in-law should be well\r\ntreated. How then can I deprive thee of food?\r\n\r\n219. The Diksha consists of the initiatory rites undergone by one\r\ndesirous of performing a particular sacrifice or completing a particular\r\nvow. Some auspicious day is selected. Mantras are uttered and the purpose\r\nis expressed in words. There were many long-extending sacrifices which\r\nwere partly of the nature of vows. Till their completion the performer or\r\nobserver is said to undergo the period of Diksha.\r\n\r\n220. The first line of 20 is differently read in the Bombay text. It\r\nruns,--'steadfastly observing my vow, I shall make arrangements for many\r\nsacrifices, creating the articles I want by thought alone (or fiats of my\r\nwill).'\r\n\r\n221. Probably, the sense is this: If a Brahmana produced extraordinary\r\nresults by his penances, a portion of his penances was supposed to be\r\ndestroyed. The Rishis did not like that any portion of Agastya's penances\r\nshould be spent for completing his sacrifice.\r\n\r\n222. It is difficult to resist the conviction that as much of this\r\nsection as relates to the mongoose is an interpolation. The Brahmanas\r\ncould not bear the idea of a sacrifice with such profusion of gifts, as\r\nthat of Yudhishthira, being censurable. Hence the invention about the\r\ntransformation of the mongoose. Truly speaking, the doctrine is noble of\r\nthe gift of a small quantity of barley made under the circumstances being\r\nsuperior in point of merit to even a Horse-sacrifice performed by a king\r\nwith gifts in profusion made to the Brahmanas"
