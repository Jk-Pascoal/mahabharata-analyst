Additional proofing and\r\nformatting at sacred-texts.com, by J. B. Hare, October 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n(Jalapradanika-parva)\r\n\r\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana and Nara, the foremost of male\r\nbeings, and unto the goddess Sarasvati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"After Duryodhana had fallen and after all the warriors\r\nalso had fallen, what, O sage, did king Dhritarashtra do on receipt of\r\nthe intelligence? What also did the high-souled Kuru king Yudhishthira,\r\nthe son of Dharma, do? What did the three survivors (of the Kuru army)\r\nviz. Kripa and the others do? I have heard everything about the feats of\r\nAshvatthama. Tell me what happened after that mutual denunciation of\r\ncurses. Tell me all that Sanjaya said unto the blind old king.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After he had lost his century of sons, king\r\nDhritarashtra, afflicted with grief on that account, cheerless, and\r\nlooking like a tree shorn of its branches, became overwhelmed with\r\nanxiety and lost his power of speech. Possessed of great wisdom, Sanjaya,\r\napproaching the monarch, addressed him, saying, Why dost thou grieve, O\r\nmonarch? Grief does not serve any purpose. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of\r\ncombatants, O king, have been slain! The earth hath become desolate, and\r\nis almost empty now! Kings of diverse realms, hailing from diverse\r\nquarters, united with thy son (for aiding him in battle) have all laid\r\ndown their lives. Let now the obsequial rites of thy sires and sons and\r\ngrandsons and kinsmen and friends and preceptors be performed in due\r\norder.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Destitute of sons and counsellors and all his\r\nfriends, king Dhritarashtra of great energy suddenly fell down on the\r\nearth like a tree uprooted by the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, Destitute as I am of sons and counsellors and all my\r\nfriends, I shall, without doubt have to wander in sorrow over the earth.\r\nWhat need have I now of life itself, left as I am of kinsmen and friends\r\nand resembling as I do a bird shorn of its wings and afflicted with\r\ndecrepitude? Shorn of kingdom, deprived of kinsmen, and destitute of\r\neyes, I cannot, O thou of great wisdom, shine any longer on earth like a\r\nluminary shorn of its splendours! I did not follow the counsels of\r\nfriends of Jamadagnis son, of the celestial rishi Narada, and of\r\nisland-born Krishna, while they offered me counsel. In the midst of the\r\nassembly, Krishna told me what was for my good, saying, \"A truce (tense)\r\nto hostilities, O king! Let thy son take the whole kingdom! Give but five\r\nvillages to the Pandavas!\" Fool that I was, for not following that\r\nadvice, I am now obliged to repent so poignantly! I did not listen to the\r\nrighteous counsels of Bhishma. Alas, having heard of the slaughter of\r\nDuryodhana whose roars were as deep as those of a bull, having heard also\r\nof the death of Duhshasana and the extinction of Karna and the setting of\r\nthe Drona-sun, my heart does not break into pieces. I do not, O Sanjaya,\r\nremember any evil act committed by me in former days, whose consequences,\r\nfool that I am, I am suffering today. Without doubt, I committed great\r\nsins in my former lives, for which the Supreme Ordainer has set me to\r\nendure such a measure of grief. This destruction of all my kinsmen, this\r\nextermination of all my well-wishers and friends, at this old age, has\r\ncome upon me through the force of Destiny. What other man is there on\r\nearth who is more afflicted than my wretched self? Since it is so, let\r\nthe Pandavas behold me this very day firmly resolved to betake myself to\r\nthe long way that leads to the regions of Brahman!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"While king Dhritarashtra was indulging in such\r\nlamentations, Sanjaya addressed him in the following words for dispelling\r\nhis grief, Cast off thy grief, O monarch! Thou hast heard the conclusions\r\nof the Vedas and the contents of diverse scriptures and holy writ, from\r\nthe lips of the old, O king! Thou hast heard those words which the sages\r\nsaid unto Sanjaya while the latter was afflicted with grief on account of\r\nthe death of his son. When thy son, O monarch, caught the pride that is\r\nborn of youth, thou didst not accept the counsels offered unto thee by\r\nthy well-wishers. Desirous of fruit, thou didst not, through\r\ncovetousness, do what was really for thy benefit. Thy own intelligence,\r\nlike a sharp sword, has wounded thee. Thou didst generally pay court to\r\nthose that were of wicked behaviour. Thy son had Duhshasana for his\r\ncounsellor, and the wicked-souled son of Radha, and the equally wicked\r\nShakuni and Citrasena of foolish understanding, and Salya. Thy son (by\r\nhis own behaviour) made the whole world his enemy. Thy son, O Bharata,\r\ndid not obey the words of Bhishma, the reverend chief of the Kurus, of\r\nGandhari and Vidura, of Drona, O king, of Kripa the son of Sharadvata, of\r\nthe mighty-armed Krishna, of the intelligent Narada, of many other\r\nrishis, and of Vyasa himself of immeasurable energy. Though possessed of\r\nprowess, thy son was of little intelligence, proud, always desirous of\r\nbattle, wicked, ungovernable, and discontented. Thou art possessed of\r\nlearning and intelligence and art always truthful. They that are so\r\nrighteous and possessed of such intelligence as thou, are never stupefied\r\nby grief. Virtue was regarded by none of them. Battle was the one word on\r\ntheir lips. For this the Kshatriya order has been exterminated and the\r\nfame of thy foes enhanced. Thou hadst occupied the position of an umpire,\r\nbut thou didst not utter one word of salutary advise. Unfitted as thou\r\nwert for the task, thou didst not hold the scales evenly. Every person\r\nshould, at the outset, adopt such a beneficial line of action that he may\r\nnot have, in the end, to repent for something already done by him.\r\nThrough affection for thy son, O monarch, thou didst what was agreeable\r\nto Duryodhana. Thou art obliged to repent for that now. It behoveth thee,\r\nhowever not to give way to grief. The man whose eyes are directed towards\r\nonly the honey without being once directed to the fall, meets with\r\ndestruction through his covetousness for honey. Such a man is obliged to\r\nrepent even like thee. The man who indulges in grief never wins wealth.\r\nBy grieving one loses the fruits one desires. Grief is again an obstacle\r\nto the acquisition of objects dear to us. The man who gives way to grief\r\nloses even his salvation. The man who shrouds a burning coal within the\r\nfolds of his attire and is burnt by the fire that is kindled by it, would\r\nbe pronounced a fool if he grieves for his injuries. Thyself, with thy\r\nson, hadst, with your words, fanned the Partha-fire, and with your\r\ncovetousness acting as clarified butter caused that fire to blaze forth,\r\ninto consuming flames. When that fire thus blazed forth thy sons fell\r\ninto it like insects. It behoveth thee not, however, to grieve for them\r\nnow that they have all been burnt in the fire of the enemys arrow. The\r\ntear-stained face, O king, which thou bearest now is not approved by the\r\nscriptures or praised by the wise. These tears, like sparks of fire, burn\r\nthe dead for whom they are shed. Kill thy grief with thy intelligence,\r\nand bear thyself up with the strength of thy own self! Thus was the king\r\ncomforted by the high-souled Sanjaya. Vidura then, O scorcher of foes,\r\nonce again addressed the king, displaying great intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Listen, O Janamejaya, to the nectar-like words that\r\nVidura said unto the son of Vicitravirya and by which he gladdened that\r\nbull among men!\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, Rise, O king! Why art thou stretched on the earth? Bear\r\nthyself up with thy own self. O king, even this is the final end of all\r\nliving creatures. Everything massed together ends in destruction;\r\neverything that gets high is sure to fall down. Union is certain to end\r\nin separation; life is sure to end in death. The destroyer, O Bharata,\r\ndrags both the hero and the coward. Why then, O bull amongst Kshatriyas,\r\nshould not Kshatriyas engage in battle? He that does not fight is seen to\r\nescape with life. When, however, ones time comes, O king, one cannot\r\nescape. As regards living creatures, they are non-existent at first. They\r\nexist in the period that intervenes. In the end they once more become\r\nnon-existent. What matter of grief then is there in this? The man that\r\nindulges in grief succeeds not in meeting with the dead. By indulging in\r\ngrief, one does not himself die. When the course of the world is such,\r\nwhy dost thou indulge in sorrow? Death drags all creatures, even the\r\ngods. There is none dear or hateful to death, O best of the Kurus! As the\r\nwind tears off the tops of all blades of grass, even so, O bull of\r\nBharatas race, death overmasters all creatures. All creatures are like\r\nmembers of a caravan bound for the same destination. (When death will\r\nencounter all) it matters very little whom he meets with first. It\r\nbehoveth thee not, O king, to grieve for those that have been slain in\r\nbattle. If the scriptures are any authority, all of them must have\r\nobtained the highest end. All of them were versed in the Vedas; all of\r\nthem had observed vows. Facing the foe all of them have met with death.\r\nWhat matter of sorrow is there in this? Invisible they had been (before\r\nbirth). Having come from that unknown region, they have once more become\r\ninvisible. They are not thine, nor art thou theirs. What grief then is\r\nthere in such disappearance? If slain, one wins heaven. By slaying, fame\r\nis won. Both these, with respect to us, are productive of great merit.\r\nBattle, therefore, is not bootless. No doubt, Indra will contrive for\r\nthem regions capable of granting every wish. These, O bull among men,\r\nbecome the guests of Indra. Men cannot, by sacrifices with profuse gifts,\r\nby ascetic penances and by learning, go so speedily to heaven as heroes\r\nslain in battle. On the bodies of hostile heroes constituting the\r\nsacrificial fire, they poured their arrowy libations. Possessed of great\r\nenergy, they had in return to endure the arrowy libations (poured upon\r\nthem by their enemies). I tell thee, O king, that for a Kshatriya in this\r\nworld there is not a better road to heaven than battle! They were all\r\nhigh-souled Kshatriyas; possessed of bravery, they were ornaments of\r\nassemblies. They have attained to a high state of blessedness. They are\r\nnot persons for whom we should grieve. Comforting thyself by thy own self\r\ncease to grieve, O bull among men! It behoveth thee not to suffer thyself\r\nto be overwhelmed with sorrow and to abandon all actions. There are\r\nthousands of mothers and fathers and sons and wives in this world. Whose\r\nare they, and whose are we? From day to day thousands of causes spring up\r\nfor sorrow and thousands of causes for fear. These, however, affect the\r\nignorant but are nothing to him that is wise. There is none dear or\r\nhateful to Time, O best of the Kurus! Time is indifferent to none. All\r\nare equally dragged by Time. Time causeth all creatures to grow, and it\r\nis Time that destroyeth everything. When all else is asleep, Time is\r\nawake. Time is irresistible. Youth, beauty, life, possessions, health,\r\nand the companionship of friends, all are unstable. He that is wise will\r\nnever covet any of these. It behoveth thee not to grieve for what is\r\nuniversal. A person may, by indulging in grief, himself perish, but grief\r\nitself, by being indulged in, never becomes light. Ifthou feelest thy\r\ngrief to be heavy, it should be counteracted by not indulging in it. Even\r\nthis is the medicine for grief, viz., that one should not indulge in it.\r\nBy dwelling on it, one cannot lessen it. On the other hand, it grows with\r\nindulgence. Upon the advent of evil or upon the bereavement of something\r\nthat is dear, only they that are of little intelligence suffer their\r\nminds to be afflicted with grief. This is neither Profit, nor Religion,\r\nnor Happiness, on which thy heart is dwelling. The indulgence of grief is\r\nthe certain means of ones losing ones objects. Through it, one falls away\r\nfrom the three great ends of life (religion, profit, and pleasure). They\r\nthat are destitute of contentment, are stupefied on the accession of\r\nvicissitudes dependent upon the possession of wealth. They, however, that\r\nare wise, are on the other hand, unaffected by such vicissitudes. One\r\nshould kill mental grief by wisdom, just as physical grief should be\r\nkilled by medicine. Wisdom hath this power. They, however, that are\r\nfoolish, can never obtain tranquillity of soul. The acts of a former life\r\nclosely follow a man, insomuch that they lie by him when he lies down,\r\nstay by him when he stays, and run with him when he runs. In those\r\nconditions of life in which one acts well or ill, one enjoys or suffers\r\nthe fruit thereof in similar conditions. In those forms (of physical\r\norganisation) in which one performs particular acts, one enjoys or\r\nsuffers the fruits thereof in similar forms. Ones own self is ones own\r\nfriend, as, indeed, ones own self is ones own enemy. Ones own self is the\r\nwitness of ones acts, good and evil. From good acts springs a state of\r\nhappiness, from sinful deeds springs woe. One always obtains the fruit of\r\nones acts. One never enjoys or suffers weal or woe that is not the fruit\r\nof ones own acts. Intelligent persons like thee, O king, never sink in\r\nsinful enormities that are disapproved by knowledge and that strike at\r\nthe very root (of virtue and happiness).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, O thou of great wisdom, my grief has been dispelled\r\nby thy excellent words! I desire, however, to again hear thee speak. How,\r\nindeed, do those that are wise free themselves from mental grief born of\r\nthe advent of evils and the bereavement of objects that are dear?\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, He that is wise obtains tranquillity by subduing both grief\r\nand joy through means by which one may escape from grief and joy. All\r\nthose things about which we are anxious, O bull among men, are ephemeral.\r\nThe world is like a plantain tree, without enduring strength. Since the\r\nwise and the foolish, the rich and the poor, all, divested of their\r\nanxieties, sleep on the crematorium, with bodies reft of flesh and full\r\nof bare bones and shrivelled sinews, whom amongst them will the survivors\r\nlook upon as possessed of distinguishing marks by which the attributes of\r\nbirth and beauty may be ascertained? (When all are equal in death) why\r\nshould human beings, whose understandings are always deceived (by the\r\nthings of this world) covet one anothers rank and position? The learned\r\nsay that the bodies of men are like houses. In time these are destroyed.\r\nThere is one being, however, that is eternal. As a person, casting off\r\none attire, whether old or new, wears another, even such is the case with\r\nthe bodies of all embodied beings. O son of Vicitravirya, creatures\r\nobtain weal or woe as the fruit of their own acts. Through their acts\r\nthey obtain heaven, O Bharata, or bliss, or woe. Whether able or unable,\r\nthey have to bear their burdens which are the result of their own acts.\r\nAs amongst earthen pots some break while still on the potters wheel, some\r\nwhile partially shaped, some as soon as brought into shape, some after\r\nremoval from the wheel, some while in course of being removed, some after\r\nremoval, some while wet, some while dry, some while being burnt, some\r\nwhile being removed from the kiln, some after removal therefrom, and some\r\nwhile being used, even such is the case with the bodies of embodied\r\ncreatures. Some are destroyed while yet in the womb, some after coming\r\nout of the womb, some on the day after, some on the expiration of a\r\nfortnight or of a month, some on the expiration of a year or of two\r\nyears, some in youth, some in middle age, and some when old. Creatures\r\nare born or destroyed according to their acts in previous lives. When\r\nsuch is the course of the world, why do you then indulge in grief? As\r\nmen, while swimming in sport on the water, sometimes dive and sometimes\r\nemerge, O king, even so creatures sink and emerge in lifes stream. They\r\nthat are of little wisdom suffer or meet with destruction as the result\r\nof their own acts. They, however, that are wise, observant of virtue, and\r\ndesirous of doing good unto all living creatures, they, acquainted with\r\nthe real nature of the appearance of creatures in this world, attain at\r\nlast to the highest end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, O foremost speakers, how may the wilderness of this\r\nworld be known? I desire to hear this. Asked by me, tell me this.\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, I will describe to thee all the acts of creatures from\r\ntheir first conception. At the outset it lives in the admixture of blood\r\nand the vital fluid. Then it grows little by little. Then on the expiry\r\nof the fifth month it assumes shape. It next becomes a foetus with all\r\nits limbs completed, and lives in a very impure place, covered with flesh\r\nand blood. Then, through the action of the wind, its lower limbs are\r\nturned upwards and the head comes downwards. Arriving in this posture at\r\nthe mouth of the uterus, it suffers manifold woes. In consequence of the\r\ncontractions of the uterus, the creature then comes out of it, endued\r\nwith the results of all his previous acts. He then encounters in this\r\nworld other evils that rush towards him. Calamities proceed towards him\r\nlike dogs at the scent of meat. Next diverse diseases approach him while\r\nhe is enchained by his previous acts. Bound by the chains of the senses\r\nand women and wealth and other sweet things of life, diverse evil\r\npractices also approach him then, O king! Seized by these, he never\r\nobtains happiness. At that season he succeeds not in obtaining the fruit\r\nof his acts, right or wrong. They, however, that set their hearts on\r\nreflection, succeed in protecting their souls. The person governed by his\r\nsenses does not know that death has come at his door. At last, dragged by\r\nthe messengers of the Destroyer, he meets with destruction at the\r\nappointed time. Agitated by his senses, for whatever good and evil has\r\nbeen done at the outset and having enjoyed or suffered the fruits of\r\nthese, he once more becomes indifferent to his acts of self-slaughter.\r\nAlas, the world is deceived, and covetousness brings it under its\r\ndominion. Deprived of understanding by covetousness, wrath, and fear, one\r\nknows not ones own self. Filled with joy at ones own respectability of\r\nbirth, one is seen to traduce those that are not high-born. Swelled also\r\nwith pride of wealth, one is seen to contemn the poor. One regards others\r\nto be ignorant fools, but seldom takes a survey of ones own self. One\r\nattributes faults to others but is never desirous to punish ones own\r\nself. Since the wise and the ignorant, the rich and the poor, the\r\nhigh-born and the lowborn, the honoured and the dishonoured, all go to\r\nthe place of the dead and sleep there freed from every anxiety, with\r\nbodies divested of flesh and full only of bones united by dried-up\r\ntendons, whom amongst them would the survivors look upon as distinguished\r\nabove the others and by what signs would they ascertain the attributes of\r\nbirth and beauty? When all, stretched after the same fashion, sleep on\r\nthe bare ground, why then should men, taking leave of their senses,\r\ndesire to deceive one another? He that, looking at this saying (in the\r\nscriptures) with his own eyes or hearing it from others, practiseth\r\nvirtue in this unstable world of life and adhereth to it from early age,\r\nattaineth to the highest end. Learning all this, he that adhereth to\r\nTruth, O king, succeedeth in passing over all paths.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, Tell me in detail everything about the ways of that\r\nintelligence by which this wilderness of duties may be safely covered.\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, Having bowed down to the Self-create, I will obey thy\r\nbehest by telling thee how the great sages speak of the wilderness of\r\nlife. A certain brahmana, living in the great world, found himself on one\r\noccasion in a large inaccessible forest teeming with beasts of prey. It\r\nabounded on every side with lions and other animals looking like\r\nelephants, all of which were engaged in roaring aloud. Such was the\r\naspect of that forest that Yama himself would take fright at it.\r\nBeholding the forest, the heart of the brahmana became exceedingly\r\nagitated. His hair stood on end, and other signs of fear manifested\r\nthemselves, O scorcher of foes! Entering it, he began to run hither and\r\nthither, casting his eyes on every point of the compass for finding out\r\nsomebody whose shelter he might seek. Wishing to avoid those terrible\r\ncreatures, he ran in fright. He could not succeed, however, in distancing\r\nthem or freeing himself from their presence. He then saw that that\r\nterrible forest was surrounded with a net, and that a frightful woman\r\nstood there, stretching her arms. That large forest was also encompassed\r\nby many five-headed snakes of dreadful forms, tall as cliffs and touching\r\nthe very heavens. Within it was a pit whose mouth was covered with many\r\nhard and unyielding creepers and herbs. The brahmana, in course of his\r\nwanderings, fell into that invisible pit. He became entangled in those\r\nclusters of creepers that were interwoven with one another, like the\r\nlarge fruit of a jack tree hanging by its stalk. He continued to hang\r\nthere, feet upwards and head downwards. While he was in that posture,\r\ndiverse other calamities overtook him. He beheld a large and mighty snake\r\nwithin the pit. He also saw a gigantic elephant near its mouth. That\r\nelephant, dark in complexion, had six faces and twelve feet. And the\r\nanimal gradually approached that pit covered with creepers and trees.\r\nAbout the twigs of the tree (that stood at the mouth of the pit), roved\r\nmany bees of frightful forms, employed from before in drinking the honey\r\ngathered in their comb about which they swarmed in large numbers.\r\nRepeatedly they desired, O bull of Bharatas race, to taste that honey\r\nwhich though sweet to all creatures could, however, attract children\r\nonly. The honey (collected in the comb) fell in many jets below. The\r\nperson who was hanging in the pit continually drank those jets. Employed,\r\nin such a distressful situation, in drinking that honey, his thirst,\r\nhowever, could not be appeased. Unsatiated with repeated draughts, the\r\nperson desired for more. Even then, O king, he did not become indifferent\r\nto life. Even there, the man continued to hope for existence. A number of\r\nblack and white rats were eating away the roots of that tree. There was\r\nfear from the beasts of prey, from that fierce woman on the outskirts of\r\nthat forest, from that snake at the bottom of the well, from that\r\nelephant near its top, from the fall of the tree through the action of\r\nthe rats, and lastly from those bees flying about for tasting the honey.\r\nIn that plight he continued to dwell, deprived of his senses, in that\r\nwilderness, never losing at any time the hope of prolonging his life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, Alas, great was the distress of that person and very\r\npainful his mode of life! Tell me, O first of speakers, whence was his\r\nattachment to life and whence his happiness? Where is that region, so\r\nunfavourable to the practice of virtue, in which that person resides? Oh,\r\ntell me how will that man be freed from all those great terrors? Tell me\r\nall this! We shall then exert ourselves properly for him. My compassion\r\nhas been greatly moved by the difficulties that lie in the way of his\r\nrescue!\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, They that are conversant, O monarch, with the religion of\r\nmoksha cite this as a simile. Understanding this properly, a person may\r\nattain to bliss in the regions hereafter. That which is described as the\r\nwilderness is the great world. The inaccessible forest within it is the\r\nlimited sphere of ones own life. Those that have been mentioned as beasts\r\nof prey are the diseases (to which we are subject). That woman of\r\ngigantic proportions residing in the forest is identified by the wise\r\nwith Decrepitude which destroys complexion and beauty. That which has\r\nbeen spoken of as the pit is the body or physical frame of embodied\r\ncreatures. The huge snake dwelling in the bottom of that pit is time, the\r\ndestroyer of all embodied creatures. It is, indeed, the universal\r\ndestroyer. The cluster of creepers growing in that pit and attached to\r\nwhose spreading stems the man hangeth down is the desire for life which\r\nis cherished by every creature. The six-faced elephant, O king, which\r\nproceeds towards the tree standing at the mouth of the pit is spoken of\r\nas the year. Its six faces are the seasons and its twelve feet are the\r\ntwelve months. The rats and the snakes that are cutting off the tree are\r\nsaid to be days and nights that are continually lessening the periods of\r\nlife of all creatures. Those that have been described as bees are our\r\ndesires. The numerous jets that are dropping honey are the pleasures\r\nderived from the gratification of our desires and to which men are seen\r\nto be strongly addicted. The wise know lifes course to be even such.\r\nThrough that knowledge they succeed in tearing off its bonds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, Excellent is this parable that thou hast recited!\r\nIndeed, thou art acquainted with truth! Having listened to thy nectarlike\r\nspeech, I desire to hear thee more.\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, Listen to me, O king, I shall once more discourse in detail\r\non those means an acquaintance with which enable the wise to free\r\nthemselves from the ties of the world. As a person, O king, who has to\r\ntravel a long way is sometimes obliged to halt when fatigued with toil,\r\neven so, O Bharata, they that are of little intelligence, travelling\r\nalong the extended way of life, have to make frequent halts in the shape\r\nof repeated births in the womb. They, however, that are wise are free\r\nfrom that obligation. Men conversant with the scriptures, for this,\r\ndescribe lifes course as a long way. The wise also call lifes round with\r\nall its difficulties a forest. Creatures, O bull of Bharatas race,\r\nwhether mobile or immobile, have to repeatedly return to the world. The\r\nwise alone escape. The diseases, mental and physical, to which mortals\r\nare subject, whether visible or invisible, are spoken of as beasts of\r\nprey by the wise. Men are always afflicted and impeded by them, O\r\nBharata! Then again, those fierce beasts of prey, represented by their\r\nown acts in life, never cause any anxiety to them that are of little\r\nintelligence. If any person, O monarch, somehow escapes from diseases,\r\nDecrepitude, that destroyer of beauty, overwhelmshim afterwards. Plunged\r\nin a slough by the objects of the different senses--sound and form and\r\ntaste and touch and scent--man remains there without anything to rescue\r\nhim thence. Meanwhile, the years, the seasons, the months, the\r\nfortnights, the days, and the nights, coming one after another, gradually\r\ndespoil him of beauty and lessen the period allotted to him. These all\r\nare messengers of death. They, however, that are of little understanding\r\nknow them not to be such. The wise say that all creatures are governed by\r\nthe Ordainer through their acts. The body of a creature is called the\r\ncar. The living principle is the driver of (that car). The senses are\r\nsaid to be steeds. Our acts and the understanding are the traces. He who\r\nfolloweth after those running steeds has to come repeatedly to this world\r\nin a round of rebirths. He, however, who, being self-restrained restrains\r\nthem by his understanding hath not to come back. They, however, that are\r\nnot stupefied while wandering in this wheel of life that is revolving\r\nlike a real wheel, do not in reality wander in a round of rebirths. He\r\nthat is wise should certainly take care to prevent the obligation of\r\nrebirth. One should not be indifferent to this, for indifference may\r\nsubject us to it repeatedly. The man, O king, who has restrained his\r\nsenses and subdued wrath and covetousness, who is contented, and truthful\r\nin speech, succeeds in obtaining peace. This body is called the car of\r\nYama. Then those that are of little intelligence are stupefied by it.\r\nSuch a person, O king, would obtain that which thou hast obtained. The\r\nloss of kingdom, of friends, and of children, O Bharata, and such as\r\nthese, overtake him who is still under the influence of desire. He that\r\nis wise should apply the medicine of intelligence to all great griefs.\r\nIndeed, obtaining the medicine of wisdom, which is truly very efficacious\r\nand is almost unattainable, the man of restrained soul would kill that\r\nserious disease called sorrow. Neither prowess, nor wealth, nor friend,\r\nnor well-wishers can cure a man of his grief so effectually as the\r\nself-restrained soul. Therefore, observant of the great duty of\r\nabstention from all injuries, or friendship for all creatures, be of\r\npious behaviour, O Bharata! Self-restraint, renunciation, and heedfulness\r\nare the three steeds of Brahman. He who rides on the car of his soul,\r\nunto which are yoked these steeds with the aid of traces furnished by\r\ngood conduct, and drives it, casting off all fear of death, proceedeth, O\r\nking, to the regions of Brahman. That person, O monarch, who gives unto\r\nall creatures an assurance of his harmlessness, goes to the highest of\r\nregions, the blessed realm of Vishnu. The fruit that one obtains by an\r\nassurance unto all creatures of his harmlessness cannot be obtained by a\r\n1,000 sacrifices or by daily fasts. Amongst all things there is certainly\r\nnothing dearer than self. Death is certainly disliked by all creatures, O\r\nBharata! Therefore, compassion should certainly be shown unto all. Endued\r\nwith diverse kinds of errors entangled by the net of their own\r\nintelligence, they that are wicked and are of good vision, wander\r\nrepeatedly on the earth. They however, that are wise and endued with\r\nsubtle sight, attain to a union with Brahman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Even after hearing the words of Vidura, the chief of\r\nthe Kurus, afflicted with grief on account of the death of his sons, fell\r\ndown senseless on the Earth. Beholding him fall down in that state, his\r\nfriends, as also the island-born Vyasa, and Vidura, and Sanjaya, and\r\nother well-wishers, and the attendants who used to wait at the gates and\r\nwho enjoyed his confidence, sprinkled cool water over his body, and\r\nfanned him with palm leaves, and gently rubbed him with their hands. For\r\na long while they comforted the king while in that condition. The\r\nmonarch, recovering his senses after a long time, wept for a long while,\r\noverwhelmed with grief on account of the death of his sons. He said, Fie\r\non the state of humanity! Fie on the human body! The woes that are\r\nsuffered in this life frequently arise from the very state of humanity.\r\nAlas, O lord, great is the grief, like poison or fire, that one suffers\r\nat the loss of sons, of wealth, of kinsmen, and relatives. That grief\r\ncauses the limbs to burn and our wisdom to be destroyed. Overwhelmed with\r\nthat grief, a person regards death to be preferable. This calamity that\r\nhas overtaken me through ill-luck is even like that. It will not, I see,\r\nend except with life itself. O best of regenerate ones, I shall,\r\ntherefore, put an end to my life this very day. Having said these words\r\nunto his high-souled sire, that foremost of all persons conversant with\r\nBrahman, Dhritarashtra, overwhelmed with grief, became stupefied. The\r\nking, O monarch reflecting on his woes, became speechless. Hearing these\r\nwords of his, the puissant Vyasa thus spoke unto his son afflicted with\r\ngrief on account of the death of his children.\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, O mighty-armed Dhritarashtra, listen to what I say. Thou art\r\npossessed of learning, thou hast great intelligence, and thou, O puissant\r\none, art skilled in understanding duties. Nothing of that which should be\r\nknown is unknown to thee, O scorcher of foes! Without doubt, thou knowest\r\nthe instability of all things doomed to death. When the world of life is\r\nunstable when this world itself is not eternal, when life is sure to end\r\nin death, why then, O Bharata, dost thou grieve? Before thy very eyes, O\r\nking, the concatenation of facts brought about by Time making thy son the\r\ncause, produced this hostility. This destruction of the Kurus, O king,\r\nwas inevitable. Why then dost thou grieve for those heroes that have\r\nattained to the highest end? O thou of mighty arms, the high-souled\r\nVidura knew everything. With all his might he had endeavoured, O king, to\r\nbring about peace. It is my opinion that the course marked out by Destiny\r\ncannot be controlled by anyone, even if one struggles for eternity. The\r\ncourse that was settled by the gods was heard directly by me. I will\r\nrecite it to thee, so that tranquillity of mind may be thine. Once\r\nbefore, without any fatigue, I repaired very quickly to the court of\r\nIndra. There I beheld all the denizens of heaven assembled together.\r\nThere were, O sinless one, all the celestial rishis also, headed by\r\nNarada. There, O monarch, I saw also the Earth (in her embodied form).\r\nThe latter had repaired to the gods for the accomplishment of a\r\nparticular mission. Approaching the gods, she said, \"That which ye all\r\nshould do for me hath, ye blessed ones, been already promised by you\r\nwhile you were in Brahmas abode. Let that be accomplished soon.\" Hearing\r\nthese words of hers, Vishnu, the adored of all the worlds, smilingly\r\naddressed her in the midst of the celestial conclave, saying, \"The eldest\r\nof the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, who is known by the name of\r\nDuryodhana, will accomplish thy business. Through that king, thy purpose\r\nwill be achieved. For his sake, many kings will assemble together on the\r\nfield of Kuru. Capable of smiting, they will cause one another to be\r\nslain through the instrumentality of hard weapons. It is evident, O\r\ngoddess, that thy burthen will then be lightened in battle. Go quickly to\r\nthy own place and continue to bear the weight of creatures, O beauteous\r\none!\" From this thou wilt understand, O king, that thy son Duryodhana,\r\nborn in Gandharis womb, was a portion of Kali, sprung for the object of\r\ncausing a universal slaughter. He was vindictive, restless, wrathful, and\r\ndifficult of being gratified. Through the influence of Destiny his\r\nbrothers also became like him. Shakuni became his maternal uncle and\r\nKarna his great friend. Many other kings were born on earth for aiding in\r\nthe work of destruction. As the king is, so do his subjects become. If\r\nthe king becomes righteous, even unrighteousness (in his dominions)\r\nassumes the shape of righteousness. Servants, without doubt, are affected\r\nby the merits and defects of their masters. Those sons of thine, O king,\r\nhaving obtained a bad king, have all been destroyed. Conversant with\r\ntruth, Narada, knew all this. Thy sons, through their own faults, have\r\nbeen destroyed, O king! Do not grieve for them, O monarch! There is no\r\ncause for grief. The Pandavas have not, O Bharata, the least fault in\r\nwhat has happened. Thy sons were all of wicked souls. It is they that\r\ncaused this destruction on earth. Blessed be thou; Narada had truly\r\ninformed Yudhishthira of all this in his court on the occasion of the\r\nrajasuya sacrifice, saying, \"The Pandavas and the Kauravas, encountering\r\neach other, will meet with destruction. Do that, O son of Kunti, which\r\nthou shouldst!\" Upon these words of Narada, the Pandavas became filled\r\nwith grief. I have thus told thee that which is an eternal secret of the\r\ngods. This will destroy thy grief and restore to thee a love of thy\r\nlife-breath, and cause thee to cherish affection for the Pandavas, for\r\nall that has happened has been due to what had been ordained by the gods.\r\nO thou of mighty arms, I had learnt all this sometime before. I also\r\nspoke of it to king Yudhishthira the just on the occasion of his foremost\r\nof sacrifices, the rajasuya. When I secretly informed him of all this,\r\nDharmas son endeavoured his best for preserving peace with the Kauravas.\r\nThat, however, which is ordained by the gods proved too powerful (to be\r\nfrustrated by him). The fiat, O king of the Destroyer, is incapable of\r\nbeing baffled anyhow by mobile and immobile creatures. Thou art devoted\r\nto virtue and possessed of superior intelligence, O Bharata! Thou knowest\r\nalso that which is the way and that which is not the way of all\r\ncreatures. If king Yudhishthira learns that thou art burning with grief\r\nand losing thy senses frequently, he will cast off his very life-breath.\r\nHe is always compassionate and possessed of wisdom. His kindness extends\r\neven to all the inferior creatures. How is it possible, O king, that he\r\nwill not show compassion to thee, O monarch? At my command, and knowing\r\nthat what is ordained is inevitable, as also from kindness to the\r\nPandavas, continue to bear thy life, O Bharata! If thou livest thus, thy\r\nfame will spread in the world. Thou shalt then be able to acquire a\r\nknowledge of all duties and find many years for obtaining ascetic merit.\r\nThis grief for the death of thy sons that has arisen in thy heart, like a\r\nblazing fire, should always be extinguished, O king, by the water of\r\nwisdom!\"\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of Vyasa of immeasurable\r\nenergy and reflecting upon them for a little while, Dhritarashtra said, O\r\nbest of regenerate ones, I am exceedingly afflicted by a heavy load of\r\ngrief. My senses are repeatedly forsaking me and I am unable to bear up\r\nmy own self. Hearing, however, these words of thine about what had been\r\nordained by the gods, I shall not think of casting off my life-breath and\r\nshall live and act without indulging in grief! Hearing these words of\r\nDhritarashtra, O monarch, Satyavatis son, Vyasa, disappeared then and\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"After the holy Vyasa had departed, what, O regenerate\r\nsage, did king Dhritarashtra, do? It behoveth thee to tell me this. What\r\nalso did the Kuru king, the high-souled son of Dharma, do? And how did\r\nthose three, Kripa and others, do? I have heard of the feats of\r\nAshvatthama and the mutual denouncement of curses. Tell me what happened\r\nnext and what Sanjaya next said (unto the old king).\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After Duryodhana had been slain and all the troops\r\nslaughtered, Sanjaya, deprived of his spiritual sight, came back to\r\nDhritarashtra.\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, The kings of diverse peoples, that came from diverse\r\nrealms, have all, O king, gone to the regions of the dead, along with thy\r\nsons. Thy son, O king, who had constantlybeen implored (for peace) but\r\nwho always wished to terminate his hostility (with the Pandavas by\r\nslaughtering them) has caused the earth to be exterminated. Do thou, O\r\nking, cause the obsequial rites of thy sons and grandsons and sires to be\r\nperformed according to due order!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing these terrible words of Sanjaya, the\r\nking fell down on the Earth and lay motionless like one deprived of life.\r\nApproaching the monarch who was lying prostrate on the Earth, Vidura,\r\nconversant with every duty, said these words: Rise, O king, why dost thou\r\nlie down thus? Do not grieve, O bull of Bharatas race! Even this, O lord\r\nof Earth, is the final end of all creatures. At first creatures are\r\nnon-existent. In the interim, O Bharata, they become existent. At the\r\nend, they once more become non-existent. What cause of sorrow is there in\r\nall this? By indulging in grief, one cannot get back the dead. By\r\nindulging in grief, one cannot die himself. When such is the course of\r\nthe world, why dost thou indulge in grief? One may die without having\r\nbeen engaged in battle. One also escapes with life after being engaged in\r\nbattle. When ones Time comes, O king, one cannot escape! Time drags all\r\nkinds of creatures. There is none dear or hateful to Time, O best of the\r\nKurus! As the wind tears off the ends of all blades of grass, even so all\r\ncreatures, O bull of Bharatas race, are brought by Time under its\r\ninfluence. All creatures are like members of the same caravan bound for\r\nthe same destination. What cause of sorrow is there if Time meets with\r\none a little earlier than with another? Those again, O king, that have\r\nfallen in battle and for whom thou grievest, are not really objects of\r\nthy grief, since all those illustrious ones have gone to heaven. By\r\nsacrifices with profuse presents, by ascetic austerities, and by\r\nknowledge, people cannot so easily repair to heaven as heroes by courage\r\nin battle. All those heroes were conversant with the Vedas; all of them\r\nwere observant of vows; all of them have perished, facing the foe in\r\nbattle. What cause of sorrow then is there? They poured their arrowy\r\nlibations upon the bodies of their brave foes as upon a fire. Foremost of\r\nmen, they bore in return the arrowy libations poured upon themselves. I\r\ntell thee, O king, that there is no better way to heaven for a Kshatriya\r\nthan through battle. All of them were high-souled Kshatriyas, all of them\r\nwere heroes and ornaments of assemblies. They have attained to a high\r\nstate of blessedness. One should not grieve for them. Do thou comfort thy\r\nown self. Do not grieve, O bull among men! It behoveth thee not to suffer\r\nthyself to be overwhelmed with sorrow and abandon all action.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hearing these words of Vidura, that bull of Bharatas\r\nrace (Dhritarashtra) ordered his car to be yoked. The king once more\r\nsaid, Bring Gandhari hither without delay, and all the Bharata ladies.\r\nBring hither Kunti also, as well as all the other ladies with her. Having\r\nsaid these words unto Vidura, conversant with every duty, Dhritarashtra\r\nof righteous soul, deprived of his senses by sorrow, ascended on his car.\r\nThen Gandhari, afflicted with grief on account of the death of her sons,\r\naccompanied by Kunti and the other ladies of the royal household, came at\r\nthe command of her lord to that spot where the latter was waiting for\r\nher. Afflicted with grief, they came together to the king. As they met,\r\nthey accosted each other and uttered loud wails of woe. Then Vidura, who\r\nhad become more afflicted than those ladies, began to comfort them.\r\nPlacing those weeping fair ones on the cars that stood ready for them, he\r\nset out (with them) from the city. At that time a loud wail of woe arose\r\nfrom every Kuru house. The whole city, including the very children,\r\nbecame exceedingly afflicted with grief. Thoseladies that had not before\r\nthis been seen by the very gods were now helpless, as they were, for the\r\nloss of their lords, seen by the common people. With their beautiful\r\ntresses all dishevelled and their ornaments cast off, those ladies, each\r\nattired in a single piece of raiment, proceeded most woefully. Indeed,\r\nthey issued from their houses resembling white mountains, like a dappled\r\nherd of deer from their mountain caves after the fall of their leader.\r\nThese fair ladies, in successive bevies, O king, came out, filled with\r\nsorrow, and ran hither and thither like a herd of fillies on a circus\r\nyard. Seizing each other by the hand, they uttered loud wails after their\r\nsons and brothers and sires. They seemed to exhibit the scene that takes\r\nplace on the occasion of the universal destruction at the end of the\r\nYuga. Weeping and crying and running hither and thither, and deprived of\r\ntheir senses by grief, they knew not what to do. Those ladies who\r\nformerly felt the blush of modesty in the presence of even companions of\r\ntheir own sex, now felt no blush of shame, though scantily clad, in\r\nappearing before their mothers-in-law. Formerly they used to comfort each\r\nother while afflicted with even slight causes of woe. Stupefied by grief,\r\nthey now, O king, refrained from even casting their eyes upon each other.\r\nSurrounded by those thousands of wailing ladies, the king cheerlessly\r\nissued out of the city and proceeded with speed towards the field of\r\nbattle. Artisans and traders and Vaishyas and all kinds of mechanics,\r\nissuing out of the city, followed in the wake of the king. As those\r\nladies, afflicted by the wholesale destruction that had overtaken the\r\nKurus, cried in sorrow, a loud wail arose from among them that seemed to\r\npierce all the worlds. All creatures that heard that wail thought that\r\nthe hour of universal destruction had come when all things would be\r\nconsumed by the fire that arises at the end of the Yuga. The citizens\r\nalso (of Hastinapura), devoted to the house of Kuru, with hearts filled\r\nwith anxiety at the destruction that had overtaken their rules, set up, O\r\nking, a wail that was as loud as that uttered by those ladies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Dhritarashtra had not proceeded for more than two\r\nmiles when he met with those three great car-warriors, Sharadvatas son\r\nKripa, Dronas son (Ashvatthama), and Kritavarma. As soon as the latter\r\nobtained a sight of the blind monarch possessed of great power, the three\r\nheroes sighed in grief and with voices choked in tears weepingly\r\naddressed him, saying, Thy royal son, O king, having achieved the most\r\ndifficult feats, has, with all his followers, gone to the region of\r\nIndra. We are the only three car-warriors of Duryodhanas army that have\r\nescaped with life. All the others, O bull of Bharatas race, have\r\nperished. Having said these words unto the king, Sharadvatas son Kripa,\r\naddressing the grief-afflicted Gandhari, said these words unto her, Thy\r\nsons have fallen while engaged in achieving feats worthy of heroes, while\r\nfearlessly fighting in battle and striking down large numbers of foes.\r\nWithout doubt, having obtained those bright worlds that are attainable\r\nonly by the use of weapons, they are sporting there like celestials,\r\nhaving assumed resplendent forms. Amongst those heroes there was no one\r\nthat turned back from battle. Every one of them has fallen at the end or\r\nedge of weapons. None of them joined his hands, begging for quarter.\r\nDeath in battle at the end or edge of weapons has been said by the\r\nancients to be the highest end that a Kshatriya can obtain. It behoveth\r\nthee not, therefore, to grieve for any of them. Their foes, O queen, the\r\nPandavas, too, have not been more fortunate. Listen, what we, headed by\r\nAshvatthama, have done unto them. Learning that thy son had been slain\r\nunrighteously by Bhima, we slaughtered the Pandavas after entering their\r\ncamp buried in sleep. All the Pancalas have been slain. Indeed, all the\r\nsons of Drupada, as also all the sons of Draupadi, have been slaughtered.\r\nHaving caused this carnage of the sons of our foes, we are flying away\r\nsince we three are incapable of standing in battle with them. Our foes,\r\nthe Pandavas, are all heroes and mighty bowmen. They will soon come up\r\nwith us, filled with rage, for taking vengeance on us. Hearing the\r\nslaughter of their sons, those bulls among men, infuriated with rage,\r\nthose heroes, O illustrious lady, will speedily pursue our track. Having\r\ncaused a carnage (in their sleeping camp) we dare not stay. Grant us\r\npermission, O queen! It behoveth thee not to set thy heart on sorrow.\r\nGrant us thy permission also, O king! Summon all thy fortitude. Do thou\r\nalso observe the duties of a Kshatriya in their highest form. Having said\r\nthese words unto the king, and circumambulating him, Kripa and Kritavarma\r\nand Dronas son, O Bharata, without being able to withdraw their eyes from\r\nking Dhritarashtra possessed of great wisdom, urged their steeds towards\r\nthe banks of the Ganga. Moving away from that spot, O king, those great\r\ncar-warriors, with hearts plunged in anxiety, took one anothers leave and\r\nseparated from one another. Sharadvatas son, Kripa, went to Hastinapura;\r\nHridikas son repaired to his own kingdom; while the son of Drona set for\r\nthe asylum of Vyasa. Even thus those heroes, who had offended the\r\nhigh-souled sons of Pandu, respectively proceeded to the places they\r\nselected, afflicted with fear and casting their eyes on one another.\r\nHaving met the king thus, those brave chastisers of foes, before the sun\r\nrose, went away, O monarch, to the places they chose. It was after this,\r\nO king, that the sons of Pandu, those great car-warriors, encountered the\r\nson of Drona, and putting forth their prowess, vanquished him, O monarch,\r\n(in the way already related).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"After all the warriors had been slaughtered, king\r\nYudhishthira the just heard that his uncle Dhritarashtra had set out from\r\nthe city called after the elephant. Afflicted with grief on account of\r\nthe death of his sons, Yudhishthira, O king, accompanied by his brothers,\r\nset out for meeting his uncle, filled with sorrow and overwhelmed with\r\ngrief for the slaughter of his (hundred) sons. The son of Kunti was\r\nfollowed by the high-souled and heroic Krishna of Dasharhas race, and by\r\nYuyudhana, as also by Yuyutsu. The princess Draupadi also, burning with\r\ngrief, and accompanied by those Pancala ladies that were with her,\r\nsorrowfully followed her lord. Yudhishthira beheld near the banks of the\r\nGanga, O king, the crowd of Bharata ladies afflicted with woe and crying\r\nlike a flight of she-ospreys. The king was soon surrounded by those\r\nthousands of ladies who, with arms raised aloft in grief, were indulging\r\nin loud lamentations and giving expression to all kinds of words,\r\nagreeable and disagreeable: Where, indeed, is that righteousness of the\r\nking, where is truth and compassion, since he has slain sires and\r\nbrothers and preceptors and sons and friends? How, O mighty-armed one,\r\nhath thy heart become tranquil after causing Drona, and thy grandsire\r\nBhishma, and Jayadratha, to be slaughtered? What need hast thou of\r\nsovereignty, after having seen thy sires and brothers, O Bharata, and the\r\nirresistible Abhimanyu and the sons of Draupadi, thus slaughtered?\r\nPassing over those ladies crying like a flight of she-ospreys, the\r\nmighty-armed king Yudhishthira the just saluted the feet of his eldest\r\nuncle. Having saluted their sire according to custom, those slayers of\r\nfoes, the Pandavas, announced themselves to him, each uttering his own\r\nname. Dhritarashtra, exceedingly afflicted with grief on account of the\r\nslaughter of his sons, then reluctantly embraced the eldest son of Pandu,\r\nwho was the cause of that slaughter. Having embraced Yudhishthira the\r\njust and spoken a few words of comfort to him, O Bharata, the\r\nwicked-souled Dhritarashtra sought for Bhima, like a blazing fire ready\r\nto burn everything that would approach it. Indeed, that fire of his\r\nwrath, fanned by the wind of his grief, seemed then to be ready to\r\nconsume the Bhima-forest. Ascertaining the evil intentions cherished by\r\nhim towards Bhima, Krishna, dragging away the real Bhima, presented an\r\niron statue of the second son of Pandu to the old king. Possessed of\r\ngreat intelligence, Krishna had, at the very outset, understood the\r\nintentions of Dhritarashtra, and had, therefore, kept such a contrivance\r\nready for baffling them. Seizing with his two arms that iron Bhima, king\r\nDhritarashtra, possessed of great strength, broke into pieces, thinking\r\nit to be Bhima himself in flesh and blood. Endued with might equal to\r\nthat of 10,000 elephants, the king reduced that statue into fragments.\r\nHis own breast, however, became considerably bruised and he began to\r\nvomit blood. Covered with blood, the king fell down on the ground like a\r\nparijata tree topped with its flowery burden. His learned charioteer\r\nSanjaya, the son of Gavalgana, raised the monarch and soothing and\r\ncomforting him, said, Do not act so. The king then, having cast off his\r\nwrath and returned to his normal disposition, became filled with grief\r\nand began to weep aloud, saying, Alas, oh Bhima, alas, oh Bhima!\r\nUnderstanding that he was no longer under the influence of wrath, and\r\nthat he was truly sorry for having (as he believed) killed Bhima,\r\nVasudeva, that foremost of men, said these words, Do not grieve, O\r\nDhritarashtra, for thou hast not slain Bhimasena! That is an iron statue,\r\nO king, which has been broken by thee! Understanding that thou wert\r\nfilled with rage, O bull of Bharatas race, I dragged the son of Kunti\r\naway from within the jaws of Death. O tiger among kings, there is none\r\nequal to thee in strength of body. What man is there, O mighty-armed one,\r\nthat would endure pressure of thy arms? Indeed, as no one can escape with\r\nlife from an encounter with the Destroyer himself, even so no body can\r\ncome out safe from within thy embrace. It was for this that yonder iron\r\nstatue of Bhima, which had been caused to be made by thy son, had been\r\nkept ready for thee. Through grief for the death of thy sons, thy mind\r\nhas fallen off from righteousness. It is for this, O great king, that\r\nthou seekest to slay Bhimasena. The slaughter of Bhima, however, O king,\r\nwould do thee no good. Thy sons, O monarch, would not be revived by it.\r\nTherefore, do thou approve of what has been by us with a view to secure\r\npeace and do not set thy heart on grief!\"\r\n\r\nSection 13\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Certain maid-servants then came to the king for\r\nwashing him. After he had been duly washed, the slayer of Madhu again\r\naddressed him, saying, Thou hast, O king, read the Vedas and diverse\r\nscriptures. Thou hast heard all old histories, and everything about the\r\nduties of kings. Thou art learned, possessed of great wisdom, and\r\nindifferent to strength and weakness. Why then dost thou cherish such\r\nwrath when all that has overtaken thee is the result of thy own fault? I\r\nspoke to thee before the battle. Both Bhishma and Drona, O Bharata, did\r\nthe same, as also Vidura and Sanjaya. Thou didst not, however, then\r\nfollow our advice. Indeed, though exhorted by us, thou didst not yet act\r\naccording to the counsels we offered, knowing that the Pandavas were\r\nsuperior to thee and thine, O Kauravya, in strength and courage. That\r\nking who is capable of seeing his own faults and knows the distinctions\r\nof place and time, obtains great prosperity. That person, however, who,\r\nthough counselled by well-wishers, does not accept their words, good or\r\nbad, meets with distress and is obliged to grieve in consequence of the\r\nevil policy he pursues. Observe thou a different course of life now, O\r\nBharata! Thou didst not keep thy soul under restraint, but suffered\r\nthyself to be ruled by Duryodhana. That which has come upon thee is due\r\nto thy own fault. Why then dost thou seek to slay Bhima? Recollecting thy\r\nown faults, govern thy wrath now. That mean wretch who had, from pride,\r\ncaused the princess of Pancala to be brought into the assembly has been\r\nslain by Bhimasena in just revenge. Look at thy own evil acts as also at\r\nthose of thy wicked-souled son. The sons of Pandu are perfectly innocent.\r\nYet have they been treated most cruelly by thee and him.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"After he had thus been told nothing but the\r\ntruth by Krishna, O monarch, king Dhritarashtra replied unto Devakis son,\r\nsaying, It is even so, O thou of mighty arms! What thou sayest, O\r\nMadhava, is perfectly true. It is parental affection, O thou of righteous\r\nsoul, that caused me to fall away from righteousness. By good luck, that\r\ntiger among men, the mighty Bhima of true prowess, protected by thee,\r\ncame not within my embrace. Now, however, I am free from wrath and fever.\r\nI desire eagerly, O Madhava, to embrace that hero, the second son of\r\nPandu. When all the kings have been dead, when my children are no more,\r\nupon the sons of Pandu depend my welfare and happiness. Having said these\r\nwords, the old king then embraced those princes of excellent frames,\r\nBhima and Dhananjaya, and those two foremost of men, the two sons of\r\nMadri, and wept, and comforted and pronounced blessings upon them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Commanded by Dhritarashtra, those bulls of Kurus\r\nrace, the Pandava brothers, accompanied by Keshava, then proceeded to see\r\nGandhari. The faultless Gandhari, afflicted with grief on account of the\r\ndeath of her hundred sons, recollecting that king Yudhishthira the just\r\nhad slain all his enemies, wished to curse him. Understanding her evil\r\nintentions towards the Pandavas, the son of Satyavati addressed himself\r\nfor counteracting them at the very outset. Having cleansed himself by the\r\nsacred and fresh water of the Ganga, the great rishi, capable of\r\nproceeding everywhere at will with the fleetness of the mind, came to\r\nthat spot. Capable of seeing the heart of every creature with his\r\nspiritual vision and with his mind directed towards it, the sage made his\r\nappearance there. Endued with great ascetic merit and ever intent on\r\nsaying what was for the benefit of creatures, the rishi, addressing his\r\ndaughter-in-law at the proper moment, said, Do not avail thyself of this\r\nopportunity for denouncing a curse. On the other hand, utilize it for\r\nshowing thy forgiveness. Thou shouldst not be angry with the Pandavas, O\r\nGandhari! Set thy heart on peace. Restrain the words that are about to\r\nfall from thy lips. Listen to my advice. Thy son, desirous of victory,\r\nhad besought thee every day for the eighteen days that battle lasted,\r\nsaying, \"O mother, bless me who am fighting with my foes.\" Implored every\r\nday in these words by thy son desirous of victory, the answer thou always\r\ngavest him was, \"Thither is victory where righteousness is!\" I do not, O\r\nGandhari, remember that any words spoken by thee have become false. Those\r\nwords, therefore, that thou, implored by Duryodhana, saidst unto him,\r\ncould not be false. Thou art always employed in the good of all\r\ncreatures. Having without doubt reached the other shore in that dreadful\r\nbattle of Kshatriyas, the sons of Pandu have certainly won the victory\r\nand a measure of righteousness that is much greater. Thou wert formerly\r\nobservant of the virtue of forgiveness. Why wouldst thou not observe it\r\nnow? Subdue unrighteousness, O thou that art conversant with\r\nrighteousness. There is victory where righteousness is. Remembering thy\r\nown righteousness and the words spoken by thyself, restrain thy wrath, O\r\nGandhari! Do not act otherwise, O thou that art beautiful in speech.\r\nHearing these words, Gandhari said, O holy one, I do not cherish any ill\r\nfeelings towards the Pandavas, nor do I wish that they should perish. In\r\nconsequence, however, of grief for the death of my sons, my heart is very\r\nmuch agitated. I know that I should protect the Pandavas with as much\r\ncare as Kunti herself protects them, and that Dhritarashtra also should\r\nprotect them as I should. Through the fault of Duryodhana and of Shakuni\r\nthe son of Subala, and through the action of Karna and Duhshasana,\r\nextermination of the Kurus hath taken place. In this matter the slightest\r\nblame cannot attach to Vibhatsu or to Prithas son Vrikodara, or to Nakula\r\nor Sahadeva, or to Yudhishthira himself. While engaged in battle, the\r\nKauravas, swelling with arrogance and pride, have fallen along with many\r\nothers (that came to their aid). I am not grieved at this. But there has\r\nbeen one act done by Bhima in the very presence of Vasudeva (that moves\r\nmy resentment). The high-souled Vrikodara, having challenged Duryodhana\r\nto a dreadful encounter with mace, and having come to know that my son,\r\nwhile careering in diverse kinds of motion in the battle, was superior to\r\nhim in skill, struck the latter below the navel. It is this that moves my\r\nwrath. Why should heroes, for the sake of their lives, cast off\r\nobligations of duty that have been determined by high-souled persons\r\nconversant with every duty?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hearing these words of Gandhari, Bhimasena, looking\r\nlike one in fright, said these words for soothing her, Be the act\r\nrighteous or unrighteous, it was done by me through fear and for the\r\nobject of protecting my own self. It behoveth thee therefore, to forgive\r\nme now. Thy mighty son was incapable of being slain by anybody in a fair\r\nand righteous battle. It was for this that I did what was unfair.\r\nDuryodhana himself had formerly vanquished Yudhishthira unrighteously. He\r\nused always to behave guilefully towards us. It was for this that I had\r\nrecourse to an unfair act. Thy son was then the sole unslain warrior on\r\nhis side. In order that that valiant prince might not slay me in the\r\nmace-encounter and once more deprive us of our kingdom, I acted in that\r\nway. Thou knowest all that thy son had said unto the princess of Pancala\r\nwhile the latter, in her season, was clad in a single piece of raiment.\r\nWithout having disposed of Suyodhana it was impossible for us to rule\r\npeacefully the whole earth with her seas. It was for this that I acted in\r\nthat way. Thy son inflicted many wrongs on us. In the midst of the\r\nassembly he had shown his left thigh unto Draupadi. For that wicked\r\nbehaviour, thy son deserved to be slain by us even then. At the command,\r\nhowever, of king Yudhishthira the just, we suffered ourselves to be\r\nrestrained by the compact that had been made. By this means, O queen, thy\r\nson provoked deadly hostilities with us. Great were our sufferings in the\r\nforest (whither we were driven by thy son). Remembering all this, I acted\r\nin that way. Having slain Duryodhana in battle, we have reached the end\r\nof our hostilities. Yudhishthira has got back his kingdom, and we also\r\nhave been freed from wrath. Hearing these words of Bhima, Gandhari said,\r\nSince thou praisest my son thus (for his skill in battle), he did not\r\ndeserve such a death. He, however, did all that thou tellest me. When\r\nVrishasena, however, had deprived Nakula of his steeds, O Bharata, thou\r\nquaffedst in battle the blood from Duhshasanas body! Such an act is cruel\r\nand is censured by the good. It suits only a person that is most\r\ndisrespectable. It was a wicked act, O Vrikodara, that was then\r\naccomplished by thee! It was undeserving of thee. Bhima replied, saying,\r\nIt is improper to quaff the blood of even a stranger, what then need be\r\nsaid about quaffing the blood of ones own self? Ones brother, again, is\r\nlike ones own self. There is no difference between them. The blood,\r\nhowever, (that I am regarded to have quaffed) did not, O mother, pass\r\ndown my lips and teeth. Karna knew this well. My hands only were smeared\r\nwith (Duhshasanas) blood. Seeing Nakula deprived of his steeds by\r\nVrishasena in battle, I caused the rejoicing (Kaurava) brothers to be\r\nfilled with dread. When after the match at dice the tresses of Draupadi\r\nwere seized, I uttered certain words in rage. Those words are still in my\r\nremembrance, I would, for all years to come, have been regarded to have\r\nswerved from the duties of a Kshatriya if I had left that vow\r\nunaccomplished. It was for this, O queen, that I did that act. It\r\nbehoveth thee not, O Gandhari, to impute any fault to me. Without having\r\nrestrained thy sons in former days, doth it behove thee to impute any\r\nfault to our innocent selves?\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, Unvanquished by anyone, thou hast slain a hundred sons of\r\nthis old man. Oh, why didst thou not spare, O child, even one son of this\r\nold couple deprived of kingdom, one whose offences were lighter? Why\r\ndidst thou not leave even one crutch for this blind couple? O child,\r\nalthough thou livest unharmed, having slain all my children, yet no grief\r\nwould have been mine if thou hadst adopted the path of righteousness (in\r\nslaying them).\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Having said these words, Gandhari, filled with\r\nwrath at the slaughter of all her sons and grandsons, enquired after\r\nYudhishthira, saying, Where is the king? After she had said these words\r\nking Yudhishthira, trembling and with joined hands, approached her and\r\nsaid these soft words unto her, Here is Yudhishthira, O goddess, that\r\ncruel slayer of thy sons! I deserve thy curses, for I am the cause of\r\nthis universal destruction. Oh, curse me! I have no longer any need for\r\nlife, for kingdom, for wealth! Having caused such friends to be slain, I\r\nhave proved myself to be a great fool and a hater of friends. Unto\r\nYudhishthira who spoke such words, who was overcome with fear, and who\r\nstood in her presence, Gandhari, drawing long sighs, said nothing.\r\nConversant with the rules of righteousness, the Kuru queen, possessed of\r\ngreat foresight, directed her eyes, from within the folds of the cloth\r\nthat covered them, to the tip of Yudhishthiras toe, as the prince, with\r\nbody bent forwards, was about to fall down at her feet. At this, the\r\nking, whose nails had before this been all very beautiful, came to have a\r\nsore nail on his toe. Beholding this, Arjuna moved away to the rear of\r\nVasudeva. and the other sons of Pandu became restless and moved from one\r\nspot to another. Gandhari then, having cast off her wrath, comforted the\r\nPandavas as a mother should. Obtaining her leave, those heroes of broad\r\nchests then proceeded together to present themselves to their mother,\r\nthat parent of heroes. Having seen her sons after a long time, Kunti, who\r\nhad been filled with anxiety on their account, covered her face with her\r\ncloth and began to weep. Having wept for some time with her children,\r\nPritha beheld the wounds and scars of many weapons on their bodies. She\r\nthen repeatedly embraced and patted each of her sons, and afflicted with\r\ngrief wept with Draupadi who had lost all her children and whom she saw\r\nlying on the bare earth, indulging in piteous lamentations.\r\n\r\n\"Draupadi said, O venerable dame, where have all your grandsons, with\r\nAbhimanyu among them, gone? Beholding thee in such distress, why are they\r\ndelaying in making their appearance before thee? Deprived as I am of my\r\nchildren, what need have I of kingdom? Raising the grief-stricken\r\nprincess of Pancala who was weeping thus, Pritha began to comfort that\r\nlady of large eyes. Then Kunti, accompanied by the princess of Pancala\r\nand followed by her sons, proceeded towards the grief-afflicted Gandhari\r\nherself in greater affliction still. Beholding that illustrious lady with\r\nher daughter-in-law, Gandhari addressed her, saying, Do not, O daughter,\r\ngrieve so. Behold, I too am as much stricken with grief as thou. I think\r\nthis universal destruction has been brought about by the irresistible\r\ncourse of Time. Inevitable as it was, this dreadful slaughter has not\r\nbeen due to the voluntary agency of human beings. Even that has come to\r\npass which Vidura of great wisdom foretold after Krishnas supplication\r\nfor peace had failed. Do not, therefore, grieve, in a matter that was\r\ninevitable, especially after its occurrence. Having fallen in battle,\r\nthey should not be grieved for. I am in the same predicament with thee.\r\n(If thou actest in such a way) who then will comfort us? Through my\r\nfault, this foremost of races has been destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nHere ends the Jalapradanika-parva in the Stri-parva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n(Stri-vilapa-parva)\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Having said these words, Gandhari, though staying on\r\nthat spot which was distant from the field of battle, beheld, with her\r\nspiritual eye, the slaughter of the Kurus. Devoted to her lord, that\r\nhighly blessed lady had always practised high vows. Undergoing the\r\nseverest penances, she was always truthful in her speech. In consequence\r\nof the gift of the boon by the great rishi Vyasa of sanctified deeds, she\r\nbecame possessed of spiritual knowledge and power. Piteous were the\r\nlamentations in which that dame then indulged. Endued with great\r\nintelligence, the Kuru dame saw, from a distance, but as if from a near\r\npoint, that field of battle, terrible to behold and full of wonderful\r\nsights, of those foremost of fighters. Scattered all over with bones and\r\nhair, and covered with streams of blood, that field was strewn with\r\nthousands upon thousands of dead bodies on every side. Covered with the\r\nblood of elephants and horses and car-warriors and combatants of other\r\nkinds, it teemed with headless trunks and trunkless heads. And it\r\nresounded with the cries of elephants and steeds and men and women and\r\nabounded with jackals and cranes and ravens and kankas and crows. And it\r\nwas the sporting ground of rakshasas subsisting on human flesh. And it\r\nswarmed with ospreys and vultures and resounded with the inauspicious\r\nhowls of jackals. Then king Dhritarashtra, at the command of Vyasa, and\r\nall the sons of Pandu with Yudhishthira at their head, with Vasudeva and\r\nall the Kuru ladies, proceeded to the field of battle. Those ladies,\r\nbereaved of their lords, having reached Kurukshetra, beheld their slain\r\nbrothers and sons and sires and husbands lying on the ground, and in\r\ncourse of being devoured by beasts of prey and wolves and ravens and\r\ncrows and ghosts and pishacas and rakshasas and diverse other wanderers\r\nof the night. Beholding that carnage which resembled the sights seen on\r\nthe sporting ground of Rudra, the ladies uttered loud shrieks and quickly\r\nalighted from their costly vehicles. Witnessing sights the like of which\r\nthey had never before witnessed, the Bharata ladies felt their limbs to\r\nbe deprived of strength and fell down on the ground. Others became so\r\nstupefied that they lost all their senses. Indeed, the Pancala and the\r\nKuru ladies were plunged into unutterable distress. Beholding that\r\ndreadful field of battle resounding on every direction with the cries of\r\nthose grief-stricken ladies, the daughter of Subala, acquainted with\r\nevery duty, addressed the lotus-eyed Keshava, that foremost of all men.\r\nWitnessing that universal slaughter of the Kurus and filled with grief at\r\nthe sight, she said these words: Behold, O lotus-eyed Madhava, these\r\ndaughters-in-law of mine! Deprived of their lords, they are uttering,\r\nwith dishevelled hair, piteous cries of woe like a flight of she-ospreys.\r\nMeeting with those dead bodies, they are calling back to their memories\r\nthe great Bharata chiefs. They are running hither and thither in large\r\nbands towards their sons and brothers and sires and husbands. Behold, O\r\nmighty-armed one, the field is covered with mothers of heroes, all of\r\nwhom, however, have been bereaved of children. There, those portions\r\nagain are covered with spouses of heroes, who have, however, been\r\nbereaved of their spouses! Behold, the field of battle is adorned with\r\nthose tigers among men, Bhishma and Karna and Abhimanyu and Drona and\r\nDrupada and Shalya, as if with blazing fires. Behold, it is adorned also\r\nwith the golden coats of mail, and with the costly gems, of high-souled\r\nwarriors, and with their angadas, and keyuras and garlands. Behold, it is\r\nstrewn with darts and spiked clubs hurled by heroic hands, and swords and\r\ndiverse kinds of keen shafts and bows. Beasts of prey, assembled\r\ntogether, are standing or sporting or lying down as it likes them!\r\nBehold, O puissant hero, the field of battle is even such. At this sight,\r\nO Janardana, I am burning with grief. In the destruction of the Pancalas\r\nand the Kurus, O slayer of Madhu, I think, the five elements (of which\r\neverything is made) have been destroyed. Fierce vultures and other birds,\r\nin thousands, are dragging those blood-dyed bodies, and seizing them by\r\ntheir armour, are devouring them. Who is there that could think of the\r\ndeath of such heroes as Jayadratha and Karna and Drona and Bhishma and\r\nAbhimanyu? Alas, though incapable of being slain, they have yet been\r\nslain, O destroyer of Madhu! Behold, vultures and kankas and ravens and\r\nhawks and dogs and jackals are feasting upon them. There, those tigers\r\namong men, that fought on Duryodhanas side, and took the field in wrath,\r\nare now lying like extinguished fires. All of them are worthy of sleeping\r\non soft and clean beds. But, alas, plunged into distress, they are\r\nsleeping today on the bare ground. Bards reciting their praises used to\r\ndelight them before at proper times. They are now listening to the fierce\r\nand inauspicious cries of jackals. Those illustrious heroes who used\r\nformerly to sleep on costly beds with their limbs smeared with sandal\r\npaste and powdered aloe, alas, now sleep on the dust! These vultures and\r\nwolves and ravens have now become their ornaments. Repeatedly uttering\r\ninauspicious and fierce cries those creatures are now dragging their\r\nbodies. Delighting in battle, those heroes, looking cheerful, have still\r\nbeside them their keen shafts, well-tempered swords, and bright maces, as\r\nif life has not yet departed from them. Many foremost of heroes,\r\npossessed of beauty and fair complexions and adorned with garlands of\r\ngold, are sleeping on the ground. Behold, beasts of prey are dragging and\r\ntearing them. Others, with massive arms, are sleeping with maces in their\r\nembrace, as if those were beloved wives. Others, still cased in armour,\r\nare holding in their hands their bright weapons. Beasts of prey are not\r\nmangling them, O Janardana, regarding them to be still alive. The\r\nbeautiful garlands of pure gold on the necks of other illustrious heroes,\r\nas the latter are being dragged by carnivorous creatures, are scattered\r\nabout on every side. There, those fierce wolves, numbering in thousands,\r\nare dragging the golden chains round the necks of many illustrious heroes\r\nstilled by death. Many, whom bards well-trained to their work formerly\r\nused, with their hymns and eulogies of grave import, to delight every\r\nmorning, are now surrounded by fair ladies stricken with grief and\r\nweeping and crying around them in woe, O tiger of Vrishnis race! The\r\nfaces of those beautiful ladies, O Keshava, though pale, look resplendent\r\nstill, like an assemblage of red lotuses! Those Kuru ladies have ceased\r\nto weep, with their respective followers and companions. They are all\r\nfilled with anxiety. Overwhelmed with sorrow, they are running hither and\r\nthither. The faces of those fair ones have, with weeping and anger,\r\nbecome resplendent as the morning sun or gold or burnished copper.\r\nHearing each others lamentations of incomplete sense, those ladies, in\r\nconsequence of the loud wails of woe bursting from every side, are unable\r\nto catch each others meaning. Some amongst them, drawing long sighs and\r\nindulging in repeated lamentations, are stupefied by grief and are\r\nabondoning their life-breaths. Many of them, beholding the bodies (of\r\ntheir sons, husbands, or sires), are weeping and setting up loud wails.\r\nOthers are striking their heads with their own soft hands. The earth,\r\nstrewn with severed heads and hands and other limbs mingled together and\r\ngathered in large heaps, looks resplendent with these signs of havoc!\r\nBeholding many headless trunks of great beauty, and many heads without\r\ntrunks, those fair ones have been lying senseless on the ground for a\r\nlong while. Uniting particular heads with particular trunks, those\r\nladies, senseless with grief, are again discovering their mistakes and\r\nsaying, \"This is not this ones,\" and are weeping more bitterly! Others,\r\nuniting arms and thighs and feet, cut off with shafts, are giving way to\r\ngrief and losing their senses repeatedly (at the sight of the restored\r\nforms). Some amongst the Bharata ladies, beholding the bodies of their\r\nlords,--bodies that have been mangled by animals and birds and severed of\r\ntheir heads,--are not succeeding in recognising them. Others, beholding\r\ntheir brothers, sires, sons, and husbands slain by foes, are, O destroyer\r\nof Madhu, striking their heads with their own hands. Miry with flesh and\r\nblood, the Earth has become impassable with arms still holding swords in\r\ntheir grasp, and with heads adorned with earrings. Beholding the field\r\nstrewn with their brothers and sires, and sons, those faultless ladies,\r\nwho had never before suffered the least distress, are now plunged into\r\nunutterable woe. Behold, O Janardana, those numerous bevies of\r\nDhritarashtras daughters-in-law, resembling successive multitudes of\r\nhandsome fillies adorned with excellent manes! What, O Keshava, can be a\r\nsadder spectacle for me to behold than that presented by those ladies of\r\nfair forms who have assumed such an aspect? Without doubt, I must have\r\nperpetrated great sins in my former lives, since I am beholding, O\r\nKeshava, my sons and grandsons and brothers all slain by foes. While\r\nindulging in such lamentations in grief, Gandharis eyes fell upon her son\r\n(Duryodhana).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Beholding Duryodhana, Gandhari, deprived of her\r\nsenses by grief, suddenly fell down on the earth like an uprooted\r\nplantain tree. Having regained her senses soon, she began to weep,\r\nrepeatedly uttering loud wails at the sight of her son lying on the bare\r\nground, covered with blood. Embracing her son, Gandhari indulged in\r\npiteous lamentations for him. Stricken with grief, and with senses\r\nexceedingly agitated, the Kuru queen exclaimed, Alas, O son! Alas, O son!\r\nBurning with sorrow, the queen drenched with her tears the body of her\r\nson, possessed of massive and broad shoulders, and adorned with garlands\r\nand collar. Addressing Hrishikesha who stood near, she said, On the eve\r\nof this battle, O puissant one, that has exterminated this race, this\r\nforemost of kings, O thou of Vrishnis race, said unto me, \"In this\r\ninternecine battle, O mother, wish me victory!\" When he had said these\r\nwords, I myself, knowing that a great calamity had come upon us, told him\r\neven this, tiger among men, \"Thither is victory where righteousness is.\r\nAnd since, son, thy heart is set on battle, thou wilt, without doubt,\r\nobtain those regions that are attainable by (the use of) weapons (and\r\nsport there) like a celestial.\" Even these were the words that I then\r\nsaid unto him. I did not then grieve for my son. I grieve, however, for\r\nthe helpless Dhritarashtra bereaved of friends and kinsmen. Behold, O\r\nMadhava, my son, that foremost of warriors, wrathful, skilled in weapons,\r\nand irresistible in battle, sleeping on the bed of heroes. Behold the\r\nreverses brought about by Time. This scorcher of foes that used of old to\r\nwalk at the head of all crowned persons now sleepeth on the dust. Without\r\ndoubt, the heroic Duryodhana, when he sleeps on that bed which is the\r\nheros hath obtained the most unattainable end. Inauspicious jackals are\r\nnow delighting that prince asleep on the heros bed, who was formerly\r\ndelighted by the fairest of ladies sitting round him. He who was formerly\r\nencircled by kings vying with one another to give him pleasure, alas, he,\r\nslain and lying on the ground, is now encircled by vultures! He who was\r\nformerly fanned with beautiful fans by fair ladies is now fanned by\r\n(carnivorous) birds with flaps of their wings! Possessed of great\r\nstrength and true prowess, this mighty-armed prince, slain by Bhimasena\r\nin battle, sleeps like an elephant slain by a lion! Behold Duryodhana, O\r\nKrishna, lying on the bare ground, covered with blood, slain by Bhimasena\r\nwith his mace. That mighty-armed one who had in battle assembled together\r\neleven akshauhinis of troops, O Keshava, hath, in consequence of his own\r\nevil policy, been now slain. Alas, there that great bowman and mighty\r\ncar-warrior sleeps, slain by Bhimasena, like a tiger slain by a lion!\r\nHaving disregarded Vidura, as also his own sire, this reckless, foolish,\r\nand wicked prince hath succumbed to death, in consequence of his\r\ndisregard of the old. He who had ruled the earth, without a rival, for\r\nthirteen years, alas, that prince, that son of mine, sleepeth to-day on\r\nthe bare ground, slain by his foes. Not long before, O Krishna, I beheld\r\nthe Earth, full of elephants and kine and horses, ruled by Duryodhana!\r\nToday, O thou of mighty arms, I see her ruled by another, and destitute\r\nof elephants and kine and horses! What need have I, O Madhava, of life?\r\nBehold, again, this sight that is more painful than the death of my son,\r\nthe sight of these fair ladies weeping by the side of the slain heroes!\r\nBehold, O Krishna, the mother of Lakshmana, that lady of large hips, with\r\nher tresses dishevelled, that dear spouse of Duryodhana, resembling a\r\nsacrificial altar of gold. Without doubt, this damsel of great\r\nintelligence, while her mighty-armed lord was formerly alive, used to\r\nsport within the embrace of her lords handsome arms! Why, indeed, does\r\nnot this heart of mine break into a hundred fragments at the sight of my\r\nson and grandson slain in battle? Alas, that faultless lady now smells\r\n(the head of) her son covered with blood. Now, again, that lady of fair\r\nthighs is gently rubbing Duryodhanas body with her fair hand. At one time\r\nshe is sorrowing for her lord and at another for her son. At one time she\r\nlooketh on her lord, at another on her son. Behold, O Madhava, striking\r\nher head with her hands, she falls upon the breast of her heroic spouse,\r\nthe king of the Kurus. Possessed of complexion like that of the filaments\r\nof the lotus, she still looketh beautiful like a lotus. The unfortunate\r\nprincess now rubbeth the face of her son and now that of her lord. If the\r\nscriptures and the shrutis be true, without doubt, this king has obtained\r\nthose regions (of blessedness) that one may win by the use of weapons!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, Behold, O Madhava, my century of sons, incapable of\r\nfatigue (from exertion in battle), have all been slain by Bhimasena with\r\nhis mace in battle! That which grieves me more today is that these my\r\ndaughters-in-law, of tender years, deprived of sons and with dishevelled\r\nhair, are wandering on the field today. Alas, they who formerly walked\r\nonly on the terraces of goodly mansions with feet adorned with many\r\nornaments, are now, in great affliction of heart, obliged to touch with\r\nthose feet of theirs this hard earth, miry with blood! Reeling in sorrow,\r\nthey are wandering like inebriated persons, driving away vultures and\r\njackals and crows with difficulty. Behold, that lady of faultless limbs\r\nand slender waist, seeing this terrible carnage, falleth down,\r\noverwhelmed with grief. Beholding this princess, this mother of\r\nLakshmana, O thou of mighty arms, my heart is torn with grief. These\r\nbeautiful ladies of fair arms, some seeing their brothers, some their\r\nhusbands, and some their sons, lying down in death on the bare ground,\r\nare themselves falling down, seizing the arms of the slain. Listen, O\r\nunvanquished one, to the loud wails of those elderly ladies and those\r\nothers of middle age at sight of this terrible carnage. Supporting\r\nthemselves against broken boxes of cars and the bodies of slain elephants\r\nand steeds, behold, O thou of great might, those ladies, worn out with\r\nfatigue, are resting themselves. Behold, O Krishna, some one amongst\r\nthem, taking up some kinsmans severed head decked with beautiful nose and\r\nearrings, is standing in grief. I think, O sinless one, that both those\r\nand myself of little understanding must have committed great sins in our\r\nformer lives, since, O Janardana, all our relatives and kinsmen have thus\r\nbeen slain by king Yudhishthira the just! Our acts, righteous or\r\nunrighteous, cannot go for nothing, O thou of Vrishnis race! Behold, O\r\nMadhava, those young ladies of beautiful bosoms and abdomen, well-born,\r\npossessed of modesty, having black eye-lashes and tresses of the same\r\ncolour on their heads, endued with voice sweet and dear like that of\r\nswans, are falling down, deprived of their senses in great grief and\r\nuttering piteous cries like flights of cranes. Behold, O lotus-eyed hero,\r\ntheir beautiful faces resembling full-blown lotuses, are scorched by the\r\nsun. Alas, O Vasudeva, the wives of my proud children possessed of\r\nprowess like that of infuriated elephants, are now exposed to the gaze of\r\ncommon people. Behold, O Govinda, the shields decked with hundred moons,\r\nthe standards of solar effulgence, the golden coats of mail, and the\r\ncollars and cuirasses made of gold, and the head-gears, of my sons,\r\nscattered on the earth, are blazing with splendour like sacrificial fires\r\nover which have been poured libations, of clarified butter. There,\r\nDuhshasana sleepeth, felled by Bhima, and the blood of all his limbs\r\nquaffed by that heroic slayer of foes. Behold that other son of mine, O\r\nMadhava, slain by Bhima with his mace, impelled by Draupadi and the\r\nrecollection of his woes at the time of the match at dice. Addressing the\r\ndice-won princess of Pancala in the midst of the assembly, this\r\nDuhshasana, desirous of doing what was agreeable to his (elder) brother\r\nas also to Karna, O Janardana, had said, \"Thou art now the wife of a\r\nslave! With Sahadeva and Nakula and Arjuna, O lady, enter our household\r\nnow!\" On that occasion, O Krishna, I said unto king Duryodhana, \"O son,\r\ncast off (from thy side) the wrathful Shakuni. Know that thy maternal\r\nuncle is of very wicked soul and exceedingly fond of quarrel. Casting him\r\noff without delay, make peace with the Pandavas, O son! O thou of little\r\nintelligence, thinkest thou not of Bhimasena filled with wrath? Thou art\r\npiercing him with thy wordy shafts like a person striking an elephant\r\nwith burning brands.\" Alas, disregarding my words, he vomitted his wordy\r\npoison at them, like a snake vomitting its poison at a bull,--at them who\r\nhad already been pierced with his wordy darts. There, that Duhshasana\r\nsleepeth, stretching his two massive arms, slain by Bhimasena like a\r\nmighty elephant by a lion. The very wrathful Bhimasena perpetrated a most\r\nhorrible act by drinking in battle the blood of his foe!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, There, O Madhava, my son Vikarna, applauded by the wise,\r\nlieth on the bare ground, slain by Bhima and mangled horribly! Deprived\r\nof life, O slayer of Madhu, Vikarna lieth in the midst of (slain)\r\nelephants like the moon in the autumnal sky surrounded by blue clouds.\r\nHis broad palm, cased in leathern fence, and scarred by constant wielding\r\nof the bow, is pierced with difficulty by vultures desirous of feeding\r\nupon it. His helpless young wife, O Madhava, is continually endeavouring,\r\nwithout success, to drive away those vultures desirous of feeding on\r\ncarrion. The youthful and brave and handsome Vikarna, O bull among men,\r\nbrought up in luxury and deserving of every kind of weal, now sleepeth\r\namid the dust, O Madhava! Though all his vital parts have been pierced\r\nwith clothyard shafts and bearded arrows and nalikas, yet that beauty of\r\nperson which was his hath not forsaken this best of the Bharatas. There,\r\nmy son Durmukha, that slayer of large band of foes, sleepeth, with face\r\ntowards the enemy, slain by the heroic Bhimasena in observance of his\r\nvow. His face, O Krishna, half-eaten away by beasts of prey, looketh more\r\nhandsome, O child, even like the moon on the seventh day of the lighted\r\nfortnight. Behold, O Krishna, the face of that heroic son of mine, which\r\nis even such. How could that son of mine be slain by foes and thus made\r\nto eat the dust? O amiable one, how could that Durmukha, before whom no\r\nfoe could stand, be slain by foes, O subjugator of celestial regions!\r\nBehold, O slayer of Madhu, that other son of Dhritarashtra, Citrasena,\r\nslain and lying on the ground, that hero who was the model of all bowmen?\r\nThose young ladies, afflicted with grief and uttering piteous cries, are\r\nnow sitting, with beasts of prey, around his fair form adorned with\r\nwreaths and garlands. These loud wails of woe, uttered by women, and\r\nthese cries and roars of beasts of prey, seem exceedingly wonderful to\r\nme, O Krishna! Youthful and handsome, and always waited upon and served\r\nby the most beautiful ladies, my son Vivinsati, O Madhava, sleepeth\r\nthere, stained with dust. His armour hath been pierced with arrows. Slain\r\nin the midst of the carnage, alas, the heroic Vivimshati is now\r\nsurrounded and waited upon by vultures! Having in battle penetrated the\r\nranks of the Pandava army, that hero now lieth on the bed of a hero,--on\r\nthe bed, that is, of an exalted Kshatriya! Behold, O Krishna, his very\r\nbeautiful face, with a smile playing on it, adorned with excellent nose\r\nand fair eyebrows, and resembling the resplendent Moon himself! Formerly\r\na large number of the most beautiful ladies used to wait upon him, like\r\nthousands of celestial girls upon a sporting gandharva. Who again could\r\nendure my son Duhsaha, that slayer of heroic foes, that hero, that\r\nornament of assemblies, that irresistible warrior, that resister of foes?\r\nThe body of Duhsaha, covered with arrows, looks resplendent like a\r\nmountain overgrown with flowering karnikaras. With his garland of gold\r\nand his bright armour, Duhsaha, though deprived of life, looks\r\nresplendent yet, like a white mountain of fire!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, He whose might and courage were regarded, O Keshava, as a\r\none and half times superior to those of his sire and thee, he who\r\nresembled a fierce and proud lion, he who, without a follower, alone\r\npierced the impenetrable array of my son, he who proved to be the death\r\nof many, alas, he now sleepeth there, having himself succumbed to death!\r\nI see, O Krishna, the splendour of that son of Arjuna, of that hero of\r\nimmeasurable energy, Abhimanyu, hath not been dimmed even in death.\r\nThere, the daughter of Virata, the daughter-in-law of the wielder of\r\ngandiva, that girl of faultless beauty overwhelmed with grief at sight of\r\nher heroic husband, is indulging in lamentations! That young wife, the\r\ndaughter of Virata, approaching her lord, is gently rubbing him, O\r\nKrishna, with her hand. Formerly, that highly intelligent and exceedingly\r\nbeautiful girl, inebriated with honeyed wines, used bashfully to embrace\r\nher lord, and kiss the face of Subhadras son, that face which resembled a\r\nfull-blown lotus and which was supported on a neck adorned with three\r\nlines like those of a conch-shell. Taking of her lords golden coat of\r\nmail, O hero, that damsel is gazing now on the blood-dyed body of her\r\nspouse. Beholding her lord, O Krishna, that girl addresses thee and says,\r\n\"O lotus-eyed one, this hero whose eyes resembled thine, hath been slain.\r\nIn might and energy, and prowess also, he was thy equal, O sinless one!\r\nHe resembled thee very much in beauty. Yet he sleeps on the ground, slain\r\nby the enemy!\" Addressing her own lord, the damsel says again, \"Thou wert\r\nbrought up in every luxury. Thou usedst to sleep on soft skins of the\r\nranku deer. Alas, does not thy body feel pain today by lying thus on the\r\nbare ground? Stretching thy massive arms adorned with golden angadas,\r\nresembling a couple of elephants trunks and covered with skin hardened by\r\nfrequent use of the bow, thou sleepest, O lord, in peace, as if exhausted\r\nwith the toil of too much exercise in the gymnasium. Alas, why dost thou\r\nnot address me that am weeping so? I do not remember to have ever\r\noffended thee. Why dost thou not speak to me then? Formerly, thou usedst\r\nto address me even when thou wouldst see me at a distance. O reverend\r\nsir, whither wilt thou go, leaving behind thee the much-respected\r\nSubhadra, these thy sires that resemble the very celestials, and my own\r\nwretched self distracted with woe?\" Behold, O Krishna, gathering with her\r\nhands the blood-dyed locks of her lord and placing his head on her lap,\r\nthe beautiful damsel is speaking to him as if he were alive, \"How couldst\r\nthose great car-warriors slay thee in the midst of battle,--thee that art\r\nthe sisters son of Vasudeva and the son of the wielder of gandiva? Alas,\r\nfie on those warriors of wicked deeds, Kripa and Karna and Jayadratha and\r\nDrona and Dronas son, by whom thou wert deprived of life. What was the\r\nstate of mind of those great car-warriors at that time when they\r\nsurrounded thee, a warrior of tender years, and slew thee to my grief?\r\nHow couldst thou, O hero, who had so many protectors, be slain so\r\nhelplessly in the very sight of the Pandavas and the Pancalas? Beholding\r\nthee, O hero, slain in battle by many persons united together, how is\r\nthat tiger among men, that son of Pandu, thy sire, able to bear the\r\nburden of life? Neither the acquisition of a vast kingdom nor the defeat\r\nof their foes conduces to the joy of the Parthas bereft of thee, O\r\nlotus-eyed one! By the practice of virtue and self-restraint, I shall\r\nvery soon repair to those regions of bliss which thou hast acquired by\r\nthe use of weapons. Protect me, O hero, when I repair to those regions.\r\nWhen ones hour does not come, one cannot die, since, wretched that I am,\r\nI still draw breath after seeing thee slain in battle. Having repaired to\r\nthe region of the pitris, whom else, like me, dost thou address now, O\r\ntiger among men, in sweet words mingled with smiles? Without doubt, thou\r\nwilt agitate the hearts of the apsaras in heaven, with thy great beauty\r\nand thy soft words mingled with smiles! Having obtained the regions\r\nreserved for persons of righteous deeds, thou art now united, O son of\r\nSubhadra, with the apsaras! While sporting with them, recollect at times\r\nmy good acts towards thee. Thy union with me in this world had, it seems,\r\nbeen ordained for only six months, for in the seventh, O hero, thou hast\r\nbeen bereft of life!\" O Krishna, the ladies of the royal house of Matsya\r\nare dragging away the afflicted Uttara, baffled of all her purposes,\r\nwhile lamenting in this strain. Those ladies, dragging away the afflicted\r\nUttara, themselves still more afflicted than that girl, are weeping and\r\nuttering loud wails at sight of the slain Virata. Mangled with the\r\nweapons and shafts of Drona, prostrate on the ground, and covered with\r\nblood, Virata is encompassed by screaming vultures and howling jackals\r\nand crowing ravens. Those black-eyed ladies, approaching the prostrate\r\nform of the Matsya king over which carnivorous birds are uttering cries\r\nof joy, are endeavouring to turn the body. Weakened by grief and\r\nexceedingly afflicted, they are unable to do what they intend. Scorched\r\nby the Sun, and worn out with exertion and toil, their faces have become\r\ncolourless and pale. Behold also, O Madhava, those other children besides\r\nAbhimanyu--Uttara, Sudakshina the prince of the Kambhojas, and the\r\nhandsome Lakshmana--all lying on the field of battle!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, Then the mighty Karna, that great bowman, lieth on the\r\nground! In battle he was like a blazing fire! That fire, however, hath\r\nnow been extinguished by the energy of Partha. Behold, Vikartanas son\r\nKarna, after having slain many atirathas, has been prostrated on the bare\r\nground, and is drenched with blood. Wrathful and possessed of great\r\nenergy, he was a great bowman and a mighty car-warrior. Slain in battle\r\nby the wielder of gandiva, that hero now sleepeth on the ground. My sons,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, from fear of the Pandavas, fought, placing\r\nKarna at their head, like a herd of elephants with its leader to the\r\nfore. Alas, like a tiger slain by a lion, or an elephant by an infuriated\r\nelephant, that warrior hath been slain in battle by Savyasaci. Assembled\r\ntogether, O tiger among men, the wives of that warrior, with dishevelled\r\ntresses and loud wails of grief, are sitting around that fallen hero!\r\nFilled with anxiety caused by the thoughts of that warrior, king\r\nYudhishthira the just could not, for thirteen years, obtain a wink of\r\nsleep! Incapable of being checked by foes in battle like Maghavat himself\r\nwho is invincible by enemies, Karna was like the all-destroying fire of\r\nfierce flames at the end of the yuga, and immovable like Himavat himself!\r\nThat hero became the protector of Dhritarashtras son, O Madhava! Alas,\r\ndeprived of life, he now lieth on the bare ground, like a tree prostrated\r\nby the wind! Behold, the wife of Karna and mother of Vrishasena, is\r\nindulging in piteous lamentations and crying and weeping and falling upon\r\nthe ground! Even now she exclaims, \"Without doubt, thy preceptors curse\r\nhath pursued thee! When the wheel of thy car was swallowed up by the\r\nEarth, the cruel Dhananjaya cut off thy head with an arrow! Alas, fie (on\r\nthe heroism and skill)!\" That lady, the mother of Sushena, exceedingly\r\nafflicted and uttering cries of woe, is falling down, deprived of her\r\nsenses, at the sight of the mighty-armed and brave Karna prostrated on\r\nthe earth, with his waist still encircled with a belt of gold.\r\nCarnivorous creatures, feeding on the body of that illustrious hero, have\r\nreduced it to very small dimensions. The sight is not gladdening, like\r\nthat of the moon on the fourteenth night of the dark fortnight. Falling\r\ndown on the earth, the cheerless dame is rising up again. Burning with\r\ngrief on account of the death of her son also, she cometh and smelleth\r\nthe face of her lord!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, Slain by Bhimasena, behold, the lord of Avanti lies\r\nthere! Vultures and jackals and crows are feeding upon that hero! Though\r\npossessed of many friends, he lies now perfectly friendless! Behold, O\r\nslayer of Madhu, having made a great slaughter of foes, that warrior is\r\nnow lying on the bed of a hero, covered with blood. Jackals, and kankas,\r\nand other carnivorous creatures of diverse kinds, are dragging him now.\r\nBehold the reverses brought about by Time. His wives, assembled together,\r\nand crying in grief, are sitting around that hero who in life was a\r\nterrible slayer of foes but who now lies on the bed of a hero. Behold,\r\nPratipas son Bahlika, that mighty bowman possessed of great energy, slain\r\nwith a broad-headed shaft, is now lying on the ground like a sleeping\r\ntiger. Though deprived of life, the colour of his face is still\r\nexceedingly bright, like that of the moon at full, risen on the fifteenth\r\nday of the lighted fortnight! Burning with grief on account of the death\r\nof his son, and desirous of accomplishing his vow, Indras son (Arjuna)\r\nhath slain there that son of Vriddhakshatra! Behold that Jayadratha, who\r\nwas protected by the illustrious Drona, slain by Partha bent on\r\naccomplishing his vow, after penetrating through eleven Akshauhinis of\r\ntroops. Inauspicious vultures, O Janardana, are feeding upon Jayadratha,\r\nthe lord of the Sindhu-Sauviras, full of pride and energy! Though sought\r\nto be protected by his devoted wives, see, O Acyuta, carnivorous\r\ncreatures are dragging his body away to a jungle in the vicinity. The\r\nKamboja and Yavana wives of that mighty-armed lord of the Sindhus and the\r\nSauviras are waiting upon him for protecting him (from the wild beasts).\r\nAt that time, O Janardana, when Jayadratha, assisted by the Kekayas,\r\nendeavoured to ravish Draupadi, he deserved to be slain by the Pandavas!\r\nFrom regard, however, for Duhshala, they set him free on that occasion.\r\nWhy, O Krishna, did they not show some regard for that Duhshala once\r\nmore? That daughter of mine, of tender years, is now crying in grief. She\r\nis striking her body with her own hands and censuring the Pandavas. What,\r\nO Krishna, can be a greater grief to me than that my daughter of tender\r\nyears should be a widow and all my daughters-in-law should become\r\nlordless. Alas, alas, behold, my daughter Duhshala, having cast off her\r\ngrief and fears, is running hither and thither in search of the head of\r\nher husband. He who had checked all the Pandavas desirous of rescuing\r\ntheir son, after causing the slaughter of a vast force, at last himself\r\nsuccumbed to death. Alas, those wives of his, with faces as beautiful as\r\nthe moon, are crying, sitting around that irresistible hero who resembled\r\nan infuriated elephant!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, There lies Shalya, the maternal uncle himself of Nakula,\r\nslain in battle, O sire, by the pious and virtuous Yudhishthira! He used\r\neverywhere, O bull among men, to boast of his equality with thee! That\r\nmighty car-warrior, the ruler of the Madras, now lieth, deprived of life.\r\nWhen he accepted the drivership of Karnas car in battle, he sought to\r\ndamp the energy of Karna for giving victory to the sons of Pandu! Alas,\r\nalas, behold the smooth face of Shalya, beautiful as the moon, and\r\nadorned with eyes resembling the petals of the lotus, eaten away by\r\ncrows! There, the tongue of that king, of the complexion of heated gold,\r\nrolling out of his mouth, is, O Krishna, being eaten away by carnivorous\r\nbirds! The ladies of the royal house of Madra, uttering loud wails of\r\nwoe, are sitting around the body of that king, that ornament of\r\nassemblies, deprived of life by Yudhishthira! Those ladies are sitting\r\naround that fallen hero like a herd of she-elephants in their season\r\naround their leader sunk in a slough. Behold the brave Shalya, that giver\r\nof protection, that foremost of car-warriors, stretched on the bed of\r\nheroes, his body mangled with shafts. There, king Bhagadatta of great\r\nprowess, the ruler of a mountainous kingdom, the foremost of all wielders\r\nof the elephant-hook, lieth on the ground, deprived of life. Behold the\r\ngarland of gold that he still wears on his head, looketh resplendent.\r\nThough the body is being eaten away by beasts of prey, that garland still\r\nadorns the fair locks on his head. Fierce was the battle that took place\r\nbetween this king and Partha, making the very hair stand on end, like\r\nthat between Shakra and the Asura Vritra. This mighty-armed one, having\r\nfought Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, and having reduced him to great\r\nstraits, was at last slain by his antagonist. He who had no equal on\r\nearth in heroism and energy, that achiever of terrible feats in battle,\r\nBhishma, lieth there, deprived of life. Behold the son of Shantanu, O\r\nKrishna, that warrior of solar effulgence, stretched on the earth, like\r\nthe Sun himself fallen from the firmament at the end of the yuga. Having\r\nscorched his foes with the fire of his weapons in battle, that valiant\r\nwarrior, that Sun among men, O Keshava, hath set like the real Sun at\r\nevening. Behold that hero, O Krishna, who in knowledge of duty was equal\r\nto Devapi himself, now lying on a bed of arrows, so worthy of heroes.\r\nHaving spread his excellent bed of barbed and unbarbed arrows, that hero\r\nlieth on it like the divine Skanda on a clump of heath. Indeed, the son\r\nof Ganga lieth, resting his head on that excellent pillow, consisting of\r\nthree arrows,--becoming complement of his bed--given him by the wielder\r\nof gandiva. For obeying the command of his sire, this illustrious one\r\ndrew up his vital seed. Unrivalled in battle, that son of Shantanu lieth\r\nthere, O Madhava! Of righteous soul and acquainted with every duty, by\r\nthe aid of his knowledge relating to both the worlds, that hero, though\r\nmortal, is still bearing his life like an immortal. When Shantanus son\r\nlieth today, struck down with arrows, it seems that no other person is\r\nalive on earth that possesseth learning and prowess that is competent to\r\nachieve great feats in battle. Truthful in speech, this righteous and\r\nvirtuous hero, solicited by the Pandavas, told them the means of his own\r\ndeath. Alas, he who had revived the line of Kuru that had become extinct,\r\nthat illustrious person possessed of great intelligence, hath left the\r\nworld with all the Kurus in his company. Of whom, O Madhava, will the\r\nKurus enquire of religion and duty after that bull among men, Devavrata,\r\nwho resembles a god, shall have gone to heaven? Behold Drona, that\r\nforemost of brahmanas, that preceptor of Arjuna, of Satyaki, and of the\r\nKurus, lying on the ground! Endued with mighty energy, Drona, O Madhava,\r\nwas as conversant with the four kinds of arms as the chief of the\r\ncelestials or Shukra of Bhrigus race. Through his grace, Vibhatsu the son\r\nof Pandu, hath achieved the most difficult feats. Deprived of life, he\r\nnow lies on the ground. Weapons refused to come (at last) at his bidding.\r\nPlacing him at their head, the Kauravas had challenged the Pandavas. That\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons was at last mangled with weapons. As\r\nhe careered in battle, scorching his foes in every direction, his course\r\nresembled that of a blazing conflagration. Alas, deprived of life, he now\r\nlieth on the ground, like an extinguished fire. The handle of the bow is\r\nyet in his grasp. The leathern fences, O Madhava, still encase his\r\nfingers. Though slain, he still looketh as if alive. The four Vedas, and\r\nall kinds of weapons, O Keshava, did not abandon that hero even as these\r\ndo not abandon the Lord Prajapati himself. His auspicious feet, deserving\r\nof every adoration and adored as a matter of fact by bards and eulogists\r\nand worshipped by disciples, are now being dragged by jackals. Deprived\r\nof her senses by grief, Kripi woefully attendeth, O slayer of Madhu, on\r\nthat Drona who hath been slain Drupadas son. Behold that afflicted lady,\r\nfallen upon the Earth, with dishevelled hair and face hanging down. Alas,\r\nshe attendeth in sorrow upon her lifeless lord, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons, lying on the ground. Many brahmacaris, with matted\r\nlocks on their head, are attending upon the body of Drona that is cased\r\nin armour rent through and through, O Keshava, with the shafts of\r\nDhrishtadyumna. The illustrious and delicate Kripi, cheerless and\r\nafflicted, is endeavouring to perform the last rites on the body of her\r\nlord slain in battle. There, those reciters of Samas, having placed the\r\nbody of Drona on the funeral pyre and having ignited the fire with due\r\nrites, are singing the three (well-known) Samas. Those brahmacaris, with\r\nmatted locks on their heads, have piled the funeral pyre of that brahmana\r\nwith bows and darts and car-boxes, O Madhava! Having collected diverse\r\nother kinds of shafts, that hero of great energy is being consumed by\r\nthem. Indeed, having placed him on the pyre, they are singing and\r\nweeping. Others are reciting the three (well-known) Samas that are used\r\non such occasions. Consuming Drona on that fire, like fire in fire, those\r\ndisciples of his of the regenerate class are proceeding towards the banks\r\nof the Ganga, along the left side of the pyre and having placed Kripi at\r\ntheir head!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, Behold the son of Somadatta, who was slain by Yuyudhana,\r\npecked at and torn by a large number of birds! Burning with grief at the\r\ndeath of his son, Somadatta, O Janardana, (as he lies there) seems to\r\ncensure the great bowman Yuyudhana. There the mother of Bhurishrava, that\r\nfaultless lady, overcome with grief, is addressing her lord Somadatta,\r\nsaying, \"By good luck, O king, thou seest not this terrible carnage of\r\nthe Bharatas, this extermination of the Kurus, this sight that resembles\r\nthe scenes occurring at the end of the yuga. By good luck, thou seest not\r\nthy heroic son, who bore the device of the sacrificial stake on his\r\nbanner and who performed numerous sacrifices with profuse presents to\r\nall, slain on the field of battle. By good luck, thou hearest not those\r\nfrightful wails of woe uttered amidst this carnage by thy\r\ndaughters-in-law like the screams of a flight of cranes on the bosom of\r\nthe sea. Thy daughters-in-law, bereaved of both husbands and sons, are\r\nrunning hither and thither, each clad in a single piece of raiment and\r\neach with her black tresses all dishevelled. By good luck, thou seest not\r\nthy son, that tiger among men, deprived of one of his arms, overthrown by\r\nArjuna, and even now in course of being devoured by beasts of prey. By\r\ngood luck, thou seest not today thy son slain in battle, and Bhurishrava\r\ndeprived of life, and thy widowed daughters-in-law plunged into grief. By\r\ngood luck, thou seest not the golden umbrella of that illustrious warrior\r\nwho had the sacrificial stake for the device on his banner, torn and\r\nbroken on the terrace of his car. There the black-eyed wives of\r\nBhurishrava are indulging in piteous lamentations, surrounding their lord\r\nslain by Satyaki. Afflicted with grief on account of the slaughter of\r\ntheir lords, those ladies, indulging in copious lamentations, are falling\r\ndown on the earth with their faces towards the ground, and slowly\r\napproaching thee, O Keshava! Alas, why did Arjuna of pure deeds\r\nperpetrate such a censurable act, since he struck off the arm of a\r\nheedless warrior who was brave and devoted to the performance of\r\nsacrifices. Alas, Satyaki did an act that was still more sinful, for he\r\ntook the life of a person of restrained soul while sitting in the\r\nobservance of the praya vow. Alas, O righteous one, thou liest on the\r\nground, slain unfairly by two foes.\" Even thus, O Madhava, those wives of\r\nBhurishrava are crying aloud in woe. There, those wives of that warrior,\r\nall possessed of slender waists, are placing upon their laps the lopped\r\noff arm of their lord and weeping bitterly!\r\n\r\n\"Here is that arm which used to invade the girdles, grind the deep\r\nbosoms, and touch the navel, the thighs, and the hips, of fair women, and\r\nloosen the ties of the drawers worn by them! Here is that arm which slew\r\nfoes and dispelled the fears of friends, which gave thousands of kine and\r\nexterminated Kshatriyas in battle! In the presence of Vasudeva himself,\r\nArjuna of unstained deeds, lopped it off thy heedless self while thou\r\nwert engaged with another in battle. What, indeed, wilt thou, O\r\nJanardana, say of this great feat of Arjuna while speaking of it in the\r\nmidst of assemblies. What also will the diadem-decked Arjuna himself say\r\nof it?\" Censuring thee in this way, that foremost of ladies hath stopped\r\nat last. The co-wives of that lady are piteously lamenting with her as if\r\nshe were their daughter-in-law!\r\n\r\n\"There the mighty Shakuni, the chief of gandharvas, of prowess incapable\r\nof being baffled, hath been slain by Sahadeva, the maternal uncle by the\r\nsisters son! Formerly, he used to be fanned with a couple of gold-handed\r\nfans! Alas, now, his prostrate form is being fanned by birds with their\r\nwings! He used to assume hundreds and thousands of forms. All the\r\nillusions, however, of that individual possessed of great deceptive\r\npowers, have been burnt by the energy of the son of Pandu. An expert in\r\nguile, he had vanquished Yudhishthira in the assembly by his powers of\r\ndeception and won from him his vast kingdom. The son of Pandu, however,\r\nhath now won Shakunis life-breaths. Behold, O Krishna, a large number of\r\nbirds is now sitting around Shakuni. An expert in dice, alas, he had\r\nacquired that skill for the destruction of my sons. This fire of\r\nhostility with the Pandavas had been ignited by Shakuni for the\r\ndestruction of my children as also of himself and his followers and\r\nkinsmen. Like those acquired by my sons, O puissant one, by the use of\r\nweapons, this one too, however wicked-souled, has acquired many regions\r\nof bliss by the use of weapons. My fear, O slayer of Madhu, is that that\r\ncrooked person may not succeed in fomenting dissensions even (there, the\r\nregion attained by them) between my children, all of whom are confiding\r\nand possessed of candour!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, Behold that irresistible ruler of the Kambojas, that\r\nbull-necked hero, lying amid the dust, O Madhava, though deserving of\r\nbeing stretched at his ease on Kamboja blankets. Stricken with great\r\ngrief, his wife is weeping bitterly at sight of his blood-stained arms,\r\nwhich, however, formerly used to be smeared with sandal-paste. Indeed,\r\nthe beauteous one exclaims, \"Even now adorned with beautiful palms and\r\ngraceful fingers, these two arms of thine resemble a couple of spiked\r\nmaces, getting within whose clasp, joy never left me for a moment! What\r\nwill be my end, O ruler of men, when I am deprived of thee?\" Endued with\r\na melodious voice, the Kamboja queen is weeping helplessly and quivering\r\nwith emotion. Behold that bevy of fair ladies there. Although tired with\r\nexertion and worn out with heat, yet beauty leaves not their forms, like\r\nthe sightliness of the wreaths worn by the celestials although exposed to\r\nthe Sun. Behold, O slayer of Madhu, the heroic ruler of the Kalingas\r\nlying there on the ground with his mighty arms adorned with a couple of\r\nangadas. Behold, O Janardana, those Magadha ladies crying and standing\r\naround Jayatsena, the ruler of the Magadhas. The charming and melodious\r\nwails of those long-eyed and sweet-voiced girls, O Krishna, are\r\nstupefying my heart exceedingly. With all their ornaments displaced,\r\ncrying, and afflicted with grief, alas, those ladies of Magadha, worthy\r\nof resting on costly beds, are now lying down on the bare ground! There,\r\nagain, those other ladies, surrounding their lord, the ruler of the\r\nKosalas, prince Brihadbala, are indulging in loud wails. Engaged in\r\nplucking from his body the shafts with which it was pierced by Abhimanyu\r\nwith the full might of his arms, those ladies are repeatedly losing their\r\nsenses. The faces of those beautiful ladies, O Madhava, through toil and\r\nthe rays of the Sun, are looking like faded lotuses. There, the brave\r\nsons of Dhrishtadyumna, of tender years and all adorned with garlands of\r\ngold and beautiful angadas, are lying, slain by Drona. Like insects on a\r\nblazing fire, they have all been burnt by falling upon Drona, whose car\r\nwas the chamber of fire, having the bow for its flame and shafts and\r\ndarts and maces for its fuel. Similarly, the five Kekaya brothers,\r\npossessed of great courage, and adorned with beautiful angadas, are lying\r\non the ground, slain by Drona and with their faces turned towards that\r\nhero. Their coats of mail, of the splendour of heated gold, and their\r\ntall standards and cars and garlands, all made of the same metal, are\r\nshedding a bright light on the earth like so many blazing fires. Behold,\r\nO Madhava, king Drupada overthrown in battle by Drona, like a mighty\r\nelephant in the forest slain by a huge lion. The bright umbrella, white\r\nin hue of the king of the Pancalas, shines, O lotus-eyed one, like the\r\nmoon in the autumnal firmament. The daughters-in-law and the wives of the\r\nold king, afflicted with grief, having burnt his body on the funeral\r\npyre, are proceeding, keeping the pyre to their right. There those\r\nladies, deprived of their senses, are removing the brave and great bowman\r\nDhrishtaketu, that bull among the Cedis, slain by Drona. This crusher of\r\nfoes, O slayer of Madhu, this great bowman, having baffled many weapons\r\nof Drona, lieth there, deprived of life, like a tree uprooted by the\r\nwind. Alas, that brave ruler of the Cedis, that mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtaketu, after having slain thousands of foes, lies himself deprived\r\nof life! There, O Hrishikesha, the wives of the ruler of the Cedis are\r\nsitting around his body still decked with fair locks and beautiful\r\nearrings, though torn by carnivorous birds. Those foremost of ladies\r\nplacing upon their laps the prostrate form of the heroic Dhrishtaketu\r\nborn of the Dasharha race, are crying in sorrow. Behold, O Hrishikesha,\r\nthe son, possessed of fair locks and excellent earrings, of that\r\nDhrishtaketu, hacked in battle by Drona with his shafts. He never\r\ndeserted his sire while the latter battled with his foes. Mark, O slayer\r\nof Madhu, he does not, even in death, desert that heroic parent. Even\r\nthus, my sons son, that slayer of hostile heroes, the mighty-armed\r\nLakshmana, hath followed his sire Duryodhana! Behold, O Keshava, the two\r\nbrothers of Avanti, Vinda and Anuvinda, lying there on the field, like\r\ntwo blossoming shala trees in the spring overthrown by the tempest. Clad\r\nin golden armour and adorned with Angadas of gold, they are still armed\r\nwith swords and bows. Possessed of eyes like those of a bull, and decked\r\nwith bright garlands, both of them are stretched on the field. The\r\nPandavas, O Krishna, with thyself, are surely unslayable, since they and\r\nthou have escaped from Drona, from Bhishma, from Karna the son of\r\nVikartana, from Kripa, from Duryodhana, from the son of Drona, from the\r\nmighty car-warrior Jayadratha, from Somadatta, from Vikarna, and from the\r\nbrave Kritavarma. Behold the reverses brought about by Time! Those bulls\r\namong men that were capable of slaying the very celestials by force of\r\ntheir weapons have themselves been slain. Without doubt, O Madhava, there\r\nis nothing difficult for destiny to bring about, since even these bulls\r\namong men, these heroes, have been slain by Kshatriya warriors. My sons\r\nendued with great activity were (regarded by me as) slain even then, O\r\nKrishna, when thou returnedst unsuccessfully to Upaplavya. Shantanus son\r\nand the wise Vidura told me then, \"Cease to bear affection for thy\r\nchildren!\" The interviews of those persons could not go for nothing.\r\nSoon, O Janardana, have my sons been consumed into ashes!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Having said these words, Gandhari, deprived of\r\nher senses by grief, fell down on the earth! Casting off her fortitude,\r\nshe suffered her senses to be stupefied by grief. Filled with wrath and\r\nwith sorrow at the death of her sons, Gandhari, with agitated heart,\r\nascribed every fault to Keshava.\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, The Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, O Krishna, have both\r\nbeen burnt. Whilst they were thus being exterminated, O Janardana, why\r\nwert thou indifferent to them? Thou wert competent to prevent the\r\nslaughter, for thou hast a large number of followers and a vast force.\r\nThou hadst eloquence, and thou hadst the power (for bringing about\r\npeace). Since deliberately, O slayer of Madhu, thou wert indifferent to\r\nthis universal carnage, therefore, O mighty-armed one, thou shouldst reap\r\nthe fruit of this act. By the little merit I have acquired through\r\nwaiting dutifully on my husband, by that merit so difficult to attain, I\r\nshall curse thee, O wielder of the discus and the mace! Since thou wert\r\nindifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other,\r\ntherefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen! In the\r\nthirty-sixth year from this, O slayer of Madhu, thou shalt, after causing\r\nthe slaughter of thy kinsmen and friends and sons, perish by disgusting\r\nmeans in the wilderness. The ladies of thy race, deprived of sons,\r\nkinsmen, and friends, shall weep and cry even as these ladies of the\r\nBharata race!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Hearing these words, the high-souled Vasudeva,\r\naddressing the venerable Gandhari, said unto her these words, with a\r\nfaint smile, There is none in the world, save myself, that is capable of\r\nexterminating the Vrishnis. I know this well. I am endeavouring to bring\r\nit about. In uttering this curse, O thou of excellent vows, thou hast\r\naided me in the accomplishment of that task. The Vrishnis are incapable\r\nof being slain by others, be they human beings or gods or Danavas. The\r\nYadavas, therefore shall fall by one anothers hand. After he of Dasharhas\r\nrace had said these words, the Pandavas became stupefied. Filled with\r\nanxiety all of them became hopeless of life!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\n\"The holy one said, Arise, arise, O Gandhari, do not set thy heart on\r\ngrief! Through thy fault, this vast carnage has taken place! Thy son\r\nDuryodhana was wicked-souled, envious, and exceedingly arrogant.\r\nApplauding his wicked acts, thou regardest them to be good. Exceedingly\r\ncruel, he was the embodiment of hostilities, and disobedient to the\r\ninjunctions of the old. Why dost thou wish to ascribe thy own faults to\r\nme? Dead or lost, the person that grieves for what has already occurred,\r\nobtaineth more grief. By indulging in grief, one increases it two-fold. A\r\nwoman of the regenerate class bears children for the practice of\r\nausterities; the cow brings forth offspring for bearing burdens; the mare\r\nbrings forth her young for acquiring speed of motion; the Shudra woman\r\nbears a child for adding to the number of servitors; the Vaishya woman\r\nfor adding to the number of keepers of cattle. A princess, however, like\r\nthee, brings forth sons for being slaughtered!\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Hearing these words of Vasudeva that were\r\ndisagreeable to her, Gandhari, with heart exceedingly agitated by grief,\r\nremained silent. The royal sage Dhritarashtra, however, restraining the\r\ngrief that arises from folly, enquired of Yudhishthira the just, saying,\r\nIf, O son of Pandu, thou knowest it, tell me the number of those that\r\nhave fallen in this battle, as also of those that have escaped with life!\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira answered, One billion 660 million and 20,000 men have\r\nfallen in this battle. Of the heroes that have escaped, the number is\r\n240,165.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, Tell me, O mighty-armed one, for thou art conversant\r\nwith everything, what ends have those foremost of men attained.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, Those warriors of true prowess that have cheerfully\r\ncast off their bodies in fierce battle have all attained regions like\r\nthose of Indra. Knowing death to be inevitable, they that have\r\nencountered it cheerlessly have attained the companionship of the\r\ngandharvas. Those warriors that have fallen at the edge of weapons, while\r\nturning away from the field or begging for quarter, have attained the\r\nworld of the guhyakas. Those high-souled warriors who, observant of the\r\nduties of kshatriya-hood and regarding flight from battle to be shameful,\r\nhave fallen, mangled with keen weapons, while advancing unarmed against\r\nfighting foes, have all assumed bright forms and attained the regions of\r\nBrahman. The remaining warriors, that have in anyhow met with death on\r\nthe precincts of the field of battle, have attained the region of the\r\nUttara-Kurus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, By the power of what knowledge, O son, thou seest\r\nthese things like one crowned with ascetic success? Tell me this, O\r\nmighty-armed one, if thou thinkest that I can listen to it without\r\nimpropriety!\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, While at thy command I wandered in the forest, I\r\nobtained this boon on the occasion of sojourning to the sacred places. I\r\nmet with the celestial rishi Lomasa and obtained from him the boon of\r\nspiritual vision. Thus on a former occasion I obtained second sight\r\nthrough the power of knowledge!\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, It is necessary that our people should burn, with\r\ndue rites, the bodies of both the friendless and the friended slain. What\r\nshall we do with those that have none to look after them and that have no\r\nsacred fires? The duties that await us are many. Who are those whose\r\n(last) rites we should perform? O Yudhishthira, will they obtain regions\r\nof blessedness by the merit of their acts, they whose bodies are now\r\nbeing torn and dragged by vultures and other birds?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, Kuntis son Yudhishthira of\r\ngreat wisdom commanded Sudharma (the priest of the Kauravas) and Dhaumya,\r\nand Sanjaya of the suta order, and Vidura of great wisdom, and Yuyutsu of\r\nKurus race, and all his servants headed by Indrasena, and all the other\r\nsutas that were with him, saying, Cause the funeral rites of the slain,\r\nnumbering by thousands, to be duly performed, so that nobody may perish\r\nfor want of persons to take care of them! At this command of king\r\nYudhishthira the just, Vidura and Sanjaya and Sudharma and Dhaumya and\r\nIndrasena and others, procuring sandal, aloe and other kinds of wood used\r\non such occasions, as also clarified butter and oil and perfumes and\r\ncostly silken robes and other kinds of cloth, and large heaps of dry\r\nwood, and broken cars and diverse kinds of weapons, caused funeral pyres\r\nto be duly made and lighted and then without haste burnt, with due rites\r\nthe slain kings in proper order. They properly burned upon those fires\r\nthat blazed forth with libations of clarified butter in torrents over\r\nthem, the bodies of Duryodhana and his hundred brothers, of Shalya, and\r\nking Bhurishrava; of king Jayadratha and Abhimanyu, O Bharata; of\r\nDuhshasanas son and Lakshmana and king Dhrishtaketu; of Vrihanta and\r\nSomadatta and the hundreds of Srinjayas; of king Kshemadhanva and Virata\r\nand Drupada; of Shikhandi the prince of Pancalas, and Dhrishtadyumna of\r\nPrishatas race; of the valiant Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja; of the ruler of\r\nthe Kosalas, the sons of Draupadi, and Shakuni the son of Subala; of\r\nAcala and Vrishaka, and king Bhagadatta; of Karna and his son of great\r\nwrath; of those great bowmen, the Kekaya princes, and those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, the Trigartas; of Ghatotkaca the prince of rakshasas, and\r\nthe brother of Vaka, of Alambusha, the foremost of rakshasas, and king\r\nJalasandha; and of hundreds and thousands of other kings. The pitri-medha\r\nrites in honour of some of the illustrious dead were performed there,\r\nwhile some sang Samas, and some uttered lamentations for the dead. With\r\nthe loud noise of Samas and Riks, and the lamentations of the women, all\r\ncreatures became stupefied that night. The funeral fires, smokeless and\r\nblazing brightly (amid the surrounding darkness), looked like luminous\r\nplanets in the firmament enveloped by clouds. Those among the dead that\r\nhad come from diverse realms and were utterly friendless were piled\r\ntogether in thousands of heaps and, at the command of Yudhishthira, were\r\ncaused to be burnt by Vidura through a large number of persons acting\r\ncoolly and influenced by good-will and affection, on pyres made of dry\r\nwood. Having caused their last rites to be performed, the Kuru king\r\nYudhishthira, placing Dhritarashtra at his head, proceeded towards the\r\nriver Ganga.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said, \"Arrived at the auspicious Ganga full of sacred\r\nwater, containing many lakes, adorned with high banks and broad shores,\r\nand having a vast bed, they cast off their ornaments, upper garments, and\r\nbelts and girdles. The Kuru ladies, crying and afflicted with great\r\ngrief, offered oblations of water unto their sires and grandsons and\r\nbrothers and kinsmen and sons and reverend seniors and husbands.\r\nConversant with duties, they also performed the water-rite in honour of\r\ntheir friends. While those wives of heroes were performing this rite in\r\nhonour of their heroic lords, the access to the stream became easy,\r\nalthough the paths (made by the tread of many feet) disappeared\r\nafterwards. The shores of the stream, though crowded with those spouses\r\nof heroes, looked as broad as the ocean and presented a spectacle of\r\nsorrow and cheerlessness. Then Kunti, O king, in a sudden paroxysm of\r\ngrief, weepingly addressed her sons in these soft words, That hero and\r\ngreat bowman, that leader of leaders of car-divisions, that warrior\r\ndistinguished by every mark of heroism, who hath been slain by Arjuna in\r\nbattle, that warrior whom, ye sons of Pandu, ye took forth, Sutas child\r\nborn of Radha, that hero who shone in the midst of his forces like the\r\nlord Surya himself, who battled with all of you and your followers, who\r\nlooked resplendent as he commanded the vast force of the Duryodhana, who\r\nhad no equal on earth for energy, that hero who preferred glory to life,\r\nthat unretiring warrior firm in truth and never fatigued with exertion,\r\nwas your eldest brother. Offer oblations of water unto that eldest\r\nbrother of yours who was born of me by the god of day. That hero was born\r\nwith a pair of earrings and clad in armour, and resembled Surya himself\r\nin splendour! Hearing these painful words of their mother, the Pandavas\r\nbegan to express their grief for Karna. Indeed, they became more\r\nafflicted than ever. Then that tiger among men, the heroic Yudhishthira,\r\nsighing like a snake, asked his mother, That Karna who was like an ocean\r\nhaving shafts for his billows, his tall standard for his vortex, his own\r\nmighty arms for a couple of huge alligators, his large car for his deep\r\nlake, and the sound of his palms for his tempestuous roar, and whose\r\nimpetuosity none could withstand save Dhananjaya, O mother, wert thou the\r\nauthoress of that heroic being? How was that son, resembling a very\r\ncelestial, born of thee in former days? The energy of his arms scorched\r\nall of us. How, mother, couldst thou conceal him like a person concealing\r\na fire within the folds of his cloth? His might of arms was always\r\nworshipped by the Dhartarashtras even as we always worship the might of\r\nthe wielder of gandiva! How was that foremost of mighty men, that first\r\nof car-warriors, who endured the united force of all lords of earth in\r\nbattle, how was he a son of thine? Was that foremost of all wielders of\r\nweapons our eldest brother? How didst thou bring forth that child of\r\nwonderful prowess? Alas, in consequence of the concealment of this affair\r\nby thee, we have been undone! By the death of Karna, ourselves with all\r\nour friends have been exceedingly afflicted. The grief I feel at Karnas\r\ndeath is a hundred times greater than that which was caused by the death\r\nof Abhimanyu and the sons of Draupadi, and the destruction of the\r\nPancalas and the Kurus. Thinking of Karna, I am burning with grief, like\r\na person thrown into a blazing fire. Nothing could have been unattainable\r\nby us, not excepting things belonging to heaven. Alas, this terrible\r\ncarnage, so destructive of the Kurus, would not have occurred. Copiously\r\nindulging in lamentations like these, king Yudhishthira the just uttered\r\nloud wails of woe. The puissant monarch then offered oblations of water\r\nunto his deceased elder brother. Then all the ladies that crowded the\r\nshores of the river suddenly sent up a loud wail of grief. The\r\nintelligent king of the Kurus, Yudhishthira, caused the wives and members\r\nof Karnas family to be brought before him. Of righteous soul, he\r\nperformed, with them, the water-rite in honour of his eldest brother.\r\nHaving finished the ceremony, the king with his senses exceedingly\r\nagitated, rose from the waters of Ganga.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of Stri-parv\r\n"
