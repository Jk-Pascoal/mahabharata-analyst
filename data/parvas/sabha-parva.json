      "content": "(Sabhakriya Parva)\r\n\r\nOm! After having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted male\r\nbeing, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said,--\"Then, in the presence of Vasudeva, Maya Danava,\r\nhaving worshipped Arjuna, repeatedly spoke unto him with joined hands and\r\nin amiable words,--'O son of Kunti, saved have I been by thee from this\r\nKrishna in spate and from Pavaka (fire) desirous of consuming me. Tell me\r\nwhat I have to do for thee.\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,--'O great Asura, everything hath already been done by thee\r\n(even by this offer of thine). Blest be thou. Go whithersoever thou\r\nlikest. Be kind and well-disposed towards me, as we are even kind to and\r\nwell-pleased with thee!'\r\n\r\n\"Maya said,--'O bull amongst men, what thou hast said is worthy of thee,\r\nO exalted one. But O Bharata, I desire to do something for thee\r\ncheerfully. I am a great artist, a Viswakarma among the Danavas. O son of\r\nPandu, being what I am, I desire to do something for thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,--'O sinless one, thou regardest thyself as saved (by me)\r\nfrom imminent death. Even if it hath been so, I cannot make thee do\r\nanything for me. At the same time, O Danava, I do not wish to frustrate\r\nthy intentions. Do thou something for Krishna. That will be a sufficient\r\nrequital for my services to thee.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"Then, O bull of the Bharata race, urged by Maya,\r\nVasudeva reflected for a moment as to what he should ask Maya to\r\naccomplish. Krishna, the Lord of the universe and the Creator of every\r\nobject, having reflected in his mind, thus commanded Maya,--'Let a\r\npalatial sabha (meeting hall) as thou choosest, be built (by thee), if\r\nthou, O son of Diti, who art the foremost of all artists, desirest to do\r\ngood to Yudhishthira the just. Indeed, build thou such a palace that\r\npersons belonging to the world of men may not be able to imitate it even\r\nafter examining it with care, while seated within. And, O Maya, build\r\nthou a mansion in which we may behold a combination of godly, asuric and\r\nhuman designs.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Having heard those words, Maya became\r\nexceedingly glad. And he forthwith built a magnificent palace for the son\r\nof Pandu like unto the palace of the celestials themselves. Then Krishna\r\nand Partha (Arjuna) after having narrated everything unto king\r\nYudhishthira the just, introduced Maya unto him. Yudhishthira received\r\nMaya with respect, offering him the honour he deserved. And, O Bharata,\r\nMaya accepted that honour thinking highly of it. O monarch of the Bharata\r\nrace, that great son of Diti then recited unto the sons of Pandu the\r\nhistory of the Danava Vrisha-parva, and that foremost of artists then,\r\nhaving rested awhile, set himself after much thoughtful planning to build\r\na palace for the illustrious sons of Pandu. Agreeably to the wishes of\r\nboth Krishna and the sons of Pritha, the illustrious Danava of great\r\nprowess, having performed on an auspicious day the initial propitiatory\r\nrites of foundation and having also gratified thousands of well-versed\r\nBrahmanas with sweetened milk and rice and with rich presents of various\r\nkinds, measured out a plot of land five thousand cubits square, which was\r\ndelightful and exceedingly handsome to behold and which was favourable\r\nfor construction of a building well-suited to the exigencies of every\r\nseason.\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said,--\"Janardana deserving the worship of all, having\r\nlived happily at Khandavaprastha for some time, and having been treated\r\nall the while with respectful love and affection by the sons of Pritha,\r\nbecame desirous one day of leaving Khandavaprastha to behold his father.\r\nThat possessor of large eyes, unto whom was due the obeisance of the\r\nuniverse, then saluted both Yudhishthira and Pritha and made obeisance\r\nwith his head unto the feet of Kunti, his father's sister. Thus revered\r\nby Kesava, Pritha smelt his head and embraced him. The illustrious\r\nHrishikesa approached his own sister Subhadra affectionately, with his\r\neyes filled with tears, and spoke unto her words of excellent import and\r\ntruth, terse proper, unanswerable and fraught with good. The\r\nsweet-speeched Subhadra also, saluting him in return and worshipping him\r\nrepeatedly with bent head, told him all that she wished to be conveyed to\r\nher relatives on the paternal side. And bidding her farewell and uttering\r\nbenedictions on his handsome sister, he of the Vrishni race, next saw\r\nDraupadi and Dhaumya. That best of men duly made obeisance unto Dhaumya,\r\nand consoling Draupadi obtained leave from her. Then the learned and\r\nmighty Krishna, accompanied by Partha, went to his cousins. And\r\nsurrounded by the five brothers, Krishna shone like Sakra in the midst of\r\nthe celestials. He whose banner bore the figure of Garuda, desirous of\r\nperforming the rites preparatory to the commencement of a journey,\r\npurified himself by a bath and adorned his person with ornaments. The\r\nbull of the Yadu race then worshipped the gods and Brahmanas with floral\r\nwreaths, mantras, bows of the head, and excellent perfumes. Having\r\nfinished all these rites, that foremost of steady and virtuous persons\r\nthen thought of setting out. The chief of the Yadu race then came out of\r\nthe inner to the outer apartment, and issuing thence he made unto\r\nBrahmanas, deserving of worship, offerings of vessel-fulls of curd and\r\nfruits, and parched-grain and caused them to pronounce benedictions upon\r\nhim. And making unto them presents also of wealth, he went round them.\r\nThen ascending his excellent car of gold endued with great speed and\r\nadorned with banner bearing the figure of Tarkhya (Garuda) and furnished\r\nalso with mace, discus, sword, his bow Sharnga and other weapons, and\r\nyoking thereunto his horses Saivya and Sugriva, he of eyes like lotuses\r\nset out at an excellent moment of a lunar day of auspicious stellar\r\nconjunction. And Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, from affection,\r\nascended the chariot after Krishna, and causing that best charioteer\r\nDaruka to stand aside, himself took the reins. And Arjuna also, of long\r\narms, riding on that car, walked round Krishna and fanned him with a\r\nwhite chamara furnished with a handle of gold. And the mighty Bhimasena\r\naccompanied by the twin brothers Nakula and Sahadeva and the priests and\r\ncitizens all followed Krishna from behind. And Kesava, that slayer of\r\nhostile heroes, followed by all the brothers, shone like a preceptor\r\nfollowed by his favourite pupils. Then Govinda spoke unto Arjuna and\r\nclasped him firmly, and worshipping Yudhisthira and Bhima, embraced the\r\ntwins. And embraced in return by the three elder Pandavas, he was\r\nreverentially saluted by the twins. After having gone about half a Yojana\r\n(two miles), Krishna, that subjugator of hostile towns, respectfully\r\naddressed Yudhishthira and requested him, O Bharata, to stop following\r\nhim further. And Govinda, conversant with every duty, then reverentially\r\nsaluted Yudhishthira and took hold of his feet. But Yudhishthira soon\r\nraised Kesava and smelt his head. King Yudhishthira the just, the son of\r\nPandu, having raised Krishna endued with eyes like lotus-petals and the\r\nforemost of the Yadava race, gave him leave, saying,--'Good bye!' Then\r\nthe slayer of Madhu, making an appointment with them (about his return)\r\nin words that were proper, and preventing with difficulty the Pandavas\r\nfrom following him further on foot, gladly proceeded towards his own\r\ncity, like Indra going towards Amravati. Out of the love and affection\r\nthey bore him, the Pandavas gazed on Krishna as long as he was within\r\nsight, and their minds also followed him when he got out of sight. And\r\nKesava of agreeable person soon disappeared from their sight, unsatiated\r\nthough their minds were with looking at him. Those bulls among men, the\r\nsons of Pritha, with minds fixed on Govinda, desisted (from following him\r\nfurther) and unwillingly returned to their own city in haste. And Krishna\r\nin his car soon reached Dwaraka followed by that hero Satyaki. Then\r\nSauri, the son of Devaki, accompanied by his charioteer Daruka reached\r\nDwaraka with the speed of Garuda.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Meanwhile king Yudhishthira of unfading glory,\r\naccompanied by his brothers and surrounded by friends, entered his\r\nexcellent capital. And that tiger among men, dismissing all his\r\nrelatives, brothers, and sons, sought to make himself happy in the\r\ncompany of Draupadi. And Kesava also, worshipped by the principal Yadavas\r\nincluding Ugrasena, entered with a happy heart his own excellent city.\r\nAnd worshipping his old father and his illustrious mother, and saluting\r\n(his brother) Valadeva, he of eyes like lotus-petals took his seat.\r\nEmbracing Pradyumna, Shamva, Nishatha, Charudeshna, Gada, Aniruddha and\r\nBhanu, and obtaining the leave of all the elderly men, Janardana entered\r\nthe apartments of Rukmini.\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said,--\"Then Maya Danava addressed Arjuna, that foremost of\r\nsuccessful warriors, saying,--'I now go with thy leave, but shall come\r\nback soon. On the north of the Kailasa peak near the mountains of\r\nMainaka, while the Danavas were engaged in a sacrifice on the banks of\r\nVindu lake, I gathered a huge quantity of delightful and variegated vanda\r\n(a kind of rough materials) composed of jewels and gems. This was placed\r\nin the mansion of Vrishaparva ever devoted to truth. If it be yet\r\nexisting, I shall come back, O Bharata, with it. I shall then commence\r\nthe construction of the delightful palace of the Pandavas, which is to be\r\nadorned with every kind of gems and celebrated all over the world. There\r\nis also, I think, O thou of the Kuru race, a fierce club placed in the\r\nlake Vindu by the King (of the Danavas) after slaughtering therewith all\r\nhis foes in battle. Besides being heavy and strong and variegated with\r\ngolden knobs, it is capable of bearing great weight, and of slaying all\r\nfoes, and is equal in strength unto an hundred thousand clubs. It is a\r\nfit weapon for Bhima, even as the Gandiva is for thee. There is also (in\r\nthat lake) a large conch-shell called Devadatta of loud sound, that came\r\nfrom Varuna. I shall no doubt give all these to thee. Having spoken thus\r\nunto Partha, the Asura went away in a north-easterly direction. On the\r\nnorth of Kailasa in the mountains of Mainaka, there is a huge peak of\r\ngems and jewels called Hiranya-sringa. Near that peak is a delightful\r\nlake of the name of Vindu. There, on its banks, previously dwelt king\r\nBhagiratha for many years, desiring to behold the goddess Ganga, since\r\ncalled Bhagirathee after that king's name. And there, on its banks, O\r\nthou best of the Bharatas, Indra the illustrious lord of every created\r\nthing, performed one hundred great sacrifices. There, for the sake of\r\nbeauty, though not according to the dictates of the ordinance, were\r\nplaced sacrificial stakes made of gems and altars of gold. There, after\r\nperforming those sacrifices, the thousand-eyed lord of Sachi became\r\ncrowned with success. There the fierce Mahadeva, the eternal lord of\r\nevery creature, has taken up his abode after having created all the\r\nworlds and there he dwelleth, worshipped with reverence by thousands of\r\nspirits. There Nara and Narayana, Brahma and Yama and Sthanu the fifth,\r\nperform their sacrifices at the expiration of a thousand yugas. There,\r\nfor the establishment of virtue and religion, Vasudeva, with pious\r\ndevotion, performed his sacrifices extending for many, many long years.\r\nThere were placed by Keshava thousands and tens of thousands of\r\nsacrificial stakes adorned with golden garlands and altars of great\r\nsplendour. Going thither, O Bharata, Maya brought back the club and the\r\nconch-shell and the various crystalline articles that had belonged to\r\nking Vrishaparva. And the great Asura, Maya, having gone thither,\r\npossessed himself of the whole of the great wealth which was guarded by\r\nYakshas and Rakshasas. Bringing them, the Asura constructed therewith a\r\npeerless palace, which was of great beauty and of celestial make,\r\ncomposed entirely of gems and precious stones, and celebrated throughout\r\nthe three worlds. He gave unto Bhimasena that best of clubs, and unto\r\nArjuna the most excellent conch-shell at whose sound all creatures\r\ntrembled in awe. And the palace that Maya built consisted of columns of\r\ngold, and occupied, O monarch, an area of five thousand cubits. The\r\npalace, possessing an exceedingly beautiful form, like unto that of Agni\r\nor Suryya, or Soma, shone in great splendour, and by its brilliance\r\nseemed to darken even the bright rays of the sun. And with the effulgence\r\nit exhibited, which was a mixture of both celestial and terrestrial\r\nlight, it looked as if it was on fire. Like unto a mass of new clouds\r\nconspicuous in the sky, the palace rose up coming into view of all.\r\nIndeed, the palace that the dexterous Maya built was so wide, delightful,\r\nand refreshing, and composed of such excellent materials, and furnished\r\nwith such golden walls and archways, and adorned with so many varied\r\npictures, and was withal so rich and well-built, that in beauty it far\r\nsurpassed Sudharma of the Dasarha race, or the mansion of Brahma himself.\r\nAnd eight thousand Rakshasas called Kinkaras, fierce, huge-bodied and\r\nendued with great strength, of red coppery eyes and arrowy ears,\r\nwell-armed and capable of ranging through the air, used to guard and\r\nprotect that palace. Within that palace Maya placed a peerless tank, and\r\nin that tank were lotuses with leaves of dark-coloured gems and stalks of\r\nbright jewels, and other flowers also of golden leaves. And aquatic fowls\r\nof various species sported on its bosom. Itself variegated with\r\nfull-blown lotuses and stocked with fishes and tortoises of golden hue,\r\nits bottom was without mud and its water transparent. There was a flight\r\nof crystal stairs leading from the banks to the edge of the water. The\r\ngentle breezes that swept along its bosom softly shook the flowers that\r\nstudded it. The banks of that tank were overlaid with slabs of costly\r\nmarble set with pearls. And beholding that tank thus adorned all around\r\nwith jewels and precious stones, many kings that came there mistook it\r\nfor land and fell into it with eyes open. Many tall trees of various\r\nkinds were planted all around the palace. Of green foliage and cool\r\nshade, and ever blossoming, they were all very charming to behold.\r\nArtificial woods were laid around, always emitting a delicious fragrance.\r\nAnd there were many tanks also that were adorned with swans and\r\nKarandavas and Chakravakas (Brahminy ducks) in the grounds lying about\r\nthe mansion. And the breeze bearing the fragrance of lotuses growing in\r\nwater and (of those growing on land) ministered unto the pleasure and\r\nhappiness of the Pandavas. And Maya having constructed such a palatial\r\nhall within fourteen months, reported its completion unto Yudhishthira.\""

The king gratified those\r\nsuperior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food\r\nseasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with\r\nrice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of\r\nmeat--with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands\r\nthat are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and\r\nunused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths.

He was a perfect master in reconciling contradictory texts\r\nand differentiating in applying general principles to particular cases,\r\nas also in interpreting contraries by reference to differences in\r\nsituation, eloquent, resolute, intelligent, possessed of powerful memory.\r\nHe was acquainted with the science of morals and politics, learned,\r\nproficient in distinguishing inferior things from superior ones, skilled\r\nin drawing inference from evidence, competent to judge of the correctness\r\nor incorrectness of syllogistic statements consisting of five\r\npropositions. He was capable of answering successively Vrihaspati himself\r\nwhile arguing, with definite conclusions properly framed about religion,\r\nwealth, pleasure and salvation, of great soul and beholding this whole\r\nuniverse, above, below, and around, as if it were present before his\r\neyes. He was master of both the Sankhya and Yoga systems of philosophy,\r\never desirous of humbling the celestials and Asuras by fomenting quarrels\r\namong them, conversant with the sciences of war and treaty, proficient in\r\ndrawing conclusions by judging of things not within direct ken, as also\r\nin the six sciences of treaty, war, military campaigns, maintenance of\r\nposts against the enemy and stratagems by ambuscades and reserves. He was\r\na thorough master of every branch of learning, fond of war and music,\r\nincapable of being repulsed by any science or any course, of action, and\r\npossessed of these and numberless other accomplishments. The Rishi,\r\nhaving wandered over the different worlds, came into that Sabha. And the\r\ncelestial Rishi  of immeasurable splendour, endued with great energy was\r\naccompanied, O monarch, by Parijata and the intelligent Raivata and\r\nSaumya and Sumukha. Possessing the speed of the mind, the Rishi came\r\nthither and was filled with gladness upon beholding the Pandavas. The\r\nBrahmana, on arriving there, paid homage unto Yudhishthira by uttering\r\nblessings on him and wishing him victory. Beholding the learned Rishi\r\narrive, the eldest of the Pandavas, conversant with all rules of duty,\r\nquickly stood up with his younger brothers. Bending low with humility,\r\nthe monarch cheerfully saluted the Rishi, and gave with due ceremonies a\r\nbefitting seat unto him. The king also gave him kine and the usual\r\nofferings of the Arghya including honey and the other ingredients.\r\nConversant with every duty the monarch also worshipped the Rishi with\r\ngems and jewels with a whole heart. Receiving that worship from\r\nYudhishthira in proper form, the Rishi became gratified. Thus worshipped\r\nby the Pandavas and the great Rishis, Narada possessing a complete\r\nmastery over the Vedas, said unto Yudhishthira the following words\r\nbearing upon religion, wealth, pleasures and salvation.\r\n\r\n\"Narada said--'Is the wealth thou art earning being spent on proper\r\nobjects? Doth thy mind take pleasure in virtue? Art thou enjoying the\r\npleasures of life? Doth not thy mind sink under their weight? O chief of\r\nmen, continuest thou in the noble conduct consistent with religion and\r\nwealth practised by thy ancestors towards the three classes of subjects,\r\n(viz., good, indifferent, and bad)? Never injurest thou religion for the\r\nsake of wealth, or both religion and wealth for the sake of pleasure that\r\neasily seduces? O thou foremost of victorious men ever devoted to the\r\ngood of all, conversant as thou art with the timeliness of everything,\r\nfollowest thou religion, wealth, pleasure and salvation dividing thy time\r\njudiciously? O sinless one, with the six attributes of kings (viz.,\r\ncleverness of speech, readiness in providing means, intelligence in\r\ndealing with the foe, memory, and acquaintance with morals and politics),\r\ndost thou attend to the seven means (viz., sowing dissensions,\r\nchastisement, conciliation, gifts, incantations, medicine and magic)?\r\nExaminest thou also, after a survey of thy own strength and weakness, the\r\nfourteen possessions of thy foes? These are the country, forts, cars,\r\nelephants, cavalry, foot-soldiers, the principal officials of state, the\r\nzenana, food supply, computations of the army and income, the religious\r\ntreatises in force, the accounts of state, the revenue, wine-shops and\r\nother secret enemies. Attendest thou to the eight occupations (of\r\nagriculture, trade, &c), having examined, O thou foremost of victorious\r\nmonarchs, thy own and thy enemy's means, and having made peace with thy\r\nenemies? O bull of the Bharata race, thy seven principal officers of\r\nstate (viz., the governor of the citadel, the commander of forces, the\r\nchief judge, the general in interior command, the chief priest, the chief\r\nphysician, and the chief astrologer), have not, I hope, succumbed to the\r\ninfluence of thy foes, nor have they, I hope, become idle in consequence\r\nof the wealth they have earned? They are, I hope, all obedient to thee.\r\nThy counsels, I hope, are never divulged by thy trusted spies in\r\ndisguise, by thyself or by thy ministers? Thou ascertainest, I hope, what\r\nthy friends, foes and strangers are about? Makest thou peace and makest\r\nthou war at proper times? Observest thou neutrality towards strangers and\r\npersons that are neutral towards thee? And, O hero, hast thou made\r\npersons like thyself, persons that are old, continent in behaviour,\r\ncapable of understanding what should be done and what should not, pure as\r\nregards birth and blood, and devoted to thee, thy ministers? O Bharata,\r\nthe victories of kings can be attributed to good counsels. O child, is\r\nthy kingdom protected by ministers learned in Sastras, keeping their\r\ncounsels close? Are thy foes unable to injure it? Thou hast not become\r\nthe slave of sleep? Wakest thou at the proper time? Conversant with\r\npursuits yielding profit, thinkest thou, during the small hours of night,\r\nas to what thou shouldst do and what thou shouldst not do the next day?\r\nThou settlest nothing alone, nor takest counsels with many? The counsels\r\nthou hast resolved upon, do not become known all over thy kingdom?\r\nCommencest thou soon to accomplish measures of great utility that are\r\neasy of accomplishment? Such measures are never obstructed? Keepest thou\r\nthe agriculturists not out of thy sight? They do not fear to approach\r\nthee? Achievest thou thy measures through persons that are trusted\r\nincorruptible, and possessed of practical experience? And, O brave king.\r\nI hope, people only know the measures already accomplished by thee and\r\nthose that have been partially accomplished and are awaiting completion,\r\nbut not those that are only in contemplation and uncommenced? Have\r\nexperienced teachers capable of explaining the causes of things and\r\nlearned in the science of morals and every branch of learning, been\r\nappointed to instruct the princes and the chiefs of the army? Buyest thou\r\na single learned man by giving in exchange a thousand ignorant\r\nindividuals? The man that is learned conferreth the greatest benefit in\r\nseasons of distress. Are thy forts always filled with treasure, food,\r\nweapons, water, engines and instruments, as also with engineers and\r\nbowmen? Even a single minister that is intelligent, brave, with his\r\npassions under complete control, and possessed of wisdom and judgment, is\r\ncapable of conferring the highest prosperity on a king or a king's son. I\r\nask thee, therefore, whether there is even one such minister with thee?\r\nSeekest thou to know everything about the eighteen Tirthas of the foe and\r\nfifteen of thy own by means of three and three spies all unacquainted\r\nwith one another? O slayer of all foes, watchest thou all thy enemies\r\nwith care and attention, and unknown to them? Is the priest thou\r\nhonourest, possessed of humility, and purity of blood, and renown, and\r\nwithout jealousy and illiberality? Hath any well-behaved, intelligent,\r\nand guileless Brahmana, well-up in the ordinance, been employed by thee\r\nin the performance of thy daily rites before the sacred fire, and doth he\r\nremind thee in proper time as to when thy homa should be performed? Is\r\nthe astrologer thou hast employed skilled in reading physiognomy, capable\r\nof interpreting omens, and competent to neutralise the effect of the\r\ndisturbances of nature? Have respectable servants been employed by thee\r\nin offices that are respectable, indifferent ones in indifferent offices,\r\nand low ones in offices that are low? Hast thou appointed to high offices\r\nministers that are guileless and of well conduct for generations and\r\nabove the common run? Oppressest thou not thy people with cruel and\r\nsevere punishment? And, O bull of the Bharata race, do thy ministers rule\r\nthy kingdom under thy orders? Do thy ministers ever slight thee like\r\nsacrificial priests slighting men that are fallen (and incapable of\r\nperforming any more sacrifices) or like wives slighting husbands that are\r\nproud and incontinent in their behaviour? Is the commander of thy forces\r\npossessed of sufficient confidence, brave, intelligent, patient,\r\nwell-conducted, of good birth, devoted to thee, and competent? Treatest\r\nthou with consideration and regard the chief officers of thy army that\r\nare skilled in every kind of welfare, are forward, well-behaved, and\r\nendued with prowess? Givest thou to thy troops their sanctioned rations\r\nand pay in the appointed time? Thou dost not oppress them by withholding\r\nthese? Knowest thou that the misery caused by arrears of pay and\r\nirregularity in the distribution of rations driveth the troops to mutiny,\r\nand that is called by the learned to be one of the greatest of mischiefs?\r\nAre all the principal high-born men devoted to thee, and ready with\r\ncheerfulness to lay down their lives in battle for thy sake? I hope no\r\nsingle individual of passions uncontrolled is ever permitted by thee to\r\nrule as he likes a number of concerns at the same time appertaining to\r\nthe army? Is any servant of thine, who hath accomplished well a\r\nparticular business by the employment of special ability, disappointed in\r\nobtaining from thee a little more regard, and an increase of food and\r\npay? I hope thou rewardest persons of learning and humility, and skill in\r\nevery kind of knowledge with gifts of wealth and honour proportionate to\r\ntheir qualifications. Dost thou support, O bull in the Bharata race, the\r\nwives and children of men that have given their lives for thee and have\r\nbeen distressed on thy account? Cherishest thou, O son of Pritha, with\r\npaternal affection the foe that hath been weakened, or him also that hath\r\nsought thy shelter, having been vanquished in battle? O lord of Earth,\r\nart thou equal unto all men, and can every one approach thee without\r\nfear, as if thou wert their mother and father? And O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, marchest thou, without loss of time, and reflecting well upon three\r\nkinds of forces, against thy foe when thou hearest that he is in\r\ndistress? O subjugator of all foes beginnest thou thy march when the time\r\ncometh, having taken into consideration all the omens you might see, the\r\nresolutions thou hast made, and that the ultimate victory depends upon\r\nthe twelve mandalas (such as reserves, ambuscades, &c, and payment of pay\r\nto the troops in advance)? And, O persecutor of all foes, givest thou\r\ngems and jewels, unto the principal officers of enemy, as they deserve,\r\nwithout thy enemy's knowledge? O son of Pritha, seekest thou to conquer\r\nthy incensed foes that are slaves to their passions, having first\r\nconquered thy own soul and obtained the mastery over thy own senses?\r\nBefore thou marchest out against thy foes, dost thou properly employ the\r\nfour arts of reconciliation, gift (of wealth) producing disunion, and\r\napplication of force? O monarch, goest thou out against thy enemies,\r\nhaving first strengthened thy own kingdom? And having gone out against\r\nthem, exertest thou to the utmost to obtain victory over them? And having\r\nconquered them, seekest thou to protect them with care? Are thy army\r\nconsisting of four kinds of forces, viz., the regular troops, the allies,\r\nthe mercenaries, and the irregulars, each furnished with the eight\r\ningredients, viz., cars, elephants, horses, offices, infantry,\r\ncamp-followers, spies possessing a thorough knowledge of the country, and\r\nensigns led out against thy enemies after having been well trained by\r\nsuperior officers? O oppressor of all foes, O great king, I hope thou\r\nslayest thy foes without regarding their seasons of reaping and of\r\nfamine? O king, I hope thy servants and agents in thy own kingdom and in\r\nthe kingdoms of thy foes continue to look after their respective duties\r\nand to protect one another. O monarch, I hope trusted servants have been\r\nemployed by thee to look after thy food, the robes thou wearest and the\r\nperfumes thou usest. I hope, O king, thy treasury, barns, stables\r\narsenals, and women's apartments, are all protected by servants devoted\r\nto thee and ever seeking thy welfare. I hope, O monarch, thou protectest\r\nfirst thyself from thy domestic and public servants, then from those\r\nservants of thy relatives and from one another. Do thy servants, O king,\r\never speak to thee in the forenoon regarding thy extravagant expenditure\r\nin respect of thy drinks, sports, and women? Is thy expenditure always\r\ncovered by a fourth, a third or a half of thy income? Cherishest thou\r\nalways, with food and wealth, relatives, superiors, merchants, the aged,\r\nand other proteges, and the distressed? Do the accountants and clerks\r\nemployed by thee in looking after thy income and expenditure, always\r\nappraise thee every day in the forenoon of thy income and expenditure?\r\nDismissest thou without fault servants accomplished in business and\r\npopular and devoted to thy welfare? O Bharata, dost thou employ superior,\r\nindifferent, and low men, after examining them well in offices they\r\ndeserve? O monarch, employest thou in thy business persons that are\r\nthievish or open to temptation, or hostile, or minors? Persecutest thou\r\nthy kingdom by the help of thievish or covetous men, or minors, or women?\r\nAre the agriculturists in thy kingdom contented. Are large tanks and\r\nlakes constructed all over thy kingdom at proper distances, without\r\nagriculture being in thy realm entirely dependent on the showers of\r\nheaven? Are the agriculturists in thy kingdom wanting in either seed or\r\nfood? Grantest thou with kindness loans (of seed-grains) unto the\r\ntillers, taking only a fourth in excess of every measure by the hundred?\r\nO child, are the four professions of agriculture, trade, cattle-rearing,\r\nand lending at interest, carried on by honest men? Upon these O monarch,\r\ndepends the happiness of thy people. O king, do the five brave and wise\r\nmen, employed in the five offices of protecting the city, the citadel,\r\nthe merchants, and the agriculturists, and punishing the criminals,\r\nalways benefit thy kingdom by working in union with one another? For the\r\nprotection of thy city, have the villages been made like towns, and the\r\nhamlets and outskirts of villages like villages? Are all these entirely\r\nunder thy supervision and sway? Are thieves and robbers that sack thy\r\ntown pursued by thy police over the even and uneven parts of thy kingdom?\r\nConsolest thou women and are they protected in thy realm? I hope thou\r\nplacest not any confidence in them, nor divulgest any secret before any\r\nof them? O monarch, having heard of any danger and having reflected on it\r\nalso, liest thou in the inner apartments enjoying every agreeable object?\r\nHaving slept during the second and the third divisions of the night,\r\nthinkest thou of religion and profit in the fourth division wakefully. O\r\nson of Pandu, rising from bed at the proper time and dressing thyself\r\nwell, showest thou thyself to thy people, accompanied by ministers\r\nconversant with the auspiciousness or otherwise of moments? O represser\r\nof all foes, do men dressed in red and armed with swords and adorned with\r\nornaments stand by thy side to protect thy person? O monarch! behavest\r\nthou like the god of justice himself unto those that deserve punishment\r\nand those that deserve worship, unto those that are dear to thee and\r\nthose that thou likest not? O son of Pritha, seekest thou to cure bodily\r\ndiseases by medicines and fasts, and mental illness with the advice of\r\nthe aged? I hope that the physicians engaged in looking after thy health\r\nare well conversant with the eight kinds of treatment and are all\r\nattached and devoted to thee. Happeneth it ever, O monarch, that from\r\ncovetousness or folly or pride thou failest to decide between the\r\nplaintiff and the defendant who have come to thee? Deprivest thou,\r\nthrough covetousness or folly, of their pensions the proteges who have\r\nsought thy shelter from trustfulness or love? Do the people that inhabit\r\nthy realm, bought by thy foes, ever seek to raise disputes with thee,\r\nuniting themselves with one another? Are those amongst thy foes that are\r\nfeeble always repressed by the help of troops that are strong, by the\r\nhelp of both counsels and troops? Are all the principal chieftains (of\r\nthy empire) all devoted to thee? Are they ready to lay down their lives\r\nfor thy sake, commanded by thee? Dost thou worship Brahmanas and wise men\r\naccording to their merits in respect of various branches of learning? I\r\ntell thee, such worship is without doubt, highly beneficial to thee. Hast\r\nthou faith in the religion based on the three Vedas and practised by men\r\nwho have gone before thee? Dost thou carefully follow the practices that\r\nwere followed by them? Are accomplished Brahmanas entertained in thy\r\nhouse and in thy presence with nutritive and excellent food, and do they\r\nalso obtain pecuniary gifts at the conclusion of those feasts? Dost thou,\r\nwith passions under complete control and with singleness of mind, strive\r\nto perform the sacrifices called Vajapeya and Pundarika with their full\r\ncomplement of rites? Bowest thou unto thy relatives and superiors, the\r\naged, the gods, the ascetics, the Brahmanas, and the tall trees (banian)\r\nin villages, that are of so much benefit to people? O sinless one,\r\ncausest thou ever grief or anger in any one? Do priests capable of\r\ngranting thee auspicious fruits ever stand by thy side? O sinless one,\r\nare thy inclinations and practices such as I have described them, and as\r\nalways enhance the duration of life and spread one's renown and as always\r\nhelp the cause of religion, pleasure, and profit? He who conducteth\r\nhimself according to this way, never findeth his kingdom distressed or\r\nafflicted; and that monarch, subjugating the whole earth, enjoyeth a high\r\ndegree of felicity. O monarch, I hope, no well-behaved, pure-souled, and\r\nrespected person is ever ruined and his life taken, on a false charge or\r\ntheft, by thy ministers ignorant of Sastras and acting from greed? And, O\r\nbull among men, I hope thy ministers never from covetousness set free a\r\nreal thief, knowing him to be such and having apprehended him with the\r\nbooty about him? O Bharata, I hope, thy ministers are never won over by\r\nbribes, nor do they wrongly decide the disputes that arise between the\r\nrich and the poor. Dost thou keep thyself free from the fourteen vices of\r\nkings, viz., atheism, untruthfulness, anger, incautiousness,\r\nprocrastination, non-visit to the wise, idleness, restlessness of mind,\r\ntaking counsels with only one man, consultation with persons unacquainted\r\nwith the science of profit, abandonment of a settled plan, divulgence of\r\ncounsels, non-accomplishment of beneficial projects, and undertaking\r\neverything without reflection? By these, O king, even monarchs firmly\r\nseated on their thrones are ruined. Hath thy study of the Vedas, thy\r\nwealth and knowledge of the Sastras and marriage been fruitful?\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--After the Rishi had finished, Yudhishthira\r\nasked,--\"How, O Rishi, do the Vedas, wealth, wife, and knowledge of the\r\nSastras bear fruit?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Rishi answered,--\"The Vedas are said to bear fruit when he that hath\r\nstudied them performeth the Agnihotra and other sacrifices. Wealth is\r\nsaid to bear fruit when he that hath it enjoyeth it himself and giveth it\r\naway in charity. A wife is said to bear fruit when she is useful and when\r\nshe beareth children. Knowledge of the Sastras is said to bear fruit when\r\nit resulteth in humility and good behaviour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--The great ascetic Narada, having answered\r\nYudhishthira thus, again asked that just ruler,-\"Do the officers of thy\r\ngovernment, O king, that are paid from the taxes levied on the community,\r\ntake only their just dues from the merchants that come to thy territories\r\nfrom distant lands impelled by the desire of gain? Are the merchants, O\r\nking, treated with consideration in thy capital and kingdom, capable of\r\nbringing their goods thither without being deceived by the false pretexts\r\nof (both the buyers and the officers of government)?\r\n\r\nListenest thou always, O monarch, to the words, fraught with instructions\r\nin religion and wealth, of old men acquainted with economic doctrines?\r\nAre gifts of honey and clarified butter made to the Brahmanas intended\r\nfor the increase of agricultural produce, of kine, of fruits and flowers,\r\nand for the sake of virtue? Givest thou always, O king, regularly unto\r\nall the artisans and artists employed by thee the materials of their\r\nworks and their wages for periods not more than four months? Examinest\r\nthou the works executed by those that are employed by thee, and\r\napplaudest thou them before good men, and rewardest thou them, having\r\nshewn them proper respect? O bull of the Bharata race, followest thou the\r\naphorisms (of the sage) in respect of every concern particularly those\r\nrelating to elephants, horses, and cars? O bull of the Bharata race, are\r\nthe aphorisms relating to the science of arms, as also those that relate\r\nto the practice of engines in warfare--so useful to towns and fortified\r\nplaces, studied in thy court? O sinless one, art thou acquainted with all\r\nmysterious incantations, and with the secrets of poisons destructive of\r\nall foes? Protectest thou thy kingdom from the fear of fire, of snakes\r\nand other animals destructive of life, of disease, and Rakshasas? As\r\nacquainted thou art with every duty, cherishest thou like a father, the\r\nblind, the dumb, the lame, the deformed, the friendless, and ascetics\r\nthat have no homes. Hast thou banished these six evils, O monarch, viz.,\r\nsleep, idleness, fear, anger, weakness of mind, and procrastination?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--The illustrious bull among the Kurus, having\r\nheard these words of that best of Brahmanas, bowed down unto him and\r\nworshipped his feet. And gratified with everything he heard, the monarch\r\nsaid unto Narada of celestial form,--\"I shall do all that thou hast\r\ndirected, for my knowledge hath expanded under thy advice!' Having said\r\nthis the king acted conformably to that advice, and gained in time the\r\nwhole Earth bounded by her belt of seas. Narada again spoke,\r\nsaying,--\"That king who is thus employed in the protection of four\r\norders, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras, passeth his days\r\nhere happily and attaineth hereafter to the region of Sakra (heaven).'\""

O master, we desire to walk in the\r\nvirtuous path of those rulers that had, besides, their souls under\r\ncomplete control.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--\"Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, possessed of\r\ngreat glory, having received with reverence the words of Narada and\r\nhaving also answered the Rishi thus, reflected for a moment. And\r\nperceiving a proper opportunity, the monarch, seated beside the Rishi,\r\nasked Narada sitting at his ease and capable of going into every world at\r\nwill, in the presence of that assembly of kings, saying,--'Possessed of\r\nthe speed of mind, thou wanderest over various and many worlds created in\r\ndays of yore by Brahma, beholding everything. Tell me, I ask thee, if\r\nthou hast, O Brahmana, ever beheld before anywhere an assembly room like\r\nthis of mine or superior to it!' Hearing these words of Yudhishthira the\r\njust, Narada smilingly answered the son of Pandu in these sweet accents,--\r\n\r\n\"Narada said,--'O child, O king I did neither see nor hear of ever before\r\namongst men, any assembly room built of gems and precious stones like\r\nthis of thine, O Bharata. I shall, however, describe unto thee the rooms\r\nof the king of the departed (Yama), of Varuna (Neptune) of great\r\nintelligence, of Indra, the King of Gods and also of him who hath his\r\nhome in Kailasha (Kuvera). I shall also describe unto thee the celestial\r\nSabha of Brahma that dispelleth every kind of uneasiness. All these\r\nassembly rooms exhibit in their structure both celestial and human\r\ndesigns and present every kind of form that exists in the universe. And\r\nthey are ever worshipped by the gods and the Pitris, the Sadhyas,\r\n(under-deities called Gana), by ascetics offering sacrifices, with souls\r\nunder complete command, by peaceful Munis engaged without intermission in\r\nVedic sacrifices with presents to Brahmanas. I shall describe all these\r\nto you if, O bull of the Bharata race, thou hast any inclinations to\r\nlisten to me!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus addressed by Narada, the high-souled king\r\nYudhishthira the just, with his brothers and all those foremost of\r\nBrahmanas (seated around him), joined his hands (in entreaty). And the\r\nmonarch then asked Narada, saying,--'Describe unto us all those assembly\r\nrooms. We desire to listen to thee. O Brahmana, what are the articles\r\nwith which each of the Sabhas are made of? What is the area of each, and\r\nwhat is the length and breadth of each? Who wait upon the Grandsire in\r\nthat assembly room? And who also upon Vasava, the Lord of the celestials\r\nand upon Yama, the son of Vivaswana? Who wait upon Varuna and upon Kuvera\r\nin their respective assembly rooms. O Brahmana Rishi, tell us all about\r\nthese. We all together desire to hear thee describe them.

Dispelling weakness of age, grief,\r\nfatigue, and fear, auspicious and bestowing good fortune, furnished with\r\nrooms and seats and adorned with celestial trees, it is delightful in the\r\nextreme. There sitteth in that assembly room, O son of Pritha, on an\r\nexcellent seat, the Lord of celestials, with his wife Sachi endowed with\r\nbeauty and affluence. Assuming a form incapable of description for its\r\nvagueness, with a crown on his head and bright bracelets on the upper\r\narms, attired in robes of pure white and decked with floral wreaths of\r\nmany hues, there he sitteth with beauty, fame, and glory by his side. And\r\nthe illustrious deity of a hundred sacrifices is daily waited upon. O\r\nmonarch, in that assembly by the Marutas in a body, each leading the life\r\nof a householder in the bosom of his family.

And, O Bharata, resplendent with his own\r\neffulgence, it stands glorified in all its beauty.

It was built, O king, by Vaisravana himself using his ascetic\r\npower. Possessing the splendour of the peaks of Kailasa, that mansion\r\neclipses by its own the brilliance of the Moon himself. Supported by\r\nGuhyakas, that mansion seems to be attached to the firmament. Of\r\ncelestial make, it is rendered extremely handsome with high chambers of\r\ngold. Extremely delightful and rendered fragrant with celestial perfumes,\r\nit is variegated with numberless costly jewels. Resembling the peaks of a\r\nmass of white clouds, it seems to be floating in the air. Painted with\r\ncolours of celestial gold, it seems to be decked with streaks of\r\nlightning. Within that mansion sitteth on an excellent seat bright as the\r\nsun and covered with celestial carpets and furnished with a handsome\r\nfootstool, king Vaisravana of agreeable person, attired in excellent\r\nrobes and adorned with costly ornaments and ear-rings of great\r\nbrilliance, surrounded by his thousand wives. Delicious and cooling\r\nbreezes murmuring through forests of tall Mandaras, and bearing fragrance\r\nof extensive plantations of jasmine, as also of the lotuses on the bosom\r\nof the river Alaka and of the Nandana-gardens, always minister to the\r\npleasure of the King of the Yakshas. There the deities with the\r\nGandharvas surrounded by various tribes of Apsaras, sing in chorus, O\r\nking, notes of celestial sweetness. Misrakesi and Rambha, and Chitrasena,\r\nand Suchismita; and Charunetra, and Gritachi and Menaka, and\r\nPunjikasthala; and Viswachi Sahajanya, and Pramlocha and Urvasi and Ira,\r\nand Varga and Sauraveyi, and Samichi, and Vududa, and Lata--these and a\r\nthousand other Apsaras and Gandharvas, all well-skilled in music and\r\ndance, attend upon Kuvera, the lord of treasures.

The goddess Lakshmi always stayeth\r\nthere, also Kuvera's son Nalakuvera. Myself and many others like myself\r\noften repair thither. Many Brahmana Rishis and celestial Rishis also\r\nrepair there often. Many Rakshasas, and many Gandharvas, besides those\r\nthat have been named, wait upon the worship, in that mansion, the\r\nillustrious lord of all treasures.

      "content": "\"Narada said,--Listen to me, O child, as I tell thee of the assembly\r\nhouse of the Grandsire, that house which none can describe, saying it is\r\nsuch. In the Krita (golden) age of old, O king, the exalted deity Aditya\r\n(once) came down from heaven into the world of men. Having seen before\r\nthe assembly-house of Brahma the Self-created, Aditya was cheerfully\r\nwandering over the Earth in human form, desirous of beholding what could\r\nbe seen here. It was on that occasion, O son of Pandu, that the god of\r\nday spoke unto me, O bull of the Bharata race, of that celestial Sabha\r\n(assembly) of the Grandsire, immeasurable and immaterial and\r\nindescribable, as regards form and shape, and capable of delighting the\r\nheart of every creature by its splendour. Hearing, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, of the merits of that Sabha, I became, O king, desirous of\r\nbeholding it. I then asked Aditya, saying,--O exalted one, I desire to\r\nbehold the sacred Sabha of the Grandsire. O lord of light, tell me, O\r\nexalted one, by what ascetic penances, or by what acts, or by what charms\r\nor by what rites, I may be enabled to behold that excellent sin-cleaning\r\nSabha.\"--Hearing these words of mine, Aditya the god of day, the deity of\r\na thousand rays, answered me, O chief of the Bharata race, thus: Observe\r\nthou, with mind rapt in meditation, the Brahma vow extending for a\r\nthousand years. Repairing then to the breast of the Himavat, I commenced\r\nthat great vow, and after I had completed it the exalted and sinless\r\ndeity Surya endued with great energy, and knowing no fatigue, took me\r\nwith him to the Sabha of the Grandsire. O king, it is impossible to\r\ndescribe that Sabha, saying--it is such, for within a moment it assumes a\r\ndifferent form that language fails to paint. O Bharata, it is impossible\r\nto indicate its dimensions or shape. I never saw anything like it before.\r\nEver contributing to the happiness of those within it, its atmosphere is\r\nneither cold nor warm. Hunger and thirst or any kind of uneasiness\r\ndisappear as soon as one goeth thither. It seems to be made up of\r\nbrilliant gems of many kinds. It doth not seem to be supported on\r\ncolumns, it knoweth no deterioration, being eternal. That self effulgent\r\nmansion, by its numerous blazing, celestial indications of unrivalled\r\nsplendour, seems to surpass the moon, the sun and the fire in splendour.\r\nStationed in heaven, it blazes forth, censuring as it were the maker of\r\nthe day. In that mansion O king, the Supreme Deity, the Grand-sire of all\r\ncreated things, having himself created everything by virtue of his\r\ncreative illusion, stayeth ever. And Daksha, Prachetas, Pulaha, Marichi,\r\nthe master Kasyapa, Bhrigu, Atri, and Vasistha and Gautama, and also\r\nAngiras, and Pulastya, Kraut, Prahlada, and Kardama, these Prajapatis,\r\nand Angirasa of the Atharvan Veda, the Valikhilyas, the Marichipas;\r\nIntelligence, Space, Knowledge, Air, Heat, Water, Earth, Sound, Touch,\r\nForm, Taste, Scent; Nature, and the Modes (of Nature), and the elemental\r\nand prime causes of the world,--all stay in that mansion beside the lord\r\nBrahma. And Agastya of great energy, and Markandeya, of great ascetic\r\npower, and Jamadagni and Bharadwaja, and Samvarta, and Chyavana, and\r\nexalted Durvasa, and the virtuous Rishyasringa, the illustrious\r\nSanatkumara of great ascetic merit and the preceptor in all matters\r\naffecting Yoga; Asita and Devala, and Jaigishavya acquainted with truth;\r\nRishava, Ajitasatru, and Mani of great energy; and the Science of healing\r\nwith its eight branches--all in their personified forms, O Bharata; the\r\nmoon with all the stars and the stellar conjunctions; Aditya with all his\r\nrays; the winds; the Sacrifices, the Declarations of purpose (in\r\nsacrifices), the Vital principles,--these illustrious and vow-observing\r\nbeings in their personified forms, and many others too numerous to\r\nmention, attend all upon Brahma in that mansion. Wealth and Religion and\r\nDesire, and Joy, and Aversion, and Asceticism and Tranquillity--all wait\r\ntogether upon the Supreme Deity in that palace. The twenty tribes of the\r\nGandharvas and Apsaras, as also their seven other tribes, and all the\r\nLokapalas (chief protectors of several regions), and Sukra, and\r\nVrihaspati, and Vudha, and Angaraka (Mangala), Sani, Rahu, and the other\r\nplanets; the Mantras (of the Sama Veda), the special Mantras (of the same\r\nVeda); (the rites of) Harimat and Vasumat, the Adityas with Indra, the\r\ntwo Agnis mentioned by name (viz. Agnisoma and Indragni), the Marutas,\r\nViswakarman, and the Vasus, O Bharata; the Pitris, and all kinds of\r\nsacrificial libations, the four Vedas. viz., Rig, Sama, Yajuh, and\r\nAtharva; all Sciences and branches of learning; Histories and all minor\r\nbranches of learning; the several branches of the Vedas; the planets, the\r\nSacrifices, the Soma, all the deities; Savitri (Gayatri), the seven kinds\r\nof rhyme; Understanding, Patience, Memory, Wisdom, Intelligence, Fame,\r\nForgiveness; the Hymns of the Sama Veda; the Science of hymns in general,\r\nand various kinds of Verses and Songs; various Commentaries with\r\narguments;--all in their personified forms, O king, and various Dramas\r\nand Poems and Stories and abridged Glosses--these also, and many others\r\nwait upon the Supreme Deity in that Sabha, Kshanas, Lavas, Muhurtas, Day,\r\nNight, Fortnights, Months, the six Seasons, O Bharata, Years, Yugas, the\r\nfour kinds of Days and Nights (viz., appearing to man, to the Pitris, to\r\nthe gods, and to Brahma) and that eternal, indestructible,\r\nundeteriorating, excellent Wheel of Time and also the Wheel of\r\nVirtue,--these always wait there. O Yudhishthira; and Aditi, Diti, Danu,\r\nSurasa, Vinata, Ira, Kalika, Suravi, Devi, Sarama, Gautami and the\r\ngoddesses Pradha, and Kadru;--these mothers of the celestials, and\r\nRudrani, Sree, Lakshmi, Bhadra, Shashthi, the Earth, Ganga, Hri, Swaha,\r\nKriti, the goddess Sura, Sachi Pushti, Arundhati, Samvritti, Asa, Niyati,\r\nSrishti, Rati,--these and many other goddesses wait upon the Creator of\r\nall. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Marutas, Aswinas, the Viswadevas\r\nSadhyas, and the Pitris gifted with the speed of the mind; these all wait\r\nthere upon the Grandsire. And, O bull amongst men, know thou that there\r\nare seven classes of Pitris, of which four classes have embodied forms\r\nand the remaining three without embodied forms. It is well known that the\r\nillustrious Vairajas and Agniswattas and Garhapattyas (three classes of\r\nPitris) range in heaven. And those amongst the Pitris that are called the\r\nSomapas, the Ekasringras, the Chaturvedas, and the Kalas, are ever\r\nworshipped amongst the four orders of men. Gratified with the Soma\r\n(juice), first, these gratify Soma afterwards. All these tribes of Pitris\r\nwait upon the Lord of the creation and cheerfully worship the Supreme\r\nDeity of immeasurable energy. And Rakshasas, Pisachas, the Danavas and\r\nGuhyakas; Nagas, Birds, and various animals; and all mobile and immobile\r\ngreat beings;--all worship the Grandsire. And Purandara the chief of the\r\ncelestials, and Varuna and Kuvera and Yama, and Mahadeva accompanied by\r\nUma, always repair thither. And, O king of kings, Mahasena (Kartikeya)\r\nalso adoreth there the Grandsire. Narayana himself, and the celestial\r\nRishis, and those Rishis called Valakhillyas, and all beings born of\r\nfemales and all those not born of females, and whatever else is seen in\r\nthe three worlds--both mobile and immobile, were all seen by me there,\r\nknow O king. And eighty thousand Rishis with vital seed drawn up, and O\r\nPandu, fifty thousand Rishis having sons, were all seen by me there. And\r\nall the dwellers in heaven repairing thither behold the Supreme Deity\r\nwhen they please, and worshipping him with a bow of their head return\r\nwhence they came. And, O king of men, the Grandsire of all created\r\nbeings, the Soul of the universe, the Self create Brahma of immeasurable\r\nintelligence and glory, equally kind unto all creatures, honoureth as\r\nthey deserve, and gratifieth with sweet speech and gift of wealth and\r\nother enjoyable articles, the gods, the Daityas, the Nagas, the\r\nBrahmanas, the Yakshas, the Birds, the Kaleyas, the Gandharvas, the\r\nApsaras, and all other exalted beings that came to him as his guests. And\r\nthat delicious Sabha, O child, is always crowded with persons coming and\r\ngoing. Filled with every kind of energy, and worshipped by Brahmarshis,\r\nthat celestial Sabha blazes forth with the graceful possessions of Brahma\r\nand looks extremely handsome, O tiger among kings as this Sabha of yours\r\nis unrivalled in the world of men, so is that Sabha of Brahma, seen by me\r\nunrivalled in all the worlds. I have seen these Sabhas, O Bharata, in\r\nregions of the celestials. This thy Sabha is unquestionably the foremost\r\nin the world of men!\""

Thou hast said that in the Sabha of the Grandsire are to be\r\nseen all the great Rishis, all the gods, all the branches of learning. As\r\nregards the Sabha of Sakra, however, thou hast named, O Muni, all the\r\ngods, the Gandharvas, and various Rishis. But, O great Muni, thou hast\r\nmentioned one and only one king, viz., the royal Rishi Harishchandra as\r\nliving in the Sabha of the illustrious chief of the gods. What act was\r\nperformed by that celebrated king, or what ascetic penances with steady\r\nvows, in consequence of which he hath been equal to Indra himself? O\r\nBrahmana, how didst thou also meet with my father, the exalted Pandu, now\r\na guest in the region of the Pitris? O exalted one of excellent vows hath\r\nhe told thee anything? O tell me all as I am exceedingly curious to hear\r\nall this from thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Narada said,--'O king of kings, I shall tell thee all that thou askest\r\nme about Harischandra, I shall presently tell thee of his high\r\nexcellence. He was a powerful king, in fact, an emperor over all the\r\nkings of the earth. Indeed, all the kings of the earth obeyed his sway. O\r\nmonarch, mounted alone upon a victorious car adorned with gold, that king\r\nby the prowess of his weapons brought the whole earth with her seven\r\nislands under his sway. And, O monarch, having subjugated the whole earth\r\nwith her mountains, forests, and woods, he made preparations for the\r\ngreat sacrifice called the Rajasuya. And all the kings of the earth\r\nbrought at his command wealth unto that sacrifice. All of them consented\r\nto become distributors of food and gifts unto the Brahmanas that were fed\r\non the occasion. At that sacrifice king Harishchandra gave away unto all\r\nwho asked, wealth that was five times what each had solicited. At the\r\nconclusion of the sacrifice, the king gratified the Brahmanas that came\r\nfrom various countries with large presents of various kinds of wealth.\r\nThe Brahmanas gratified with various kinds of food and enjoyable\r\narticles, given away unto them to the extent of their desires, and with\r\nthe heaps of jewels distributed amongst them, began to say,--King\r\nHarischandra is superior to all kings in energy and renown.--And know, O\r\nmonarch, O bull of the Bharata race, it was for this reason that\r\nHarischandra shone more brightly than thousands of other kings. The\r\npowerful Harischandra having concluded his great sacrifice, became\r\ninstalled, O king, in the sovereignty of the earth and looked resplendent\r\non his throne. O bull of the Bharata race, all those monarchs that\r\nperform the sacrifice of Rajasuya, (attaining to the region of Indra)\r\npass their time in felicity in Indra's company. And, O bull of the\r\nBharata race, those kings also that yield up their lives without turning\r\ntheir backs on the field of battle attain to the mansion of Indra and\r\nlive in joy with him. Those again that yield up their bodies after severe\r\nascetic penances also attain to the same region and shine brightly there\r\nfor ages. O king of the Kuru race, O son of Kunti, thy father Pandu,\r\nbeholding the good fortune of Harischandra and wondering much thereat,\r\nhath told thee something. Knowing that I was coming to the world of men,\r\nhe bowed unto me and said,--Thou shouldst tell Yudhishthira, O Rishi,\r\nthat he can subjugate the whole Earth inasmuch as his brothers are all\r\nobedient to him. And having done this let him commence the grand\r\nsacrifice called Rajasuya. He is my son; if he performeth that sacrifice,\r\nI may, like Harischandra, soon attain to the region of Indra, and there\r\nin his Sabha pass countless years in continuous joy. I told him in\r\nreply,--O King, I shall tell thy son all this, if I go to the world of\r\nman. I have now told thee what he said, O tiger among men. Accomplish\r\nthen, O son of Pandu, the desires of thy father. If thou performest that\r\nsacrifice, thou shall then be able to go, along with thy deceased\r\nancestors, into the same region that is inhabited by the chief of the\r\nimmortals. It hath been said,--O king, that the performance of this great\r\nsacrifice is attended with many obstacles. A class of Rakshasas called\r\nBrahma Rakshasas, employed in obstructing all sacrifices, always search\r\nfor loop-holes when this great sacrifice is commenced. On the\r\ncommencement of such a sacrifice a war may take place destroying the\r\nKshatriyas and even furnishing occasion for the destruction of the whole\r\nEarth. A slight obstacle may involve the whole Earth in ruin. Reflecting\r\nupon all this, O king of kings do what is for thy good. Be thou watchful\r\nand ready in protecting the four orders of thy subjects. Grow, thou in\r\nprosperity, and enjoy thou felicity. Gratify thou the Brahmanas with\r\ngifts of wealth. I have now answered in detail all that thou hast asked\r\nme. With thy leave I will now go to the city (Dwaravati) of that\r\nDasarhas.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--'O Janamejaya, having said this unto the son of\r\nPritha, Narada went away, accompanied by those Rishis with whom he had\r\ncome. And after Narada had gone away, king Yudhishthira, O thou of the\r\nKuru race, began to think, along with his brothers, of that foremost of\r\nsacrifices called Rajasuya.'"

      "content": "Vaisampayana said,--\"Yudhishthira, having heard these words of Narada,\r\nbegan to sigh heavily. And, O Bharata, engaged in his thoughts about the\r\nRajasuya, the king had no peace of mind. Having heard of this glory of\r\nthe illustrious monarchs (of old) and being certain about the acquisition\r\nof regions of felicity by performers of sacrifices in consequence of\r\ntheir sacred deeds, and thinking especially of that royal sage\r\nHarischandra who had performed the great sacrifice king Yudhishthira\r\ndesired to make preparations for the Rajasuya sacrifice. Then worshipping\r\nhis counsellors and others present at his Sabha, and worshipped by them\r\nin return, he began to discuss with them about that sacrifice. Having\r\nreflected much, that king of kings, that bull amongst the Kurus, inclined\r\nhis mind towards making preparations for the Rajasuya. That prince of\r\nwonderful energy and prowess, however, reflecting upon virtue and\r\nrighteousness, again set his heart to find out what would be for the good\r\nof all his people. For Yudhishthira, that foremost of all virtuous men,\r\nalways kind unto his subjects, worked for the good of all without making\r\nany distinctions. Indeed, shaking off both anger and arrogance,\r\nYudhishthira always said,--Give unto each what is due to each,--and the\r\nonly sounds that he could hear were,--Blessed be Dharma! Blessed be\r\nDharma! Yudhishthira! conducting himself thus and giving paternal\r\nassurance to everybody, there was none in the kingdom who entertained any\r\nhostile feelings towards him. He therefore came to be called Ajatasatru\r\n(one with no enemy at all). The king cherished every one as belonging to\r\nhis family, and Bhima ruled over all justly. Arjuna, used to employing\r\nboth his hands with equal skill, protected the people from (external)\r\nenemies. And the wise Sahadeva administered justice impartially. And\r\nNakula behaved towards all with humility that was natural to him. Owing\r\nto all this, the kingdom became free from disputes and fear of every\r\nkind. And all the people became attentive to their respective\r\noccupations. The rain became so abundant as to leave no room for desiring\r\nmore; and the kingdom grew in prosperity. And in consequence of the\r\nvirtues of the king, money-lenders, the articles required for sacrifices,\r\ncattle-rearing, tillage, and traders, all and everything grew in\r\nprosperity. Indeed, during the reign of Yudhishthira who was ever devoted\r\nto truth, there was no extortion, no stringent realisation of arrears of\r\nrent, no fear of disease, of fire, or of death by poisoning and\r\nincantations, in the kingdom. It was never heard at that time that\r\nthieves or cheats or royal favourites ever behaved wrongfully towards the\r\nking or towards one another amongst themselves. Kings conquered on the\r\nsix occasions (of war, treaty, &c.) were wont to wait upon him in order\r\nto do good unto the monarch and worship him ever, while the traders of\r\ndifferent classes came to pay him the taxes leviable on their respective\r\noccupations. And accordingly during the reign of Yudhishthira who was\r\never devoted to virtue, his dominion grew in prosperity. Indeed, the\r\nprosperity of the kingdom was increased not by these alone but even by\r\npersons wedded to voluptuousness and indulging in all luxuries to their\r\nfill. And the king of kings, Yudhishthira, whose sway extended over all,\r\nwas possessed of every accomplishment and bore everything with patience.\r\nAnd, O king, whatever countries the celebrated and illustrious monarch\r\nconquered, the people everywhere, from Brahmanas to swains, were all more\r\nattached to him than to their own fathers and mothers.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"King Yudhishthira, then, that foremost of speakers,\r\nsummoning together his counsellors and brothers, asked them repeatedly\r\nabout the Rajasuya sacrifice. Those ministers in a body, thus asked by\r\nthe wise Yudhishthira desirous of performing the sacrifice, then told him\r\nthese words of grave import,--'One already in possession of a kingdom\r\ndesireth all the attributes of an emperor by means of that sacrifice\r\nwhich aideth a king in acquiring the attributes of Varuna. O prince of\r\nKuru race, thy friends think that as thou art worthy of the attributes of\r\nan emperor, the time is even come for thee for the performance of the\r\nRajasuya sacrifice. The time for the performance of that sacrifice in\r\nwhich Rishis of austere vows kindle six fires with mantras of the Sama\r\nVeda, is come for thee in consequence of thy Kshatriya possessions. At\r\nthe conclusion of the Rajasuya sacrifice when the performer is installed\r\nin the sovereignty of the empire, he is rewarded with the fruits of all\r\nsacrifices including the Agnihotra. It is for this that he is called the\r\nconqueror of all. Thou art quite able, O strong-armed one, to perform\r\nthis sacrifice. All of us are obedient to thee. Soon will you be able, O\r\ngreat king, to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. Therefore, O great king,\r\nlet thy resolution be taken to perform this sacrifice without further\r\ndiscussion. Thus, spoke unto the king all his friends and counsellors\r\nseparately and jointly. And, O king, Yudhishthira that slayer of all\r\nenemies, having heard these virtuous, bold, agreeable and weighty words\r\nof theirs, accepted them mentally. And having heard those words of his\r\nfriends and counsellors, and knowing his own strength also, the king, O\r\nBharata, repeatedly thought over the matter. After this the intelligent\r\nand virtuous Yudhishthira, wise in counsel, again consulted with his\r\nbrothers, with the illustrious Ritwijas about him, with his ministers and\r\nwith Dhaumya and Dwaipayana and others.\r\n\r\n'Yudhishthira said,--\"How may this wish that I entertain of performing\r\nthe excellent sacrifice of Rajasuya that is worthy of an emperor, bear\r\nfruit, in consequence of my faith and speech alone.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, thus asked by the\r\nking, they replied at that time unto Yudhishthira the just in these\r\nwords,--Being conversant with the dictates of morality, thou art, O king,\r\nworthy to perform the grand sacrifice of Rajasuya. After the Ritwijas and\r\nthe Rishis  had told these words unto the king, his ministers and\r\nbrothers highly approved of the speech. The king, however, possessed of\r\ngreat wisdom, and with mind under complete control, actuated by the\r\ndesire of doing good unto the world, again resolved the matter in his\r\nmind, thinking of his own strength and means, the circumstances of time\r\nand place and his income and expenditure. For he knew that the wise never\r\ncome to grief owing to their always acting after full deliberation.\r\nThinking that the sacrifice should not be commenced, pursuant to his own\r\nresolution only, Yudhishthira, carefully bearing upon his shoulder the\r\nweight of affairs thought of Krishna that persecutor of all sinners as\r\nthe fittest person to decide the matter, in as much as he knew him to be\r\nthe foremost of all persons, possessed of immeasurable energy,\r\nstrong-armed, without birth but born amongst men from Will alone.\r\nReflecting upon his god-like feats the son of Pandu concluded that there\r\nwas nothing that was unknown to him, nothing that he could not achieve,\r\nand nothing that he could not bear, and Yudhishthira, the son of Pritha,\r\nhaving come to this settled resolution soon sent a messenger unto that\r\nmaster of all beings, conveying through him blessings and speeches such\r\nas one senior in age might send to one that is younger. And that\r\nmessenger riding in a swift car arrived amongst the Yadavas and\r\napproached Krishna who was then residing in Dwaravati. And Achyuta\r\n(Krishna) hearing that the son of Pritha had become desirous of seeing\r\nhim, desired to see his cousin. And quickly passing over many regions,\r\nbeing drawn by his own swift horses, Krishna arrived at Indraprastha,\r\naccompanied by Indrasena. And having arrived at Indraprastha, Janardana\r\napproached Yudhisthira without loss of time. And Yudhisthira received\r\nKrishna with paternal-affection, and Bhima also received him likewise.\r\nAnd Janardana then went with a cheerful heart to his father's sister\r\n(Kunti). And worshipped then with reverence by the twins, he began to\r\nconverse cheerfully with his friend Arjuna who was overjoyed at seeing\r\nhim. And after he had rested awhile in a pleasant apartment and had been\r\nfully refreshed, Yudhishthira approached him at his leisure and informed\r\nhim all about the Rajasuya sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'I have wished to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice.\r\nThat sacrifice, however, cannot be performed by one's wishing alone to\r\nperform it. Thou knowest, O Krishna, even thing about the means by which\r\nit may be accomplished. He alone can achieve this sacrifice in whom\r\neverything is possible, who is worshipped everywhere and who is the king\r\nof kings. My friends and counsellors approaching me have said that I\r\nshould perform that sacrifice. But, O Krishna, in respect of that matter,\r\nthy words shall be my guide. Of counsellers some from friendship do not\r\nnotice the difficulties; others from motives of self-interest say only\r\nwhat is agreeable. Some again regard that which is beneficial to\r\nthemselves as worthy of adoption. Men are seen to counsel thus on matters\r\nawaiting decision. But thou, O Krishna, art above such motives. Thou hast\r\nconquered both desire and anger. It behoveth thee to tell me what is most\r\nbeneficial to the world.\""

      "content": "(Rajasuyarambha Parva)\r\n\r\n\"Krishna said,--'O great king, thou art a worthy possessor of all the\r\nqualities essential for the performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. Thou\r\nknowest everything, O Bharata. I shall, however, still tell thee\r\nsomething. Those persons in the world that now go by the name of\r\nKshatriyas are inferior (in everything) to those Kshatriyas that Rama,\r\nthe son of Jamadagnya, exterminated.' O lord of the earth, O bull of the\r\nBharata race, thou knowest what form of rule these Kshatriyas, guided by\r\nthe instructions traditionally handed down from generation to generation,\r\nhave established amongst their own order, and how far they are competent\r\nto perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. The numerous royal lines and other\r\nordinary Kshatriyas all represent themselves to be the descendants of\r\nAila and Ikshwaku. The descendants of Aila, O king, as, indeed, the kings\r\nof Ikshwaku's race, are, know O bull of the Bharata race, each divided\r\ninto a hundred separate dynasties. The descendants of Yayati and the\r\nBhojas are great, both in extent (number) and accomplishments. O king,\r\nthese last are to-day scattered all over the earth. And all the\r\nKshatriyas worship the prosperity of those monarchs. At present, however,\r\nO monarch, king Jarasandha, overcoming that prosperity enjoyed by their\r\nwhole order, and overpowering them by his energy hath set himself over\r\nthe heads of all these kings. And Jarasandha, enjoying the sovereignty\r\nover the middle portion of the earth (Mathura), resolved to create a\r\ndisunion amongst ourselves. O monarch, the king who is the lord paramount\r\nof all kings, and in whom alone the dominion of the universe is centered,\r\nproperly deserves to be called an emperor. And, O monarch, king Sisupala\r\nendued with great energy, hath placed himself under his protection and\r\nhath become the generalissimo of his forces. And, O great king, the\r\nmighty Vaka, the king of the Karushas, capable of fighting by putting\r\nforth his powers of illusion, waiteth, upon Jarasandha, as his disciple.\r\nThere are two others, Hansa and Dimvaka, of great energy and great soul,\r\nwho have sought the shelter of the mighty Jarasandha. There are others\r\nalso viz., Dantavakra, Karusha, Karava, Meghavahana, that wait upon\r\nJarasandha. He also that beareth on his head that gem which is known as\r\nthe most wonderful on earth, that king of the Yavanas, who hath chastised\r\nMuru and Naraka, whose power is unlimited, and who ruleth the west like\r\nanother Varuna, who is called Bhagadatta, and who is the old friend of\r\nthy father, hath bowed his head before Jarasandha, by speech and\r\nspecially by act. In his heart, however, tied as he is by affection to\r\nthee, he regardeth thee as a father regardeth his child. O king, that\r\nlord of the earth who hath his dominions on the west and the south, who\r\nis thy maternal uncle and who is called Purujit, that brave perpetuator\r\nof the Kunti race, that slayer of all foes, is the single king that\r\nregardeth thee from affection. He whom I did not formerly slay, that\r\nwicked wretch amongst the Chedis, who represented himself in this world\r\nas a divine personage and who hath become known also as such, and who\r\nalways beareth, from foolishness, the signs that distinguish me that king\r\nof Vanga Pundra and the Kiratas, endowed with great strength, and who is\r\nknown on earth by the names of Paundraka and Vasudeva hath also espoused\r\nthe side of Jarasandha. And, O king of kings, Bhishmaka, the mighty king\r\nof the Bhojas--the friend of Indra--the slayer of hostile heroes--who\r\ngoverns a fourth part of the world, who by his learning conquered the\r\nPandyas and the Kratha-Kausikas, whose brother the brave Akriti was like\r\nRama, the son of Jamdagni, hath become a servitor to the king of Magadha.\r\nWe are his relatives and are, therefore, engaged everyday in doing what\r\nis agreeable unto him. But although we regard him much, still he\r\nregardeth us not and is engaged in doing us ill. And, O king, without\r\nknowing his own strength and the dignity of the race to which he\r\nbelongeth, he hath placed himself under Jarasandha's shelter at sight of\r\nthe latter's blazing fame alone. And, O exalted one, the eighteen tribes\r\nof the Bhojas, from fear of Jarasandha, have all fled towards the west;\r\nso also have the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Vodhas, the Salwas, the\r\nPatachchavas, the Susthalas, the Mukuttas, and the Kulindas, along with\r\nthe Kuntis. And the king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and\r\nfollowers; and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas have all\r\nfled to the country of the Kuntis. So also the Matsyas and the\r\nSannyastapadas, overcome with fear, leaving their dominions in the north,\r\nhave fled into the southern country. And so all the Panchalas, alarmed at\r\nthe power of Jarasandha, have left their own kingdom and fled in all\r\ndirections. Some time before, the foolish Kansa, having persecuted the\r\nYadavas, married two of the daughters of Jarasandha. They are called Asti\r\nand Prapti and are the sister of Sahadeva. Strengthened by such an\r\nalliance, the fool persecuting his relatives gained an ascendency over\r\nthem all. But by this conduct he earned great obloquy. The wretch also\r\nbegan to oppress the old kings of the Bhoja tribe, but they, to protect\r\nthemselves from the persecution of their relative, sought our help.\r\nHaving bestowed upon Akrura the handsome daughter of Ahuka, with\r\nSankarshana as my second I did a service to my relatives, for both Kansa\r\nand Sunaman were slain by me assisted by Rama. But after the immediate\r\ncause of fear was removed (by the death of Kansa), Jarasandha, his\r\nfather-in-law, took up arms. Ourselves consisting of the eighteen younger\r\nbranches of the Yadavas arrived at the conclusion that even if we struck\r\nour enemies continually with excellent weapons capable of taking the\r\nlives of the foes, we should still be unable to do anything unto him even\r\nin three hundred years. He hath two friends that are like unto the\r\nimmortals, and in point of strength the foremost of all men endued with\r\nmight. They are called Hansa and Dimvaka who are both incapable of being\r\nslain by weapons. The mighty Jarasandha, being united with them, becomes\r\nincapable, I think, of being vanquished by even the three worlds. O thou\r\nforemost of all intelligent men, this is not our opinion alone but all\r\nother kings also are of the same mind. There lived, O monarch, a king of\r\nthe name of Hansa, who was slain by Rama (Valadeva) after a battle of\r\neighteen days. But, O Bharata, hearing people say that Hansa had been\r\nkilled, Dimvaka, O king, thought that he could not live without Hansa. He\r\naccordingly jumped into the waters of the Yamuna and killed himself.\r\nAfterwards when Hansa, the subjugator of hostile heroes, heard that\r\nDimvaka, had killed himself, he went to the Yamuna and jumped into its\r\nwaters. Then, O bull of the Bharata race, king Jarasandha, hearing that\r\nboth Hansa and Dimvaka had been killed, returned to his kingdom with an\r\nempty heart. After Jarasandha had returned, O slayer of all foes, we were\r\nfilled with pleasure and continued to live at Mathura. Then the widow of\r\nHansa and the daughter of Jarasandha, that handsome woman with eyes like\r\nlotus-petals, grieved at the death of her lord, went unto her father, and\r\nrepeatedly urged, O Monarch, the king of Magadha, saying,--O slayer of\r\nall foes, kill thou the slayer of my husband.--Then, O great king,\r\nremembering the conclusion to which we had come of old we became\r\nexceedingly cheerless and fled from Mathura. Dividing our large wealth\r\ninto small portions so as to make each portion easily portable, we fled\r\nfrom fear of Jarasandha, with our cousins and relatives. Reflecting upon\r\neverything, we fled towards the west. There is a delightful town towards\r\nthe west called Kusasthali, adorned by the mountains of Raivata. In that\r\ncity, O monarch, we took up our abode. We rebuilt its fort and made it so\r\nstrong that it has become impregnable even to the Gods. And from within\r\nit even the women might fight the foe, what to speak of the Yadava heroes\r\nwithout fear of any kind? O slayer of all foes, we are now living in that\r\ncity. And, O tiger of the Kuru race, considering the inaccessibility of\r\nthat first of mountains and regarding themselves as having already\r\ncrossed the fear of Jarasandha, the descendants of Madhu have become\r\nexceedingly glad. Thus, O king, though possessed of strength and energy,\r\nyet from the oppressions of Jarasandha we have been obliged to repair to\r\nthe mountains of Gomanta, measuring three Yojanas in length. Within each\r\nyojana have been established one and twenty posts of armed men. And at\r\nintervals of each yojana are hundred gates with arches which are defended\r\nby valourous heroes engaged in guarding them. And innumerable Kshatriyas\r\ninvincible in war, belonging to the eighteen younger branches of the\r\nYadavas, are employed in defending these works. In our race, O king,\r\nthere are full eighteen thousand brothers and cousins. Ahuka hath had a\r\nhundred sons, each of whom is almost like a god (in prowess), Charudeshna\r\nwith his brother Chakradeva, Satyaki, myself, Valadeva the son of Rohini,\r\nand my son Samva who is equal unto me in battle--these seven, O king are\r\nAtirathas. Besides these, there are others, O king, whom I shall\r\npresently name. They are Kritavarman, Anadhrishti, Samika, Samitinjaya,\r\nKanka, Sanku and Kunti. These seven are Maharathas. There are also two\r\nsons of Andhakabhoja, and the old king himself. Endued with great energy\r\nthese are all heroes, each mighty as the thunderbolt. These Maharathas,\r\nchoosing the middle country, are now living amongst the Vrishnis. O thou\r\nbest of the Bharata line, thou alone art worthy of being an emperor. It\r\nbehoveth thee, O Bharata, to establish thy empire over all the\r\nKshatriyas. But this is my judgment, O king, that thou wilt not be able\r\nto celebrate the Rajasuya sacrifice as long as the mighty Jarasandha\r\nliveth. By him have been immured in his hillfort numerous monarchs, like\r\na lion that hath deposited the slain bodies of mighty elephants within a\r\ncave of the king of mountains. O slayer of all enemies, king Jarasandha,\r\ndesirous of offering in sacrifice hundred monarchs, adored for his fierce\r\nascetic penances the illustrious god of gods, the lord of Uma. It is by\r\nthis means that the kings of the earth have been vanquished by\r\nJarasandha. And, O best of monarchs, he hath by that means been able to\r\nfulfil the vow he had made relative to his sacrifice. By defeating the\r\nkings with their troops and bringing all of them as captives into this\r\ncity, he had swelled its crowds enormously. We also, O king, from fear of\r\nJarasandha, at one time had to leave Mathura and fly to the city of\r\nDwaravati. If, O great king, thou desirest to perform this sacrifice,\r\nstrive to release the kings confined by Jarasandha, as also to compass\r\nhis death. O son of the Kuru race, otherwise this undertaking of thine\r\ncan never be completed. O thou foremost of intelligent men if the\r\nRajasuya is to be performed by thee, you must do this in this way and not\r\notherwise. This, O king, is my view (on the matter). Do, O sinless one,\r\nas thou thinkest. Under these circumstances, O king, having reflected\r\nupon everything, taking note of causes, tell us what thou thyself\r\nthinkest proper.\""

Behold, there are kings in every province employed in\r\nbenefiting their respective selves. But no one amongst them hath been\r\nable to achieve the imperial dignity. Indeed, the title emperor is\r\ndifficult of acquisition. He that knoweth the valour and strength of\r\nothers never applaudeth himself. He, indeed, is really worthy of applause\r\n(worship) who, engaged in encounters with his enemies, beareth himself\r\ncommendably. O thou supporter of the dignity of the Vrishni race, man's\r\ndesires and propensities, like the wide earth itself adorned with many\r\njewels, are varied and extensive. As experience can seldom be gained but\r\nby travelling in regions remote from one's home, so salvation can never\r\nbe attained except by acting according to principles that are very high,\r\ncompared with the ordinary level of our desire and propensities. I regard\r\npeace of mind as the highest object here, for from that quality may\r\nproceed my prosperity. In my judgment, if I undertake to celebrate this\r\nsacrifice, I shall never win the highest reward. O Janardana, endued with\r\nenergy and intelligence, these that have been born in our race think that\r\nsome one amongst them will at one time become the foremost amongst all\r\nKshatriyas. But, O exalted one, we also were all frightened by the fear\r\nof Jarasandha and, O sinless one, by the wickedness of that monarch. O\r\nthou invincible in battle, the might of thy arm is my refuge. When,\r\ntherefore, thou taken fright at Jarasandha's might, how should I regard\r\nmyself strong in comparison with him? Madhava, O thou of the Vrishni\r\nrace, I am repeatedly depressed by the thought whether Jarasandha is\r\ncapable or not of being slain by thee, by Rama, by Bhimasena, or by\r\nArjuna. But what shall I say, O Keshava? Thou art my highest authority on\r\neverything.'\r\n\r\n\"On hearing these words, Bhima well-skilled in speech said,--'That king\r\nwho is without exertion, or who being weak and without resources entereth\r\ninto hostility with one that is strong, perisheth like an ant-hill. It\r\nmay be generally seen, however, that even a king that is weak may\r\nvanquish an enemy that is strong and obtain the fruition of all his\r\nwishes, by wakefulness and by the application of policy. In Krishna is\r\npolicy, in myself strength, in Arjuna triumphs. So like the three\r\n(sacrificial) fires that accomplish a sacrifice, we shall accomplish the\r\ndeath of the king of Magadha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Krishna then said,--'One that is immature in understanding seeketh the\r\nfruition of his desire without an eye to what may happen to him in\r\nfuture. It is seen that no one forgiveth for that reason a foe that is of\r\nimmature understanding and inclined to serve his own interests. It hath\r\nbeen heard by us that in the krita age, having brought every one under\r\ntheir subjection, Yauvanaswin by the abolition of all taxes, Bhagiratha\r\nby his kind treatment to his subjects, Kartavirya by the energy of his\r\nasceticism, the lord Bharata by his strength and valour, and Maruta by\r\nhis prosperity, all these five became emperors. But, O Yudhishthira, thou\r\nwho covetest the imperial dignity deserves it, not by one but by all\r\nthese qualities, viz., victory, protection afforded to thy people,\r\nvirtue, prosperity, and policy. Know, O bull of the Kuru race, that\r\nJarasandha, the son of Vrihadratha, is even such (i.e., a candidate for\r\nthe imperial dignity). A hundred dynasties of kings have become unable to\r\noppose Jarasandha. He, therefore, may be regarded to be an emperor for\r\nhis strength. Kings that are wearers of jewels worship Jarasandha (with\r\npresents of jewels). But, wicked from his childhood, he is scarcely\r\nsatisfied with such worship. Having become the foremost among all, he\r\nattacketh yet with violence kings with crowns on their heads. Nor is\r\nthere seen any king from whom he taketh not tribute. Thus hath he brought\r\nunder his sway nearly a hundred kings. How can, O son of Pritha, any weak\r\nmonarch approach him with hostile intentions? Confined in the temple of\r\nShiva and offered as sacrifice unto him like so many animals, do not\r\nthese monarchs dedicated unto that god feel the most poignant misery, O\r\nbull of the Bharata race? A Kshatriya that dieth in battle is ever\r\nregarded with respect. Why shall we not, therefore, meet together and\r\noppose Jarsandha in battle? He hath already brought eighty-six kings;\r\nfourteen only are wanting to complete one hundred. As soon as he\r\nobtaineth those fourteen, he will begin his cruel act. He that shall be\r\nto obstruct that act will surely win blazing renown. And he that will\r\nvanquish Jarasandha will surely become the emperor of all the\r\nKshatriyas.'\""

Yama himself cannot vanquish in battle the mighty host of\r\nJarasandha that is endued, besides, with terrible valour. What valour can\r\nye exhibit against it. This affair that promises to terminate otherwise\r\nmay lead to great mischief. It is my opinion, therefore, that the\r\nproposed task should not be undertaken. Listen, O Krishna, to what I for\r\none think. O Janardana, desisting from this act seemeth to me to be\r\nbeneficial. My heart to-day is afflicted. The Rajasuya appeareth to me\r\ndifficult of accomplishment.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said,--\"Arjuna who had obtained that excellent of bows and\r\nthat couple of inexhaustible quivers, and that car with that banner, as\r\nalso that assembly room, now addressed Yudhishthira and said,--'I have\r\nobtained, O king, a bow and weapons and arrows and energy and allies and\r\ndominions and fame and strength. Those are always difficult of\r\nacquisition, however much they may be desired. Learned men of repute\r\nalways praise in good society nobleness of descent. But nothing is equal\r\nto might. Indeed, O monarch, there is nothing I like more than prowess.\r\nBorn in a race noted for its valour, one that is without valour is\r\nscarcely worthy of regard. One, however, possessed of valour, that is\r\nborn in a race not noted for it, is much superior to the former. He, O\r\nking, is a Kshatriya in every thing who increaseth his fame and\r\npossessions by the subjugation of his enemies. And he that is possessed\r\nof valour, though destitute of all (other) merits, will vanquish his\r\nfoes. One, however, that is destitute of valour, though possessed of\r\nevery (other) merit, can scarcely accomplish anything. Every merit exists\r\nby the side of valour in an incipient state. Concentration of attention,\r\nexertion and destiny exist as the three causes of victory. One, however,\r\nthat is possessed of valour doth not yet deserve success if he acts\r\ncarelessly. It is for this that an enemy endued with strength sometimes\r\nsuffers death at the hands of his foes. As meanness overtakes the weak,\r\nso folly sometimes overtakes the strong. A king, therefore, that is\r\ndesirous of victory, should avoid both these causes of destruction. If,\r\nfor the purpose of our sacrifice, we endeavour to slay Jarasandha and\r\nrescue the kings kept by him for a cruel purpose, there is no higher act\r\nwhich we could employ ourselves in. If, however, we do not undertake the\r\ntask, the world will always think us incompetent. We have certainly the\r\ncompetence, O king! Why should you, therefore, regard us as incompetent?\r\nThose that have become Munis desirous of achieving tranquillity of souls,\r\nobtain yellow robes with ease. So if we vanquish the foe, the imperial\r\ndignity will easily be ours. We shall, therefore fight the foe.\""

We know not when death will overtake us, in the night or in the\r\nday. Nor have we ever heard that immortality hath been achieved by\r\ndesisting from fight. This, therefore, is the duty of men, viz., to\r\nattack all enemies in accordance with the principles laid down in the\r\nordinance. This always gives satisfaction to the heart. Aided by good\r\npolicy, if not frustrated by Destiny, an undertaking becomes crowned with\r\nsuccess. If both parties aided by such means encounter each other, one\r\nmust obtain ascendency over the other, for both cannot win or lose.

If, again, both parties\r\nare equally circumstanced, the result becomes doubtful. Both, however,\r\ncannot win.

If, disguising our own faults, we attack the\r\nenemy taking advantage of his loopholes, why should we not succeed?\r\nIndeed, the policy of intelligent men, is that one should not fight\r\nopenly with foes that are exceedingly powerful and are at the head of\r\ntheir well-arrayed forces. This too is my opinion. If, however, we\r\naccomplish our purpose secretly entering the abode of our foe and\r\nattacking his person, we shall never earn obloquy. That bull among\r\nmen--Jarasandha--alone enjoyeth unfaded glory, like unto him who is the\r\nself in the heart of every created being. But I see his destruction\r\nbefore me. Desirous of protecting our relatives we will either slay him\r\nin battle or shall ascend to heaven being ourselves slain in the end by\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nYudhishthira said--\"O Krishna, who is this Jarasandha? What is his energy\r\nand what is his prowess, that having touched thee he hath not been burnt\r\nlike an insect at the touch of fire?\"\r\n\r\nKrishna said,--'Hear, O monarch, who Jarasandha is; what his energy; and\r\nwhat is his prowess; and why also he hath been spared by us, Even though\r\nhe hath repeatedly offended us. There was a mighty king of the name of\r\nVrihadratha, the lord of the Magadhas. Proud in battle, he had three\r\nAkshauhinis of troops. Handsome and endued with energy, possessed of\r\naffluence and prowess beyond measure, and always bearing on his person\r\nmarks indicating installation at sacrifices. He was like a second Indra.\r\nIn glory he was like unto Suryya, in forgiveness like unto the Earth, in\r\nwrath like unto the destroyer Yama and in wealth like unto Vaisravana.\r\nAnd O thou foremost of the Bharata race, the whole earth was covered by\r\nhis qualities that descended upon him from a long line of ancestors, like\r\nthe rays emerging from the sun. And, O bull of the Bharata race, endued\r\nwith great energy that monarch married two twin daughters of the king of\r\nKasi, both endued with the wealth of beauty. And that bull among men made\r\nan engagement in secret with his wives that he would love them equally\r\nand would never show a preference for either. And the lord of the earth\r\nin the company of his two dearly loved wives, both of whom suited him\r\nwell, passed his days in joy like a mighty elephant in the company of two\r\ncow-elephants, or like the ocean in his personified form between Ganga\r\nand Yamuna (also in their personified forms). The monarch's youth\r\nhowever, passed away in the enjoyment of his possessions, without any son\r\nbeing born unto him to perpetuate his line. The best of monarch failed to\r\nobtain a son to perpetuate his race, even by means of various auspicious\r\nrites, and homas, and sacrifices performed with the desire for having an\r\noffspring. One day the king heard that the high-souled Chanda-kausika,\r\nthe son of Kakshivat of the illustrious Gautama race, having desisted\r\nfrom ascetic penances had come in course of his wanderings to his capital\r\nand had taken his seat under the shade of a mango tree. The king went\r\nunto that Muni accompanied by his two wives, and worshipping him with\r\njewels and valuable presents gratified him highly. That best of Rishis\r\ntruthful in speech and firmly attached to truth, then told the king,--O\r\nking of kings, I have been pleased with thee. O thou of excellent vows,\r\nsolicit thou a boon. King Vrihadratha then, with his wives, bending low\r\nunto that Rishi, spoke these words choked with tears in consequence of\r\nhis despair of obtaining a child.--'O holy one forsaking my kingdom I am\r\nabout to go into the woods to practise ascetic penances. I am very\r\nunfortunate for I have no son. What shall I do, therefore, with my\r\nkingdom or with a boon?'\r\n\r\nKrishna continued,--\"Hearing these words (of the king), the Muni\r\ncontrolling his outer senses entered into meditation, sitting in the\r\nshade of that very mango tree where he was. And there fell upon the lap\r\nof the seated Muni a mango that was juicy and untouched by the beak of a\r\nparrot or any other bird. That best of Munis, taking up the fruit and\r\nmentally pronouncing certain mantras over it, gave it unto the king as\r\nthe means of his obtaining an incomparable offspring. And the great Muni,\r\npossessed also of extraordinary wisdom, addressing the monarch,\r\nsaid,--\"Return, O king, thy wish is fulfilled. Desist, O king, from going\r\n(into the woods)\".--Hearing these words of the Muni and worshipping his\r\nfeet, the monarch possessed of great wisdom, returned to his own abode.\r\nAnd recollecting his former promise (unto them) the king gave, O bull of\r\nthe Bharata race, unto his two wives that one fruit. His beautiful\r\nqueens, dividing that single fruit into two parts, ate it up. In\r\nconsequence of the certainty of the realisation of the Muni's words and\r\nhis truthfulness, both of them conceived, as an effect of their having\r\neaten that fruit. And the king beholding them in that state became filled\r\nwith great joy. Then, O wise monarch, some time after, when the time\r\ncame, each of the queens brought forth a fragmentary body. And each\r\nfragment had one eye, one arm, one leg, half a stomach, half a face, and\r\nhalf an anus. Beholding the fragmentary bodies, both the mothers trembled\r\nmuch. The helpless sisters then anxiously consulted each other, and\r\nsorrowfully abandoned those fragments endued with life. The two midwives\r\n(that waited upon the queens) then carefully wrapping up the still-born\r\n(?) fragments went out of the inner apartments (of the palace) by the\r\nback door and throwing away the bodies, returned in haste. A little while\r\nafter, O tiger among men, a Rakshasa woman of the name of Jara living\r\nupon flesh and blood, took up the fragments that lay on a crossing. And\r\nimpelled by force of fate, the female cannibal united the fragments for\r\nfacility of carrying them away. And, O bull among men, as soon as the\r\nfragments were united they formed a sturdy child of one body (endued with\r\nlife). Then, O king, the female cannibal, with eyes expanded in wonder,\r\nfound herself unable to carry away that child having a body as hard and\r\nstrong as the thunder-bolt. That infant then closing his fists red as\r\ncopper and inserting them into its mouth, began to roar terribly as\r\nrain-charged clouds. Alarmed at the sound, the inmates of the palace, O\r\ntiger among men, suddenly came out with the king, O slayer of all foes.\r\nThe helpless and disappointed and sad queens also, with breasts full of\r\nmilk, also came out suddenly to recover their child. The female cannibal\r\nbeholding the queens in that condition and the king too so desirous of an\r\noffspring, and the child was possessed of such strength thought within\r\nherself--I live within dominions of the king who is so desirous of an\r\noffspring. It behoveth not me, therefore, to kill the infant child of\r\nsuch an illustrious and virtuous monarch. The Rakshasa woman then,\r\nholding the child in her arms like the clouds enveloping the sun, and\r\nassuming a human form, told the king these words,--O Vrihadratha, this is\r\nthy child. Given to thee by me, O, take it. It hath been born of both thy\r\nwives by virtue of the command of the great Brahmana. Cast away by the\r\nmidwives, it hath been protected by me!\r\n\r\n\"Krishna continued,--O thou foremost of the Bharata race, the handsome\r\ndaughters of the king of Kasi, having obtained the child, soon drenched\r\nit with their lacteal streams. The king ascertaining everything, was\r\nfilled with joy, and addressing that female cannibal disguised as a human\r\nbeing possessing the complexion of gold, asked,--O thou of the complexion\r\nof the filament of the lotus, who art thou that givest me this child? O\r\nauspicious one, thou seemest to me as a goddess roaming at thy pleasure!\""

And, O\r\nBharata, worshipping the Rishi with water to wash his feet and face, and\r\nwith the offerings of Arghya the king then offered his whole kingdom\r\nalong with his son for the acceptance of the Rishi.

There Vrihadratha had slain a\r\ncannibal called Rishava and having slain the monster made of his hide\r\nthree drums which he placed in his own city. And those drums were such\r\nthat once beaten their sound lasted one full month. And the brothers\r\nbroke down the Chaityaka peak that was delightful to all the Magadhas, at\r\nthat point where those drums covered with celestial flowers used to yield\r\ntheir continuous sound. And desirous of slaying Jarasandha they seemed by\r\nthat act of theirs to place their feet upon the head of their foe. And\r\nattacking with their mighty arms that immovable and huge and high and old\r\nand celebrated peak always worshipped with perfumes and floral wreaths,\r\nthose heroes broke it down. And with joyful hearts they then entered the\r\ncity. And it so happened that the learned Brahmanas residing within the\r\ncity saw many evil omens which they reported to Jarasandha. And the\r\npriest making the king mount an elephant whirled lighted brands about\r\nhim. And king Jarasandha also, possessed of great prowess, with a view to\r\nwarding of those evils, entered upon the celebration of a sacrifice, with\r\nproper vows and fasts. Meanwhile, O Bharata, the brothers unarmed, or\r\nrather with their bare arms as their only weapons, desirous of fighting\r\nwith Jarasandha, entered the capital in the guise of Brahmanas. They\r\nbeheld the extraordinary beauty of the shops full of various edibles and\r\nfloral wreaths, and supplied with articles of every variety of various\r\nqualities that man can desire. Those best of men, Krishna, Bhima, and\r\nDhananjaya, beholding in those shops their affluence, passed along the\r\npublic road. And endued with great strength they snatched forcibly from\r\nthe flower-vendors the garlands they had exposed for sale. And attired in\r\nrobes of various colours and decked in garlands and ear-rings the heroes\r\nentered the abode of Jarasandha possessed of great intelligence, like\r\nHimalayan lions eyeing cattle-folds. And the arms of those warriors, O\r\nking, besmeared with sandal paste, looked like the trunks of sala trees.\r\nThe people of Magadha, beholding those heroes looking like elephants,\r\nwith necks broad like those of trees and wide chests, began to wonder\r\nmuch. Those bull among men, passing through three gates that were crowded\r\nwith men, proudly and cheerfully approached the king. And Jarasandha\r\nrising up in haste received them with water to wash their feet with, and\r\nhoney and the other ingredients of the Arghya--with gifts of kine, and\r\nwith other forms of respect. The great king addressing them said,--'Ye\r\nare welcome'! And, O Janamejaya, both Partha and Bhima remained silent at\r\nthis. And addressing the monarch Krishna said,--'O king of kings these\r\ntwo are now in the observance of a vow. Therefore they will not speak.\r\nSilent they will remain till midnight After that hour they will speak\r\nwith thee!' The king then quartering his guests in the sacrificial\r\napartments retired into his private chambers. And when midnight arrived,\r\nthe monarch arrived at the place where his guests attired as Brahmanas\r\nwere. For, O King, that ever victorious monarch observed this vow which\r\nwas known throughout the Worlds that as soon as he should hear of the\r\narrival of Snataka Brahmanas at his place, should it be even at midnight,\r\nhe would immediately, O Bharata, come out and grant them an audience.\r\nBeholding the strange attire of his guests that best of kings wondered\r\nmuch. For all that, however, he waited on them respectfully. Those bulls\r\namong men, those slayers of all foes, on the other hand, O thou best of\r\nthe Bharata race, beholding king Jarasandha, said,--'Let salvation be\r\nattained by thee, O king, without difficulty.' And, O tiger among kings,\r\nhaving said this unto the monarch, they stood looking at each other. And,\r\nO king of kings, Jarasandha then said unto those sons of Pandu and him of\r\nthe Yadu race, all disguised as Brahmanas--'Take your seats.' And those\r\nbulls among men sat themselves down, and like the three priests of a\r\ngreat sacrifice blazed forth in their beauty. And king Jarasandha, O thou\r\nof the Kuru race, firmly devoted to truth, censuring the disguised\r\nguests, said unto them,--'It is well known to me that in the whole world\r\nBrahmanas in the observance of Snataka vow never deck their persons with\r\ngarlands and fragrant paste unseasonably. Who are ye, therefore, thus\r\ndecked with flowers, and with hands bearing the marks of the bow-string?\r\nAttired in coloured robes and decked unseasonably with flowers and paste,\r\nye give me to understand that ye are Brahmanas, although ye bear\r\nKshatriya energy. Tell me truly who ye are. Truth decks even kings.\r\nBreaking down the peak of the Chaityaka hill, why have ye, in disguise,\r\nentered (the city) by an improper gate without fear of the royal wrath?\r\nThe energy of a Brahmana dwelleth in his speech, (not in act). This your\r\nfeat is not suited to the order to which ye profess to belong. Tell us\r\ntherefore, the end ye have in view. Arrived here by such an improper way,\r\nwhy accept ye not the worship I offer? What is your motive for coming to\r\nme? Thus addressed by the king, the high-souled Krishna, well-skilled in\r\nspeech, thus replied unto the monarch in a calm and grave voice.\r\n\r\n\"Krishna said,--'O king, know us for Snataka Brahmanas. Brahmanas and\r\nKshatriyas and Vaishyas are all, O monarch, competent to observe the vow\r\nof Snataka. This vow, besides, hath (many) especial and general rules. A\r\nKshatriya observing this vow with especial rules always achieve\r\nprosperity. Therefore, have we decked ourselves with flowers. Kshatriyas\r\nagain, O king, exhibit their energy by their arms and not in speech. It\r\nis, therefore, O son of Vrihadratha, that the speeches uttered by a\r\nKshatriya are never audacious. O monarch, the creator hath planted his\r\nown energy in the aim of the Kshatriya. If thou wishest to behold it,\r\nthou shalt certainly behold it today. These are the rules of the\r\nordinance, viz., that an enemy's abode should be entered through a wrong\r\ngate and a friend's abode through the right one. And know, O monarch,\r\nthat this also is our eternal vow that having entered the foe's abode for\r\nthe accomplishment of our purpose, we accept not the worship offered to\r\nus!\""

When I have never done ye an injury, why, ye Brahmanas do\r\nye regard me, who am innocent, as your foe? O, answer me truly, for this,\r\nindeed, is the rule followed by the honest. The mind is pained at the\r\ninjury to one's pleasure and morality. That Kshatriya who injures an\r\ninnocent man's (sources of) pleasure and morality even if he be otherwise\r\na great warrior and well-versed in all rules of morality, obtains,\r\nwithout any doubt the fate of sinners (hereafter) and falls off from\r\nprosperity. The practices of the Kshatriyas are the best of those that\r\nare honest in the three worlds Indeed, those that are acquainted with\r\nmorality applaud the Kshatriya practices. Adhering to those practices of\r\nmy order with steady soul, I never injure those that are under me. In\r\nbringing this charge, therefore, against me, it appears that ye speak\r\nerroneously!'\r\n\r\n\"Krishna said,--'O thou of mighty arms, there is a certain person of the\r\nhead of a (royal) line who upholdeth the dignity of his race At his\r\ncommand have we come against thee. Thou hast brought, O king, many of the\r\nKshatriyas of the world as captives (to thy city.) Having perpetrated\r\nthat wicked wrong how dost thou regard thyself as innocent? O best of\r\nmonarchs, how can a king act wrongfully towards other virtuous kings? But\r\nthou, O king, treating other kings with cruelty, seekest to offer them as\r\nsacrifice unto the god Rudra! O son of Vrihadratha, this sin committed by\r\nthee may touch even us, for as we are virtuous in our practices, we are\r\ncapable of protecting virtue. The slaughter of human being as sacrifice\r\nunto the gods is never seen. Why dost thou, therefore, seek to perform a\r\nsacrifice unto god Sankara by slaughtering human beings? Thou art\r\naddressing persons belonging to thy own order as animals (fit for\r\nsacrifice)! Fool as thou art, who else, O Jarasandha, is capable of\r\nbehaving in this way? One always obtaineth the fruits of whatever acts\r\none performeth under whatever circumstances. Therefore, desirous as we\r\nare of helping all distressed people, we have, for the prosperity of our\r\nrace, come hither to slay thee, the slaughterer of our relatives. Thou\r\nthinkest that there is no man among the Kshatriyas (equal to thee). This,\r\nO king, is a great error of judgment on thy part. What Kshatriya is\r\nthere, O king, who endued with greatness of soul and recollecting the\r\ndignity of his own parentage, would not ascend to eternal heaven that\r\nhath not its like anywhere, falling in open fight? Know O bull among men,\r\nthat Kshatriyas engage themselves in battle, as persons installed in\r\nsacrifices, with heaven in view, and vanquish the whole world! Study of\r\nthe Vedas, great fame, ascetic penances, and death in battle, are all\r\nacts that lead to heaven. The attainment of heaven by the three other\r\nacts may be uncertain, but death in battle hath that for its certain\r\nconsequence. Death in battle is the sure cause of triumph like Indra's.\r\nIt is graced by numerous merits. It is for this reason that he of a\r\nhundred sacrifices (Indra) hath become what he is, and by vanquishing the\r\nAsuras he ruleth the universe. Hostility with whom else than thee is so\r\nsure of leading to heaven, proud as thou art of the excessive strength of\r\nthy vast Magadha host? Don't disregard others, O king. Valour dwelleth in\r\nevery man. O king of men, there are many men whose valour may be equal or\r\nsuperior to thine. As long as these are not known, so long only art thou\r\nnoted for thy valour. Thy prowess, O king, can be borne by us. It is,\r\ntherefore, that I say so. O king of Magadha, cast off thy superiority and\r\npride in the presence of those that are thy equals. Go not, O king, with\r\nthy children and ministers and army, into the regions of Yama.\r\nDamvodhava, Kartavirya, Uttara, and Vrihadratha, were kings that met with\r\ndestruction, along with all their forces, for having disregarded their\r\nsuperiors. Desirous of liberating the captive monarchs from thee, know\r\nthat we are certainly not Brahmanas. I am Hrishesha otherwise called\r\nSauri, and these two heroes among men are the sons of Pandu. O king of\r\nMagadha, we challenge thee. Fight standing before us. Either set free all\r\nthe monarchs, or go thou to the abode of Yama.\r\n\r\n\"Jarasandha said,--'I never make a captive of a king without first\r\nvanquishing him. Who hath been kept here that hath not been defeated in\r\nwar? This, O Krishna, it hath been said, is the duty that should be\r\nfollowed by the Kshatriyas, viz., to bring others under sway by the\r\nexhibition of prowess and then to treat them as slaves. Having gathered\r\nthese monarchs with the intention of offering them as sacrifices unto the\r\ngod, how shall I, O Krishna, from fear liberate them to-day, when I\r\nrecollect also the duty I have recited of a Kshatriya? With troops\r\nagainst troops arrayed in order of battle, or alone against one, or\r\nagainst two, or against three, at the same time or separately, I am ready\r\nto fight.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"Having spoken thus, and desiring to fight with those\r\nheroes of terrible achievements, king Jarasandha ordered (his son)\r\nSahadeva to be installed on the throne. Then, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nthe king, on the eve of battle, thought of his two generals Kausika and\r\nChitrasena. These two, O king, were formerly called by everybody in the\r\nworld of men by the respectful appellations of Hansa and Dimvaka. And, O\r\nmonarch, that tiger among men, the lord Sauri ever devoted to truth, the\r\nslayer of Madhu, the younger brother of Haladhara, the foremost of all\r\npersons having their senses under complete control, keeping in view the\r\ncommand of Brahma and remembering that the ruler of Magadha was destined\r\nto be slain in battle by Bhima and not by the descendant of Madhu\r\n(Yadavas), desired not to slay himself king Jarasandha, that foremost of\r\nall men endued with strength, that hero possessed of the prowess of a\r\ntiger, that warrior of terrible valour.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said,--'then that foremost of all speakers, Krishna of the\r\nYadava race, addressing king Jarasandha who was resolved upon fighting,\r\nsaid,--'O king, with whom amongst us three dost thou desire to fight? Who\r\namongst us shall prepare himself for battle (with thee)?' Thus addressed,\r\nthe ruler of Magadha, king Jarasandha of great splendour, expressed his\r\ndesire for fighting with Bhima. The priest then, bringing with him the\r\nyellow pigment obtained from the cow and garlands of flowers and other\r\nauspicious articles, as also various excellent medicines for restoring\r\nlost consciousness and alleviating pain, approached Jarasandha, panting\r\nfor battle. The king Jarasandha, on whose behalf propitiatory ceremonies\r\nwith benedictions were performed by a renowned Brahmana, remembering the\r\nduty of a Kshatriya dressed himself for battle. Taking off his crown and\r\nbinding his hair properly, Jarasandha stood up like an ocean bursting its\r\ncontinents. Then the monarch possessed of terrible prowess, addressing\r\nBhima. said, 'I will fight with thee. It is better to be vanquished by a\r\nsuperior person.' And saying this, Jarasandha, that represser of all foes\r\nendued, rushed with great energy at Bhimasena like the Asura Vala or old\r\nwho rushed at the chief of the celestials. And the mighty Bhimasena, on\r\nwhose behalf the gods had been invoked by Krishna, that cousin of his,\r\nhaving consulted with advanced towards Jarasandha, impelled by the desire\r\nof fight. Then those tigers among men, those heroes of great prowess,\r\nwith their bare arms as their only weapons, cheerfully engaged themselves\r\nin the encounter, each desirous of vanquishing the other. And seizing\r\neach other's arms and twining each other's legs, (at times) they slapped\r\ntheir arm-pits, causing the enclosure to tremble at the sound. And\r\nfrequently seizing each other's necks with their hands and dragging and\r\npushing it with violence, and each pressing every limb of his body\r\nagainst every limb of the other, they continued, O exalted one, to slap\r\ntheir arm-pits (at time). And sometimes stretching their arms and\r\nsometimes drawing them close, and now raising them up and now dropping\r\nthem down, they began to seize each other. And striking neck against neck\r\nand forehead against forehead, they caused fiery sparks to come out like\r\nflashes of lightning. And grasping each other in various ways by means of\r\ntheir arms, and kicking each other with such violence as to affect the\r\ninnermost nerves, they struck at each other's breasts with clenched\r\nfists. With bare arms as their only weapons roaring like clouds they\r\ngrasped and struck each other like two mad elephants encountering each\r\nother with their trunks. Incensed at each other's blow, they fought on\r\ndragging and pushing each other and fiercely looking at each other like\r\ntwo wrathful lions. And each striking every limb of the other with his\r\nown and using his arms also against the other, and catching hold of each\r\nother's waist, they hurled each other to a distance. Accomplished in\r\nwrestling, the two heroes clasping each other with their arms and each\r\ndragging the other unto himself, began to press each other with great\r\nviolence. The heroes then performed those grandest of all feats in\r\nwrestling called Prishtabhanga, which consisted in throwing each other\r\ndown with face towards the earth and maintaining the one knocked down in\r\nthat position as long as possible. And employing his arms, each also\r\nperformed the feats called Sampurna-murchcha and Purna-kumbha. At times\r\nthey twisted each other's arms and other limbs as if these were vegetable\r\nfibres that were to be twisted into chords. And with clenched fists they\r\nstruck each other at times, pretending to aim at particular limbs while\r\nthe blows descended upon other parts of the body. It was thus that those\r\nheroes fought with each other. The citizens consisting of thousands, of\r\nBrahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, and even women and the\r\naged, O tiger among men, came out and gathered there to behold the fight.\r\nAnd the crowd became so great that it was one solid mass of humanity with\r\nno space between body and body. The sound the wrestlers made by the\r\nslapping of their arms, the seizing of each other's necks for bringing\r\neach other down, and the grasping of each other's legs for dashing each\r\nother to the ground, became so loud that it resembled the roar of thunder\r\nor of falling cliffs. Both of them were foremost of mighty men, and both\r\ntook great delight in such encounter. Desirous of vanquishing the other,\r\neach was on the alert for taking advantage of the slightest lapse of the\r\nother. And, O monarch, the mighty Bhima and Jarasandha fought terribly on\r\nin those lists, driving the crowd at times by the motions of their hands\r\nlike Vritra and Vasava of old. Thus two heroes, dragging each other\r\nforward and pressing each other backward and with sudden jerks throwing\r\neach other face downward and sideways, mangled each other dreadfully. And\r\nat times they struck each other with their knee-joints. And addressing\r\neach other loudly in stinging speeches, they struck each other with\r\nclenched fists, the blows descending like a mass of stone upon each\r\nother. With broad shoulders and long arms and both well-skilled in\r\nwrestling encounters, they struck each other with those long arms of\r\ntheirs that were like maces of iron. That encounter of the heroes\r\ncommenced on the first (lunar) day of the month of Kartic (October) and\r\nthe illustrious heroes fought on without intermission and food, day and\r\nnight, till the thirteenth lunar day. It was on the night of the\r\nfourteenth of the lunar fortnight that the monarch of Magadha desisted\r\nfrom fatigue. And O king, Janardana beholding the monarch tired,\r\naddressed Bhima of terrible deeds, and as if to stimulate him said,--'O\r\nson of Kunti, a foe that is fatigued cannot be pressed for if pressed at\r\nsuch a time he may even die. Therefore, O son of Kunti, this king should\r\nnot be oppressed by thee. On the other hand, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nfight with him With thy arms, putting forth as much strength only as thy\r\nantagonist hath now left!' Then that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of\r\nPandu, thus addressed by Krishna, understood the plight of Jarasandha and\r\nforthwith resolved upon taking his life. And that foremost of all men\r\nendued with strength, that prince of the Kuru race, desirous of\r\nvanquishing the hitherto unvanquished Jarasandha, mustered all his\r\nstrength and courage.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said,--\"thus addressed, Bhima firmly resolved upon slaying\r\nJarasandha, replied unto Krishna of the Yadu race, saying,--O tiger of\r\nthe Yadu race, O Krishna, this wretch that yet stayeth before me with\r\nsufficient strength and bent upon fight, should not be forgiven by me.\r\nHearing these words of Vrikodara (Bhima), that tiger among men, Krishna,\r\ndesiring to encourage that hero to accomplish the death of Jarasandha\r\nwithout any delay, answered,--'O Bhima, exhibit today upon Jarasandha the\r\nstrength thou hast luckily derived, the might thou hast obtained from\r\n(thy father), the god Maruta.' Thus addressed by Krishna, Bhima, that\r\nslayer of foes, holding up in the air the powerful Jarasandha, began to\r\nwhirl him on high. And, O bull of the Bharata race, having so whirled him\r\nin the air full hundred times, Bhima pressed his knee against\r\nJarasandha's backbone and broke his body in twain. And having killed him\r\nthus, the mighty Vrikodara uttered a terrible roar. And the roar of the\r\nPandava mingling with that death knell of Jarasandha, while he was being\r\nbroken on Bhima's knee, caused a loud uproar that struck fear into the\r\nheart of every creature. And all the citizens of Magadha became dumb with\r\nterror and many women were even prematurely delivered. And hearing those\r\nroars, the people of Magadha thought that either the Himavat was tumbling\r\ndown or the earth itself was being rent asunder. And those oppressors of\r\nall foes then, leaving the lifeless body of the king at the palace gate\r\nwhere he lay as one asleep, went out of the town. And Krishna, causing\r\nJarasandha's car furnished with an excellent flagstaff to be made ready\r\nand making the brothers (Bhima and Arjuna) ride in it, went in and\r\nreleased his (imprisoned) relatives. And those kings rescued from\r\nterrible fate, rich in the possession of jewels, approaching Krishna made\r\npresents unto him of jewels and gems. And having vanquished his foe,\r\nKrishna furnished with weapons and unwounded and accompanied by the kings\r\n(he had released), came out of Girivraja riding in that celestial car (of\r\nJarasandha). And he also who could wield the bow with both hands\r\n(Arjuna), who was incapable of being vanquished by any of the monarchs on\r\nearth, who was exceedingly handsome in person and well-skilled in the\r\ndestruction of the foe, accompanied by the possessor of great strength\r\n(Bhima), came out of that tort with Krishna driving the car whereon he\r\nrode. And that best of cars, incapable of being vanquished by any king,\r\nridden in by those warriors Bhima and Arjuna, and driven by Krishna,\r\nlooked exceedingly handsome. Indeed, it was upon that car that Indra and\r\nVishnu had fought of old in the battle (with the Asuras) in which Taraka\r\n(the wife of Vrihaspati) had become the immediate cause of much\r\nslaughter. And riding upon that car Krishna now came out of the\r\nhill-fort. Possessed of the splendour of heated gold, and decked with\r\nrows of jingling bells and furnished with wheels whose clatter was like\r\nthe roar of clouds, and ever victorious in battle, and always\r\nslaughtering the foe against whom it was driven, it was that very car\r\nriding upon which Indra had slain ninety-nine Asuras of old. And those\r\nbulls among men (the three cousins) having obtained that car became\r\nexceedingly glad. The people of Magadha, behold the long-armed Krishna\r\nalong with the two brothers, seated in that car (of Jarasandha) wondered\r\nmuch. O Bharata, that car, whereunto were yoked celestial horses and\r\nwhich possessed the speed of the wind, thus ridden upon by Krishna,\r\nlooked exceedingly beautiful. And upon that best of cars was a flag-staff\r\nwithout being visibly attached thereto, and which was the product of\r\ncelestial skill. And the handsome flag-staff, possessed of the splendour\r\nof the rainbow, could be seen from the distance of a yojana. And Krishna\r\nwhile, coming out, thought of Garuda. And Garuda, thought of by his\r\nmaster, came thither in no time, like a tree of vast proportions standing\r\nin a village worshipped by all. Garuda of immense weight of body and\r\nliving upon snakes sat upon that excellent car along with the numberless\r\nopen-mouthed and frightfully-roaring creatures on its flag-staff. And\r\nthereupon that best of cars became still more dazzling with its splendour\r\nand was as incapable of being looked at by created being as the midday\r\nsun surrounded by a thousand rays. And, O king, such was that best of\r\nflag-staffs of celestial make that it never struck against any tree nor\r\ncould any weapon injure it at all even though visible to men's eyes. And\r\nAchyuta, that tiger among men, riding with the two sons of Pandu upon\r\nthat celestial car, the clatter of whose wheels was like the roar of the\r\nclouds, came out of Girivraja. The car upon which Krishna rode had been\r\nobtained by king Vasu from Vasava, and from Vasu by Vrihadratha, and from\r\nthe latter in due course by king Jarasandha. And he of long arms and eyes\r\nlike lotus-petals and possessed of illustrious reputation, coming out of\r\nGirivraja, stopped (for some time) on a level plain outside the town.\r\nAnd, O king, all the citizens then, with the Brahmanas at their head,\r\nhastened thither to adore him with due religious rites. And the kings who\r\nhad been released from confinement worshipped the slayer of Madhu with\r\nreverence, and addressing him with eulogies said,--O thou of long arms,\r\nthou hast to-day rescued us, sunk in the deep mire of sorrow in the hand\r\nof Jarasandha. Such an act of virtue by thee, O son of Devaki, assisted\r\nby the might of Bhima and Arjuna, is most extraordinary. O Vishnu,\r\nlanguishing as we all were in the terrible hill-fort of Jarasandha, it\r\nwas verily from sheer good fortune alone that thou hast rescued us, O son\r\nof the Yadu race, and achieved thereby a remarkable reputation. O tiger\r\namong men, we bow down to thee. O, command us what we shall do. However\r\ndifficult of accomplishment, thy command being made known to us, O lord\r\n(Krishna), it will at once be accomplished by us. Thus addressed by the\r\nmonarchs, the high-souled Hrishikesa gave them every assurance and\r\nsaid,--'Yudhishthira is desirous of performing the sacrifice of Rajasuya.\r\nThat monarch, ever guided by virtue, is solicitous of acquiring the\r\nimperial dignity. Having known this from me assist ye him in his\r\nendeavours. Then, O king, all those monarchs with joyous hearts accepted\r\nthe words of Krishna, saying,--'So be it! And saying this, those lords of\r\nearth made presents of jewels unto him of the Dasarha race. And Govinda,\r\nmoved by kindness towards them, took a portion of those presents,\r\n\r\n\"Then the son of Jarasandha, the high-souled Sahadeva, accompanied by his\r\nrelatives and the principal officers of state, and with his priest in\r\nfront came thither. And the prince, bending himself low and making large\r\npresents of jewels and precious stones, worshipped Vasudeva, that god\r\namong men. Then that best of men, Krishna, giving every assurance unto\r\nthe prince afflicted with fear, accepted those presents of his of great\r\nvalue. And Krishna joyfully installed the prince there and then in the\r\nsovereignty of Magadha. And the strong-armed and illustrious son of\r\nJarasandha, thus installed on the throne by those most exalted of men and\r\nhaving obtained the friendship of Krishna and treated with respect and\r\nkindness by the two sons of Pritha, re-entered the city of his father.\r\nAnd that bull amongst men, Krishna, accompanied by the sons of Pritha and\r\ngraced with great good fortune, left the city of Magadha, laden with\r\nnumerous jewels. Accompanied by the two sons of Pandu, Achyuta (Krishna)\r\narrived at Indraprastha, and approaching Yudhishthira joyfully addressing\r\nthat monarch said,--'O best of kings, from good fortune, the mighty\r\nJarasandha hath been slain by Bhima, and the kings confined (at\r\nGirivraja) have been all set free. From good fortune also, these two,\r\nBhima and Dhananjaya, are well and arrived, O Bharata, it their own city\r\nunwounded. Then Yudhishthira worshipped Krishna as he deserved and\r\nembraced Bhima and Arjuna in joy. And the monarch who had no enemy,\r\nhaving obtained victory through the agency of his brothers in consequence\r\nof the death of Jarasandha, gave himself up to pleasure and merriment\r\nwith all his brothers. And the oldest son of Pandu (Yudhisthira) together\r\nwith his brothers approached the kings who had come to Indraprastha and\r\nentertaining and worshipping them, each according to his age, dismissed\r\nthem all. Commanded by Yudhishthira those kings with joyful hearts, set\r\nout for their respective countries without loss of time, riding upon\r\nexcellent vehicles. Thus, O king, did that tiger among men. Janardana of\r\ngreat intelligence, caused his foe Jarasandha to be slain through the\r\ninstrumentality of the Pandavas. And, O Bharata, that chastiser of all\r\nfoes having thus caused Jarasandha to be slain, took leave of\r\nYudhishthira and Pritha, and Draupadi and Subhadra, and Bhimasena and\r\nArjuna and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva. After taking leave of\r\nDhananjaya also, he set out for his own city (of Dwarka), riding upon\r\nthat best of cars of celestial make, possessed of the speed of the mind\r\nand given unto him by Yudhishthira, filling the ten points of the horizon\r\nwith the deep rattle of its wheels. And, O bull of the Bharata race, just\r\nas Krishna was on the point of setting out, the Pandavas with\r\nYudhishthira at their head walked round that tiger among men who was\r\nnever fatigued with exertion.'\r\n\r\n\"And after the illustrious Krishna, the son of Devaki, had departed (from\r\nIndraprastha) having acquired that great victory and having also\r\ndispelled the fears of the kings, that feat, O Bharata, swelled the fame\r\nof the Pandavas. And, O king, the Pandavas passed their days, continuing\r\nto gladden the heart of Draupadi. And at that time, whatever was proper\r\nand consistent with virtue, pleasure, and profit, continued to be\r\nproperly executed by king Yudhishthira in the exercise of his duties of\r\nprotecting his subjects.\""

And having thus subjugated the king of Pragjyotisha,\r\nDhananjaya of long arms, the son of Kunti, then marched towards the\r\nnorth--the direction presided over by the lord of treasures. That bull\r\namongst men, that son of Kunti, then conquered the mountainous tracts and\r\ntheir outskirts, as also the hilly regions. And having conquered all the\r\nmountains and the kings that reigned there, and bringing them under his\r\nsway, he exacted tributes from all. And winning the affections of those\r\nkings and uniting himself with them, he next marched, O king, against\r\nVrihanta, the king of Uluka, making this earth tremble with the sound of\r\nhis drums, the clatter of his chariot-wheels, and the roar of the\r\nelephants in his train. Vrihanta, however, quickly coming out of his city\r\nfollowed by his army consisting of four kinds of troops, gave battle to\r\nFalguna (Arjuna). And the fight that took place between Vrihanta and\r\nDhananjaya was terrible. It so happened that Vrihanta was unable to bear\r\nthe prowess of the son of Pandu. Then that invincible king of the\r\nmountainous region regarding the son of Kunti irresistible, approached\r\nhim with all his wealth. Arjuna snatched out the kingdom from Vrihanta,\r\nbut having made peace with him marched, accompanied by that king, against\r\nSenavindu whom he soon expelled from his kingdom. After this he\r\nsubjugated Modapura, Vamadeva, Sudaman, Susankula, the Northern Ulukas,\r\nand the kings of those countries and peoples. Hereafter at the command of\r\nYudhishthira, O monarch, Arjuna, did not move from the city of Senavindu\r\nbut sent his troops only and brought under his sway those five countries\r\nand peoples. For Arjuna, having arrived at Devaprastha, the city of\r\nSenavindu, took up his quarters there with his army consisting of four\r\nkinds of forces. Thence, surrounded by the kings and the peoples he had\r\nsubjugated, the hero marched against king Viswagaswa--that bull of Puru's\r\nrace. Having vanquished in battle the brave mountaineers, who were all\r\ngreat warriors, the son of Pandu, O king, then occupied with the help of\r\nhis troops, the town protected by the Puru king. Having vanquished in\r\nbattle the Puru king, as also the robber tribes, of the mountains, the\r\nson of Pandu brought under his sway the seven tribes called\r\nUtsava-sanketa. That bull of the Kshatriya race then defeated the brave\r\nKshatriyas of Kashmira and also king Lohita along with ten minor chiefs.\r\nThen the Trigartas, the Daravas, the Kokonadas, and various other\r\nKshatriyas, O king, advanced against the son of Pandu. That Prince of the\r\nKuru race then took the delightful town of Avisari, and then brought\r\nunder his sway Rochamana ruling in Uraga. Then the son of Indra (Arjuna),\r\nputting forth his might, pressed the delightful town of Singhapura that\r\nwas well-protected with various weapons. Then Arjuna, that bull amongst\r\nthe son of Pandu, at the head of all his troops, fiercely attacked the\r\nregions called Suhma and Sumala. Then the son of Indra, endued with great\r\nprowess, after pressing them with great force, brought the Valhikas\r\nalways difficult of being vanquished, under his sway. Then Falguna, the\r\nson of Pandu, taking with him a select force, defeated the Daradas along\r\nwith the Kambojas. Then the exalted son of Indra vanquished the robber\r\ntribes that dwelt in the north-eastern frontier and those also that dwelt\r\nin the woods. And, O great king, the son of Indra also subjugated the\r\nallied tribes of the Lohas, the eastern Kambojas, and northern Rishikas.\r\nAnd the battle with the Rishikas was fierce in the extreme. Indeed, the\r\nfight that took place between them and the son of Pritha was equal to\r\nthat between the gods and the Asuras in which Taraka (the wife of\r\nVrihaspati) had become the cause of so much slaughter. And defeating, O\r\nking, the Rishikas in the field of battle, Arjuna took from them as\r\ntribute eight horses that were of the colour of the parrot's breast, as\r\nalso other horses of the hues of the peacock, born in northern and other\r\nclimes and endued with high speed.

And then he beheld the celebrated caves of Kishkindhya and in that\r\nregion fought for seven days with the monkey-kings Mainda and Dwivida.\r\nThose illustrious kings however, without being tired an the encounter,\r\nwere gratified with Sahadeva.

Let the mission of the king Yudhishthira the just\r\npossessed of great intelligence, be accomplished without hindrance. And\r\ntaking jewels and gems from them all, the hero marched towards the city\r\nof Mahishmati, and there that bull of men did battle with king Nila. The\r\nbattle that took place between king Nila and the mighty Sahadeva the son\r\nof Pandu, that slayer of hostile heroes, was fierce and terrible. And the\r\nencounter was an exceedingly bloody one, and the life of the hero himself\r\nwas exposed to great risk, for the god Agni himself assisted king Nila in\r\nthat fight. Then the cars, heroes, elephants, and the soldiers in their\r\ncoats of mail of Sahadeva's army all appeared to be on fire. And\r\nbeholding this the prince of the Kuru race became exceedingly anxious.\r\nAnd, O Janamejaya, at sight of this the hero could not resolve upon what\r\nhe should do.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said,--O regenerate one, why was it that the god Agni become\r\nhostile in battle unto Sahadeva, who was fighting simply for the\r\naccomplishment of a sacrifice (and therefore, for the gratification of\r\nAgni himself)?\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--'It is said, O Janamejaya, that the god Agni while\r\nresiding in Mahishmati, earned the reputation of a lover. King Nila had a\r\ndaughter who was exceedingly beautiful. She used always to stay near the\r\nsacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And it so\r\nhappened that king Nila's fire, even if fanned, would not blaze up till\r\nagitated by the gentle breath of that girl's fair lips. And it was said\r\nin King Nila's palace and in the house of all his subjects that the god\r\nAgni desired that beautiful girl for his bride. And it so happened that\r\nhe was accepted by the girl herself. One day the deity assuming the form\r\nof a Brahmana, was happily enjoying the society of the fair one, when he\r\nwas discovered by the king. And the virtuous king thereupon ordered the\r\nBrahmana to be punished according to law. At this the illustrious deity\r\nflamed up in wrath. And beholding this, the king wondered much and bent\r\nhis head low on the ground. And after some time the king bowing low\r\nbestowed the daughter of his upon the god Agni, disguised as a Brahmana.\r\nAnd the god Vibhabasu (Agni) accepting that fair-browed daughter of king\r\nNila, became gracious unto that monarch. And Agni, the illustrious\r\ngratifier of all desires also asked the monarch to beg a boon of him. And\r\nthe king begged that his troops might never be struck with panic while\r\nengaged in battle. And from that time, O king, those monarchs who from\r\nignorance of this, desire to subjugate king Nila's city, are consumed by\r\nHutasana (Agni). And from that time, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, the\r\ngirls of the city of Mahishmati became rather unacceptable to others (as\r\nwives). And Agni by his boon granted them sexual liberty, so that the\r\nwomen of that town always roam about at will, each unbound to a\r\nparticular husband. And, O bull of the Bharata race, from that time the\r\nmonarchs (of other countries) forsake this city for fear of Agni. And the\r\nvirtuous Sahadeva, beholding his troops afflicted with fear and\r\nsurrounded by flames of fire, himself stood there immovable as a\r\nmountain. And purifying himself and touching water, the hero (Sahadeva)\r\nthen addressed Agni, the god that sanctifieth everything, in these\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n'I bow unto thee, O thou whose track is always marked with smoke. These\r\nmy exertions are all for thee. O thou sanctifier of all, thou art the\r\nmouth of the gods and thou art Sacrifice personified. Thou art called\r\nPavaka because thou sanctifiest everything, and thou art Havyavahana,\r\nbecause thou carriest the clarified butter that is poured on thee. The\r\nVeda have sprung for ministering unto thee, and, therefore, thou art\r\ncalled Jataveda. Chief of the gods as thou art, thou art called\r\nChitrabhanu, Anala, Vibhavasu, Hutasana, Jvalana, Sikhi, Vaiswanara,\r\nPingesa, Plavanga, Bhuritejah. Thou art he from whom Kumara (Kartikeya)\r\nhad his origin; thou art holy; thou art called Rudragarva and\r\nHiranyakrit. Let thee, O Agni, grant me energy, let Vayu grant me life,\r\nlet Earth grant me nourishment and strength, and let Water grant me\r\nprosperity. O Agni, thou who art the first cause of the waters, thou who\r\nart of great purity, thou for ministering unto whom the Vedas have\r\nsprung, thou who art the foremost of the deities, thou who art their\r\nmouth, O purify me by thy truth. Rishis and Brahmanas, Deities and Asuras\r\npour clarified butter every day, according to the ordinance into thee\r\nduring sacrifices. Let the rays of truth emanating from thee, while thou\r\nexhibitest thyself in those sacrifices, purify me. Smoke-bannered as thou\r\nart and possessed of flames, thou great purifier from all sins born of\r\nVayu and ever present as thou art in all creatures, O purify me by the\r\nrays of thy truth. Having cleansed myself thus cheerfully, O exalted one,\r\ndo I pray unto thee. O Agni, grant me now contentment and prosperity, and\r\nknowledge and gladness.\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued.--'He that will pour clarified butter into Agni\r\nreciting these mantras, will ever be blessed with prosperity, and having\r\nhis soul under complete control will also be cleansed from all his sins.\r\n\r\n\"Sahadeva, addressing Agni again, said,--'O carrier of the sacrificial\r\nlibations, it behoveth thee not to obstruct a sacrifice!' Having said\r\nthis, that tiger among men--the son of Madri--spreading some kusa grass\r\non earth sat down in expectation of the (approaching) fire and in front\r\nof those terrified and anxious troops of his. And Agni, too, like the\r\nocean that never transgresseth its continents, did not pass over his\r\nhead. On the other hand approaching Sahadeva quietly and addressing that\r\nprince of the Kuru race, Agni that god of men gave him every assurance\r\nand said,--'O thou of the Kuru race, rise up from this posture. O rise\r\nup, I was only trying thee. I know all thy purpose, as also those of the\r\nson of Dharma (Yudhisthira). But, O best of the Bharata race, as long as\r\nthere is a descendant of king Nila's line, so long should this town be\r\nprotected by me. I will, however O son of Pandu, gratify the desires of\r\nthy heart. And at these words of Agni, O bull of the Bharata race, the\r\nson of Madri rose up with a cheerful heart, and joining his hands and\r\nbending his head worshipped that god of fire, sanctifier of all beings.\r\nAnd at last, after Agni had disappeared, king Nila came there, and at the\r\ncommand of that deity, worshipped with due rites Sahadeva, that tiger\r\namong men--that master of battle. And Sahadeva accepted that worship and\r\nmade him pay tribute. And having brought king Nila under his sway thus,\r\nthe victorious son of Madri then went further towards the south. The\r\nlong-armed hero then brought the king of Tripura of immeasurable energy\r\nunder his sway. And next turning his forces against the Paurava kingdom,\r\nhe vanquished and reduced to subjection the monarch thereof. And the\r\nprince, after this, with great efforts brought Akriti, the king of\r\nSaurashtra and preceptor of the Kausikas under his sway. The virtuous\r\nprince, while staying in the kingdom of Saurashtra sent an ambassador\r\nunto king Rukmin of Bhishmaka within the territories of Bhojakata, who,\r\nrich in possessions and intelligence, was the friend of Indra himself.\r\nAnd the monarch along with his son, remembering their relationship with\r\nKrishna, cheerfully accepted, O king, the sway of the son of Pandu. And\r\nthe master of battle then, having exacted jewels and wealth from king\r\nRukmin, marched further to the south. And, endued with great energy and\r\ngreat strength, the hero then, reduced to subjection, Surparaka and\r\nTalakata, and the Dandakas also. The Kuru warrior then vanquished and\r\nbrought under his subjection numberless kings of the Mlechchha tribe\r\nliving on the sea coast, and the Nishadas and the cannibals and even the\r\nKarnapravarnas, and those tribes also called the Kalamukhas who were a\r\ncross between human beings and Rakshasas, and the whole of the Cole\r\nmountains, and also Surabhipatna, and the island called the Copper\r\nisland, and the mountain called Ramaka. The high-souled warrior, having\r\nbrought under subjection king Timingila, conquered a wild tribe known by\r\nthe name of the Kerakas who were men with one leg. The son of Pandu also\r\nconquered the town of Sanjayanti and the country of the Pashandas and the\r\nKarahatakas by means of his messengers alone, and made all of them pay\r\ntributes to him. The hero brought under his subjection and exacted\r\ntributes from the Paundrayas and the Dravidas along with the Udrakeralas\r\nand the Andhras and the Talavanas, the Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas,\r\nand also the delightful city of Atavi and that of the Yavanas. And, O\r\nking of kings, that slayer of all foes, the virtuous and intelligent son\r\nof Madri having arrived at the sea-shore, then despatched with great\r\nassurance messengers unto the illustrious Vibhishana, the grandson of\r\nPulastya. And the monarch willingly accepted the sway of the son of\r\nPandu, for that intelligent and exalted king regarded it all as the act\r\nof Time. And he sent unto the son of Pandu diverse kinds of jewels and\r\ngems, and sandal and also wood, and many celestial ornaments, and much\r\ncostly apparel, and many valuable pearls. And the intelligent Sahadeva,\r\naccepting them all, returned to his own kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"Thus it was, O king, that slayer of all foes, having vanquished by\r\nconciliation and war numerous kings and having also made them pay\r\ntribute, came back to his own city. The bull of the Bharata race, having\r\npresented the whole of that wealth unto king Yudhisthira the just\r\nregarded himself, O Janamejaya, as crowned with success and continued to\r\nlive happily.\""

The intelligent Nakula, surrounded by a\r\nlarge host, set out from Khandavaprastha for the west, making this earth\r\ntremble with the shouts and the leonine roars of the warriors and the\r\ndeep rattle of chariot wheels. And the hero first assailed the\r\nmountainous country called Rohitaka that was dear unto (the celestial\r\ngeneralissimo) Kartikeya and which was delightful and prosperous and full\r\nof kine and every kind of wealth and produce. And the encounter the son\r\nof Pandu had with the Mattamyurakas of that country was fierce. And the\r\nillustrious Nakula after this, subjugated the whole of the desert country\r\nand the region known as Sairishaka full of plenty, as also that other one\r\ncalled Mahetta. And the hero had a fierce encounter with the royal sage\r\nAkrosa. And the son of Pandu left that part of the country having\r\nsubjugated the Dasarnas, the Sivis, the Trigartas, the Amvashtas, the\r\nMalavas, the five tribes of the Karnatas, and those twice born classes\r\nthat were called the Madhyamakeyas and Vattadhanas. And making circuitous\r\njourney that bull among men then conquered the (Mlechcha) tribes called\r\nthe Utsava-sanketas. And the illustrious hero soon brought under\r\nsubjection the mighty Gramaniya that dwelt on the shore of the sea, and\r\nthe Sudras and the Abhiras that dwelt on the banks of the Saraswati, and\r\nall those tribes that lived upon fisheries, and those also that dwelt on\r\nthe mountains, and the whole of the country called after the five rivers,\r\nand the mountains called Amara, and the country called Uttarayotisha and\r\nthe city of Divyakutta and the tribe called Dwarapala. And the son of\r\nPandu, by sheer force, reduced to subjection the Ramathas, the Harahunas,\r\nand various kings of the west. And while staying there Nakula sent. O\r\nBharata, messengers unto Vasudeva. And Vasudeva with all the Yadavas\r\naccepted his sway. And the mighty hero, proceeding thence to Sakala, the\r\ncity of the Madras, made his uncle Salya accept from affection the sway\r\nof the Pandavas. And, O monarch, the illustrious prince deserving the\r\nhospitality and entertainment at his uncle's hands, was well entertained\r\nby his uncle. And skilled in war, the prince, taking from Salya a large\r\nquantity of jewels and gems, left his kingdom. And the son of Pandu then\r\nreduced to subjection the fierce Mlechchas residing on the sea coast, as\r\nalso the wild tribes of the Palhavas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the\r\nSakas. And having subjugated various monarchs, and making all of them pay\r\ntributes, Nakula that foremost of the Kurus, full of resources, retraced\r\nhis way towards his own city. And, O king, so great was the treasure\r\nwhich Nakula brought that ten thousand camels could carry it with\r\ndifficulty on their backs. And arriving at Indraprastha, the heroic and\r\nfortunate son of Madri presented the whole of that wealth unto\r\nYudhishthira.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, O king, did Nakula subjugate the countries that lay to the\r\nwest--the direction that is presided over by the god Varuna, and that had\r\nonce before been subjugated by Vasudeva himself!\""

And by reason of the equitable taxation and the virtuous rule\r\nof the monarch, clouds in his kingdom poured as much rain as the people\r\ndesired, and the cities and the town became highly prosperous. Indeed as\r\na consequence of the monarch's acts; every affair of the kingdom,\r\nespecially cattle bleeding, agriculture and trade prospered highly. O\r\nking, during those days even robbers and cheats never spoke lies amongst\r\nthemselves, nor they that were the favourites of the monarch. There were\r\nno droughts and floods and plagues and fires and premature deaths in\r\nthose days of Yudhishthira devoted to virtue. And it was only for doing\r\nagreeable services, or for worshipping, or for offering tributes that\r\nwould not impoverish, that other kings used to approach Yudhisthira (and\r\nnot for hostility or battle.) The large treasure room of the king became\r\nso much filled with hoards of wealth virtuously obtained that it could\r\nnot be emptied even in a hundred years. And the son of Kunti,\r\nascertaining the state of his treasury and the extent of his possessions,\r\nfixed his heart upon the celebration of a sacrifice. His friends and\r\nofficers, each separately and all together, approaching him said,--'The\r\ntime hath come, O exalted one, for thy sacrifice. Let arrangements,\r\ntherefore, be made without loss of time.' While they were thus talking,\r\nHari (Krishna), that omniscient and ancient one, that soul of the Vedas,\r\nthat invincible one as described by those that have knowledge, that\r\nforemost of all lasting existences in the universe, that origin of all\r\nthings, as also that in which all things come to be dissolved, that lord\r\nof the past, the future, and the present Kesava--the slayer of Kesi, and\r\nthe bulwark of all Vrishnis and the dispeller of all fear in times of\r\ndistress and the smiter of all foes, having appointed Vasudeva to the\r\ncommand of the (Yadava) army, and bringing with him for the king\r\nYudhishthira just a large mass of treasure; entered that excellent city\r\nof cities. Khandava, himself surrounded by a mighty host and filling the\r\natmosphere with the rattle of his chariot-wheels. And Madhava, that tiger\r\namong men enhancing that limitless mass of wealth the Pandavas had by\r\nthat inexhaustible ocean of gems he had brought, enhanced the sorrows of\r\nthe enemies of the Pandavas. The capital of the Bharata was gladdened by\r\nKrishna's presence just as a dark region is rendered joyful by the sun or\r\na region of still air by a gentle breeze. Approaching him joyfully and\r\nreceiving him with due respect, Yudhishthira enquired of his welfare. And\r\nafter Krishna had been seated at ease, that bull among men, the son of\r\nPandu, with Dhaumya and Dwaipayana and the other sacrificial priests and\r\nwith Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, addressed Krishna thus,--\r\n\r\n'O Krishna it is for thee that the whole earth is under my sway. And, O\r\nthou of the Vrishni race, it is through thy grace that vast wealth had\r\nbeen got by me. And, O son of Devaki, O Madhava, I desire to devote that\r\nwealth according to the ordinance, unto superior Brahmanas and the\r\ncarrier of sacrificial libations. And, O thou of the Dasarha race, it\r\nbehoveth thee, O thou of mighty arms, to grant me permission to celebrate\r\na sacrifice along with thee and my younger brothers. Therefore, O\r\nGovinda, O thou of long arms, install thyself at that sacrifice; for, O\r\nthou of the Dasarha race, if thou performed the sacrifice, I shall be\r\ncleansed of sin. Or, O exalted one, grant permission for myself being\r\ninstalled at the sacrifice along with these my younger brothers, for\r\npermitted by thee, O Krishna. I shall be able to enjoy the fruit of an\r\nexcellent sacrifice.\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Unto Yudhisthira after he had said this,\r\nKrishna, extolling his virtues, said.--'Thou, O tiger among kings,\r\ndeservest imperial dignity. Let, therefore, the great sacrifice be\r\nperformed by thee. And if thou performest that sacrifice an obtainest its\r\nfruit we all shall regard ourselves as crowned with success. I am always\r\nengaged in seeking good. Perform thou then the sacrifice thou desirest.\r\nEmploy me also in some office for that purpose, for I should obey all thy\r\ncommands. Yudhisthira replied--O Krishna, my resolve is already crowned\r\nwith fruit, and success also is surely mine, when thou, O Harishikesa,\r\nhast arrived here agreeably to my wish!'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Commanded by Krishna, the son of Pandu along\r\nwith his brothers set himself upon collecting the materials for the\r\nperformance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. And that chastiser of all foes,\r\nthe son of Pandu, then commanded Sahadeva that foremost of all warriors\r\nand all ministers also, saying,--Let persons be appointed to collect\r\nwithout loss of time, all those articles which the Brahmanas have\r\ndirected as necessary for the performance of this sacrifice, and all\r\nmaterials and auspicious necessaries that Dhaumya may order as required\r\nfor it, each of the kind needed and one after another in due order. Let\r\nIndrasena and Visoka and Puru with Arjuna for his charioteer be engaged\r\nto collect food if they are to please me. Let these foremost of the Kurus\r\nalso gather every article of agreeable taste and smell that may delight\r\nand attract the hearts of the Brahmanas.'\r\n\r\n\"Simultaneously with these words of king Yudhisthira the just, Sahadeva\r\nthat foremost of warriors, having accomplished everything, represented\r\nthe matter to the king. And Dwaipayana, O king, then appointed as\r\nsacrificial priests exalted Brahmanas that were like the Vedas themselves\r\nin embodied forms. The son of Satyavati became himself the Brahma of that\r\nsacrifice. And that bull of the Dhananjaya race, Susaman, became the\r\nchanter of the Vedic (Sama) hymns. Yajnavalkya devoted to Brahma became\r\nthe Adhyaryu, and Paila--the son of Vasu and Dhaumya became the Hotris.\r\nAnd O bull of the Bharata race, the disciples and the sons of these men,\r\nall well-acquainted with the Vedas and the branches of the Vedas, became\r\nHotragts. And all of them, having uttered benedictions and recited the\r\nobject of the sacrifice, worshipped, according to the ordinance the large\r\nsacrificial compound. Commanded by the Brahmanas, builders and artificers\r\nerected numerous edifices there that were spacious and well-perfumed like\r\nunto the temples of the gods. After these were finished, that best of\r\nkings and that bull among men Yudhishthira. commanded his chief adviser\r\nSahadeva, saying,--'Despatch thou, without loss of time, messengers\r\nendued with speed to invite all to the sacrifice. And Sahadeva, hearing\r\nthese words of the king, despatched messengers telling them,--'Invite ye\r\nall the Brahmanas in the kingdom and all the owners of land (Kshatriyas)\r\nand all the Vaisyas and also all the respectable Sudras, and bring them\r\nhither!'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Endued with speed, these messengers then, thus\r\ncommanded, invited everybody according to the orders of the Pandava,\r\nwithout losing any time, and brought with them many persons, both friends\r\nand strangers. Then, O Bharata, the Brahmanas at the proper time\r\ninstalled Yudhishthira the son of Kunti at the Rajasuya sacrifice. And\r\nafter the ceremony of installation was over, that foremost of men, the\r\nvirtuous king Yudhishthira the just like the god Dharma himself in human\r\nframe, entered the sacrificial compound, surrounded by thousands of\r\nBrahmanas and his brothers and the relatives and friends and counsellors,\r\nand by a large number of Kshatriya kings who had come from various\r\ncountries, and by the officers of State. Numerous Brahmanas, well-skilled\r\nin all branches of knowledge and versed in the Vedas and their several\r\nbranches, began to pour in from various countries. Thousands of\r\ncraftsmen, at the command of king Yudhishthira the just, erected for\r\nthose Brahmanas with their attendants separate habitations well-provided\r\nwith food and clothes and the fruits and flowers of every season. And, O\r\nking, duly worshipped by the monarch the Brahmanas continued to reside\r\nthere passing their time in conversation on diverse topics and beholding\r\nthe performances of actors and dancers. And the clamour of high-souled\r\nBrahmanas, cheerfully eating and talking, was heard there without\r\nintermission. 'Give,' and 'Eat' were the words that were heard there\r\nincessantly and every day. And, O Bharata, king Yudhishthira the just\r\ngave unto each of those Brahmanas thousands of kine and beds and gold\r\ncoins and damsels.\r\n\r\nThus commenced on earth the sacrifice of that unrivalled hero, the\r\nillustrious son of Pandu, like the sacrifice in heaven of Sakra himself.\r\nThen that bull among men, king Yudhishthira despatched Nakula the son of\r\nPandu unto Hastinapura to bring Bhishma and Drona, Dhritarashtra and\r\nVidura and Kripa and those amongst his cousins that were well-disposed\r\ntowards him.\""

And\r\nthose illustrious Rishis with Narada as their foremost, seated at their\r\nease with those royal sages within that enclosure, looked like the gods\r\nseated in the mansion of Brahma in the company of the celestial Rishis.\r\nEndued with immeasurable energy those Rishis, having obtained leisure,\r\nstarted various topics of conversation. 'This is so,' 'This is not so,'\r\n'This is even so.' 'This cannot be otherwise,'--thus did many of them\r\nengage in discussions with one another. Some amongst the disputants, by\r\nwell-chosen arguments made the weaker position appear the stronger and\r\nthe stronger the weaker. Some disputants endued with great intelligence\r\nfell upon the position urged by others like hawks darting at meat thrown\r\nup into the air, while some amongst them versed in the interpretations of\r\nreligious treatises and others of rigid vows, and well-acquainted with\r\nevery commentary and gloss engaged themselves in pleasant converse. And,\r\nO king, that platform crowded with gods, Brahmanas and great Rishis\r\nlooked extremely handsome like the wide expanse of the firmament studded\r\nwith stars. O monarch, there was then no Sudra near that platform of\r\nYudhisthira's mansion, nor anybody that was without vows.\r\n\r\n\"And Narada, beholding the fortunate Yudhisthira's prosperity that was\r\nborn of that sacrifice, became highly gratified. Beholding that vast\r\nconcourse all the Kshatriyas, the Muni Narada, O king of men, became\r\nthoughtful. And, O bull amongst men, the Rishi began to recollect the\r\nwords he had heard of old in the mansion of Brahma regarding the\r\nincarnation on earth of portions of every deity. And knowing, O son of\r\nthe Kuru race, that that was a concourse (of incarnate) gods, Narada\r\nthought in his mind of Hari with eyes like lotus-petals. He knew that\r\nthat creator himself of every object one, that exalted of all\r\ngods--Narayana--who had formerly commanded the celestials, saying,--'Be\r\nye born on earth and slay one another and come back to heaven'--that\r\nslayer of all the enemies of the gods, that subjugator of all hostile\r\ntowns, in order to fulfil his own promise, had been born in the Kshatriya\r\norder. And Narada knew that the exalted and holy Narayana, also called\r\nSambhu the lord of the universe, having commanded all the celestials\r\nthus, had taken his birth in the race of Yadus and that foremost of all\r\nperpetuator of races, having sprung from the line of the Andhaka-Vrishnis\r\non earth was graced with great good fortune and was shining like the moon\r\nherself among stars. Narada knew that Hari the grinder of foes, whose\r\nstrength of arm was ever praised by all the celestials with Indra among\r\nthem, was then living in the world in human form. Oh, the Self-Create\r\nwill himself take away (from the earth) this vast concourse of Kshatriyas\r\nendued with so much strength. Such was the vision of Narada the\r\nomniscient who knew Hari or Narayana to be that Supreme Lord whom\r\neverybody worshipped with sacrifice. And Narada, gifted with great\r\nintelligence and the foremost of all persons and conversant with\r\nmorality, thinking of all this, sat at that sacrifice of the wise king\r\nYudhisthira the just with feelings of awe.\r\n\r\n\"Then Bhishma, O king, addressing king Yudhisthira the just, said, \"O\r\nBharata, let Arghya (an article of respect) be offered unto the kings as\r\neach of them deserveth. Listen, O Yudhishthira, the preceptor, the\r\nsacrificial priest, the relative, the Snataka, the friend, and the king,\r\nit hath been said are the six that deserve Arghya. The wise have said\r\nthat when any of these dwell with one for full one year he deserveth to\r\nbe worshipped with Arghya. These kings have been staying with us for some\r\ntime. Therefore, O king, let Arghyas be procured to be offered unto each\r\nof them. And let an Arghya be presented first of all unto him among those\r\npresent who is the foremost.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Bhishma, Yudhishthira said--'O Grandsire, O thou\r\nof the Kuru race, whom thou deemest the foremost amongst these and unto\r\nwhom the Arghya should be presented by us, O tell me.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--Then, O Bharata, Bhishma the son of Santanu,\r\njudged it by his intelligence that on earth Krishna was the foremost of\r\nall. And he said--'As is the sun among all luminous objects, so is the\r\none (meaning Krishna) (who shines like the sun) among us all, in\r\nconsequence of his energy, strength and prowess. And this our sacrificial\r\nmansion is illuminated and gladdened by him as a sunless region by the\r\nsun, or a region of still air by a gust of breeze. Thus commanded by\r\nBhishma, Sahadeva endued with great prowess duly presented the first\r\nArghya of excellent ingredients unto Krishna of the Vrishni race. Krishna\r\nalso accepted it according to the forms of the ordinance. But Sisupala\r\ncould not bear to see that worship offered unto Vasudeva. And this mighty\r\nking of Chedi, reproving in the midst of that assembly both Bhishma and.\r\nYudhishthira, censured Vasudeva thereafter.\""

O son of Pandu, this conduct of thine in thus\r\nwillingly worshipping him with eyes like lotus-petals is not worthy of\r\nthe illustrious Pandavas. Ye sons of Pandu. Ye are children. Ye know not\r\nwhat morality is, for that is very subtle. Bhishma, this son also of\r\nGanga is of little knowledge and hath transgressed the rules of morality\r\n(by giving ye such counsel). And, O Bhishma, if one like thee, possessed\r\nof virtue and morality acteth from motives of interest, he is deserving\r\nof censure among the honest and the wise. How doth he of the Dasarha\r\nrace, who is not even a king, accept worship before these kings and how\r\nis it that he hath been worshipped by ye? O bull of the Kuru race, if\r\nthou regardest Krishna as the oldest in age, here is Vasudeva, and how\r\ncan his son be said so in his presence? Or, if thou regardest Vasudeva as\r\nyour well-wisher and supporter, here is Drupada; how then can Madhava\r\ndeserve the (first) worship? Or, O son of Kuru, regardest thou Krishna as\r\npreceptor? When Drona is here, how hast thou worshipped him of the\r\nVrishni race? Or, O son of Kuru, regardest thou Krishna as the Ritwija?\r\nWhen old Dwaipayana is here, how hath Krishna been worshipped by thee?\r\nAgain when old Bhishma, the son of Santanu, that foremost of men who is\r\nnot to die save at his own wish is here, why, O king, hath Krishna been\r\nworshipped by thee? When the brave Aswatthaman, versed in every branch of\r\nknowledge is here, why, O king, hath Krishna, O thou of the Kuru race,\r\nbeen worshipped by thee? When that King of kings, Duryyodhana, that\r\nforemost of men, is here, as also Kripa the preceptor of the Bharata\r\nprinces, why hath Krishna been worshipped by thee? How, O son of Pandu,\r\npassing over Druma, the preceptor of the Kimpurusas, hast thou worshipped\r\nKrishna? When the invincible Bhishmaka and king Pandya possessed of every\r\nauspicious mark, and that foremost of kings--Rukmi and Ekalavya and\r\nSalya, the king of the Madras, are here, how, O son of Pandu, hast thou\r\noffered the first worship unto Krishna? Here also is Karna ever boasting\r\nof his strength amongst all kings, and (really) endued with great might,\r\nthe favourite disciple of the Brahmana Jamadagnya, the hero who\r\nvanquished in battle all monarchs by his own strength alone. How, O\r\nBharata, hast thou, passing him over, offered the first worship unto\r\nKrishna? The slayer of Madhu is neither a sacrificial priest nor a\r\npreceptor, nor a king. That thou hast notwithstanding all these\r\nworshipped him, O chief of the Kurus, could only have been from motives\r\nof gain. If, O Bharata, it was your wish to offer the first worship unto\r\nthe slayer of Madhu, why were these monarchs brought here to be insulted\r\nthus? We have not paid tributes to the illustrious son of Kunti from\r\nfear, from desire of gain, or from having been won over by conciliation.\r\nOn the other hand, we have paid him tribute simply because he hath been\r\ndesirous of the imperial dignity from motives of virtue. And yet he it is\r\nthat thus insulteth us. O king, from what else, save motives of insult,\r\ncould it have been that thou hast worshipped Krishna, who possesseth not\r\nthe insignia of royalty, with the Arghya in the midst of the assembled\r\nmonarchs? Indeed, the reputation for virtue that the son of Dharma hath\r\nacquired, hath been acquired by him without cause, for who would offer\r\nsuch undue worship unto one that hath fallen off from virtue. This wretch\r\nborn in the race of the Vrishnis unrighteously slew of old the\r\nillustrious king Jarasandha. Righteousness hath today been abandoned by\r\nYudhishthira and meanness only hath been displayed by him in consequence\r\nof his having offered the Arghya to Krishna. If the helpless sons of\r\nKunti were affrighted and disposed to meanness, thou, O Madhava, ought to\r\nhave enlightened them as to thy claims to the first worship? Why also, O\r\nJanarddana, didst thou accept the worship of which thou art unworthy,\r\nalthough it was offered unto thee by those mean-minded princes? Thou\r\nthinkest much of the worship unworthily offered unto thee, like a dog\r\nthat lappeth in solitude a quantity of clarified butter that it hath\r\nobtained. O Janarddana, this is really no insult offered unto the\r\nmonarchs; on the other hand it is thou whom the Kurus have insulted.\r\nIndeed, O slayer of Madhu, as a wife is to one that is without virile\r\npower, as a fine show is to one that is blind, so is this royal worship\r\nto thee who art no king. What Yudhishthira is, hath been seen; what\r\nBhishma is, hath been seen; and what this Vasudeva is hath been seen.\r\nIndeed, all these have been seen as they are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Having spoken these words, Sisupala rose from his excellent seat, and\r\naccompanied by the kings, went out of that assembly.\""

O king, it is highly sinful and needlessly cruel. Insult\r\nnot Bhishma, O king, by saying that he doth not know what virtue is.\r\nBehold, these many kings, older than thou art, all approve of the worship\r\noffered unto Krishna. It behoveth thee to bear it patiently like them. O\r\nruler of Chedi, Bhishma knoweth Krishna truly. Thou knowest him not so\r\nwell as this one of the Kuru race.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma also, after this, said,--He that approveth not the worship\r\noffered unto Krishna, the oldest one in the universe, deserveth neither\r\nsoft words nor conciliation. The chief of warriors of the Kshatriya rare\r\nwho having overcome a Kshatriya in battle and brought him under his\r\npower, setteth him free, becometh the guru (preceptor or master) of the\r\nvanquished one. I do not behold in this assembly of kings even one ruler\r\nof men who hath not been vanquished in battle by the energy of this son\r\nof the Satwata race. This one (meaning Krishna) here, of undefiled glory,\r\ndeserveth to be worshipped not by ourselves alone, but being of mighty\r\narms, he deserveth to be worshipped by the three worlds also. Innumerable\r\nwarriors among Kshatriyas have been vanquished in battle by Krishna. The\r\nwhole universe without limit is established in him of the Vrishni race.\r\nTherefore do we worship Krishna amongst the best and the oldest, and not\r\nothers. It behoveth thee not to say so. Let thy understanding be never\r\nso. I have, O king, waited upon many persons that are old in knowledge. I\r\nhave heard from all those wise men, while talking; of the numerous\r\nmuch-regarded attributes of the accomplished Sauri. I have also heard\r\nmany times all the acts recited by people that Krishna of great\r\nintelligence hath performed since his birth. And, O king of Chedi, we do\r\nnot from caprice, or keeping in view our relationship or the benefits he\r\nmay confer on us, worship Janarddana who is worshipped by the good on\r\nearth and who is the source of the happiness of every creature. We have\r\noffered unto him the first worship because of his fame, his heroism, his\r\nsuccess. There is none here of even tender years whom we have not taken\r\ninto consideration. Passing over many persons that are foremost for their\r\nvirtues, we have regarded Hari as deserving of the first worship. Amongst\r\nthe Brahmanas one that is superior in knowledge, amongst the Kshatriyas\r\none that is superior in strength, amongst the Vaisyas one that is\r\nsuperior in possessions and wealth, and amongst the Sudras one that is\r\nsuperior in years, deserveth to be worshipped. In the matter of the\r\nworship offered unto Govinda, there are two reason, viz., knowledge of\r\nthe Vedas and their branches, and also excess of strength. Who else is\r\nthere in the world of men save Kesava that is so distinguished? Indeed,\r\nliberality, cleverness, knowledge of the Vedas, bravery, modesty,\r\nachievements, excellent intelligence, humility, beauty, firmness,\r\ncontentment and prosperity--all dwell for ever in Achyuta. Therefore, ye\r\nkings; it behoveth ye to approve of the worship that hath been offered\r\nunto Krishna who is of great accomplishments, who as the preceptor, the\r\nfather, the guru, is worthy of the Arghya and deserving of (everybody's)\r\nworship. Hrishikesa is the sacrificial priest, the guru, worthy of being\r\nsolicited to accept one's daughter in marriage, the Snataka, the king,\r\nthe friend: therefore hath Achyuta been worshipped by us. Krishna is the\r\norigin of the universe and that in which the universe is to dissolve.\r\nIndeed, this universe of mobile and immobile creatures hath sprung into\r\nexistence from Krishna only. He is the unmanifest primal cause (Avyakta\r\nPrakriti), the creator, the eternal, and beyond the ken of all creatures.\r\nTherefore doth he of unfading glory deserve highest worship. The\r\nintellect, the seat of sensibility, the five elements, air, heat, water,\r\nether, earth, and the four species of beings (oviparous, viviparous, born\r\nof filthy damp and vegetal) are all established in Krishna. The sun, the\r\nmoon, the constellations, the planets, all the principal directions, the\r\nintermediate directions, are all established in Krishna. As the Agnihotra\r\nis the foremost among all Vedic sacrifices, as the Gayatri is the\r\nforemost among metres, as the king is the foremost among men, as the\r\nocean is the foremost among all rivers, as the moon is the foremost among\r\nall constellations, as the sun is the foremost among all luminous bodies,\r\nas the Meru is the foremost among all mountains, as Garuda is the\r\nforemost among all birds, so as long as the upward, downward, and sideway\r\ncourse of the universe lasteth, Kesava is the foremost in all the worlds\r\nincluding the regions of the celestials. This Sisupala is a mere boy and\r\nhence he knoweth not Krishna, and ever and everywhere speaketh of Krishna\r\nthus. This ruler of Chedi will never see virtue in that light in which\r\none that is desirous of acquiring high merit will see it. Who is there\r\namong the old and the young or among these illustrious lords of earth\r\nthat doth not regard Krishna as deserving of worship or that doth not\r\nworship Krishna? If Sisupala regardeth this worship as undeserved, it\r\nbehoveth him to do what is proper in this matter.'\""

And a shower of flowers\r\nfell on Sahadeva's head, and an incorporeal voice said--'Excellent,\r\nexcellent.' Then Narada clad in black deer-skin, speaking of both the\r\nfuture and the past, that dispeller of all doubts, fully acquainted with\r\nall the worlds, said in the midst of innumerable creatures, these words\r\nof the clearest import,--'Those men that will not worship the lotus-eyed\r\nKrishna should be regarded as dead though moving, and should never be\r\ntalked to on any occasion.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--Then that god among men, Sahadeva cognisant of\r\nthe distinction between a Brahmana and a Kshatriya, having worshipped\r\nthose that deserved worship, completed that ceremony.

They\r\nall said, 'We must so act that the final sacrificial rite performed by\r\nYudhishthira and the worship of Krishna may not be regarded as having\r\nbeen acquiesced in by us. And impelled by a belief in their power and\r\ngreat assurance, the kings, deprived of reason through anger, began to\r\nsay this. And being moved by self-confidence and smarting under the\r\ninsult offered unto them, the monarchs repeatedly exclaimed thus. Though\r\ntheir friends sought to appease them, their faces glowed with anger like\r\nthose of roaring lions driven away from their preys.

Like a boat tied to another\r\nboat or the blind following the blind, are the Kurus who have thee for\r\ntheir guide. Thou hast once more simply pained our hearts by reciting\r\nparticularly the deeds of this one (Krishna), such as the slaying of\r\nPutana and others. Arrogant and ignorant as thou art, and desirous of\r\npraising Kesava, why doth not this tongue of thine split up into a\r\nhundred parts? How dost thou, superior as thou art in knowledge, desire\r\nto praise that cow-boy in respect of whom even men of little intelligence\r\nmay address invectives? If Krishna in his infancy slew a vulture, what is\r\nthere remarkable in that, or in that other feat of his, O Bhishma, viz.,\r\nin his slaughter of Aswa and Vrishava, both of whom were unskilled in\r\nbattle? If this one threw drown by a kick an inanimate piece of wood,\r\nviz., a car, what is there, O Bhishma, wonderful in that? O Bhishma, what\r\nis there remarkable in this one's having supported for a week the\r\nGovardhan mount which is like an anthill? 'While sporting on the top of a\r\nmountain this one ate a large quantity of food,'--hearing these words of\r\nthine many have wondered exceedingly. But, O thou who art conversant with\r\nthe rules of morality, is not this still more wrongful that that great\r\nperson, viz., Kansa, whose food this one ate, hath been slain by him?\r\nThou infamous one of the Kuru race, thou art ignorant of the rules of\r\nmorality. Hast thou not ever heard, from wise men speaking unto thee,\r\nwhat I would now tell thee? The virtuous and the wise always instruct the\r\nhonest that weapons must never be made to descend upon women and kine and\r\nBrahmanas and upon those whose food hath been taken, as also upon those\r\nwhose shelter hath been enjoyed. It seemeth, O Bhishma, that all these\r\nteachings hath been thrown away by thee. O infamous one of the Kuru race,\r\ndesiring to praise Kesava, thou describest him before me as great and\r\nsuperior in knowledge and in age, as if I knew nothing. If at thy word, O\r\nBhishma, one that hath slain women (meaning Putana) and kine be\r\nworshipped, then what is to become of this great lesson? How can one who\r\nis such, deserve praise, O Bhishma? 'This one is the foremost of all wise\r\nmen,--'This one is the lord of the universe'--hearing these words of\r\nthine, Janarddana believeth that these are all true. But surely, they are\r\nall false. The verses that a chanter sings, even if he sings them often,\r\nproduce no impression on him. And every creature acts according to his\r\ndisposition, even like the bird Bhulinga (that picks the particles of\r\nflesh from between the lion's teeth, though preaching against rashness).\r\nAssuredly thy disposition is very mean. There is not the least doubt\r\nabout it.

Possessing a knowledge of virtue, thou\r\nhast fallen off from the path of the wise. Therefore thou art sinful.\r\nWho, O Bhishma, knowing himself to be virtuous and superior in knowledge,\r\nwill so act as thou hast done from motives of virtue? If thou knowest the\r\nways of the morality, if thy mind is guided by wisdom, blessed be thou.\r\nWhy then, O Bhishma, was that virtuous girl Amva, who had set her heart\r\nupon another, carried off by thee, so proud of wisdom and virtue? Thy\r\nbrother Vichitravirya conformably to the ways of the honest and the\r\nvirtuous, knowing that girl's condition, did not marry her though brought\r\nby thee. Boasting as thou dost of virtue, in thy very sight, upon the\r\nwidow of thy brother were sons begotten by another according to the ways\r\nof the honest. Where is thy virtue, O Bhishma?

Worship, gift, study,--sacrifices distinguished by large\r\ngifts to the Brahmanas,--these all equal not in merit even one-sixteenth\r\npart of that which is obtainable by the possession of a son. The merit, O\r\nBhishma, that is acquired by numberless vows and fasts assuredly becomes\r\nfruitless in the case of one that is childless. Thou art childless and\r\nold and the expounder of false morality. Like the swan in the story, thou\r\nshalt now die at the hands of thy relatives. Other men possessed of\r\nknowledge have said this of old. I will presently recite it fully in thy\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n\"There lived of yore an old swan on the sea-coast. Ever speaking of\r\nmorality, but otherwise in his conduct, he used to instruct the feathery\r\ntribe. Practise ye virtue and forego sin,--these were the words that\r\nother truthful birds, O Bhishma, constantly heard him utter And the other\r\noviparous creatures ranging the sea, it hath been heard by us, O Bhishma\r\nuse for virtue's sake to bring him food. And, O Bhishma, all those other\r\nbirds, keeping their eggs, with him, ranged and dived in the waters of\r\nthe sea. And the sinful old swan, attentive to his own pursuits, used to\r\neat up the eggs of all those birds that foolishly trusted in him. After a\r\nwhile when the eggs were decreasing in number, a bird of great wisdom had\r\nhis suspicions roused and he even witnessed (the affair) one day. And\r\nhaving witnessed the sinful act of the old swan, that bird in great\r\nsorrow spoke unto all the other birds. Then, O thou best of the Kurus,\r\nall those birds witnessing with their own eyes the act of the old swan,\r\napproached that wretch of false conduct and slew him.\r\n\r\n\"Thy behaviour, O Bhishma, is even like that of the old swan. These lords\r\nof earth might slay thee in anger like those creatures of the feathery\r\ntribe slaying the old swan. Persons conversant with the Puranas recite a\r\nproverb, O Bhishma, as regards this occurrence, I shall, O Bharata,\r\nrepeat it to thee fully. It is even this: O thou that supportest thyself\r\non thy wings, though thy heart is affected (by the passions), thou\r\npreachest yet (of virtue); but this thy sinful act of eating up the eggs\r\ntransgresseth thy speech!\""

The powerful king of Chedi, beholding\r\nBhima of terrible prowess in such rage, laughingly said,--'Release him, O\r\nBhishma! Let all the monarchs behold him scorched by my prowess like an\r\ninsect in fire.' Hearing these words of the ruler of the Chedis, Bhishma,\r\nthat foremost of the Kurus and chief of all intelligent men, spoke unto\r\nBhima these words.\""

On that account, his father and mother along with\r\ntheir relatives, were struck with fear. And beholding these extraordinary\r\nomens, his parents resolved to abandon him. But an incorporeal voice,\r\nabout this time, said unto the king and his wife with their ministers and\r\npriest, all with hearts paralysed by anxiety, those words,--'This thy\r\nson, O king, that hath been born will become both fortunate and superior\r\nin strength. Therefore thou hast no fear from him. Indeed cherish the\r\nchild without anxiety. He will not die (in childhood). His time is not\r\nyet come. He that will slay him with weapons hath also been born.'\r\nHearing these words, the mother, rendered anxious by affection for her\r\nson, addressed the invisible Being and said,--I bow with joined hands\r\nunto him that hath uttered these words respecting my son; whether he be\r\nan exalted divinity or any other being, let him tell me another word, I\r\ndesire to hear who will be the slayer of this my son. The invisible Being\r\nthen said,--'He upon whose lap this child being placed the superfluous\r\narms of his will fall down upon the ground like a pair of five-headed\r\nsnakes, and at the sight of whom his third eye on the forehead will\r\ndisappear, will be his slayer?' Hearing of the child's three eyes and\r\nfour arms as also of the words of the invisible Being, all the kings of\r\nthe earth went to Chedi to behold him. The king of Chedi worshipping, as\r\neach deserved, the monarchs that came, gave his child upon their laps one\r\nafter another. And though the child was placed upon the laps of a\r\nthousand kings, one after another, yet that which the incorporeal voice\r\nhad said came not to pass. And having heard of all this at Dwaravati, the\r\nmighty Yadava heroes Sankarshana and Janarddana also went to the capital\r\nof the Chedis, to see their father's sister--that daughter of the Yadavas\r\n(the queen of Chedi) And saluting everybody according to his rank and the\r\nking and queen also, and enquiring after every body's welfare, both Rama\r\nand Kesava took their seats. And after those heroes had been worshipped,\r\nthe queen with great pleasure herself placed the child on the lap of\r\nDamodara. As soon as the child was placed on his lap, those superfluous\r\narms of his fell down and the eye on his forehead also disappeared. And\r\nbeholding this, the queen in alarm and anxiety begged of Krishna a boon.\r\nAnd she said,--'O mighty-armed Krishna, I am afflicted with fear; grant\r\nme a boon. Thou art the assurer of all afflicted ones and that the\r\ndispeller of everybody's fear. Thus addressed by her. Krishna, that son\r\nof the Yadu race, said--'Fear not, O respected one. Thou art acquainted\r\nwith morality. Thou needest have no fear from me. What boon shall I give\r\nthee? What shall I do, O aunt? Whether able or not, I shall do thy\r\nbidding.'--Thus spoken to by Krishna, the queen said, 'O thou of great\r\nstrength, thou wilt have to pardon the offences of Sisupala for my sake.\r\nO tiger of the Yadu race. Know O lord, even this is the boon that I ask.'\r\nKrishna then said, 'O aunt, even when he will deserve to be slain, I will\r\npardon an hundred offences of his. Grieve thou not.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued,--'Even thus, O Bhima, is this wretch of a\r\nking--Sisupala of wicked heart, who, proud of the boon granted by\r\nGovinda, summons thee to battle!'\""

If thy mind, O Bhishma, delighteth so in\r\npraising others, then praise thou these kings, leaving off Krishna.\r\nPraise thou this excellent of kings, Darada, the ruler of Valhika, who\r\nrent this earth as soon as he was born. Praise thou, O Bhishma, this\r\nKarna, the ruler of the territories of Anga and Vanga, who is equal in\r\nstrength unto him of a thousand eyes, who draweth a large bow, who endued\r\nwith mighty arms owneth celestial ear-rings of heavenly make with which\r\nhe was born and this coat of mail possessing the splendour of the rising\r\nsun, who vanquished in a wrestling encounter the invincible Jarasandha\r\nequal unto Vasava himself, and who tore and mangled that monarch. O\r\nBhishma, praise Drona and Aswatthaman, who both father and son, are\r\nmighty warriors, worthy of praise, and the best of Brahmanas, and either\r\nof whom, O Bhishma, if enraged could annihilate this earth with its\r\nmobile and immobile creatures, as I believe. I do not behold, O Bhishma,\r\nthe king that is equal in battle unto Drona or Aswatthaman. Why wishest\r\nthou not to praise them? Passing over Duryyodhana, that mighty-armed king\r\nof kings, who is unequalled in whole earth girt with her seas and king\r\nJayadratha accomplished in weapons and endued with great prowess, and\r\nDruma the preceptor of the Kimpurushas and celebrated over the world for\r\nprowess, and Saradwata's son, old Kripa, the preceptor of the Bharata\r\nprinces and endued with great energy, why dost thou praise Kesava?\r\nPassing over that foremost of bowmen--that excellent of kings, Rukmin of\r\ngreat energy, why praisest thou Kesava? Passing over Bhishmaka of\r\nabundant energy, and king Dantavakra, and Bhagadatta known for his\r\ninnumerable sacrificial stakes, and Jayatsena the king of the Magadha,\r\nand Virata and Drupada, and Sakuni and Vrihadvala, and Vinda and Anuvinda\r\nof Avant Pandya, Sweta Uttama Sankhya of great prosperity, the proud\r\nVrishasena, the powerful Ekalavya, and the great charioteer Kalinga of\r\nabundant energy, why dost thou praise Kesava? And, O Bhishma, if thy mind\r\nis always inclined to sing the praises of others, why dost thou not\r\npraise Salya and other rulers of the earth? O king, what can be done by\r\nme when (it seemeth) thou hast not heard anything before from virtuous\r\nold men giving lessons in morality? Hast thou never heard, O Bhishma,\r\nthat reproach and glorification, both of self and others, are not\r\npractices of those that are respectable? There is no one that approveth\r\nthy conduct, O Bhishma, in unceasingly praising with devotion, from\r\nignorance alone, Kesava so unworthy of praise. How dost thou, from thy\r\nwish alone, establish the whole universe in the servitor and cowherd of\r\nBhoja (Kansa)? Perhaps, O Bharata, this thy inclination is not\r\nconformable to thy true nature, like to what may be in the bird Bhulinga,\r\nas hath already been said by me. There is a bird called Bhulinga living\r\non the other side of the Himavat. O Bhishma, that bird ever uttereth\r\nwords of adverse import. Never do anything rash,--this is what she always\r\nsayeth, but never understandeth that she herself always acteth very\r\nrashly. Possessed of little intelligence that bird picketh from the\r\nlion's mouth the pieces of flesh sticking between the teeth, and at a\r\ntime when the lion is employed in eating. Assuredly, O Bhishma, that bird\r\nliveth at the pleasure of the lion. O sinful wretch, thou always speakest\r\nlike that bird. And assuredly, O Bhishma, thou art alive at the pleasure\r\nonly of these kings. Employed in acts contrary to the opinions of all,\r\nthere is none else like thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued,--Hearing these harsh words of the ruler of\r\nChedi, Bhishma, O king, said in the hearing of the king of Chedi,--'Truly\r\nam I alive at the pleasure of these rulers of earth. But I do regard\r\nthese kings as not equal to even a straw.' As soon as these words were\r\nspoken by Bhishma, the kings became inflamed with wrath. And the down of\r\nsome amongst them stood erect and some began to reprove Bhishma. And\r\nhearing those words of Bhishma, some amongst them, that were wielders of\r\nlarge bows exclaimed, 'This wretched Bhishma, though old, is exceedingly\r\nboastful. He deserveth not our pardon. Therefore, ye kings, incensed with\r\nrage as this Bhishma is, it is well that this wretch were slain like an\r\nanimal, or, mustering together, let us burn him in a fire of grass or\r\nstraw.' Hearing these words of the monarchs, Bhishma the grand-sire of\r\nthe Kurus, endued with great intelligence, addressing those lords of\r\nearth, said,--'I do not see the end of our speeches, for words may be\r\nanswered with words. Therefore, ye lords of earth, listen ye all unto\r\nwhat I say. Whether I be slain like an animal or burnt in a fire of grass\r\nand straw, thus do I distinctly place my foot on the heads of ye all.\r\nHere is Govinda, that knoweth no deterioration. Him have we worshipped.\r\nLet him who wisheth for speedy death, summon to battle Madhava of dark\r\nhue and the wielder of the discus and the mace; and falling enter into\r\nand mingle with the body of this god!\""

Come, fight with\r\nme until I slay thee today with all the Pandavas. For, O Krishna, the\r\nsons of Pandu also, who disregarding the claims of all these kings, have\r\nworshipped thee who art no king, deserve to be slain by me along with\r\nthee. Even this is my opinion, O Krishna, that they who from childishness\r\nhave worshipped thee, as if thou deservest it, although thou art unworthy\r\nof worship, being only a slave and a wretch and no king, deserve to be\r\nslain by me.' Having said this, that tiger among kings stood there\r\nroaring in anger. And after Sisupala had ceased, Krishna addressing all\r\nthe kings in the presence of the Pandavas, spoke these words in a soft\r\nvoice.--'Ye kings, this wicked-minded one, who is the son of a daughter\r\nof the Satwata race, is a great enemy of us of the Satwata race; and\r\nthough we never seek to injure him, he ever seeketh our evil. This wretch\r\nof cruel deeds, ye kings, hearing that we had gone to the city of\r\nPragjyotisha, came and burnt Dwaraka, although he is the son of my\r\nfather's sister. While king Bhoja was sporting on the Raivataka hill,\r\nthis one fell upon the attendants of that king and slew and led away many\r\nof them in chains to his own city. Sinful in all his purpose, this\r\nwretch, in order to obstruct the sacrifice of my father, stole the\r\nsacrificial horse of the horse-sacrifice that had been let loose under\r\nthe guard of armed men. Prompted by sinful motives, this one ravished the\r\nreluctant wife of the innocent Vabhru (Akrura) on her way from Dwaraka to\r\nthe country of the Sauviras. This injurer of his maternal uncle,\r\ndisguising himself in the attire of the king of Karusha, ravished also\r\nthe innocent Bhadra, the princess of Visala, the intended bride of king\r\nKarusha. I have patiently borne all these sorrows for the sake of my\r\nfather's sister. It is, however, very fortunate that all this hath\r\noccurred today in the presence of all the kings. Behold ye all today the\r\nhostility this one beareth towards me. And know ye also all that he hath\r\ndone me at my back. For the excess of that pride in which he hath\r\nindulged in the presence of all these monarchs, he deserveth to be slain\r\nby me. I am ill able to pardon today the injuries that he hath done me.\r\nDesirous of speedy death, this fool had desired Rukmini. But the fool\r\nobtained her not, like a Sudra failing to obtain the audition of the\r\nVedas.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Vasudeva, all the\r\nassembled monarchs began to reprove the ruler of Chedi. But the powerful\r\nSisupala, having heard these words, laughed aloud and spoke thus,--'O\r\nKrishna, art thou not ashamed in saying in this assembly, especially\r\nbefore all these kings that Rukmini (thy wife) had been coveted by me? O\r\nslayer of Madhu, who else is there than thee, who regarding himself a man\r\nwould say in the midst of respectable men that his wife had been intended\r\nfor some body else? O Krishna, pardon me if thou pleasest, or pardon me\r\nnot. But angry or friendly, what canst thou do unto me?'\r\n\r\n\"And while Sisupala was speaking thus, the exalted slayer of Madhu\r\nthought in his mind of the discus that humbleth the pride of the Asuras.\r\nAnd as soon as the discus came into his hands, skilled in speech the\r\nillustrious one loudly uttered these words,--'Listen ye lords of earth,\r\nwhy this one had hitherto been pardoned by me. As asked by his mother, a\r\nhundred offences (of his) were to be pardoned by me. Even this was the\r\nboon she had asked, and even this I granted her. That number, ye kings,\r\nhath become full. I shall now slay him in your presence, ye monarchs.'\r\nHaving said this, the chief of the Yadus, that slayer of all foes, in\r\nanger, instantly cut off the head of the ruler of Chedi by means of his\r\ndiscus. And the mighty-armed one fell down like a cliff struck with\r\nthunder. And, O monarch, the assembled kings then beheld a fierce energy,\r\nlike unto the sun in the sky, issue out of the body of the king of Chedi,\r\nand O king, that energy then adored Krishna, possessed of eyes like lotus\r\nleaves and worshipped by all the worlds, and entered his body. And all\r\nthe kings beholding the energy which entered that mighty-armed chief of\r\nmen regarded it as wonderful. And when Krishna had slain the king of\r\nChedi, the sky, though cloudless, poured showers of rain, and blasting\r\nthunders were hurled, and the earth itself began to tremble. There were\r\nsome among the kings who spoke not a word during those unspeakable\r\nmoments but merely sat gazing at Janarddana. And some there were that\r\nrubbed in rage their palms with their forefingers. And there were others\r\nwho deprived of reason by rage bit their lips with their teeth. And some\r\namongst the kings applauded him of the Vrishni race in private. And some\r\nthere were that became excited with anger; while others became mediators.\r\nThe great Rishis with pleased hearts praised Kesava and went away. And\r\nall the high-souled Brahmanas and the mighty kings that were there,\r\nbeholding Krishna's prowess, became glad at heart and praised him.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira then commanded his brothers to perform without delay the\r\nfuneral rites of king Sisupala, the brave son of Damaghosha, with proper\r\nrespect. The sons of Pandu obeyed the behest of their brother. And\r\nYudhishthira then, with all the kings, installed the son of king Sisupala\r\nin the sovereignty of the Chedis.\r\n\r\n\"Then that sacrifice, O monarch, of the king of the Kurus possessed of\r\ngreat energy, blessed with every kind of prosperity, became exceedingly\r\nhandsome and pleasing unto all young men. And commenced auspiciously, and\r\nall impediments removed, and furnished with abundance of wealth and corn,\r\nas also with plenty of rice and every kind of food, it was properly\r\nwatched by Kesava. And Yudhishthira in due time completed the great\r\nsacrifice. And the mighty-armed Janarddana, the exalted Sauri, with his\r\nbow called Saranga and his discus and mace, guarded that sacrifice till\r\nits completion. And all the Kshatriya monarchs, having approached the\r\nvirtuous Yudhishthira who had bathed after the conclusion of the\r\nsacrifice, said these words: 'By good fortune thou hast come out\r\nsuccessful. O virtuous one, thou hast obtained the imperial dignity. O\r\nthou of the Ajamida race, by thee hath been spread the fame of thy whole\r\nrace. And, O king of kings, by this act of thine, thou hast also acquired\r\ngreat religious merit. We have been worshipped by thee to the full extent\r\nof our desires. We now tell thee that we are desirous of returning to our\r\nown kingdoms. It behoveth thee to grant us permission.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of the monarchs, king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nworshipping each as he deserved, commanded his brothers, saying, 'These\r\nmonarchs had all come to us at their own pleasure. These chastisers of\r\nfoes are now desirous of returning to their own kingdoms, bidding me\r\nfarewell. Blest be ye, follow ye these excellent kings to the confines of\r\nour own dominions.' Hearing these words of their brother, the virtuous\r\nPandava princes followed the kings, one after another as each deserved.\r\nThe powerful Dhrishtadyumna followed without loss of time king Virata:\r\nand Dhananjaya followed the illustrious and mighty charioteer Yajnasena;\r\nand the mighty Bhimasena followed Bhishma and Dhritarashtra: and\r\nSahadeva, that master of battle, followed the brave Drona and his son;\r\nand Nakula, O king, followed Suvala with his son; and the sons of\r\nDraupadi with the son of Subhadra followed those mighty warriors--the\r\nkings of the mountainous countries. And other bulls among Kshatriyas\r\nfollowed other Kshatriyas. And the Brahmanas by thousands also went away,\r\nduly worshipped.\r\n\r\n\"After all the Kings and the Brahmanas had gone away, the powerful\r\nVasudeva addressing Yudhishthira said,--'O son of the Kuru race, with thy\r\nleave, I also desire to go to Dwaraka. By great good fortune, thou hast\r\naccomplished the foremost of sacrifices--Rajasuya!' Thus addressed by\r\nJanarddana, Yudhishthira replied, 'Owing to thy grace, O Govinda. I have\r\naccomplished the great sacrifice. And it is owing to thy grace that the\r\nwhole Kshatriya world having accepted my sway, had come hither with\r\nvaluable tribute. O hero, without thee, my heart never feeleth any\r\ndelight. How can I, therefore, O hero, give thee, O sinless one, leave to\r\ngo? But thou must have to go to the city of Dwaraka.' The virtuous Hari\r\nof worldwide fame, thus addressed by Yudhishthira, cheerfully went with\r\nhis cousin to Pritha and said,--'O aunt, thy sons have now obtained the\r\nimperial dignity. They have obtained vast wealth and been also crowned\r\nwith success. Be pleased with all this. Commanded by thee, O aunt, I\r\ndesire to go to Dwaraka.' After this, Kesava bade farewell to Draupadi\r\nand Subhadra. Coming out then of the inner apartments accompanied by\r\nYudhishthira, he performed his ablutions and went through the daily rites\r\nof worship, and then made the Brahmanas utter benedictions. Then the\r\nmighty armed Daruka came there with a car of excellent design and body\r\nresembling the clouds. And beholding that Garuda-bannered car arrived\r\nthither, the high-souled one, with eyes like lotus leaves, walked round\r\nit respectfully and ascending on it set out for Dwaravati. And king\r\nYudhishthira the just, blessed with prosperity, accompanied by his\r\nbrothers, followed on foot the mighty Vasudeva. Then Hari with eyes like\r\nlotus leaves, stopping that best of cars for a moment, addressing\r\nYudhishthira the son of Kunti, said,--'O king of kings, cherishest thou\r\nthy subjects with ceaseless vigilance and patience. And as the clouds are\r\nunto all creatures, as the large tree of spreading bough is unto birds,\r\nas he of a thousand eyes is unto the immortals, be thou the refuge and\r\nsupport of thy relatives. And Krishna and Yudhishthira having thus talked\r\nunto each other took each other's leave and returned to their respective\r\nhomes. And, O king, after the chief of the Satwata race had gone to\r\nDwaravati, king Duryodhana alone, with king Suvala's son, Sakuni,--these\r\nbulls among men,--continued to live in that celestial assembly house."

In course of time, O bull of the Bharata race, making thee\r\nthe sole cause, the assembled Kshatriyas of the world will be destroyed,\r\nO Bharata, for the sins of Duryodhana and through the might of Bhima and\r\nArjuna.

And he\r\nsaid to himself, 'Indeed what the Rishi hath said must come to pass. We\r\nwill succeed in warding off the fates by exertion alone?' Then\r\nYudhishthira endued with great energy addressing all his brothers, said,\r\n'Ye tigers among men, ye have heard what the island-born Rishi hath told\r\nme. Having heard the words of the Rishi, I have arrived at this firm\r\nresolution viz., that I should die, as I am ordained to be the cause of\r\nthe destruction of all Kshatriyas. Ye my dear ones, if Time hath intended\r\nso what need is there for me to live?' Hearing these words of the king,\r\nArjuna replied, 'O king, yield not thyself to this terrible depression\r\nthat is destructive of reason. Mustering fortitude, O great king, do what\r\nwould be beneficial.' Yudhishthira then, firm in truth, thinking all the\r\nwhile of Dwaipayana's words answered his brothers thus,--'Blest be ye.\r\nListen to my vow from this day. For thirteen years, what ever purpose\r\nhave I to live for, I shall not speak a hard word to my brothers or to\r\nany of the kings of the earth. Living under the command of my relatives,\r\nI shall practise virtue, exemplifying my vow. If I live in this way,\r\nmaking no distinction between my own children and others, there will be\r\nno disagreement (between me and others).

Beholding Duryodhana fallen into\r\nthe lake, the mighty Bhima laughed aloud as also the menials of the\r\npalace. And the servants, at the command of the king, soon brought him\r\ndry and handsome clothes. Beholding the plight of Duryodhana, the mighty\r\nBhima and Arjuna and both the twins--all laughed aloud. Being unused to\r\nputting up with insults, Duryodhana could not bear that laugh of theirs.\r\nConcealing his emotions he even did not cast his looks on them. And\r\nbeholding the monarch once more draw up his clothes to cross a piece of\r\ndry land which he had mistaken for water, they all laughed again. And the\r\nking sometime after mistook a closed door made of crystal as open. And as\r\nhe was about to pass through it his head struck against it, and he stood\r\nwith his brain reeling. And mistaking as closed another door made of\r\ncrystal that was really open, the king in attempting to open it with\r\nstretched hands, tumbled down. And coming upon another door that was\r\nreally open, the king thinking it as closed, went away from it. And, O\r\nmonarch, king Duryodhana beholding that vast wealth in the Rajasuya\r\nsacrifice and having become the victim of those numerous errors within\r\nthe assembly house at last returned, with the leave of the Pandavas, to\r\nHastinapore.\r\n\r\nAnd the heart of king Duryodhana, afflicted at sight of the prosperity of\r\nthe Pandavas, became inclined to sin, as he proceeded towards his city\r\nreflecting on all he had seen and suffered. And beholding the Pandavas\r\nhappy and all the kings of the earth paying homage to them, as also\r\neverybody, young and old, engaged in doing good unto them, and reflecting\r\nalso on the splendour and prosperity of the illustrious sons of Pandu,\r\nDuryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, became pale. In proceeding (to his\r\ncity) with an efflicted heart, the prince thought of nothing else but\r\nthat assembly house and that unrivalled prosperity of the wise\r\nYudhishthira. And Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, was so taken up\r\nwith his thoughts then that he spoke not a word to Suvala's son even\r\nthough the latter addressed him repeatedly. And Sakuni, beholding him\r\nabsent-minded, said,--'O Duryodhana, why art thou proceeding thus'?\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana replied,--O uncle, beholding this whole earth owning the sway\r\nof Yudhishthira in consequence of the might of the illustrious Arjuna's\r\nweapons and beholding also that sacrifice of the son of Pritha like unto\r\nthe sacrifice of Sakra himself of great glory among the celestials, I,\r\nbeing filled with jealousy and burning day and night, am being dried up\r\nlike a shallow tank in the summer season. Behold, when Sisupala was slain\r\nby the chief of the Satwatas, there was no man to take the side of\r\nSisupala. Consumed by the fire of the Pandava, they all forgave that\r\noffence; otherwise who is there that could forgive it? That highly\r\nimproper act of grave consequence done by Vasudeva succeeded in\r\nconsequence of the power of the illustrious son of Pandu. And so many\r\nmonarchs also brought with them various kinds of wealth for king\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, like tribute-paying Vaisyas! Beholding\r\nYudhishthira's prosperity of such splendour, my heart burneth, efflicted\r\nwith jealously, although it behoveth me not to be jealous.'\r\n\r\n\"Having reflected in this way, Duryodhana, as if burnt by fire, addressed\r\nthe king of Gandhara again and said,--'I shall throw myself upon a\r\nflaming fire or swallow poison or drown myself in water. I cannot live.\r\nWhat man is there in the world possessed of vigour who can bear to see\r\nhis foes in the enjoyment of prosperity and himself in destitution?\r\nTherefore I who bear to see that accession of prosperity and fortune (in\r\nmy foes) am neither a woman nor one that is not a woman, neither also a\r\nman nor one that is not a man. Beholding their sovereignty over the world\r\nand vast affluence, as also that sacrifice, who is there like me that\r\nwould not smart under all that? Alone I am incapable of acquiring such\r\nroyal prosperity; nor do I behold allies that could help me in the\r\nmatter. It is for this that I am thinking of self-destruction. Beholding\r\nthat great and serene prosperity of the son of Kunti, I regard Fate as\r\nsupreme and exertions fruitless. O son of Suvala, formerly I strove to\r\ncompass his destruction. But baffling all my efforts he hath grown in\r\nprosperity even like the lotus from within a pool of water. It is for\r\nthis that I regard Fate as supreme and exertions fruitless. Behold, the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra are decaying and the sons of Pritha are growing day\r\nby day. Beholding that prosperity of the Pandavas, and that assembly\r\nhouse of theirs, and those menials laughing at me, my heart burneth as if\r\nit were on fire. Therefore, O uncle, know me now as deeply grieved and\r\nfilled with jealousy, and speak of it to Dhritarashtra."

O slayer of foes, O great king,\r\nthou couldst not destroy them by repeatedly devising numberless plans,\r\nmany of which thou hadst even put to practice. Those tigers among men out\r\nof sheer luck escaped all those machinations. They have obtained Draupadi\r\nfor wife and Drupada with his sons as also Vasudeva of great prowess as\r\nallies, capable of helping them in subjugating the whole world. And O\r\nking, having inherited the paternal share of the kingdom without being\r\ndeprived of it they have grown in consequence of their own energy. What\r\nis there to make thee sorry for this? Having gratified Hustasana,\r\nDhananjaya hath obtained the bow Gandiva and the couple of inexhaustible\r\nquivers and many celestial weapons. With that unique bow and by the\r\nstrength of his own arms also he hath brought all the kings of the world\r\nunder his sway. What is there to make thee sorry for this? Having saved\r\nthe Asura Maya from a conflagration, Arjuna, that slayer of foes, using\r\nboth his hands with equal skill, caused him to build that assembly house.\r\nAnd it is for this also that commanded by Maya, those grim Rakshasas\r\ncalled Kinkaras supported that assembly house. What is there in this to\r\nmake thee sorry? Thou hast said, O king, that thou art without allies.\r\nThis, O Bharata, is not true. These thy brothers are obedient to thee.\r\nDrona of great prowess and wielding the large bow along with his son,\r\nRadha's son Karna, the great warrior Gautama (Kripa), myself with my\r\nbrothers and king Saumadatti--these are thy allies. Uniting thyself with\r\nthese, conquer thou the whole of the earth.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said,--'O king, with thee, as also with these great warriors,\r\nI shall subjugate the Pandavas, if it pleases thee. If I can now\r\nsubjugate them, the world will be mine and all the monarchs, and that\r\nassembly house so full of wealth.'\r\n\r\n\"Sakuni replied,--'Dhananjaya and Vasudeva, Bhimasena and Yudhishthira,\r\nNakula and Sahadeva and Drupada with his sons,--these cannot be\r\nvanquished in battle by even the celestials, for they are all great\r\nwarriors wielding the largest bows, accomplished in weapons, and\r\ndelighting in battle. But, O king, I know the means by which Yudhishthira\r\nhimself may be vanquished. Listen to me and adopt it.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said,--'without danger to our friends and other illustrious\r\nmen, O uncle, tell me if there is any way by which I may vanquish him.'\r\n\r\n\"Sakuni said,--'The son of Kunti is very fond of dice-play although he\r\ndoth not know how to play. That king if asked to play, is ill able to\r\nrefuse. I am skillful at dice. There is none equal to me in this respect\r\non earth, no, not even in the three worlds, O son of Kuru. Therefore, ask\r\nhim to play at dice. Skilled at dice, I will win his kingdom, and that\r\nsplendid prosperity of his for thee, O bull among men. But, O Duryodhana,\r\nrepresent all this unto the king (Dhritarashtra). Commanded by thy father\r\nI will win without doubt the whole of Yudhishthira's possessions.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said 'O son of Suvala, thou thyself represent properly all\r\nthis to Dhritarashtra, the chief of the Kurus.

      "content": "Vaisampayana said--\"O king, impressed with the great Rajasuya sacrifice\r\nof king Yudhishthira, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, having learnt before the\r\nintentions of Duryodhana, while accompanying him in the way from the\r\nassembly house, and desirous of saying what was agreeable to him,\r\napproached Dhritarashtra endued with great wisdom, and finding the\r\nmonarch deprived of his eye seated (in his throne), told him these\r\nwords,--'Know, O great king, O bull of the Bharata race, that Duryodhana,\r\nhaving lost colour, hath become pale and emaciated and depressed and a\r\nprey to anxiety. Why dost thou not, after due enquiry, ascertain the\r\ngrief that is in the heart of thy eldest son, the grief that is caused by\r\nthe foe?'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said,--'Duryodhana, what is the reason of thy great\r\naffliction. O son of the Kuru race? If it is fit for me to hear it, then\r\ntell me the reason. This Sakuni here says that thou hast lost colour,\r\nbecome pale and emaciated, and a prey to anxiety. I do not know what can\r\nbe the reason of the sorrow. This vast wealth of mine is at thy control.\r\nThy brothers and all our relations never do anything that is disagreeable\r\nto thee. Thou wearest the best apparel and eatest the best food that is\r\nprepared with meat. The best of horse carries thee. What it is,\r\ntherefore, that hath made thee pale and emaciated? Costly beds, beautiful\r\ndamsels, mansions decked with excellent furniture, and sport of the\r\ndelightful kind, without doubt these all wait but at thy command, as in\r\nthe case of the gods themselves Therefore, O proud one, why dost thou\r\ngrieve, O son, as if thou wert destitute.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said,--'I eat and dress myself like a wretch and pass my time\r\nall the while a prey to fierce jealousy. He indeed is a man, who\r\nincapable of bearing the pride of the foe, liveth having vanquished that\r\nfoe with the desire of liberating his own subjects from the tyranny of\r\nthe foe. Contentment, as also pride, O Bharata, are destructive of\r\nprosperity; and those other two qualities also, viz., compassion and\r\nfear. One who acteth under the influence of these, never obtaineth\r\nanything high. Having beheld Yudhishthira's prosperity, whatever I enjoy\r\nbrings me no gratification. The prosperity of Kunti's son that is\r\npossessed of such splendour maketh me pale. Knowing the affluence of the\r\nfoe and my own destitution, even though that affluence is not before me,\r\nI yet see it before me. Therefore, have I lost colour and become\r\nmelancholy, pale and emaciated. Yudhishthira supporteth eighty-eight\r\nthousand Snataka Brahmanas leading domestic lives, giving unto each of\r\nthem thirty slave-girls. Beside this, thousand other Brahmanas daily eat\r\nat his palace the best of food on golden plates. The king of Kambhoja\r\nsent unto him (as tribute) innumerable skins, black, darkish, and red, of\r\nthe deer Kadali, as also numberless blankets of excellent textures. And\r\nhundreds and thousands and thousands of she-elephants and thirty thousand\r\nshe-camels wander within the palace, for the kings of the earth brought\r\nthem all as tribute to the capital of the Pandavas. And, O lord of earth,\r\nthe kings also brought unto this foremost of sacrifices heaps upon heaps\r\nof jewels and gems for the son of Kunti. Never before did I see or hear\r\nof such enormous wealth as was brought unto the sacrifice of the\r\nintelligent sons of Pandu. And, O king, beholding that enormous\r\ncollection of wealth belonging to the foe, I can not enjoy peace of mind.\r\nHundreds of Brahmanas supported by the grants that Yudhishthira hath\r\ngiven them and possessing wealth of kine, waited at the palace gate with\r\nthree thousands of millions of tribute but were prevented by the keepers\r\nfrom entering the mansion. Bringing with them clarified butter in\r\nhandsome Kamandalus made of gold, they did not obtain admission into the\r\npalace, and Ocean himself brought unto him in vessels of white copper the\r\nnectar that is generated within his waters and which is much superior to\r\nthat which flowers and annual plants produce for Sakra. And Vasudeva (at\r\nthe conclusion of the sacrifice) having brought an excellent conch bathed\r\nthe Sun of Pritha with sea water brought in thousand jars of gold, all\r\nwell adorned with numerous gems. Beholding all this I became feverish\r\nwith jealousy. Those jars had been taken to the Eastern and the Southern\r\noceans. And they had also been taken on the shoulders of men to the\r\nWestern ocean, O bull among men. And, O father, although none but birds\r\nonly can go to the Northern region Arjuna, having gone thither, exacted\r\nas tribute a vast quantity of wealth. There is another wonderful incident\r\nalso which I will relate to thee. O listen to me. When a hundred thousand\r\nBrahmanas were fed, it had been arranged that to notify this act every\r\nday conches would be blown in a chorus. But, O Bharata, I continually\r\nheard conches blown there almost repeatedly. And hearing those notes my\r\nhair stood on end. And, O great king, that palatial compound, filled with\r\ninnumerable monarchs that came there as spectators, looked exceedingly\r\nhandsome like the cloudless firmament with stars. And, O king of men, the\r\nmonarchs came into that sacrifice of the wise son of Pandu bringing with\r\nthem every kind of wealth. And the kings that came there became like\r\nVaisyas the distributors of food unto the Brahmanas that were fed. And O\r\nking, the prosperity that I beheld of Yudhishthira was such that neither\r\nthe chief himself of the celestials, nor Yama or Varuna, nor the lord of\r\nthe Guhyakas owneth the same. And beholding that great prosperity of the\r\nson of Pandu, my heart burneth and I cannot enjoy peace.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Sakuni replied,--'Hear how thou\r\nmayest obtain this unrivalled prosperity that thou beholdest in the son\r\nof Pandu, O thou that hast truth for thy prowess. O Bharata, I am an\r\nadept at dice, superior to all in the world. I can ascertain the success\r\nor otherwise of every throw, and when to stake and when not. I have\r\nspecial knowledge of the game. The Son of Kunti also is fond of dice\r\nplaying though he possesseth little skill in it. Summoned to play or\r\nbattle, he is sure to come forward, and I will defeat him repeatedly at\r\nevery throw by practising deception. I promise to win all that wealth of\r\nhis, and thou, O Duryodhana, shalt then enjoy the same.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"King Duryodhana, thus addressed by Sakuni,\r\nwithout allowing a moment to elapse, said unto Dhritarashtra,--'This,\r\nSakuni, an adept at dice, is ready to win at dice, O king, the wealth of\r\nthe sons of Pandu. It behoveth thee to grant him permission to do so.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra replied,--'I always follow the counsels of Kshatta, my\r\nminister possessed of great wisdom. Having consulted with him, I will\r\ninform thee what my judgment is in respect of this affair. Endued with\r\ngreat foresight, he will, keeping morality before his eyes, tell us what\r\nis good and what is proper for both parties, and what should be done in\r\nthis matter.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said,--'If thou consultest with Kshatta he will make thee\r\ndesist. And if thou desist, O king, I will certainly kill myself. And\r\nwhen I am dead, O king, thou wilt become happy with Vidura. Thou wilt\r\nthen enjoy the whole earth; what need hast thou with me?'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Dhritarashtra, hearing these words of\r\naffliction uttered by Duryodhana from mixed feeling, himself ready to\r\nwhat Duryodhana had dictated, commanded his servant, saying,--'Let\r\nartificers be employed to erect without delay a delightful and handsome\r\nand spacious palace with an hundred doors and a thousand columns. And\r\nhaving brought carpenters and joiners, set ye jewels and precious stones\r\nall over the walls. And making it handsome and easy of access, report to\r\nme when everything is complete. And, O monarch, king Dhritarashtra having\r\nmade this resolution for the pacification of Duryodhana, sent messengers\r\nunto Vidura for summoning him. For without taking counsel with Vidura\r\nnever did the monarch form any resolution. But as regards the matter at\r\nhand, the king although he knew the evils of gambling, was yet attracted\r\ntowards it. The intelligent Vidura, however, as soon as he heard of it,\r\nknew that the arrival of Kali was at hand. And seeing that the way to\r\ndestruction was about to open, he quickly came to Dhritarashtra. And\r\nVidura approaching his illustrious eldest brother and bowing down unto\r\nhis feet, said these words:\r\n\r\n'O exalted king, I do not approve of this resolution that thou hast\r\nformed. It behave thee, O king, to act in such a way that no dispute may\r\narise between thy children on account of this gambling match.'\r\n\r\nDhritarashtra replied,--'O Kshatta, if the gods be merciful unto us,\r\nassuredly no dispute will ever arise amongst my sons. Therefore,\r\nauspicious or otherwise, beneficial or otherwise, let this friendly\r\nchallenge at dice proceed. Even this without doubt is what fate hath\r\nordained for us. And, O son of the Bharata race, when I am near, and\r\nDrona and Bhishma and thou too, nothing evil that even Fate might have\r\nordained is likely to happen. Therefore, go thou on a car yoking thereto\r\nhorses endued with the speed of the wind, so that thou mayest reach\r\nKhandavaprastha even today and bring thou Yudhishthira with thee. And, O\r\nVidura, I tell that even this is my resolution. Tell me nothing. I regard\r\nFate as supreme which bringeth all this.' Hearing these words of\r\nDhritarashtra and concluding that his race was doomed, Vidura in great\r\nsorrow went unto Bhishma with great wisdom.\""

Vidura doth not speak well of it. Possessed of\r\ngreat wisdom, he will never give me advice that is not for my good. I\r\nalso regard what Vidura sayeth as exceedingly beneficial for me. Do that,\r\nO son, for I regard it all as for thy good also. Indeed, Vidura knoweth\r\nwith all its mysteries the science (of political morality) that the\r\nillustrious and learned and wise Vrihaspati, the celestial Rishi who is\r\nthe spiritual guide of Vasava--had unfolded unto the wise chief of the\r\nimmortals. And O son, I always accept what Vidura adviseth. O king, as\r\nthe wise Uddhava is ever regarded amongst the Vrishnis, so is Vidura\r\npossessed of great intelligence esteemed as the foremost of the Kurus.\r\nTherefore, O son, have nothing to do with dice. It is evident that dice\r\nsoweth dissensions. And dissensions are the ruin of the kingdom.\r\nTherefore, O son, abandon this idea of gambling. O son, thou hast\r\nobtained from us what, it hath been ordained, a father and a mother\r\nshould give unto their son, viz., ancestral rank and possessions. Thou\r\nart educated and clever in every branch of knowledge, and hast been\r\nbrought up with affection in thy paternal dwelling. Born the eldest among\r\nall thy brothers, living within thy own kingdom, why regardest thou\r\nthyself as unhappy? O thou of mighty arms, thou obtainest food and attire\r\nof the very best kind and which is not obtainable by ordinary men. Why\r\ndost thou grieve yet. O son, O mighty-armed one, ruling thy large\r\nancestral kingdom swelling with people and wealth, thou shinest as\r\nsplendidly as the chief of the celestials in heaven. Thou art possessed\r\nof wisdom. It behoveth thee to tell me what can be the root of this grief\r\nthat hath made thee so melancholy.\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana replied,--'I am a sinful wretch, O king, because I eat and\r\ndress beholding (the prosperity of the foes). It hath been said that man\r\nis a wretch who is not filled with jealousy at the sight of his enemy's\r\nprosperity. O exalted one, this kind of prosperity of mine doth not\r\ngratify me. Beholding that blazing prosperity of the son of Kunti, I am\r\nvery much pained. I tell thee strong must be my vitality, in as much as I\r\nam living even at the sight of the whole earth owning the sway of\r\nYudhishthira. The Nipas, the Chitrakas, the Kukkuras, the Karaskaras, and\r\nthe Lauha-janghas are living in the palace of Yudhishthira like bondsmen.\r\nThe Himavat, the ocean, the regions on the sea-shore, and the numberless\r\nother regions that yield jewels and gems, have all acknowledged\r\nsuperiority of the mansion of Yudhishthira in respect of wealth it\r\ncontaineth. And, O Monarch, regarding me as the eldest and entitled to\r\nrespect, Yudhishthira having received me respectfully, appointed me in\r\nreceiving the jewels and gems (that were brought as tribute). O Bharata,\r\nthe limit and the like of the excellent and invaluable jewels that were\r\nbrought there have not been seen. And O king, my hands were fatigued in\r\nreceiving that wealth. And when I was tired, they that brought those\r\nvaluable articles from distant regions used to wait till I was able to\r\nresume my labour. Bringing jewels from the lake Vindu, the Asura\r\narchitect Maya constructed (for the Pandavas) a lake-like surface made of\r\ncrystal. Beholding the (artificial) lotuses with which it was filled, I\r\nmistook it, O king for water. And seeing me draw up my clothes (while\r\nabout to cross it), Vrikodara (Bhima) laughed at me, regarding me as\r\nwanting in jewels and having lost my head at the sight of the affluence\r\nof my enemy. If I had the ability, I would, O king, without the loss of a\r\nmoment, slay Vrikodara for that. But, O monarch, if we endeavour to slay\r\nBhima now, without doubt, ours will be the fate of Sisupala. O Bharata,\r\nthat insult by the foe burneth me. Once again, O king, beholding a\r\nsimilar lake that is really full of water but which I mistook for a\r\ncrystal surface, I fell into it. At that, Bhima with Arjuna once more\r\nlaughed derisively, and Draupadi also accompanied by other females joined\r\nin the laughter. That paineth my heart exceedingly. My apparel having\r\nbeen wet, the menials at the command of the king gave me other clothes.\r\nThat also is my great sorrow. And O king, hear now of another mistake\r\nthat I speak of. In attempting to pass through what is exactly of the\r\nshape of a door but through which there was really no passage, I struck\r\nmy forehead against stone and injured myself. The twins Nakula and\r\nSahadeva beholding from a distance that I was so hit at the head came and\r\nsupported me in their arms, expressing great concern for me. And Sahadeva\r\nrepeatedly told me, as if with a smile,--'This O king, is the door. Go\r\nthis way!' And Bhimasena, laughing aloud, addressed me and said,--'O son\r\nof Dhritarashtra, this is the door. And, O king I had not even heard of\r\nthe names of those gems that I saw in that mansion. And it is for these\r\nreasons that my heart so acheth.\""

Beholding that wealth of the foe, I\r\nlost my reason and scarcely knew myself. And, O Bharata, listen as I\r\ndescribe that wealth consisting of both manufactures and the produce of\r\nthe land. The king of Kamboja gave innumerable skins of the best king,\r\nand blankets made of wool, of the soft fur of rodents and other\r\nburroughers, and of the hair of cats,--all inlaid with threads of gold.\r\nAnd he also gave three hundred horses of the Titteti and the Kalmasha\r\nspecies possessing noses like parrots. And he also gave three hundred\r\ncamels and an equal number of she-asses, all fattened with the olives and\r\nthe Pilusha. And innumerable Brahmanas engaged in rearing cattle and\r\noccupied in low offices for the gratification of the illustrious king\r\nYudhishthira the just waited at the gate with three hundred millions of\r\ntribute but they were denied admission into the palace. And hundred upon\r\nhundreds of Brahmanas possessing wealth of kine and living upon the lands\r\nthat Yudhishthira had given them, came there with their handsome golden\r\nKamandalus filled with clarified butter. And though they had brought such\r\ntribute, they were refused admission into the palace. And the Sudra kings\r\nthat dwelt in the regions on the seacoast, brought with them, O king,\r\nhundred thousands of serving girls of the Karpasika country, all of\r\nbeautiful features and slender waist and luxuriant hair and decked in\r\ngolden ornaments; and also many skins of the Ranku deer worthy even of\r\nBrahmanas as tribute unto king Yudhishthira. And the tribes Vairamas,\r\nParadas, Tungas, with the Kitavas who lived upon crops that depended on\r\nwater from the sky or of the river and also they who were born in regions\r\non the sea-shore, in woodlands, or countries on the other side of the\r\nocean waited at the gate, being refused permission to enter, with goats\r\nand kine and asses and camels and vegetable, honey and blankets and\r\njewels and gems of various kinds. And that great warrior king Bhagadatta,\r\nthe brave ruler of Pragjyotisha and the mighty sovereign of the\r\nmlechchas, at the head of a large number of Yavanas waited at the gate\r\nunable to enter, with a considerable tribute comprising of horses of the\r\nbest breed and possessing the speed of the wind. And king Bhagadatta\r\n(beholding the concourse) had to go away from the gate, making over a\r\nnumber of swords with handles made of the purest ivory and well-adorned\r\nwith diamonds and every kind of gems. And many tribes coming from\r\ndifferent regions, of whom some possess two eyes, some three and some had\r\neyes on their foreheads, and those also called Aushmikas, and Nishadas,\r\nand Romakas, some cannibals and many possessing only one leg. I say, O\r\nking, standing at the gate, being refused permission to enter. And these\r\ndiverse rulers brought as tribute ten thousand asses of diverse hues and\r\nblack necks and huge bodies and great speed and much docility and\r\ncelebrated all over the world. And these asses were all of goodly size\r\nand delightful colour. And they were all bred on the coast of Vankhu. And\r\nthere were many kings that gave unto Yudhishthira much gold and silver.\r\nAnd having given much tribute they obtained admission into the palace of\r\nYudhishthira. The people that came there possessing only one leg gave\r\nunto Yudhishthira many wild horses, some of which were as red as the\r\ncochineal, and some white, and some possessing the hues of the rainbow\r\nand some looking like evening clouds, and some that were of variegated\r\ncolour. And they were all endued with the speed of the mind. And they\r\nalso gave unto the king enough gold of superior quality. I also saw\r\nnumberless Chins and Sakas and Uddras and many barbarous tribes living in\r\nthe woods, and many Vrishnis and Harahunas, and dusky tribes of the\r\nHimavat, and many Nipas and people residing in regions on the sea-coast,\r\nwaiting at the gate being refused permission to enter. And the people of\r\nValhika gave unto him as tribute ten thousand asses, of goodly size and\r\nblack necks and daily running two hundred miles, And those asses were of\r\nmany shapes. And they were well-trained and celebrated all over the\r\nworld. And possessed of symmetrical proportion and excellent colour,\r\ntheir skins were pleasant to the touch. And the Valhikas also presented\r\nnumerous blankets of woollen texture manufactured in Chin and numerous\r\nskins of the Ranku deer, and clothes manufactured from jute, and others\r\nwoven with the threads spun by insects. And they also gave thousands of\r\nother clothes not made of cotton, possessing the colour of the lotus. And\r\nthese were all of smooth texture. And they also gave soft sheep-skins by\r\nthousands. And they also gave many sharp and long swords and scimitars,\r\nand hatchets and fine-edged battle-axes manufactured in the western\r\ncountries. And having presented perfumes and jewels and gems of various\r\nkinds by thousands as tribute, they waited at the gate, being refused\r\nadmission into the palace. And the Sakas and Tukhatas and Tukharas and\r\nKankas and Romakas and men with horns bringing with them as tribute\r\nnumerous large elephants and ten thousand horses, and hundreds and\r\nhundreds of millions of gold waited at the gate, being refused permission\r\nto enter. And the kings of the eastern countries having presented\r\nnumerous valuable articles including many costly carpets and vehicles and\r\nbeds, and armours of diverse hues decked with jewels and gold and ivory,\r\nand weapons of various kinds, and cars of various shapes and handsome\r\nmake and adorned with gold, with well-trained horses trimmed with tiger\r\nskins, and rich and variegated blankets for caprisoning elephants, and\r\nvarious kinds of jewels and gems, arrows long and short and various other\r\nkinds of weapons, obtained permission to enter the sacrificial palace of\r\nthe illustrious Pandava!'\""

They that dwell by the side of\r\nthe river Sailoda flowing between the mountains of Mer and Mandara and\r\nenjoy the delicious shade of topes of the Kichaka bamboo, viz., the\r\nKhashas, Ekasanas, the Arhas, the Pradaras, the Dirghavenus, the Paradas,\r\nthe Kulindas, the Tanganas, and the other Tanganas, brought as tribute\r\nheaps of gold measured in dronas (jars) and raised from underneath the\r\nearth by ants and therefore called after these creatures. The mountain\r\ntribes endued with great strength having brought as tribute numerous\r\nChamaras (long brushes) soft and black and others white as moon-beam and\r\nsweet honey extracted from the flowers growing on the Himavat as also\r\nfrom the Mishali champaka and garlands of flowers brought from the region\r\nof the northern Kurus, and diverse kinds of plants from the north even\r\nfrom Kailasa, waited with their heads bent down at the gate of king\r\nYudhishthira, being refused permission to enter. I also beheld there\r\nnumberless chiefs of the Kiratas armed with cruel weapons and ever\r\nengaged in cruel deeds, eating of fruits and roots and attired in skins\r\nand living on the northern slopes of the Himavat and on the mountain from\r\nbehind which the sun rises and in the region of Karusha on the sea-coast\r\nand on both sides of the Lohitya mountains. And, O king, having brought\r\nwith them as tribute loads upon loads of sandal and aloe as also black\r\naloe, and heaps upon heaps of valuable skins and gold and perfumes, and\r\nten thousand serving-girls of their own race, and many beautiful animals\r\nand birds of remote countries, and much gold of great splendour procured\r\nfrom mountains, the Kiratas waited at the gate, being refused permission\r\nto enter. The Kairatas, the Daradas, the Darvas, the Suras, the\r\nVaiamakas, the Audumvaras, the Durvibhagas, the Kumaras, the Paradas\r\nalong with the Vahlikas, the Kashmiras, the Ghorakas, the Hansakayanas,\r\nthe Sivis, the Trigartas, the Yauddheyas, the ruler of Madras and the\r\nKaikeyas, the Amvashtas, the Kaukuras, the Tarkshyas, the Vastrapas along\r\nwith the Palhavas, the Vashatayas, the Mauleyas along with the\r\nKshudrakas, and the Malavas, the Paundrayas, the Kukkuras, the Sakas, the\r\nAngas, the Vangas, the Punras, the Sanavatyas, and the Gayas--these good\r\nand well-born Kshatriyas distributed into regular clans and trained to\r\nthe use of arms, brought tribute unto king Yudhishthira by hundreds and\r\nthousands. And the Vangas, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, the Tamraliptas,\r\nthe Supundrakas, the Dauvalikas, the Sagarakas, the Patrornas, the\r\nSaisavas, and innumerable Karnapravaranas, who presented themselves at\r\nthe gate, were told by the gate-keepers at the command of the king, that\r\nif they could wait and bring good tribute they could obtain admission.\r\nThen the kings of those nations each gave a thousand elephants furnished\r\nwith tusks like unto the shafts of ploughs and decked with girdles made\r\nof gold, and covered with fine blankets and therefore, resembling the\r\nlotus in hue. And they were all darkish as rocks and always musty, and\r\nprocured from the sides of the Kamyaka lake, and covered with defensive\r\narmour. And they were also exceedingly patient and of the best breed. And\r\nhaving made these presents, those kings were permitted to enter. O king,\r\nthese and many others, coming from various regions, and numberless other\r\nillustrious kings, brought jewels and gems unto this sacrifice. And\r\nChitraratha, also the king of Gandharvas, the friend of Indra, gave four\r\nhundred horses gifted with the speed of the wind. And the Gandharva\r\nTumvuru gladly gave a hundred horses of the colour of mango leaf and\r\ndecked in gold. And, O thou of the Kuru race, the celebrated king of the\r\nMlechcha tribe, called the Sukaras, gave many hundreds of excellent\r\nelephants. And Virata, the king of Matsya, gave as tribute two thousand\r\nelephants decked in gold. And king Vasudana from the kingdom of Pansu\r\npresented unto the son of Pandu six and twenty elephants and two thousand\r\nhorses. O king, all decked in gold and endued with speed and strength and\r\nin full vigour of youth, and diverse other kinds of wealth. And Yajnasena\r\npresented unto the sons of Pandu for the sacrifice, fourteen thousand\r\nserving-girls and ten thousand serving-men with their wives, many\r\nhundreds of excellent elephants, six and twenty cars with elephants yoked\r\nunto them, and also his whole kingdom. And Vasudeva of the Vrishni race,\r\nin order to enhance the dignity of Arjuna, gave fourteen thousands of\r\nexcellent elephants. Indeed, Krishna is the soul of Arjuna and Arjuna is\r\nthe soul of Krishna, and whatever Arjuna may say Krishna is certain to\r\naccomplish. And Krishna is capable of abandoning heaven itself for the\r\nsake of Arjuna. and Arjuna also is capable of sacrificing his life for\r\nthe sake of Krishna. And the Kings of Chola and Pandya, though they\r\nbrought numberless jars of gold filled with fragrant sandal juice from\r\nthe hills of Malaya, and loads of sandal and aloe wood from the Dardduras\r\nhills, and many gems of great brilliancy and fine cloths inlaid with\r\ngold, did not obtain permission (to enter). And the king of the Singhalas\r\ngave those best of sea-born gems called the lapis lazuli, and heaps of\r\npearls also, and hundreds of coverlets for elephants. And numberless\r\ndark-coloured men with the ends of their, eyes red as copper, attired in\r\nclothes decked with gems, waited at the gate with those presents. And\r\nnumberless Brahmanas and Kshatriyas who had been vanquished, and Vaisyas\r\nand serving Sudras, from love of Yudhishthira, brought tribute unto the\r\nson of Pandu. And even all the Mlechchas, from love and respect, came\r\nunto Yudhishthira. And all orders of men, good, indifferent and low,\r\nbelonging to numberless races, coming from diverse lands made\r\nYudhishthira's habitation the epitome of the world.\r\n\r\n\"And beholding the kings of the earth to present unto the foes such\r\nexcellent and valuable presents, I wished for death out of grief. And O\r\nking, I will now tell thee of the servants of the Pandavas, people for\r\nwhom Yudhishthira supplieth food, both cooked and uncooked. There are a\r\nhundred thousand billions of mounted elephants and cavalry and a hundred\r\nmillions of cars and countless foot soldiers. At one place raw provisions\r\nare being measured out; at another they are being cooked; and at another\r\nplace the foods are being distributed. And the notes of festivity are\r\nbeing heard everywhere. And amongst men of all orders I beheld not a\r\nsingle one in the mansion of Yudhishthira that had not food and drink and\r\nornaments. And eighty-eight thousands of Snataka Brahmanas leading\r\ndomestic lives, all supported by Yudhishthira, with thirty serving-girls\r\ngiven unto each, gratified by the king, always pray with complacent\r\nhearts for the destruction of his foes. And ten thousands of other\r\nascetics with vital seed drawn up, daily eat of golden plates in\r\nYudhishthira's palace. And, O king, Yajnaseni, without having eaten\r\nherself, daily seeth whether everybody, including even the deformed and\r\nthe dwarfs, hath eaten or not. And, O Bharata, only two do not pay\r\ntribute unto the son of Kunti, viz., the Panchalas in consequence of\r\ntheir relationship by marriage, and the Andhakas and Vrishnis in\r\nconsequence of their friendship."

And, O king, I beheld there many thousands of\r\nwild kine with as many vessels of white copper for milking them, brought\r\nthither by the kings of the earth as sacrificial presents to be given\r\naway by Yudhishthira unto the Brahmana. And, O Bharata, for bathing\r\nYudhishthira at the conclusion of the sacrifice, many kings with the\r\ngreatest alacrity, themselves brought there in a state of purity many\r\nexcellent jars (containing water). And king Vahlika brought there a car\r\ndecked with pure gold. And king Sudakshina himself yoked thereto four\r\nwhite horses of Kamboja breed, and Sunitha of great might fitted the\r\nlower pole and the ruler of Chedi with his own hands took up and fitted\r\nthe flag-staff. And the king of the Southern country stood ready with the\r\ncoat of mail; the ruler of Magadha, with garlands of flowers and the\r\nhead-gear; the great warrior Vasudana with a sixty years old elephant,\r\nthe king of Matsya, with the side-fittings of the car, all encased in\r\ngold; king Ekalavya, with the shoes; the king of Avanti, with diverse\r\nkinds of water for the final bath; king Chekitana, with the quiver; the\r\nking of Kasi, with the bow; and Salya; with a sword whose hilt and straps\r\nwere adorned with gold. Then Dhaumya and Vyasa, of great ascetic merit,\r\nwith Narada and Asita's son Devala, standing before performed the\r\nceremony of sprinkling the sacred water over the king. And the great\r\nRishis with cheerful hearts sat where the sprinkling ceremony was\r\nperformed. And other illustrious Rishis conversant with the Vedas, with\r\nJamadagni's son among them, approached Yudhishthira, the giver of large\r\nsacrificial presents, uttering mantras all the while, like the seven\r\nRishis, approaching the great India in heaven. And Satyaki of unbaffled\r\nprowess held the umbrella (over the king's head). And Dhananjaya and\r\nBhima were engaged in tanning the king; while the twins held a couple of\r\nchamaras in their hands. And the Ocean himself brought in a sling that\r\nbig conch of Varuna which the celestial artificer Viswakarman had\r\nconstructed with a thousand Nishkas of gold, and which Prajapati had in a\r\nformer Kalpa, presented unto India. It was with that conch that Krishna\r\nbathed Yudhishthira after the conclusion of the sacrifice, and beholding\r\nit, I swooned away. People go to the Eastern or the Western seas and also\r\nto the Southern one. But, O father, none except birds can ever go to the\r\nNorthern sea. But the Pandavas have spread their dominion even there, for\r\nI heard hundreds of conches that had been brought thence blown (in the\r\nsacrificial mansion) indicative of auspicious rejoicing. And while those\r\nconches blew simultaneously, my hair stood on end. And those among the\r\nkings, who were weak in strength fell down. And Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nSatyaki and the sons of Pandu and Kesava,--those eight, endued with\r\nstrength and prowess and handsome in person, beholding the kings deprived\r\nof consciousness and myself in that plight, laughed outright. Then\r\nVibhatsu (Arjuna) with a cheerful heart gave, O Bharata, unto the\r\nprincipal Brahmanas five hundred bullocks with horns plated with gold.\r\nAnd king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, having completed the Rajasuya\r\nsacrifice, obtained like the exalted Harishchandra such prosperity that\r\nneither Rantideva nor Nabhaga, nor Jauvanaswa, nor Manu, nor king Prithu\r\nthe son of Vena, nor Bhagiratha, Yayati, nor Nahusha, had obtained its\r\nlike. And beholding, O exalted one, such prosperity, in the son of Pritha\r\nwhich is even like that which Harishchandra had, I do not see the least\r\ngood in continuing to live, O Bharata! O ruler of men, a yoke that is\r\ntied (to the bullock's shoulders) by a blind man becomes loosened. Even\r\nsuch is the case with us. The younger ones are growing while the elder\r\nones are decaying. And beholding all this, O chief of the Kurus, I cannot\r\nenjoy peace even with the aid of reflection. And it is for this, O king,\r\nthat I am plunged into grief and becoming pale and emaciated.\""

O king, thou art of mature\r\nwisdom; thou hast the opportunity to listen to the words of old, and thy\r\nsenses also are under thy control. It behoveth thee not to confound us\r\nwho are ready to seek our own interests. Vrihaspati hath said that the\r\nusage of kings are different from those of common people. Therefore kings\r\nshould always attend to their own interests with vigilance. The\r\nattainment of success is the sole criterion that should guide the conduct\r\nof a Kshatriya. Whether, therefore, the means is virtuous or sinful, what\r\nscruples can there be in the duties of one's own order?

Discontent is the root of prosperity. Therefore, O\r\nking, I desire to be discontented. He that striveth after the acquisition\r\nof prosperity is, O king, a truly politic person. Nobody should be\r\nattached to wealth and affluence, for the wealth that hath been earned\r\nand hoarded may be plundered. The usages of kings are even such. It was\r\nduring a period of peace that Sakra cut off the head of Namuchi after\r\nhaving given a pledge to the contrary, and it was because he approved of\r\nthis eternal usage towards the enemy that he did so. Like a snake that\r\nswalloweth up frogs and other creatures living in holes, the earth\r\nswalloweth up a king that is peaceful and a Brahmana that stirreth not\r\nout of home. O king, none can by nature be any person's foe. He is one's\r\nfoe, and not anybody else, who hath common pursuits with one. He that\r\nfrom folly neglecteth a growing foe, hath his vitals cut off as by a\r\ndisease that he cherished without treatment. A foe, however\r\ninsignificant, if suffered to grow in prowess, swalloweth one like the\r\nwhite ants at the root of a tree eating off the tree itself. O Bharata, O\r\nAjamida, let not the prosperity of the foe be acceptable to thee. This\r\npolicy (of neglecting the foe) should always be borne on their heads by\r\nthe wise even like a load.

Prowess conferreth speedy\r\ngrowth. Coveting as I do the prosperity of the Pandavas. I have not yet\r\nmade it my own. At present I am a prey to doubts in respect of my\r\nability. I am determined to resolve those doubts of mine.

The\r\nking is happy with his sons who are all obedient to him and hath no\r\ngrief. The illustrious monarch is bent on his own aggrandisement. The\r\nking of the Kurus hath commanded me to enquire after thy peace and\r\nprosperity, and to ask thee to repair to Hastinapore with thy brothers\r\nand to say, after beholding king Dhritarashtra's newly erected palace,\r\nwhether that one is equal to thy own. Repairing thither, O son of Pritha,\r\nwith thy brothers, enjoy ye in that mansion and sit to a friendly match\r\nat dice. We shall be glad if thou goest, as the Kurus have already\r\narrived there. And thou wilt see there those gamblers and cheats that the\r\nillustrious king Dhritarashtra hath already brought thither. It is for\r\nthis, O king, that I have come hither. Let the king's command be approved\r\nby thee.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'O Kshatta, if we sit to a match at dice, we may\r\nquarrel. What man is there, who knowing all this, will consent to gamble?\r\nWhat dost thou think fit for us? We all are obedient to thy counsels.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said,--'I know that gambling is the root of misery, and I strove\r\nto dissuade the king from it. The king, however, hath sent me to thee.\r\nHaving known all this, O learned one, do what is beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'Besides the sons of Dhritarashtra what other\r\ndishonest gamblers are there ready for play? Tell us, O Vidura, who they\r\nare and with whom we shall have to play, staking hundreds upon hundreds\r\nof our possessions.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said,--'O monarch, Sakuni, the king of Gandhara, an adept at\r\ndice, having great skill of hand and desperate in stakes, Vivingati, king\r\nChitrasena, Satyavrata, Purumitra and Jaya, these, O king, are there.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'It would seem then that some of the most desperate\r\nand terrible gamblers always depending upon deceit are there. This whole\r\nuniverse, however, is at the will of its Maker, under the control of\r\nfate. It is not free. O learned one, I do not desire, at the command of\r\nking Dhritarashtra to engage myself in gambling. The father always\r\nwisheth to benefit his son. Thou art our master, O Vidura. Tell me what\r\nis proper for us. Unwilling as I am to gamble, I will not do so, if the\r\nwicked Sakuni doth not summon me to it in the Sabha? If, however, he\r\nchallengeth me, I will never refuse. For that, as settled, is my eternal\r\nvow.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"King Yudhishthira the just having said this\r\nunto Vidura, commanded that preparations for his journey might be made\r\nwithout loss of time. And the next day, the king accompanied by his\r\nrelatives and attendants and taking with him also the women of the\r\nhousehold with Draupadi in their midst, set out for the capital of the\r\nKurus. 'Like some brilliant body falling before the eyes, Fate depriveth\r\nus of reason, and man, tied as it were with a cord, submitteth to the\r\nsway of Providence,' saying this, king Yudhishthira, that chastiser of\r\nthe foe, set out with Kshatta, without deliberating upon that summons\r\nfrom Dhritarashtra. And that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Pandu\r\nand Pritha, riding upon the car that had been given him by the king of\r\nValhika, and attired also in royal robes, set out with his brothers. And\r\nthe king, blazing as it were with royal splendour, with Brahmanas walking\r\nbefore him, set out from his city, summoned by Dhritarashtra and impelled\r\nby what hath been ordained by Kala (Time). And arriving at Hastinapore he\r\nwent to the palace of Dhritarashtra. And going there, the son of Pandu\r\napproached the king. And the exalted one then approached Bhishma and\r\nDrona and Karna, and Kripa, and the son of Drona, and embraced and was\r\nembraced by them all. And the mighty-armed one, endued with great\r\nprowess, then approached Somadatta, and then Duryodhana and Salya, and\r\nthe son of Suvala, and those other kings also that had arrived there\r\nbefore him. The king then went to the brave Dusshasana and then to all\r\nhis (other) brothers and then to Jayadratha and next to all the Kurus one\r\nafter another. And the mighty-armed one, then surrounded by all his\r\nbrothers, entered the apartment of the wise king Dhritarashtra. And then\r\nYudhishthira beheld the reverend Gandhari, ever obedient to her lord, and\r\nsurrounded by her daughters-in-law like Rohini by the stars. And saluting\r\nGandhari and blessed by her in return, the king then beheld his old\r\nuncle, that illustrious monarch whose wisdom was his eye. King\r\nDhritarashtra then, O monarch, smelt his head as also the heads of those\r\nfour other princes of the Kuru race, viz., the sons of Pandu with\r\nBhimasena as their eldest. And, O king, beholding--the handsome Pandava\r\nthose tigers among men, all the Kurus became exceedingly glad. And\r\ncommanded by the king, the Pandavas then retired to the chambers allotted\r\nto them and which were all furnished with jewels and gems. And when they\r\nhad retired into the chambers, the women of Dhritarashtra's household\r\nwith Dussala taking the lead visited them. And the daughters-in-law of\r\nDhritarashtra beholding the blazing and splendid beauty and prosperity of\r\nYajnaseni, became cheerless and filled with jealousy. And those tigers\r\namong men, having conversed with the ladies went through their daily\r\nphysical exercises and then performed the religious rites of the day. And\r\nhaving finished their daily devotions, they decked their persons with\r\nsandal paste of the most fragrant kind. And desiring to secure good luck\r\nand prosperity they caused (by gifts) the Brahmanas to utter\r\nbenedictions. And then eating food that was of the best taste they\r\nretired to their chambers for the night. And those bulls among the Kurus\r\nthen were put to sleep with music by handsome females. And obtaining from\r\nthem what came in due succession, those subjugators of hostile towns\r\npassed with cheerful hearts that delightful night in pleasure and sport.\r\nAnd waked by the bards with sweet music, they rose from their beds, and\r\nhaving passed the night thus in happiness, they rose at dawn and having\r\ngone through the usual rites, they entered into the assembly house and\r\nwere saluted by those that were ready there for gambling.\""

Let, therefore, the dice be cast and the\r\nrules of play be fixed, O Yudhishthira.'\r\n\r\n'Yudhishthira replied, 'Deceitful gambling is sinful. There is no\r\nKshatriya prowess in it. There is certainly no morality in it. Why, then,\r\nO king, dost thou praise gambling so? The wise applaud not the pride that\r\ngamesters feel in deceitful play. O Sakuni, vanquish us, not like a\r\nwretch, by deceitful means.'\r\n\r\nSakuni said,--'That high-souled player who knoweth the secrets of winning\r\nand losing, who is skilled in baffling the deceitful arts of his\r\nconfrere, who is united in all the diverse operations of which gambling\r\nconsisteth, truly knoweth the play, and he suffereth all in course of it.\r\nO son of Pritha, it is the staking at dice, which may be lost or won that\r\nmay injure us. And it is for that reason that gambling is regarded as a\r\nfault. Let us, therefore, O king, begin the play. Fear not. Let the\r\nstakes be fixed. Delay not!'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'That best of Munis, Devala, the son of Asita, who\r\nalways instructeth us about all those acts that may lead to heaven, hell,\r\nor the other regions, hath said, that it is sinful to play deceitfully\r\nwith a gamester. To obtain victory in battle without cunning or stratagem\r\nis the best sport. Gambling, however, as a sport, is not so. Those that\r\nare respectable never use the language of the Mlechchas, nor do they\r\nadopt deceitfulness in their behaviour. War carried on without\r\ncrookedness and cunning, this is the act of men that are honest. Do not,\r\nO Sakuni, playing desperately, win of us that wealth with which according\r\nto our abilities, we strive to learn how to benefit the Brahmanas. Even\r\nenemies should not be vanquished by desperate stakes in deceitful play. I\r\ndo not desire either happiness or wealth by means of cunning. The conduct\r\nof one that is a gamester, even if it be without deceitfulness, should\r\nnot be applauded.'\r\n\r\n\"Sakuni said,--'O Yudhishthira, it is from a desire of winning, which is\r\nnot a very honest motive, that one high-born person approacheth another\r\n(in a contest of race superiority). So also it is from a desire of\r\ndefeating, which is not a very honest motive, that one learned person\r\napproacheth another (in a contest of learning). Such motives, however,\r\nare scarcely regarded as really dishonest. So also, O Yudhishthira, a\r\nperson skilled at dice approacheth one that is not so skilled from a\r\ndesire of vanquishing him. One also who is conversant with the truths of\r\nscience approacheth another that is not from desire of victory, which is\r\nscarcely an honest motive. But (as I have already said) such a motive is\r\nnot really dishonest. And, O Yudhishthira, so also one that is skilled in\r\nweapons approacheth one that is not so skilled; the strong approacheth\r\nthe weak. This is the practice in every contest. The motive is victory, O\r\nYudhishthira. If, therefore, thou, in approaching me, regardest me to be\r\nactuated by motives that are dishonest, if thou art under any fear,\r\ndesist then from play.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'Summoned, I do not withdraw. This is my established\r\nvow. And, O king, Fate is all powerful. We all are under the control of\r\nDestiny. With whom in this assembly am I to play? Who is there that can\r\nstake equally with me?

And it is for me that this Sakuni, my uncle, will play.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said,--'Gambling for one's sake by the agency of another\r\nseemeth to me to be contrary to rule.

Know, O\r\nking, that he will be the cause of death of ye all. A jackal is living in\r\nthy house, O king, in the form of Duryodhana. Thou knowest it not in\r\nconsequence of thy folly. Listen now to the words of the Poet (Sukra)\r\nwhich I will quote. They that collect honey (in mountains), having\r\nreceived what they seek, do not notice that they are about to fall.\r\nAscending dangerous heights, abstracted in the pursuit of what they seek,\r\nthey fall down and meet with destruction. This Duryodhana also, maddened\r\nwith the play at dice, like the collector of honey, abstracted in what he\r\nseeketh, marketh not the consequences. Making enemies of these great\r\nwarriors, he beholdeth not the fall that is before him. It is known to\r\nthee, O thou of great wisdom, that amongst the Bhojas, they abandoned,\r\nfor the good of the citizens a son that was unworthy of their race. The\r\nAndhakas, the Yadavas, and the Bhojas uniting together, abandoned Kansa.\r\nAnd afterwards, when at the command of the whole tribe, the same Kansa\r\nhad been slain by Krishna that slayer of foes, all the men of the tribe\r\nbecame exceedingly happy for a hundred years. So at thy command, let\r\nArjuna slay this Suyodhana. And in consequence of the slaying of this\r\nwretch, let the Kurus be glad and pass their days in happiness. In\r\nexchange of a crow, O great king, buy these peacocks--the Pandavas; and\r\nin exchange of a jackal, buy these tigers.

Even\r\nthis was what the omniscient Kavya himself, acquainted with the thoughts\r\nof every creature, and a source of terror unto all foes, said unto the\r\ngreat Asuras to induce them to abandon Jambha at the moment of his birth.\r\nIt is said that a certain king, having caused a number of wild birds that\r\nvomited gold to take up their quarters in his own house, afterwards\r\nkilled them from temptation. O slayer of foes, blinded by temptation and\r\nthe desire of enjoyment, for the sake of gold, the king destroyed at the\r\nsame time both his present and future gains. Therefore, O king, prosecute\r\nnot the Pandavas from desire of profit, even like the king in story. For\r\nthen, blinded by folly thou wilt have to repent afterwards, even like the\r\nperson that killed the birds. Like a flower-seller that plucketh (many\r\nflowers) in the garden from trees that he cherisheth with affection from\r\nday to day, continue, O Bharata, to pluck flowers day by day from the\r\nPandavas. Do not scorch them to their roots like a fire-producing breeze\r\nthat reduceth everything to black charcoal.

But consider that he is a child who having first accepted one for\r\na friend, subsequently findeth fault with him. An evil-hearted man can\r\nnever be brought to the path of rectitude, like an unchaste wife in the\r\nhouse of a well-born person. Assuredly, instruction is not agreeable to\r\nthis bull of the Bharata race like a husband of sixty years to a damsel\r\nthat is young. After this, O king, if thou wishest to hear words that are\r\nagreeable to thee, in respect of all acts good or bad, ask thou women and\r\nidiots and cripples or persons of that description. A sinful man speaking\r\nwords that are agreeable may be had in this world. But a speaker of words\r\nthat are disagreeable though sound as regimen, or a hearer of the same,\r\nis very rare. He indeed, is a king's true ally who disregarding what is\r\nagreeable or disagreeable to his master beareth himself virtuously and\r\nuttereth what may be disagreeable but necessary as regimen. O great king,\r\ndrink thou that which the honest drink and the dishonest shun, even\r\nhumility, which is like a medicine that is bitter, pungent, burning,\r\nunintoxicating, disagreeable, and revolting. And drinking it, O king,\r\nregain thou thy sobriety. I always wish Dhritarashtra and his sons\r\naffluence and fame. Happen what may unto thee, here I bow to thee (and\r\ntake my leave). Let the Brahmanas wish me well. O son of Kuru, this is\r\nthe lesson I carefully inculcate, that the wise should never enrage such\r\nas adders as have venom in their very glances!\""

In my judgement, slavery does\r\nnot attach to Krishna, in as much as she was staked by the King after he\r\nhad lost himself and ceased to be his own master. Like the bamboo that\r\nbeareth fruit only when it is about to die, the son of Dhritarashtra\r\nwinneth this treasure at play. Intoxicated, he perceiveth nor in these\r\nhis last moments that dice bring about enmity and frightful terrors. No\r\nman should utter harsh speeches and pierce the hearts of the others. No\r\nman should subjugate his enemies by dice and such other foul means. No\r\none should utter such words as are disapproved by the Vedas and lead to\r\nhell and annoy others. Some one uttereth from his lips words that are\r\nharsh. Stung by them another burneth day and night. These words pierce\r\nthe very heart of another. The learned, therefore, should never utter\r\nthem, pointing them at others. A goat had once swallowed a hook, and when\r\nit was pierced with it, the hunter placing the head of the animal on the\r\nground tore its throat frightfully in drawing it out. Therefore, O\r\nDuryodhana, swallow not the wealth of the Pandavas. Make them not thy\r\nenemies. The sons of Pritha never use words such as these.

And he said,--'Yudhishthira\r\nhaving been intoxicated with dice, Duryodhana, O Draupadi, hath won thee.\r\nCome now, therefore, to the abode of Dhritarashtra. I will take thee, O\r\nYajnaseni, and put thee in some menial work.'\r\n\r\nDraupadi said,--'Why, O Pratikamin, dost thou say so? What prince is\r\nthere who playeth staking his wife? The king was certainly intoxicated\r\nwith dice. Else, could he not find any other object to stake?'\r\n\r\n\"The Pratikamin said,--'When he had nothing else to stake, it was then\r\nthat Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu, staked thee. The king had first staked\r\nhis brothers, then himself, and then thee, O princess.'\r\n\r\n\"Draupadi said,--'O son of the Suta race, go, and ask that gambler\r\npresent in the assembly, whom he hath lost first, himself, or me.\r\nAscertaining this, come hither, and then take me with thee, O son of the\r\nSuta race.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"The messenger coming back to the assembly told\r\nall present the words of Draupadi. And he spoke unto Yudhishthira sitting\r\nin the midst of the kings, these words,--Draupadi hath asked thee, Whose\r\nlord wert thou at the time thou lost me in play? Didst thou lose thyself\r\nfirst or me? Yudhishthira, however sat there like one demented and\r\ndeprived of reason and gave no answer good or ill to the Suta.\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana then said,--'Let the princess of Panchala come hither and put\r\nher question. Let every one hear in this assembly the words that pass\r\nbetween her and Yudhishthira.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"The messenger, obedient to the command of\r\nDuryodhana, going once again to the palace, himself much distressed, said\r\nunto Draupadi,--'O princess, they that are in the assembly are summoning\r\nthee. It seemeth that the end of the Kauravas is at hand. When\r\nDuryodhana, O princess, is for taking thee before the assembly, this\r\nweak-brained king will no longer be able to protect his prosperity.'\r\n\r\n\"Draupadi said,--'The great ordainer of the world hath, indeed, ordained\r\nso. Happiness and misery pay their court to both the wise and unwise.\r\nMorality, however, it hath been said, is the one highest object in the\r\nworld. If cherished, that will certainly dispense blessings to us. Let\r\nnot that morality now abandon the Kauravas. Going back to those that are\r\npresent in that assembly, repeat these my words consonant with morality.\r\nI am ready to do what those elderly and virtuous persons conversant with\r\nmorality will definitely tell me.\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"The Suta, hearing these words of Yajnaseni,\r\ncame back to the assembly and repeated the words of Draupadi. But all sat\r\nwith faces downwards, uttering not a word, knowing the eagerness and\r\nresolution of Dhritarashtra's son.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira, however, O bull of the Bharata race, hearing of\r\nDuryodhana's intentions, sent a trusted messenger unto Draupadi,\r\ndirecting that although she was attired in one piece of cloth with her\r\nnavel itself exposed, in consequence of her season having come, she\r\nshould come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly. And that\r\nintelligent messenger, O king, having gone to Draupadi's abode with\r\nspeed, informed her of the intentions of Yudhishthira. The illustrious\r\nPandavas, meanwhile, distressed and sorrowful, and bound by promise,\r\ncould not settle what they should do. And casting his eyes upon them,\r\nking Duryodhana, glad at heart, addressed the Suta and said,--'O\r\nPratikamin, bring her hither. Let the Kauravas answer her question before\r\nher face. The Suta, then, obedient to his commands, but terrified at the\r\n(possible) wrath of the daughter of Drupada, disregarding his reputation\r\nfor intelligence, once again said to those that were in the\r\nassembly,--what shall I say unto Krishna?'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana, hearing this, said,--'O Dussasana, this son of my Suta, of\r\nlittle intelligence, feareth Vrikodara. Therefore, go thou thyself and\r\nforcibly bring hither the daughter of Yajnasena, Our enemies at present\r\nare dependent on our will. What can they do thee?' Hearing the command of\r\nhis brother, prince Dussasana rose with blood-red eyes, and entering the\r\nabode of those great warriors, spake these words unto the princess,\r\n'Come, come, O Krishna, princess of Panchala, thou hast been won by us.\r\nAnd O thou of eyes large as lotus leaves, come now and accept the Kurus\r\nfor thy lords. Thou hast been won virtuously, come to the assembly.' At\r\nthese words, Draupadi, rising up in great affliction, rubbed her pale\r\nface with her hands, and distressed she ran to the place where the ladies\r\nof Dhritarashtra's household were. At this, Dussasana roaring in anger,\r\nran after her and seized the queen by her locks, so long and blue and\r\nwavy. Alas! those locks that had been sprinkled with water sanctified\r\nwith mantras in the great Rajasuya sacrifice, were now forcibly seized by\r\nthe son of Dhritarashtra disregarding the prowess of the Pandavas. And\r\nDussasana dragging Krishna of long long locks unto the presence of the\r\nassembly--as if she were helpless though having powerful protectors--and\r\npulling at her, made her tremble like the banana plant in a storm. And\r\ndragged by him, with body bent, she faintly cried--'Wretch! it ill\r\nbehoveth thee to take me before the assembly. My season hath come, and I\r\nam now clad in one piece of attire. But Dussasana dragging Draupadi\r\nforcibly by her black locks while she was praying piteously unto Krishna\r\nand Vishnu who were Narayana and Nara (on earth), said unto her--'Whether\r\nthy season hath come or not, whether thou art attired in one piece of\r\ncloth or entirely naked, when thou hast been won at dice and made our\r\nslave, thou art to live amongst our serving-women as thou pleasest.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"With hair dishevelled and half her attire\r\nloosened, all the while dragged by Dussasana, the modest Krishna consumed\r\nwith anger, faintly said--\"In this assembly are persons conversant with\r\nall the branches of learning devoted to the performance of sacrifices and\r\nother rites, and all equal unto Indra, persons some of whom are really my\r\nsuperiors and others who deserve to be respected as such. I can not stay\r\nbefore them in this state. O wretch! O thou of cruel deeds, drag me not\r\nso. Uncover me not so. The princes (my lords) will not pardon thee, even\r\nif thou hast the gods themselves with Indra as thy allies. The\r\nillustrious son of Dharma is now bound by the obligations of morality.\r\nMorality, however, is subtle. Those only that are possessed of great\r\nclearness of vision can ascertain it. In speech even I am unwilling to\r\nadmit an atom of fault in my lord forgetting his virtues. Thou draggest\r\nme who am in my season before these Kuru heroes. This is truly an\r\nunworthy act. But no one here rebuketh thee. Assuredly, all these are of\r\nthe same mind with thee. O fie! Truly hath the virtue of the Bharata\r\ngone! Truly also hath the usage of those acquainted with the Kshatriya\r\npractice disappeared! Else these Kurus in this assembly would never have\r\nlooked silently on this act that transgresseth the limits of their\r\npractices. Oh! both Drona and Bhishma have lost their energy, and so also\r\nhath the high-souled Kshatta, and so also this king. Else, why do these\r\nforemost of the Kuru elders look silently on this great crime?\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Thus did Krishna of slender waist cry in\r\ndistress in that assembly. And casting a glance upon her enraged\r\nlords--the Pandavas--who were filled with terrible wrath, she inflamed\r\nthem further with that glance of hers. And they were not so distressed at\r\nhaving been robbed of their kingdom, of their wealth, of their costliest\r\ngems, as with that glance of Krishna moved by modesty and anger. And\r\nDussasana, beholding Krishna looking at her helpless lords, dragging her\r\nstill more forcibly, and addressed her, 'Slave, Slave' and laughed aloud.\r\nAnd at those words Karna became very glad and approved of them by\r\nlaughing aloud. And Sakuni, the son of Suvala, the Gandhara king,\r\nsimilarly applauded Dussasana. And amongst all those that were in the\r\nassembly except these three and Duryodhana, every one was filled with\r\nsorrow at beholding Krishna thus dragged in sight of that assembly. And\r\nbeholding it all, Bhishma said, 'O blessed one, morality is subtle. I\r\ntherefore am unable to duly decide this point that thou hast put,\r\nbeholding that on the one hand one that hath no wealth cannot stake the\r\nwealth belonging to others, while on the other hand wives are always\r\nunder the orders and at the disposal of their lords. Yudhishthira can\r\nabandon the whole world full of wealth, but he will never sacrifice\r\nmorality. The son of Pandu hath said--'I am won.' Therefore, I am unable\r\nto decide this matter. Sakuni hath not his equal among men at dice-play.\r\nThe son of Kunti still voluntarily staked with him. The illustrious\r\nYudhishthira doth not himself regard that Sakuni hath played with him\r\ndeceitfully. Therefore, I can not decide this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Draupadi said,--\"The king was summoned to this assembly and though\r\npossessing no skill at dice, he was made to play with skilful, wicked,\r\ndeceitful and desperate gamblers. How can he be said then to have staked\r\nvoluntarily? The chief of the Pandavas was deprived of his senses by\r\nwretches of deceitful conduct and unholy instincts, acting together, and\r\nthen vanquished. He could not understand their tricks, but he hath now\r\ndone so. Here, in this assembly, there are Kurus who are the lords of\r\nboth their sons and their daughters-in-law! Let all of them, reflecting\r\nwell upon my words, duly decide the point that I have put.\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--'Unto Krishna who was thus weeping and crying\r\npiteously, looking at times upon her helpless lord, Dussasana spake many\r\ndisagreeable and harsh words. And beholding her who was then in her\r\nseason thus dragged, and her upper garments loosened, beholding her in\r\nthat condition which she little deserved, Vrikodara afflicted beyond\r\nendurance, his eyes fixed upon Yudhishthira, gave way to wrath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bhima said,--'O Yudhishthira, gamblers have in their houses many women\r\nof loose character. They do not yet stake those women having kindness for\r\nthem even. Whatever wealth and other excellent articles the king of Kasi\r\ngave, whatever, gems, animals, wealth, coats of mail and weapons that\r\nother kings of the earth gave, our kingdom, thyself and ourselves, have\r\nall been won by the foes. At all this my wrath was not excited for thou\r\nart our lord. This, however, I regard as a highly improper act--this act\r\nof staking Draupadi. This innocent girl deserveth not this treatment.\r\nHaving obtained the Pandavas as her lords, it is for thee alone that she\r\nis being thus persecuted by the low, despicable, cruel, and mean-minded\r\nKauravas. It is for her sake, O king, that my anger falleth on thee. I\r\nshall burn those hands of thine. Sahadeva, bring some fire.\"\r\n\r\n'Arjuna hearing this, said,--'Thou hast never, O Bhimasena, before this\r\nuttered such words as these. Assuredly thy high morality hath been\r\ndestroyed by these cruel foes. Thou shouldst not fulfil the wishes of the\r\nenemy. Practise thou the highest morality. Whom doth it behave to\r\ntransgress his virtuous eldest brother? The king was summoned by the foe,\r\nand remembering the usage of the Kshatriyas, he played at dice against\r\nhis will. That is certainly conducive to our great fame.\r\n\r\n'Bhima said,--'If I had not known, O Dhananjaya, that the king had acted\r\naccording to Kshatriya usage, then I would have, taking his hands\r\ntogether by sheer force, burnt them in a blazing fire.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Beholding the Pandavas thus distressed and the\r\nprincess of Panchala also thus afflicted, Vikarna the son of\r\nDhritarashtra said--'Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath been\r\nasked by Yajnaseni. If we do not judge a matter referred to us, all of us\r\nwill assuredly have to go to hell without delay. How is that Bhishma and\r\nDhritarashtra, both of whom are the oldest of the Kurus, as also the\r\nhigh-souled Vidura, do not say anything! The son of Bharadwaja who is the\r\npreceptor of us, as also Kripa, is here. Why do not these best of\r\nregenerate ones answer the question? Let also those other kings assembled\r\nhere from all directions answer according to their judgment this\r\nquestion, leaving aside all motives of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer\r\nye the question that hath been asked by this blessed daughter of king\r\nDrupada, and declare after reflection on which side each of ye is.' Thus\r\ndid Vikarna repeatedly appeal to those that were in that assembly. But\r\nthose kings answered him not one word, good or ill. And Vikarna having\r\nrepeatedly appealed to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like\r\na snake. And at last the prince said--'Ye kings of the earth, ye\r\nKauravas, whether ye answer this question or not, I will say what I\r\nregard as just and proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that\r\nhunting, drinking, gambling, and too much enjoyment of women, are the\r\nfour vices of kings. The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking\r\nvirtue. And people do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus\r\nimproperly engaged, as of any authority. This son of Pandu, while deeply\r\nengaged in one of these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful\r\ngamblers, made Draupadi a stake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the\r\ncommon wife of all the sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost\r\nhimself offered her as a stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake,\r\nindeed prevailed upon the king to stake this Krishna. Reflecting upon all\r\nthese circumstances, I regard Draupadi as not won.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that\r\nassembly. And they all applauded Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala.\r\nAnd at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger,\r\nwaving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--'O Vikarna, many opposite\r\nand inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly. Like fire\r\nproduced from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will\r\nconsume thee. These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not\r\nuttered a word. They all regard the daughter of Drupada to have been\r\nproperly won. Thou alone, O son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy\r\nimmature years, art bursting with wrath, for though but a boy thou\r\nspeakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. O younger brother of\r\nDuryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, for thou sayest\r\nlike a fool that this Krishna who hath been (justly) won as not won at\r\nall. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won,\r\nwhen the eldest of the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his\r\npossessions? O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in all the\r\npossessions (of Yudhishthira). Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who\r\nhath been justly won as not won? Draupadi had been mentioned (by Suvala)\r\nand approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. For what reason then dost\r\nthou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou thinkest that bringing her\r\nhither attired in a single piece of cloth, is an action of impropriety,\r\nlisten to certain excellent reasons I will give. O son of the Kuru race,\r\nthe gods have ordained only one husband for one woman. This Draupadi,\r\nhowever, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain it is that she is an\r\nunchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this assembly attired\r\nthough she be in one piece of cloth--even to uncover her is not at all an\r\nact that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas had--she\r\nherself and these Pandavas themselves,--have all been justly won by the\r\nson of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words of (apparent)\r\nwisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the\r\nattire of Draupadi. Hearing these words the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of\r\ntheir upper garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then\r\nDussasana, O king, forcibly seizing Draupadi's attire before the eyes of\r\nall, began to drag it off her person.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"When the attire of Draupadi was being thus\r\ndragged, the thought of Hari, (And she herself cried aloud, saying), 'O\r\nGovinda, O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond\r\nof cow-herdesses (of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the\r\nKauravas are humiliating me. O Lord, O husband of Lakshmi, O Lord of\r\nVraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue\r\nme who am sinking in the Kaurava Ocean. O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou\r\ngreat yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou creator of all things, O\r\nGovinda, save me who am distressed,--who am losing my senses in the midst\r\nof the Kurus.' Thus did that afflicted lady resplendent still in her\r\nbeauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of Krishna, of\r\nHari, of the lord of the three worlds. Hearing the words of Draupadi,\r\nKrishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent one from\r\ncompassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud\r\nto Krishna, also called Vishnu and Hari and Nara for protection, the\r\nillustrious Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes\r\nof many hues. And, O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged,\r\nafter one was taken off, another of the same kind, appeared covering her.\r\nAnd thus did it continue till many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on,\r\nowing to the protection of Dharma, hundreds upon hundreds of robes of\r\nmany hues came off Draupadi's person. And there arose then a deep uproar\r\nof many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly beholding\r\nthat most extraordinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud\r\nDraupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then, squeezing\r\nhis hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those\r\nkings a terrible oath in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"And Bhima said,--Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world.\r\nWords such as these were never before uttered by other men, nor will\r\nanybody in the future ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having\r\nspoken these words I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain\r\nthe region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in battle, by sheer\r\nforce, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel of the\r\nBharata race, if I do not drink his life-blood, let me not obtain the\r\nregion of my ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these terrible words of Bhima that made\r\nthe down of the auditors to stand on end, everybody present there\r\napplauded him and censured the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of\r\nclothes had been gathered in that assembly, all dragged from the person\r\nof Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed, sat down. And beholding the\r\nsons of Kunti in that state, the persons--those gods among men--that were\r\nin that assembly all uttered the word 'Fie!'(on the son of\r\nDhritarashtra). And the united voices of all became so loud that they\r\nmade the down of anybody who heard them stand on end. And all the honest\r\nmen that were in that assembly began to say,--'Alas! the Kauravas answer\r\nnot the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all\r\ncensuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that\r\nmaster of the science of morality, waving his hands and silencing every\r\none, spake these words;--'Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having\r\nput her question is weeping helplessly. Ye are not answering her. Virtue\r\nand morality are being persecuted by such conduct. An afflicted person\r\napproacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by\r\nfire. They that are in the assembly quench that fire and cool him by\r\nmeans of truth and morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly\r\nabout his rights, as sanctioned by morality. They that are in the\r\nassembly should, unmoved by interest and anger, answer the question. Ye\r\nkings, Vikarna hath answered the question, according to his own knowledge\r\nand judgment. Ye should also answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the\r\nrules of morality, and having attended an assembly, he that doth not\r\nanswer a query that is put, incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to\r\na lie. He, on the other hand, who, knowing the rules of morality and\r\nhaving joined an assembly answereth falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin\r\nof a lie. The learned quote as an example in this connection the old\r\nhistory of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.\r\n\r\n\"There was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a\r\nson named Virochana. And Virochana, for the sake of obtaining a bride,\r\nquarrelled with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us\r\nthat they mutually wagered their lives, saying--I am superior,--I am\r\nsuperior,--for the sake of obtaining a bride. And after they had thus\r\nquarrelled with each other, they both made Prahlada the arbitrator to\r\ndecide between them. And they asked him, saying;--Who amongst us is\r\nsuperior (to the other)? Answer this question. Speak not falsely.\r\nFrightened at this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon Sudhanwan. And\r\nSudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of Yama, told him,--If thou\r\nanswerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will then be split\r\ninto a hundred pieces by the wielder of the thunderbolt with that bolt of\r\nhis.--Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like a leaf of\r\nthe fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with\r\nhim. And Prahlada said,--'Thou art, O illustrious and exalted one, fully\r\nconversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and\r\nthe Asuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of\r\ngreat difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask thee, what regions\r\nare obtainable by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or\r\nanswer it falsely. Kasyapa thus asked answered.--'He that knoweth, but\r\nanswereth not a question from temptation, anger or fear, casteth upon\r\nhimself a thousand nooses of Varuna. And the person who, cited as a\r\nwitness with respect to any matter of ocular or auricular knowledge,\r\nspeaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand nooses of Varuna upon his own\r\nperson. On the completion of one full year, one such noose is loosened.\r\nTherefore, he that knoweth, should speak the truth without concealment.\r\nIf virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an assembly (for aid), it is the\r\nduty of every body in the assembly to take off the dart, otherwise they\r\nthemselves would be pierced with it. In an assembly where a truly\r\ncensurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit of that act attacheth to\r\nthe head of that assembly, a fourth to the person acting censurably and a\r\nfourth unto those others that are there. In that assembly, on the other\r\nhand, when he that deserveth censure is rebuked, the head of the assembly\r\nbecometh freed from all sins, and the other members also incur none. It\r\nis only the perpetrator himself of the act that becometh responsible for\r\nit. O Prahlada, they who answer falsely those that ask them about\r\nmorality destroy the meritorious acts of their seven upper and seven\r\nlower generations. The grief of one who hath lost all his wealth, of one\r\nwho hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one who is separated from\r\nhis companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of one that hath\r\nlost his all in consequence of the king's demand, of a woman who is\r\nsterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last\r\nstruggles in the tiger's claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who\r\nhath been deprived of his property by false witnesses, have been said by\r\nthe gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his\r\nwho speaketh false. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his\r\nhaving seen, heard, and understood a thing. Therefore, a witness should\r\nalways tell the truth. A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious\r\nmerits and earthly possessions also.' Hearing these words of Kasyapa,\r\nPrahlada told his son, \"Sudhanwan is superior to thee, as indeed, (his\r\nfather) Angiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan is\r\nsuperior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this Sudhanwan is now the\r\nlord of the life.\" At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, \"Since\r\nunmoved by affection for thy child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I\r\ncommand, let this son of thine live for a hundred years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued,--Let all the persons, therefore, present in this\r\nassembly hearing these high truths of morality, reflect upon what should\r\nbe the answer to the question asked by Draupadi\".\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"The kings that were there hearing these words\r\nof Vidura, answered not a word, yet Karna alone spoke unto Dussasana,\r\ntelling him. Take away this serving-woman Krishna into the inner\r\napartments. And thereupon Dussasana began to drag before all the\r\nspectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and crying\r\npiteously unto the Pandavas her lords.\""

Dragged forcibly by this wretch's strong arms, I was\r\ndeprived of my senses. I salute these reverend seniors in this assembly\r\nof the Kurus. That I could not do this before cannot be my fault.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"Dragged with greater force than before, the\r\nafflicted and helpless Draupadi, undeserving of such treatment, falling\r\ndown upon the ground, thus wept in that assembly of the Kurus,--\r\n\r\n\"'Alas, only once before, on the occasion of the Swayamvara, I was beheld\r\nby the assembled kings in the amphitheatre, and never even once beheld\r\nafterwards. I am to-day brought before this assembly. She whom even the\r\nwinds and the sun had seen never before in her palace is to-day before\r\nthis assembly and exposed to the gaze of the crowd. Alas, she whom the\r\nsons of Pandu could not, while in her palace, suffer to be touched even\r\nby the wind, is to-day suffered by the Pandavas to be seized and dragged\r\nby this wretch. Alas, these Kauravas also suffer their daughter-in-law,\r\nso unworthy of such treatment, to be thus afflicted before them. It\r\nseemeth that the times are out of joint. What can be more distressing to\r\nme, than that though high-born and chaste, I should yet be compelled to\r\nenter this public court? Where is that virtue for which these kings were\r\nnoted? It hath been heard that the kings of ancient days never brought\r\ntheir wedded wives into the public court. Alas, that eternal usage hath\r\ndisappeared from among the Kauravas. Else, how is it that the chaste wife\r\nof the Pandavas, the sister of Prishata's son, the friend of Vasudeva, is\r\nbrought before this assembly? Ye Kauravas, I am the wedded wife of king\r\nYudhishthira the just, hailing from the same dynasty to which the King\r\nbelonged. Tell me now if I am a serving-maid or otherwise. I will\r\ncheerfully accept your answer. This mean wretch, this destroyer of the\r\nname of the Kurus, is afflicting me hard. Ye Kauravas, I cannot bear it\r\nany longer. Ye kings, I desire ye to answer whether ye regard me as won\r\nor unwon. I will accept your verdict whatever it be.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words, Bhishma answered, I have already said, O blessed\r\none that the course of morality is subtle. Even the illustrious wise in\r\nthis world fail to understand it always. What in this world a strong man\r\ncalls morality is regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may\r\nreally be; but what a weak man calls morality is scarcely regarded as\r\nsuch even if it be the highest morality. From the importance of the issue\r\ninvolved, from its intricacy and subtlety, I am unable to answer with\r\ncertitude the question thou hast asked. However, it is certain that as\r\nall the Kurus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the\r\ndestruction of this our race will happen on no distant date. O blessed\r\none, the family into which thou hast been admitted as a daughter-in-law,\r\nis such that those who are born in it, however much they might be\r\nafflicted by calamities, never deviate from the paths of virtue and\r\nmorality. O Princess of Panchala, this conduct of thine also, viz. that\r\nthough sunk in distress, thou still easiest thy eyes on virtue and\r\nmorality, is assuredly worthy of thee. These persons, Drona and others,\r\nof mature years and conversant with morality, sit heads downwards like\r\nmen that are dead, with bodies from which life hath departed. It seemeth\r\nto me, however, that Yudhishthira is an authority on this question. It\r\nbehoveth him to declare whether thou art won or not won.\""

Let them answer\r\nthy question. O Panchali, let them for thy sake declare in the midst of\r\nthese respectable men that Yudhishthira is not their lord, let them\r\nthereby make king Yudhishthira the just a liar. Thou shalt then be freed\r\nfrom the condition of slavery. Let the illustrious son of Dharma, always\r\nadhering to virtue, who is even like Indra, himself declare whether he is\r\nnot thy lord. At his words, accept thou the Pandavas or ourselves without\r\ndelay. Indeed, all the Kauravas present in this assembly are floating in\r\nthe ocean of thy distress.

And shouting\r\napprovingly, they made signs unto one another by motions of their eyes\r\nand lips. And amongst some that were there, sounds of distress such as\r\n'O! and 'Alas!\" were heard. And at these words of Duryodhana, so\r\ndelightful (to his partisans), the Kauravas present in that assembly\r\nbecame exceedingly glad. And the kings, with faces turned sideways,\r\nlooked upon Yudhishthira conversant with the rules of morality, curious\r\nto hear what he would say. And every one present in that assembly became\r\ncurious to hear what Arjuna, the son of Pandu never defeated in battle,\r\nand what Bhimasena, and what the twins also would say. And when that busy\r\nhum of many voices became still, Bhimasena, waving his strong and\r\nwell-formed arms smeared with sandalpaste spake these words,--'If this\r\nhigh-souled king Yudhishthira the just, who is our eldest brother, had\r\nnot been our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race (for all\r\nthis). He is the lord of all our religious and ascetic merits, the lord\r\nof even our lives. If he regardeth himself as won, we too have all been\r\nwon. If this were not so, who is there amongst creatures touching the\r\nearth with their feet and mortal, that would escape from me with his life\r\nafter having touched those locks of the princess of Panchala? Behold\r\nthese mighty, well-formed arms of mine, even like maces of iron. Having\r\nonce come within them, even he of a hundred sacrifices is incapable of\r\neffecting an escape. Bound by the ties of virtue and the reverence that\r\nis due to our eldest brother, and repeatedly urged by Arjuna to remain\r\nsilent, I am not doing anything terrible. If however, I am once commanded\r\nby king Yudhishthira the just, I would slay these wretched sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, making slaps do the work of swords, like a lion slaying a\r\nnumber of little animals.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Unto Bhima who had spoken these words Bhishma\r\nand Drona and Vidura said, 'Forbear, O Bhima.

O excellent one, the slave, the son, and\r\nthe wife are always dependent. They cannot earn wealth, for whatever they\r\nearn belongeth to their master. Thou art the wife of a slave incapable of\r\npossessing anything on his own account. Repair now to the inner\r\napartments of king Dhritarashtra and serve the king's relatives. We\r\ndirect that that is now thy proper business. And, O princess, all the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra and not the sons of Pritha are now thy masters. O\r\nhandsome one, select thou another husband now,--one who will not make\r\nthee a slave by gambling. It is well-known that women, especially that\r\nare slaves, are not censurable if they proceed with freedom in electing\r\nhusbands. Therefore let it be done by thee. Nakula hath been won, as also\r\nBhimasena, and Yudhishthira also, and Sahadeva, and Arjuna. And, O\r\nYajnaseni, thou art now a slave. Thy husbands that are slaves cannot\r\ncontinue to be thy lords any longer.

Obedient to the king and bound by\r\nthe tie of virtue and duty, burning everything with his eyes inflamed by\r\nanger, he said,--'O king, I cannot be angry at these words of this son of\r\na Suta, for we have truly entered the state of servitude. But O king,\r\ncould our enemies have said so unto me, it thou hadst not played staking\r\nthis princess?'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Bhimasena king\r\nDuryodhana addressed Yudhishthira who was silent and deprived of his\r\nsenses, saying,--'O king, both Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins also, are\r\nunder thy sway. Answer thou the question (that hath been asked by\r\nDraupadi). Say, whether thou regardest Krishna as unwon.' And having\r\nspoken thus unto the son of Kunti, Duryodhana. desirous of encouraging\r\nthe son of Radha and insulting Bhima, quickly uncovered his left thigh\r\nthat was like unto the stem of a plantain tree or the trunk of an\r\nelephant and which was graced with every auspicious sign and endued with\r\nthe strength of thunder, and showed it to Draupadi in her very sight. And\r\nbeholding this, Bhimasena expanding his red eyes, said unto Duryodhana in\r\nthe midst of all those kings and as if piercing them (with his dart-like\r\nwords),--'Let not Vrikodara attain to the regions, obtained by his\r\nancestors, if he doth not break that thigh of thine in the great\r\nconflict. And sparkles of fire began to be emitted from every organ of\r\nsense of Bhima filled with wrath, like those that come out of every crack\r\nand orifice in the body of a blazing tree.\r\n\r\nVidura then, addressing everybody, said,--'Ye kings of Pratipa's race,\r\nbehold the great danger that ariseth from Bhimasena.

The sons of Dhritarashtra have, indeed,\r\ngambled disregarding every proper consideration. They are even now\r\ndisputing in this assembly about a lady (of the royal household). The\r\nprosperity of our kingdom is at an end. Alas, the Kauravas are even now\r\nengaged in sinful consultations. Ye Kauravas, take to your heart this\r\nhigh precept that I declare. If virtue is persecuted, the whole assembly\r\nbecometh polluted. If Yudhishthira had staked her before he was himself\r\nwon, he would certainly have been regarded as her master. If, however a\r\nperson staketh anything at a time when he himself is incapable of holding\r\nany wealth, to win it is very like obtaining wealth in a dream. Listening\r\nto the words of the king of Gandhara, fall ye not off from this undoubted\r\ntruth.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana, hearing Vidura thus speak, said,--'I am willing to abide by\r\nthe words of Bhima, of Arjuna and of the twins.

Having been a\r\nprince, so superior to all men, and nurtured by kings it is not proper\r\nthat he should be called the child of a slave.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said unto her,--'O auspicious one, let it be as thou\r\nsayest. O excellent one, ask thou another boon, for I will give it. My\r\nheart inclineth to give thee a second boon.

Virtuous in thy behaviour, thou art the foremost of all my\r\ndaughters-in-law.\r\n\r\nDraupadi said,--'O best of kings, O illustrious one, covetousness always\r\nbringeth about loss of virtue. I do not deserve a third boon. Therefore I\r\ndare not ask any. O king of kings, it hath been said that a Vaisya may\r\nask one boon; a Kshatriya lady, two boons; a Kshatriya male, three, and a\r\nBrahmana, a hundred.

But the\r\nlight that is in us hath been dimmed by this act of insult to our wife.\r\nHow, O Arjuna, can a son born from this insulted wife of ours prove\r\nserviceable to us?\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna replied,--'Superior persons, O Bharata, never prate about the\r\nharsh words that may or may not be uttered by inferior men. Persons that\r\nhave earned respect for themselves, even if they are able to retaliate,\r\nremember not the acts of hostility done by their enemies, but, on the\r\nother hand, treasure up only their good deeds.'\r\n\r\n'Bhima said,--'Shall I, O king, slay, without loss of time all these foes\r\nassembled together, even here, or shall I destroy them, O Bharata, by the\r\nroots, outside this palace?

Then\r\nYudhishthira forbade the mighty hero, embracing him with his arms and\r\ntelling him 'Be not so. Stay in silence and peace.'

Where there is intelligence, there is forbearance.\r\nTherefore, O Bharata, follow thou counsels of peace. The axe falleth upon\r\nwood, not upon stone. (Thou art open to advice, not Duryodhana).

The mountains of Himavat might be removed\r\nfrom where they are, the maker of the day lose his brightness, the moon\r\nhis coldness, but this vow of mine will ever be cherished.

O son of Pandu. thou surpassest in intelligence even\r\nPururavas, the son of Ila; in strength, all other monarchs, and in\r\nvirtue, even the Rishis. Therefore, resolve thou earnestly to win\r\nvictory, which belongeth to Indra; to control thy wrath, which belongeth\r\nto Yama; to give in charity, which belongeth to Kuvera; and to control\r\nall passions, which belongeth to Varuna. And, O Bharata, obtain thou the\r\npower of gladdening from the moon, the power of sustaining all from\r\nwater; forbearance from the earth; energy from the entire solar disc;\r\nstrength from the winds, and affluence from the other elements. Welfare\r\nand immunity from ailment be thine; I hope to see thee return. And, O\r\nYudhishthira, act properly and duly in all seasons,--in those of\r\ndistress--in those of difficulty,--indeed, in respect of everything, O\r\nson of Kunti, with our leave go hence. O Bharata, blessing be thine. No\r\none can say that ye have done anything sinful before. We hope to see\r\nthee, therefore, return in safety and crowned with success.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Thus addressed by Vidura, Yudhishthira the son\r\nof Pandu, of prowess incapable of being baffled, saying, 'So be it,'\r\nbowing low unto Bhishma and Drona, went away.\""

And she also asked\r\nleave of the other ladies of the household who had all been plunged into\r\ngrief. And saluting and embracing every one of them as each deserved, she\r\ndesired to go away. Then there arose within the inner apartments of the\r\nPandavas a loud wail of woe. And Kunti, terribly afflicted upon beholding\r\nDraupadi on the eve of her journey, uttered these words in a voice choked\r\nwith grief,--\r\n\r\n'O child, grieve not that this great calamity hath overtaken thee. Thou\r\nart well conversant with the duties of the female sex, and thy behaviour\r\nand conduct also are as they should be. It behoveth me not, O thou of\r\nsweet smiles, to instruct thee as to thy duties towards thy lords. Thou\r\nart chaste and accomplished, and thy qualities have adorned the race of\r\nthy birth as also the race into which thou hast been admitted by\r\nmarriage. Fortunate are the Kauravas that they have not been burnt by thy\r\nwrath. O child, safely go thou blest by my prayers. Good women never\r\nsuffer their hearts to the unstung at what is inevitable. Protected by\r\nvirtue that is superior to everything, soon shalt thou obtain good\r\nfortune. While living in the woods, keep thy eye on my child Sahadeva.\r\nSee that his heart sinketh not under this great calamity.'\r\n\r\n\"Saying 'So be it!' the princess Draupadi bathed in tears, and clad in\r\none piece of cloth, stained with blood, and with hair dishevelled left\r\nher mother-in-law. And as she went away weeping and wailing Pritha\r\nherself in grief followed her. She had not gone far when she saw her sons\r\nshorn of their ornaments and robes, their bodies clad in deerskins, and\r\ntheir heads down with shame. And she beheld them surrounded by rejoicing\r\nfoes' and pitied by friends. Endued with excess of parental affection,\r\nKunti approached her sons in that state, and embracing them all, and in\r\naccents choked by woe, She said these words,--\r\n\r\n\"Ye are virtuous and good-mannered, and adorned with all excellent\r\nqualities and respectful behaviour. Ye are all high-minded, and engaged\r\nin the service of your superiors. And ye are also devoted to the gods and\r\nthe performance of sacrifices. Why, then, hath this calamity overtaken\r\nyou. Whence is this reverse of fortune? I do not see by whose wickedness\r\nthis sin hath overtaken you. Alas I have brought you forth. All this must\r\nbe due to my ill fortune. It is for this that ye have been overtaken by\r\nthis calamity, though ye all are endued with excellent virtues. In energy\r\nand prowess and strength and firmness and might, ye are not wanting. How\r\nshall ye now, losing your wealth and possessions, live poor in the\r\npathless woods? If I had known before that ye were destined to live in\r\nthe woods, I would not have on Pandit's death come from the mountains of\r\nSatasringa to Hastinapore. Fortunate was your father, as I now regard,\r\nfor he truly reaped the fruit of his asceticism, and he was gifted with\r\nforesight, as he entertained the wish of ascending heaven, without having\r\nto feel any pain on account of his sons. Fortunate also was the virtuous\r\nMadri, as I regard her today, who had, it seems, a fore-knowledge of what\r\nwould happen and who on that account, obtained the high path of\r\nemancipation and every blessing therewith. All, Madri looked upon me as\r\nher stay, and her mind and her affections were ever fixed on me. Oh, fie\r\non my desire of life, owing to which suffer all this woe. Ye children, ye\r\nare all excellent and dear unto me. I have obtained you alter much\r\nsuffering. I cannot leave you. Even I will go with you. Alas, O Krishna,\r\n(Draupadi), why dost thou leave me so? Everything endued with life is\r\nsure to perish. Hath Dhata (Brahma) himself forgotten to ordain my death?\r\nPerhaps, it is so, and, therefore, life doth not quit me. O Krishna, O\r\nthou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O younger brother of Sankarshana, where art\r\nthou? Why dost thou not deliver me and these best of men also from such\r\nwoe? They say that thou who art without beginning and without end\r\ndeliverest those that think of thee. Why doth this saying become untrue.\r\nThese my sons are ever attached to virtue and nobility and good fame and\r\nprowess. They deserve not to suffer affliction. Oh, show them mercy.\r\nAlas, when there are such elders amongst our race as Bhishma and Drona\r\nand Kripa, all conversant with morality and the science of worldly\r\nconcerns, how could such calamity at all come? O Pandu, O king, where art\r\nthou? Why sufferest thou quietly thy good children to be thus sent into\r\nexile, defeated at dice? O Sahadeva, desist from going. Thou art my\r\ndearest child, dearer, O son of Madri, than my body itself. Forsake me\r\nnot. It behoveth thee to have some kindness for me. Bound by the ties of\r\nvirtue, let these thy brothers go. But then, earn thou that virtue which\r\nspringeth from waiting upon me.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"The Pandavas then consoled their weeping mother\r\nand with hearts plunged in grief set out for the woods. And Vidura\r\nhimself also much afflicted, consoling the distressed Kunti with reasons,\r\nand led her slowly to his house. And the ladies of Dhritarashtra's house,\r\nhearing everything as it happened, viz., the exile (of the Pandavas) and\r\nthe dragging of Krishna into the assembly where the princes had gambled,\r\nloudly wept censuring the Kauravas. And the ladies of the royal household\r\nalso sat silent for a long time, covering their lotus-like faces with\r\ntheir fair hands. And king Dhritarashtra also thinking of the dangers\r\nthat threatened his sons, became a prey to anxiety and could not enjoy\r\npeace of mind. And anxiously meditating on everything, and with mind\r\ndeprived of its equanimity through grief, he sent a messenger unto\r\nVidura, saying, 'Let Kshatta come to me without a moment's delay.'\r\n\r\n\"At this summons, Vidura quickly came to Dhritarashtra's palace. And as\r\nsoon as he came, the monarch asked him with great anxiety how the\r\nPandavas had left Hastinapore.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said,--\"As soon as Vidura endued with great foresight came\r\nunto him king Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, timidly asked his\r\nbrother,--'How doth Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, proceed along? And\r\nhow Arjuna? And how the twin sons of Madri? And how, O Kshatta, doth\r\nDhaumya proceed along? And how the illustrious Draupadi? I desire to hear\r\neverything, O Kshatta; describe to me all their acts.'\r\n\r\nVidura replied,--'Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, hath gone away covering\r\nhis face with his cloth. And Bhima, O king, hath gone away looking at his\r\nown mighty arms. And Jishnu (Arjuna) hath gone away, following the king\r\nspreading sand-grains around. And Sahadeva, the son of Madri, hath gone\r\naway besmearing his face, and Nakula, the handsomest of men, O king, hath\r\ngone away, staining himself with dust and his heart in great affliction.\r\nAnd the large-eyed and beautiful Krishna hath gone away, covering her\r\nface with her dishevelled hair following in the wake of the king, weeping\r\nand in tears. And O monarch, Dhaumya goeth along the road, with kusa\r\ngrass in hand, and uttering the aweful mantras of Sama Veda that relate\r\nto Yama.'\r\n\r\nDhritarashtra asked,--\"Tell me, O Vidura, why is it that the Pandavas are\r\nleaving Hastinapore in such varied guise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vidura replied,--'Though persecuted by thy sons and robbed of his\r\nkingdom and wealth the mind of the wise king Yudhishthira the just hath\r\nnot yet deviated from the path of virtue. King Yudhishthira is always\r\nkind, O Bharata, to thy children. Though deprived (of his kingdom and\r\npossessions) by foul means, filled with wrath as he is, he doth not open\r\neyes. 'I should not burn the people by looking at them with angry\r\neyes,'--thinking so, the royal son of Pandu goeth covering his face.\r\nListen to me as I tell thee, O bull of the Bharata race, why Bhima goeth\r\nso. 'There is none equal to me in strength of arms,' thinking so Bhima\r\ngoeth repeatedly stretching forth his mighty arms. And, O king, proud of\r\nthe strength of his arms, Vrikodara goeth, exhibiting them and desiring\r\nto do unto his enemies deeds worthy of those arms. And Arjuna the son of\r\nKunti, capable of using both his arms (in wielding the Gandiva) followeth\r\nthe footsteps of Yudhishthira, scattering sand-grains emblematical of the\r\narrows he would shower in battle. O Bharata, he indicateth that as the\r\nsand-grains are scattered by him with ease, so will he rain arrows with\r\nperfect ease on the foe (in time of battle). And Sahadeva goeth\r\nbesmearing his lace, thinking 'None may recognise me in this day of\r\ntrouble.' And, O exalted one, Nakula goeth staining himself with dust\r\nthinking, 'Lest otherwise I steal the hearts of the ladies that may look\r\nat me.' And Draupadi goeth, attired in one piece of stained cloth, her\r\nhair dishevelled, and weeping, signifying--'The wives of those for whom I\r\nhave been reduced to such a plight, shall on the fourteenth year hence be\r\ndeprived of husbands, sons and relatives and dear ones and smeared all\r\nover with blood, with hair dishevelled and all in their feminine seasons\r\nenter Hastinapore having offered oblations of water (unto the manes of\r\nthose they will have lost). And O Bharata, the learned Dhaumya with\r\npassions under full control, holding the kusa grass in his hand and\r\npointing the same towards the south-west, walketh before, singing the\r\nmantras of the Sama Veda that relate to Yama. And, O monarch, that\r\nlearned Brahamana goeth, also signifying, 'When the Bharatas shall be\r\nslain in battle, the priests of the Kurus will thus sing the Soma mantras\r\n(for the benefit of the deceased).' And the citizens, afflicted with\r\ngreat grief, are repeatedly crying out, 'Alas, alas, behold our masters\r\nare going away! O fie on the Kuru elders that have acted like foolish\r\nchildren in thus banishing heirs of Pandu from covetousness alone. Alas,\r\nseparated from the son of Pandu we all shall become masterless. What love\r\ncan we bear to the wicked and avaricious Kurus? Thus O king, have the\r\nsons of Kunti, endued with great energy of mind, gone away,--indicating,\r\nby manner and signs, the resolutions that are in their hearts. And as\r\nthose foremost of men had gone away from Hastinapore, flashes of\r\nlightning appeared in the sky though without clouds and the earth itself\r\nbegan to tremble. And Rahu came to devour the Sun, although it was not\r\nthe day of conjunction And meteors began to fall, keeping the city to\r\ntheir right. And jackals and vultures and ravens and other carnivorous\r\nbeasts and birds began to shriek and cry aloud from the temples of the\r\ngods and the tops of sacred trees and walls and house-tops. And these\r\nextraordinary calamitous portents, O king, were seen and heard,\r\nindicating the destruction of the Bharatas as the consequence of thy evil\r\ncounsels.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"And, O monarch, while king Dhritarashtra and\r\nthe wise Vidura were thus talking with each other, there appeared in that\r\nassembly of the Kauravas and before the eyes of all, the best of the\r\ncelestial Rishis. And appealing before them all, he uttered these\r\nterrible words, On the fourteenth year hence, the Kauravas, in\r\nconsequence of Duryodhana's fault, will all be destroyed by the might of\r\nBhima and Arjuna'. And having said this, that best of celestial Rishis,\r\nadorned with surpassing Vedic grace, passing through the skies,\r\ndisappeared from the scene. Then Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the son\r\nof Suvala regarding Drona as their sole refuge, offered the kingdom to\r\nhim. Drona then, addressing the envious and wrathful Duryodhana and\r\nDussasana and Karna and all the Bharata, said, 'The Brahamanas have said\r\nthat the Pandavas being of celestial origin are incapable of being slain.\r\nThe sons of Dhritarashtra, however, having, with all the kings, heartily\r\nand with reverence sought my protection, I shall look after them to the\r\nbest of my power. Destiny is supreme, I cannot abandon them. The sons of\r\nPandu, defeated at dice, are going into exile in pursuance of their\r\npromise. They will live in the woods for twelve years. Practising the\r\nBrahmacharyya mode of life for this period, they will return in anger and\r\nto our great grief take the amplest vengeance on their foes. I had\r\nformerly deprived Drupada of his kingdom in a friendly dispute. Robbed of\r\nhis kingdom by me, O Bharata, the king performed a sacrifice for\r\nobtaining a son (that should slay me). Aided by the ascetic power of Yaja\r\nand Upayaja, Drupada obtained from the (sacrificial) fire a son named\r\nDhrishtadyumna and a daughter, viz., the faultless Krishna, both risen\r\nfrom the sacrificial platform. That Dhrishtadyumna is the brother-in-law\r\nof the sons of Pandu by marriage, and dear unto them. It is for him,\r\ntherefore that I have much fear. Of celestial origin and resplendent as\r\nthe fire, he was born with bow, arrows, and encased in mail. I am a being\r\nthat is mortal. Therefore it is for him that I have great fear. That\r\nslayer of all foes, the son of Parshatta, hath taken the side of the\r\nPandavas. I shall have to lose my life, if he and I ever encounter each\r\nother in battle. What grief can be greater to me in this world than this,\r\nye Kauravas that Dhrishtadyumna is the destined slayer of Drona--this\r\nbelief is general. That he hath been born for slaying me hath been heard\r\nby me and is widely known also in the world. For thy sake, O Duryodhana,\r\nthat terrible season of destruction is almost come. Do without loss of\r\ntime, what may be beneficial unto thee. Think not that everything hath\r\nbeen accomplished by sending the Pandavas into exile. This thy happiness\r\nwill last for but a moment, even as in winter the shadow of the top of\r\nthe palm tree resteth (for a short time) at its base. Perform various\r\nkinds of sacrifices, and enjoy, and give O Bharata, everything thou\r\nlikest. On the fourteenth year hence, a great calamity will overwhelm\r\nthee.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Drona, Dhritarashtra\r\nsaid,--'O Kshatta, the preceptor hath uttered what is true. Go thou and\r\nbring back the Pandavas. If they do not come back, let them go treated\r\nwith respect and affection. Let those my sons go with weapons, and cars,\r\nand infantry, and enjoying every other good thing.'\""

And while he was\r\nseated restless with anxiety and sighing in grief, Sanjaya approaching\r\nhim said, 'O lord of the earth having now obtained the whole earth with\r\nall its wealth and sent away the sons of Pandu into exile, why is it, O\r\nking, that thou grievest so?\"\r\n\r\nDhritarashtra said,--'What have they not to grieve for who will have to\r\nencounter in battle those bulls among warriors--the sons of\r\nPandu--fighting on great cars and aided by allies?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--\"O king, all this great hostility is inevitable on\r\naccount of thy mistaken action, and this will assuredly bring about the\r\nwholesale destruction of the whole world. Forbidden by Bhishma, by Drona,\r\nand by Vidura, thy wicked-minded and shameless son Duryodhana sent his\r\nSuta messenger commanding him to bring into court the beloved and\r\nvirtuous wife of the Pandavas. The gods first deprive that man of his\r\nreason unto whom they send defeat and disgrace. It is for this that such\r\na person seeth things in a strange light. When destruction is at hand,\r\nevil appeareth as good unto the understanding polluted by sin, and the\r\nman adhereth to it firmly. That which is improper appeareth as proper,\r\nand that which is proper appeareth as improper unto the man about to be\r\noverwhelmed by destruction, and evil and impropriety are what he liketh.\r\nThe time that bringeth on destruction doth not come with upraised club\r\nand smash one's head. On the other hand the peculiarity of such a time is\r\nthat it maketh a man behold evil in good and good in evil. The wretches\r\nhave brought on themselves this terrible, wholesale, and horrible\r\ndestruction by dragging the helpless princess of Panchala into the court.\r\nWho else than Duryodhana--that false player of dice could bring into the\r\nassembly, with insults, the daughter of Drupada, endued with beauty and\r\nintelligence, and conversant with every rule of morality and duty, and\r\nsprung not from any woman's womb but from the sacred fire? The handsome\r\nKrishna, then in her season, attired in one piece of stained cloth when\r\nbrought into the court cast her eyes upon the Pandavas. She beheld them,\r\nhowever, robbed of their wealth, of their kingdom, of even their attire,\r\nof their beauty, of every enjoyment, and plunged into a state of bondage.\r\nBound by the tie of virtue, they were then unable to exert their prowess.\r\nAnd before all the assembled kings Duryodhana and Karna spake cruel and\r\nharsh words unto the distressed and enraged Krishna undeserving of such\r\ntreatment. O monarch, all this appeareth to me as foreboding fearful\r\nconsequences.'\r\n\r\nDhritarashtra said,--'O Sanjaya, the glances of the distressed daughter\r\nof Drupada might consume the whole earth. Can it be possible that even a\r\nsingle son of mine will live? The wives of the Bharatas, uniting with\r\nGandhari upon beholding virtuous Krishna, the wedded wife of the\r\nPandavas, endued with beauty and youth, dragged into the court, set up\r\nfrightful wail. Even now, along with all my subjects, they weep every\r\nday. Enraged at the ill treatment of Draupadi, the Brahmanas in a body\r\ndid not perform that evening their Agnihotra ceremony. The winds blew\r\nmightily as they did at the time of the universal dissolution. There was\r\na terrible thunder-storm also. Meteors fell from the sky, and Rahu by\r\nswallowing the Sun unseasonably alarmed the people terribly. Our\r\nwar-chariots were suddenly ablaze, and all their flagstaffs fell down\r\nforeboding evil unto the Bharatas. Jackals began to cry frightfully from\r\nwithin the sacred fire-chamber of Duryodhana, and asses from all\r\ndirections began to bray in response. Then Bhishma and Drona, and Kripa,\r\nand Somadatta and the high-souled Vahlika, all left the assembly. It was\r\nthen that at the advice of Vidura I addressed Krishna and said, 'I will\r\ngrant thee boons, O Krishna, indeed, whatever thou wouldst ask? The\r\nprincess of the Panchala there begged of me the liberation of the\r\nPandavas. Out of my own motion I then set free the Pandavas, commanding\r\nthem to return (to their capital) on their cars and with their bows and\r\narrows. It was then that Vidura told me, 'Even this will prove the\r\ndestruction of the Bharata race, viz., this dragging of Krishna into the\r\ncourt. This daughter of the King of Panchala is the faultless Sree\r\nherself. Of celestial origin, she is the wedded wife of the Pandavas. The\r\nwrathful sons of Pandu will never forgive this insult offered unto her.\r\nNor will the mighty bowmen of the Vrishni race, nor the mighty warriors\r\namongst the Panchalas suffer this in silence. Supported by Vasudeva of\r\nunbaffled prowess, Arjuna will assuredly come back, surrounded by the\r\nPanchala host. And that mighty warrior amongst them, Bhimasena endued\r\nwith surpassing strength, will also come back, whirling his mace like\r\nYama himself with his club. These kings will scarcely be able to bear the\r\nforce of Bhima's mace. Therefore, O king, not hostility but peace for\r\never with the sons of Pandu is what seemeth to me to be the best. The\r\nsons of Pandu are always stronger than the Kurus. Thou knowest, O king,\r\nthat the illustrious and mighty king Jarasandha was slain in battle by\r\nBhima with his bare arms alone. Therefore, O bull of the Bharata race, it\r\nbehoveth thee to make peace with the sons of Pandu. Without scruples of\r\nany kind, unite the two parties, O king. And it thou actest in this way,\r\nthou art sure to obtain good luck, O king. It was thus, O son of\r\nGavalgani, that Vidura addressed me in words of both virtue and profit.\r\nAnd I did not accept this counsel, moved by affection for my son.\"\r\n\r\nThe End of Sabha Parva\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1.
