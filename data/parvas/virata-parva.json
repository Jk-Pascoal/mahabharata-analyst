      "content": "(Pandava-Pravesa Parva)\r\n\r\nOM! Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of male\r\nbeings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said, \"How did my great-grandfathers, afflicted with the fear\r\nof Duryodhana, pass their days undiscovered in the city of Virata? And, O\r\nBrahman, how did the highly blessed Draupadi, stricken with woe, devoted\r\nto her lords, and ever adoring the Deity[1], spend her days unrecognised?\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"Listen, O lord of men, how thy great grandfathers\r\npassed the period of unrecognition in the city of Virata. Having in this\r\nway obtained boons from the god of Justice, that best of virtuous men,\r\nYudhishthira, returned to the asylum and related unto the Brahmanas all\r\nthat had happened. And having related everything unto them, Yudhishthira\r\nrestored to that regenerate Brahmana, who had followed him the churning\r\nstaff and the fire-sticks he had lost. And, O Bharata, the son of the god\r\nof Justice, the royal Yudhishthira of high soul then called together all\r\nhis younger brothers and addressed them, saying, 'Exiled from our\r\nkingdom, we have passed twelve years. The thirteenth year, hard to spend,\r\nhath now come. Do thou therefore, O Arjuna, the son of Kunti, select some\r\nspot where we may pass our days undiscovered by our enemies.'\"\r\n\r\nArjuna replied, \"Even by virtue of Dharma's boon, we shall, O lord of\r\nmen, range about undiscovered by men. Still, for purposes of residence, I\r\nshall mention some spots that are both delightful and secluded. Do thou\r\nselect some one of them. Surrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are, many\r\ncountries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi,\r\nMatsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva,\r\nYugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. Which of\r\nthese, O king, wouldst thou choose, and where, O foremost of monarchs,\r\nshall we spend this year?\"\r\n\r\nYudhishthira said \"O them of mighty arms, it is even so. What that\r\nadorable Lord of all creatures hath said must become true. Surely, after\r\nconsulting together, we must select some delightful, auspicious, and\r\nagreeable region for our abode, where we may live free from fear. The\r\naged Virata, king of the Matsyas, is virtuous and powerful and\r\ncharitable, and is liked by all. And he is also attached to the Pandavas.\r\nEven in the city of Virata, O child, we shall, O Bharata, spend this\r\nyear, entering his service. Tell me, ye sons of the Kuru race, in what\r\ncapacities ye will severally present yourselves before the king of the\r\nMatsyas!\"\r\n\r\nArjuna said, \"O god among men, what service wilt thou take in Virata's\r\nkingdom? O righteous one, in what capacity wilt thou reside in the city\r\nof Virata? Thou art mild, and charitable, and modest, and virtuous, and\r\nfirm in promise. What wilt thou, O king, afflicted as thou art with\r\ncalamity, do? A king is qualified to bear trouble like an ordinary\r\nperson. How wilt thou overcome this great calamity that has overtaken\r\nthee?\"\r\n\r\nYudhishthira replied, \"Ye sons of the Kuru race, ye bulls among men, hear\r\nwhat I shall do on appearing before king Virata. Presenting myself as a\r\nBrahmana, Kanka by name, skilled in dice and fond of play, I shall become\r\na courtier of that high-souled king. And moving upon chess-boards\r\nbeautiful pawns made of ivory, of blue and yellow and red and white hue,\r\nby throws of black and red dice. I shall entertain the king with his\r\ncourtiers and friends. And while I shall continue to thus delight the\r\nking, nobody will succeed in discovering me. And should the monarch ask\r\nme, I shall say, 'Formerly I was the bosom friend of Yudhishthira.' I\r\ntell you that it is thus that I shall pass my days (in the city of\r\nVirata). What office wilt thou, O Vrikodara, fill in the city of Virata?\""

I am skilled in culinary art, and I\r\nshall prepare curries for the king, and excelling all those skilful cooks\r\nthat had hitherto dressed his food I shall gratify the monarch. And I\r\nshall carry mighty loads of wood. And witnessing that mighty feat, the\r\nmonarch will be pleased. And, O Bharata, beholding such superhuman feats\r\nof mine, the servants of the royal household will honour me as a king.\r\nAnd I shall have entire control over all kinds of viands and drinks. And\r\ncommanded to subdue powerful elephants and mighty bulls, I will do as\r\nbidden.

What office will be performed by that best of warriors, Arjuna,\r\nwho proceeded to that forest and gratified Agni, vanquishing on a single\r\ncar and slaying huge Nagas and Rakshasas, and who married the sister of\r\nVasuki himself, the king of the Nagas? Even as the sun is the foremost of\r\nall heat-giving bodies, as the Brahmana is the best of all bipeds, as the\r\ncobra is the foremost of all serpents, as Fire is the first of all things\r\npossessed of energy, as the thunderbolt is the foremost of all weapons,\r\nas the humped bull is the foremost of all animals of the bovine breed, as\r\nthe ocean is the foremost of all watery expanses, as clouds charged with\r\nrain are the foremost of all clouds, as Ananta is the first of all Nagas,\r\nas Airavata is the foremost of all elephants, as the son is the foremost\r\nof all beloved objects, and lastly, as the wife is the best of all\r\nfriends, so, O Vrikodara, is the youthful Gudakesa, the foremost of all\r\nbowmen. And O Bharata, what office will be performed by Vibhatsu, the\r\nwielder of Gandiva, whose car is drawn by white horses, and who is not\r\ninferior to Indra or Vasudeva Himself? What office will be performed by\r\nArjuna who, dwelling for five years in the abode of the thousand-eyed\r\nDeity (Indra) shining in celestial lustre, acquired by his own energy the\r\nscience of superhuman arms with all celestial weapons, and whom I regard\r\nas the tenth Rudra, the thirteenth Aditya, the ninth Vasu, and the tenth\r\nGraha, whose arms, symmetrical and long, have the skin hardened by\r\nconstant strokes of the bowstring and cicatrices which resemble those on\r\nthe humps of bulls,--that foremost of warriors who is as Himavat among\r\nmountains, the ocean among expanses of water, Sakra among the celestial,\r\nHavya-vaha (fire) among the Vasus, the tiger among beasts, and Garuda\r\namong feathery tribes!\"\r\n\r\nArjuna replied, \"O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of the\r\nneuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of the\r\nbowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my cicatrized arms with\r\nbangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and conch-bangles on my\r\nwrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king,\r\nappear as one of the third sex, Brihannala by name. And living as a\r\nfemale I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner\r\napartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the\r\nwomen of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and\r\nin musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the\r\nvarious excellent acts of men and thus conceal myself, O son of Kunti, by\r\nfeigning disguise. And, O Bharata should the king enquire, I will say\r\nthat, I lived as a waiting maid of Draupadi in Yudhishthira's palace.\r\nAnd, O foremost of kings, concealing myself by this means, as fire is\r\nconcealed by ashes, I shall pass my days agreeably in the palace of\r\nVirata.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having said this, Arjuna, that best of men and\r\nforemost of virtuous persons, became silent.

And, O monarch, I am well-acquainted\r\nwith the nature of kine, as also with their auspicious marks and other\r\nmatters relating to them. I can also discriminate bulls with auspicious\r\nmarks, the scent of whose urine may make even the barren being forth\r\nchild.

      "content": "Yudhishthira said, \"Ye have already said what offices ye will\r\nrespectively perform. I also, according to the measure of my sense, have\r\nsaid what office I will perform. Let our priest, accompanied by\r\ncharioteers and cooks, repair to the abode of Drupada, and there maintain\r\nour Agnihotra fires. And let Indrasena and the others, taking with then\r\nthe empty cars, speedily proceeded to Dwaravati. Even this is my wish.\r\nAnd let all these maid-servants of Draupadi go to the Panchalas, with our\r\ncharioteers and cooks. And let all of them say,--We do not know where the\r\nPandavas have gone leaving us at the lake of Dwaitavana.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said, \"Having thus taken counsel of one another and told one\r\nanother the offices they would discharge, the Pandavas sought Dhaumya's\r\nadvice. And Dhaumya also gave them advice in the following words, saying,\r\nYe sons of Pandu, the arrangements ye have made regarding the Brahmanas,\r\nyours friends, cars, weapons, and the (sacred) fires, are excellent. But\r\nit behoveth thee, O Yudhishthira, and Arjuna specially, to make provision\r\nfor the protection of Draupadi. Ye king, ye are well-acquainted with the\r\ncharacters of men. Yet whatever may be your knowledge, friends may from\r\naffection be permitted to repeat what is already known. Even this is\r\nsubservient to the eternal interests of virtue, pleasure, and profit. I\r\nshall, therefore speak to you something. Mark ye. To dwell with a king\r\nis, alas, difficult. I shall tell you, ye princes, how ye may reside in\r\nthe royal household, avoiding every fault. Ye Kauravas, honourably or\r\notherwise, ye will have to pass this year in the king's palace,\r\nundiscovered by those that know you. Then in the fourteenth year, ye will\r\nlive happy. O son of Pandu, in this world, that cherisher and protector\r\nof all beings, the king, who is a deity in an embodied form, is as a\r\ngreat fire sanctified with all the mantras. [6] One should present\r\nhimself before the king, after having obtained his permission at the\r\ngate. No one should keep contact with royal secrets. Nor should one\r\ndesire a seat which another may covet. He who doth not, regarding himself\r\nto be a favourite, occupy (the king's) car, or coach, or seat, or\r\nvehicle, or elephant, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal household.\r\nHe that sits not upon a seat the occupation of which is calculated raise\r\nalarm in the minds of malicious people, is alone worthy of dwelling in a\r\nroyal household. No one should, unasked offer counsel (to a king). Paying\r\nhomage in season unto the king, one should silently and respectfully sit\r\nbeside the king, for kings take umbrage at babblers, and disgrace laying\r\ncounsellors. A wise person should not contact friendship with the king's\r\nwife, nor with the inmates of the inner apartments, nor with those that\r\nare objects of royal displeasure. One about the king should do even the\r\nmost unimportant acts and with the king's knowledge. Behaving thus with a\r\nsovereign, one doth not come by harm. Even if an individual attain the\r\nhighest office, he should, as long as he is not asked or commanded,\r\nconsider himself as born-blind, having regard to the king's dignity, for\r\nO repressers of foes, the rulers of men do not forgive even their sons\r\nand grandsons and brothers when they happen to tamper with their dignity.\r\nKings should be served with regardful care, even as Agni and other god;\r\nand he that is disloyal to his sovereign, is certainly destroyed by him.\r\nRenouncing anger, and pride, and negligence, it behoveth a man to follow\r\nthe course directed by the monarch. After carefully deliberating on all\r\nthings, a person should set forth before the king those topics that are\r\nboth profitable and pleasant; but should a subject be profitable without\r\nbeing pleasant, he should still communicate it, despite its\r\ndisagreeableness. It behoveth a man to be well-disposed towards the king\r\nin all his interests, and not to indulge in speech that is alike\r\nunpleasant and profitless. Always thinking--I am not liked by the\r\nking--one should banish negligence, and be intent on bringing about what\r\nis agreeable and advantageous to him. He that swerveth not from his\r\nplace, he that is not friendly to those that are hostile to the king, he\r\nthat striveth not to do wrong to the king, is alone worthy to dwell in a\r\nroyal household. A learned man should sit either on the king's right or\r\nthe left; he should not sit behind him for that is the place appointed\r\nfor armed guards, and to sit before him is always interdicted. Let none,\r\nwhen the king is engaged in doing anything (in respect of his servants)\r\ncome forward pressing himself zealously before others, for even if the\r\naggrieved be very poor, such conduct would still be inexcusable.[7] It\r\nbehoveth no man to reveal to others any lie the king may have told\r\ninasmuch as the king bears ill will to those that report his falsehoods.\r\nKings also always disregard persons that regard themselves as learned. No\r\nman should be proud thinking--I am brave, or, I am intelligent, but a\r\nperson obtains the good graces of a king and enjoys the good things of\r\nlife, by behaving agreeably to the wishes of the king. And, O Bharata,\r\nobtaining things agreeable, and wealth also which is so hard to acquire,\r\na person should always do what is profitable as well as pleasant to the\r\nking. What man that is respected by the wise can even think of doing\r\nmischief to one whose ire is great impediment and whose favour is\r\nproductive of mighty fruits? No one should move his lips, arms and\r\nthighs, before the king. A person should speak and spit before the king\r\nonly mildly. In the presence of even laughable objects, a man should not\r\nbreak out into loud laughter, like a maniac; nor should one show\r\n(unreasonable) gravity by containing himself, to the utmost. One should\r\nsmile modestly, to show his interest (in what is before him). He that is\r\never mindful of the king's welfare, and is neither exhilarated by reward\r\nnor depressed by disgrace, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal\r\nhousehold. That learned courtier who always pleaseth the king and his son\r\nwith agreeable speeches, succeedeth in dwelling in a royal household as a\r\nfavourite. The favourite courtier who, having lost the royal favour for\r\njust reason, does not speak evil of the king, regains prosperity. The man\r\nwho serveth the king or liveth in his domains, if sagacious, should speak\r\nin praise of the king, both in his presence and absence. The courtier who\r\nattempts to obtain his end by employing force on the king, cannot keep\r\nhis place long and incurs also the risk of death. None should, for the\r\npurpose of self-interest, open communications with the king's enemies.[8]\r\nNor should one distinguish himself above the king in matters requiring\r\nability and talents. He that is always cheerful and strong, brave and\r\ntruthful, and mild, and of subdued senses, and who followeth his master\r\nlike his shadow, is alone worthy to dwell in a royal household. He that\r\non being entrusted with a work, cometh forward, saying,--I will do\r\nthis--is alone worthy of living in a royal household. He that on being\r\nentrusted with a task, either within the king's dominion or out of it,\r\nnever feareth to undertake it, is alone fit to reside in a royal\r\nhousehold. He that living away from his home, doth no remember his dear\r\nones, and who undergoeth (present) misery in expectation of (future)\r\nhappiness, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal household. One should\r\nnot dress like the king, nor should one indulge, in laughter in the\r\nking's presence nor should one disclose royal secrets. By acting thus one\r\nmay win royal favour. Commissioned to a task, one should not touch bribes\r\nfor by such appropriation one becometh liable to fetters or death. The\r\nrobes, ornaments, cars, and other things which the king may be pleased to\r\nbestow should always be used, for by this, one winneth the royal favour.\r\nYe children, controlling your minds, do ye spend this year, ye sons of\r\nPandu, behaving in this way. Regaining your own kingdom, ye may live as\r\nye please.\"\r\n\r\nYudhishthira said, \"We have been well taught by thee. Blessed be thou.\r\nThere is none that could say so to us, save our mother Kunti and Vidura\r\nof great wisdom. It behoveth thee to do all that is necessary now for our\r\ndeparture, and for enabling us to come safely through this woe, as well\r\nas for our victory over the foe.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, Dhaumya, that\r\nbest of Brahmanas, performed according to the ordinance the rites\r\nordained in respect of departure. And lighting up their fires, he\r\noffered, with mantras, oblations on them for the prosperity and success\r\nof the Pandavas, as for their reconquest of the whole world. And walking\r\nround those fires and round the Brahmanas of ascetic wealth, the six set\r\nout, placing Yajnaseni in their front. And when those heroes had\r\ndeparted, Dhaumya, that best of ascetics, taking their sacred fires, set\r\nout for the Panchalas. And Indrasena, and others already mentioned, went\r\nto the Yadavas, and looking after the horses and the cars of the Pandavas\r\npassed their time happily and in privacy.\""

And those bowmen\r\ndesirous of (speedily) recovering their kingdom, hitherto living in\r\ninaccessible hills and forest fastnesses, now terminated their\r\nforest-life and proceeded to the southern bank of that river. And those\r\nmighty warriors endued with great strength and hitherto leading the lives\r\nof hunters by killing the deer of the forest, passed through Yakrilloma\r\nand Surasena, leaving behind, on their right, the country of the\r\nPanchalas, and on their left, that of the Dasarnas. And those bowmen,\r\nlooking wan and wearing beards and equipped with swords, entered Matsya's\r\ndominions leaving the forest, giving themselves out as hunters. And on\r\narriving at that country, Krishna addressed Yudhishthira, saying, 'We see\r\nfootpaths here, and various fields. From this it appears that Virata's\r\nmetropolis is still at a distance. Pass we here what part of the night is\r\nstill left, for great is my fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nYudhishthira answered, \"O Dhananjaya of Bharata's race, do thou take up\r\nPanchali and carry her.

If, O child, we enter it with our\r\nweapons about us, we shall thereby surely excite the alarm of the\r\ncitizens. Further, the tremendous bow, the Gandiva, is known to all men,\r\nso that people will, without doubt, recognise us soon. And if even one of\r\nus is discovered, we shall, according to promise, have to pass another\r\ntwelve years in the forest.'\"\r\n\r\nArjuna said, \"Hard by yon cemetery and near that inaccessible peak is a\r\nmighty Sami tree, throwing-about its gigantic branches and difficult to\r\nascend. Nor is there any human being, who, I think, O Pandu's son, will\r\nespy us depositing our arms at that place. That tree is in the midst of\r\nan out-of-the way forest abounding in beasts and snakes, and is in the\r\nvicinity of a dreary cemetery. Stowing away our weapons on the Sami tree,\r\nlet us, O Bharata, go to the city, and live there, free from anxiety!\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Having O bull of the Bharata race spoken thus to\r\nking Yudhishthira the just, Arjuna prepared to deposit the weapons (on\r\nthe tree). And that bull among the Kurus, then loosened the string of the\r\nlarge and dreadful Gandiva, ever producing thundering twang and always\r\ndestructive of hostile hosts, and with which he had conquered, on a\r\nsingle car, gods and men and Nagas and swelling provinces. And the\r\nwarlike Yudhishthira, that represser of foes, unfastened the undecaying\r\nstring of that bow with which he had defended the field of Kurukshstra.\r\nAnd the illustrious Bhimasena unstrung that bow by means of which that\r\nsinless one had vanquished in fight the Panchals and the lord of Sindhu,\r\nand with which, during his career of conquest, he had, single-handed,\r\nopposed innumerable foes, and hearing whose twang which was like unto the\r\nroar of the thunder or the splitting of a mountain, enemies always fly\r\n(in panic) from the field of battle. And that son of Pandu of coppery\r\ncomplexion and mild speech who is endued with great prowess in the field,\r\nand is called Nakula in consequence of his unexampled beauty in the\r\nfamily, then unfastened the string of that bow with which he had\r\nconquered all the regions of the west. And the heroic Sahadeva also,\r\npossessed of a mild disposition, then united the string of that bow with\r\nwhich he had subjugated the countries of the south. And with their bows,\r\nthey put together their long and flashing swords, their precious quivers,\r\nand their arrows sharp as razors. And Nakula ascended the tree, and\r\ndeposited on it the bows and the other weapons. And he tied them fast on\r\nthose parts of the tree which he thought would not break, and where the\r\nrain would not penetrate. And the Pandavas hung up a corpse (on the\r\ntree), knowing that people smelling the stench of the corpse would\r\nsay--here sure, is a dead body, and avoid the tree from a distance. And\r\non being asked by the shepherds and cowherds regarding the corpse, those\r\nrepressers of foes said unto them, 'This is our mother, aged one hundred\r\nand eighty years. We have hung up her dead body, in accordance with the\r\ncustom observed by our forefathers.' And then those resisters of foes\r\napproached the city. And for purposes of non-discovery Yudhisthira kept\r\nthese (five) names for himself and his brothers respectively, viz., Jaya,\r\nJayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, and Jayatvala. Then they entered the great\r\ncity, with the view to passing the thirteenth year undiscovered in that\r\nkingdom, agreeably to the promise (to Duryodhana).\""

And\r\nthe king, desirous with his brothers of obtaining a sight of the Goddess,\r\ninvoked her and began to praise her by reciting various names derived\r\nfrom (approved) hymns. And Yudhishthira said, 'Salutations to thee, O\r\ngiver of boons. O thou that art identical with Krishna, O maiden, O thou\r\nthat hast observed the vow of Brahmacharya, O thou of body bright as the\r\nnewly-risen Sun, O thou efface beautiful as the full moon. Salutations to\r\nthee, O thou of four hands and four faces, O thou of fair round hips and\r\ndeep bosom, O thou that wearest bangles made of emeralds and sapphires, O\r\nthou that bearest excellent bracelets on thy upper arm. Thou shinest, O\r\nGoddess, as Padma, the consort of Narayana. O thou that rangest the\r\netherial regions, thy true form and thy Brahmacharya are both of the\r\npurest kind. Sable as the black clouds, thy face is beautiful as that of\r\nSankarshana. Thou bearest two large arms long as a couple of poles raised\r\nin honour of Indra. In thy (six) other arms thou bearest a vessel, a\r\nlotus, a bell, a noose, a bow, a large discus, and various other weapons.\r\nThou art the only female in the universe that possesses! the attribute of\r\npurity. Thou art decked with a pair of well-made ears graced with\r\nexcellent rings. O Goddess, thou shinest with a face that challengeth the\r\nmoon in beauty. With an excellent diadem and beautiful braid with robes\r\nmade of the bodies of snakes, and with also the brilliant girdle round\r\nthy hips, thou shinest like the Mandara mountain encircled with snakes.\r\nThou shinest also with peacock-plumes standing erect on thy head, and\r\nthou hast sanctified the celestial regions by adopting the vow of\r\nperpetual maiden-hood. It is for this, O thou that hast slain the\r\nMahishasura, [9] that thou art praised and worshipped by the gods for the\r\nprotection of the three worlds. O thou foremost of all deities, extend to\r\nme thy grace, show me thy mercy, and be thou the source of blessings to\r\nme. Thou art Jaya and Vijaya, and it is thou that givest victory in\r\nbattle. Grant me victory, O Goddess, and give me boons also at this hour\r\nof distress. Thy eternal abode is on Vindhya--that foremost of mountains.\r\nO Kali, O Kali, thou art the great Kali, ever fond of wine and meat and\r\nanimal sacrifice. Capable of going everywhere at will, and bestowing\r\nboons on thy devotees, thou art ever followed in thy journeys by Brahma\r\nand the other gods. By them that call upon thee for the relief of their\r\nburdens, and by them also that bow to thee at daybreak on Earth, there is\r\nnothing that cannot be attained in respect either of offspring or wealth.\r\nAnd because thou rescuest people from difficulties whether when they are\r\nafflicted in the wilderness or sinking in the great ocean, it is for this\r\nthat thou art called Durga[10] by all. Thou art the sole refuge of men\r\nwhen attacked by robbers or while afflicted in crossing streams and seas\r\nor in wilderness and; forests. Those men that remember thee are never\r\nprostrated, O great Goddess. Thou art Fame, thou art Prosperity, thou art\r\nSteadiness, thou art Success; thou art the Wife, thou art men's\r\nOffspring, thou art Knowledge, and thou art the Intellect. Thou art the\r\ntwo Twilights, the Night Sleep, Light--both solar and lunar, Beauty,\r\nForgiveness, Mercy, and every other thing. Thou dispellest, worshipped by\r\nthe devotees their fetters, ignorance, loss of children and loss of\r\nwealth, disease, death, and fear. I, who have been deprived of my\r\nkingdom, seek thy protection. And as I bow to thee with bended head, O\r\nSupreme Goddess, grant me protection, O thou of eyes like lotus leaves.\r\nAnd be thou as boon-giving Truth unto us that are acting according to\r\nTruth. And, O Durga, kind as thou art unto all that seek thy protection,\r\nand affectionate unto all thy devotees, grant me protection!'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued, \"Thus praised by the son of Pandu, the Goddess\r\nshowed herself unto him. And approaching the king, she addressed him in\r\nthese words, 'O mighty armed king, listen, O Lord, to these words of\r\nmine. Having vanquished and slain the ranks of the Kauravas through my\r\ngrace, victory in battle will soon be thine. Thou shalt again lord it\r\nover the entire Earth, having made thy dominions destitute of thorns.\r\nAnd, O king, thou shalt also, with thy brothers, obtain great happiness.\r\nAnd through my grace, joy and health will be thine. And they also in the\r\nworld who will recite my attributes and achievements will be freed from\r\ntheir sins, and gratified. I will bestow upon them kingdom, long life,\r\nbeauty of person, and offspring. And they, O king, who will invoke me,\r\nafter thy manner, in exile or in the city, in the midst of battle or of\r\ndangers from foes, in forests or in inaccessible deserts, in seas or\r\nmountain fastnesses, there is nothing that they will not obtain in this\r\nworld. And ye sons of Pandu, he will achieve success in every business of\r\nhis that will listen to, or himself recite with devotion, this excellent\r\nhymn. And through my grace neither the Kuru's spies, nor those that dwell\r\nin the country of the Matsyas, will succeed in recognising you all as\r\nlong as ye reside in Virata's city!' And having said these words unto\r\nYudhishthira, that chastiser of foes, and having arranged for the\r\nprotection of the sons of Pandu, the Goddess disappeared there and then.\""

He cannot be a Brahmana.\r\nMethinks he is a man of men, and a lord of earth. He hath neither slaves,\r\nnor cars, nor elephants with him, yet he shineth like the very Indra. The\r\nmarks on his person indicate him to be one whose coronal locks have\r\nundergone the sacred investiture. Even this is my belief. He approacheth\r\nme without any hesitation, even as an elephant in rut approacheth an\r\nassemblage of lotuses!'\r\n\r\n\"And as the king was indulging in these thoughts, that bull among men,\r\nYudhishthira, came before Virata and addressed him, saying, 'O great\r\nking, know me for a Brahmana who, having lost his all hath come to thee\r\nfor the means of subsistence. I desire, O sinless one, to live here\r\nbeside thee acting under thy commands,[11] O lord. The king then,\r\nwell-pleased, replied unto him saying, 'Thou art welcome. Do thou then\r\naccept the appointment thou seekest!' And having appointed the lion among\r\nkings in the post he had prayed for, king Virata addressed him with a\r\nglad heart, saying, 'O child, I ask thee from affection, from the\r\ndominions of what king dost thou come hither? Tell me also truly what is\r\nthy name and family, and what thou hast a knowledge of.'\"\r\n\r\nYudhishthira said, \"My name is Kanka, and I am a Brahmana belonging to\r\nthe family known by the name of Vaiyaghra.

And beholding her wandering, men and\r\nwomen came to her hastily and addressed her, saying, 'Who are you? And\r\nwhat do you seek?' And she replied, 'I am a king's Sairindhri. I desire\r\nto serve any one that will maintain me.' But beholding her beauty and\r\ndress, and hearing also her speech that was so sweet, the people could\r\nnot take her for a maid-servant in search of subsistence. And it came to\r\npass that while looking this way and that from the terrace, Virata's\r\nbeloved queen, daughter of the king of Kekaya, saw Draupadi.

Thereupon, Draupadi answered her, saying, 'O foremost of queen, I\r\nam Sairindhri. I will serve anybody that will maintain me.' Then Sudeshna\r\nsaid, 'What you say (regarding your profession) can never be compatible\r\nwith so much beauty. (On the contrary) you might well be the mistress of\r\nservants both, male and female. Your heels are not prominent, and your\r\nthighs touch each other. And your intelligence is great, and your navel\r\ndeep, and your words solemn.

Tell me, O beautiful damsel, who thou art. Thou canst never be a\r\nmaidservant. Art thou a Yakshi, a Goddess, a Gandharvi, or an Apsara? Art\r\nthou the daughter of a celestial, or art thou a female Naga? Art thou the\r\nguardian goddess of some city, a Vidyadhari, or a Kinnari,--or art thou\r\nRohini herself?

O beauteous lady, of jasmines and\r\nlotuses and blue lilies and Champakas. Formerly I served Krishna's\r\nfavourite queen Satyabhama, and also Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas\r\nand the foremost beauty of the Kuru race.

Surely, O thou of\r\nwell-rounded hips, O damsel of exquisite charms, beholding thy form of\r\nsuperhuman beauty, king Virata is sure to forsake me, and will turn to\r\nthee with his whole heart. O thou of faultless limbs, O thou that art\r\nendued with large eyes casting quick glances, he upon whom thou wilt look\r\nwith desire is sure to be stricken.

And all the keepers of my horses and all my charioteers will from\r\ntoday be subordinate to thee. If this suits thee, say what remuneration\r\nis desired by thee. But, O thou that resemblest a celestial, the office\r\nof equerry is not worthy of thee. For thou lookest like a king and I\r\nesteem thee much. The appearance here hath pleased me as much as if\r\nYudhishthira himself were here. Oh, how does that blameless son of Pandu\r\ndwell and divert himself in the forest, now destitute of servants as he\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'That youth, like unto a chief of the\r\nGandharvas, was treated thus respectfully by the delighted king Virata.\r\nAnd he conducted himself there in such a manner as to make himself dear\r\nand agreeable to all in the palace. And no one recognised him while\r\nliving under Virata's protection. And it was in this manner then the sons\r\nof Pandu, the very sight of whom had never been fruitless, continued to\r\nlive in the country of the Matsyas. And true to their pledge those lords\r\nof the earth bounded by her belt of seas passed their days of incognito\r\nwith great composure notwithstanding their poignant sufferings.'\""

      "content": "(Samayapalana Parva)\r\n\r\n\"Janamejaya said, 'While living thus disguised in the city of the\r\nMatsyas, what did those descendants of the Kuru race endued with great\r\nprowess, do, O regenerate one!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Hear, O king, what those descendants of Kuru did\r\nwhile they dwelt thus in disguise in the city of the Matsyas, worshipping\r\nthe king thereof. By the grace of the sage Trinavindu and of the\r\nhigh-souled lord of justice, the Pandavas continued to live unrecognised\r\nby others in the city of Virata. O lord of men, Yudhishthira, as courtier\r\nmade himself agreeable to Virata and his sons as also to all the Matsyas.\r\nAn adept in the mysteries of dice, the son of Pandu caused them to play\r\nat dice according to his pleasure and made them sit together in the\r\ndice-hall like a row of birds bound in a string. And that tiger among\r\nmen, king Yudhishthira the Just, unknown to the monarch, distributed\r\namong his brothers, in due proportion, the wealth he won from Virata. And\r\nBhimasena on his part, sold to Yudhishthira for price, meat and viands of\r\nvarious kinds which he obtained from the king. And Arjuna distributed\r\namong all his brothers the proceeds of worn-out cloths which he earned in\r\nthe inner apartments of the palace. And Sahadeva, too, who was disguised\r\nas a cowherd gave milk, curds and clarified butter to his brothers. And\r\nNakula also shared with his brothers the wealth the king gave him,\r\nsatisfied with his management of the horses. And Draupadi, herself in a\r\npitiable condition, looked after all those brothers and behaved in such a\r\nway as to remain unrecognized. And thus ministering unto one another's\r\nwants, those mighty warriors lived in the capital of Virata as hidden\r\nfrom view, as if they were once more in their mother's womb. And those\r\nlords of men, the sons of Pandu, apprehensive of danger from the son of\r\nDhritarashtra, continued to dwell there in concealment, watching over\r\ntheir wife Draupadi. And after three months had passed away, in the\r\nfourth, the grand festival in honour of the divine Brahma which was\r\ncelebrated with pomp in the country of the Matsyas, came off. And there\r\ncame athletes from all quarters by thousands, like hosts of celestials to\r\nthe abode of Brahma or of Siva to witness that festival. And they were\r\nendued with huge bodies and great prowess, like the demons called\r\nKalakhanjas. And elated with their prowess and proud of their strength,\r\nthey were highly honoured by the king. And their shoulders and waists and\r\nnecks were like those of lions, and their bodies were very clean, and\r\ntheir hearts were quite at ease. And they had many a time won success in\r\nthe lists in the presence of kings. And amongst them there was one who\r\ntowered above the rest and challenged them all to a combat. And there was\r\nnone that dared to approach him as he proudly stalked in the arena. And\r\nwhen all the athletes stood sad and dispirited, the king of the Matsyas\r\nmade him fight with his cook. And urged by the king, Bhima made up his\r\nmind reluctantly, for he could not openly disobey the royal behest. And\r\nthat tiger among men then having worshipped the king, entered the\r\nspacious arena, pacing with the careless steps of a tiger. And the son of\r\nKunti then girded up his loins to the great delight of the spectators.\r\nAnd Bhima then summoned to the combat that athlete known by the name of\r\nJimuta who was like unto the Asura Vritra whose prowess was widely known.\r\nAnd both of them were possessed of great courage, and both were endued\r\nwith terrible prowess. And they were like a couple of infuriate and\r\nhuge-bodied elephants, each sixty years old. And those brave tigers among\r\nmen then cheerfully engaged in a wrestling combat, desirous of\r\nvanquishing each other. And terrible was the encounter that took place\r\nbetween them, like the clash of the thunderbolt against the stony\r\nmountain-breast. And both of them were exceedingly powerful and extremely\r\ndelighted at each other's strength. And desirous of vanquishing each\r\nother, each stood eager to take advantage of his adversary's lapse. And\r\nboth were greatly delighted and both looked like infuriate elephants of\r\nprodigious size. And various were the modes of attack and defence that\r\nthey exhibited with their clenched fists.[12] And each dashed against the\r\nother and flung his adversary to a distance. And each cast the other down\r\nand pressed him close to the ground. And each got up again and squeezed\r\nthe other in his arms. And each threw the other violently off his place\r\nby boxing him on the breast. And each caught the other by the legs and\r\nwhirling him round threw him down on the ground. And they slapped each\r\nother with their palms that struck as hard as the thunderbolt. And they\r\nalso struck each other with their outstretched fingers, and stretching\r\nthem out like spears thrust the nails into each other's body. And they\r\ngave each other violent kicks. And they struck knee and head against\r\nhead, producing the crash of one stone against another. And in this\r\nmanner that furious combat between those warriors raged on without\r\nweapons, sustained mainly by the power of their arms and their physical\r\nand mental energy, to the infinite delight of the concourse of\r\nspectators. And all people, O king, took deep interest in that encounter\r\nof those powerful wrestlers who fought like Indra and the Asura Vritra.\r\nAnd they cheered both of them with loud acclamations of applause. And the\r\nbroad-chested and long-armed experts in wrestling then pulled and pressed\r\nand whirled and hurled down each other and struck each other with their\r\nknees, expressing all the while their scorn for each other in loud\r\nvoices. And they began to fight with their bare arms in this way, which\r\nwere like spiked maces of iron. And at last the powerful and mighty-armed\r\nBhima, the slayer of his foes, shouting aloud seized the vociferous\r\nathlete by the arms even as the lion seizes the elephant, and taking him\r\nup from the ground and holding him aloft, began to whirl him round, to\r\nthe great astonishment of the assembled athletes and the people of\r\nMatsya. And having whirled him round and round a hundred times till he\r\nwas insensible, the strong-armed Vrikodara dashed him to death on the\r\nground. And when the brave and renowned Jimuta was thus killed, Virata\r\nand his friends were filled with great delight. And in the exuberance of\r\nhis joy, the noble-minded king rewarded Vallava then and there with the\r\nliberality of Kuvera. And killing numerous athletes and many other men\r\npossessed of great bodily strength, he pleased the king very much. And\r\nwhen no one could be found there to encounter him in the lists, the king\r\nmade him fight with tigers and lions and elephants. And the king also\r\nmade him battle with furious and powerful lions in the harem for the\r\npleasure of the ladies. And Arjuna, too, pleased the king and all the\r\nladies of the inner apartments by singing and dancing. And Nakula pleased\r\nVirata, that best of kings, by showing him fleet and well-trained steeds\r\nthat followed him wherever he went. And the king, gratified with him,\r\nrewarded him with ample presents. And beholding around Sahadeva a herd of\r\nwell-trained bullocks, Virata that bull among men, bestowed upon him also\r\nwealth of diverse kinds. And, O king, Draupadi distressed to see all\r\nthose warriors suffer pain, sighed incessantly. And it was in this way\r\nthat those eminent persons lived there in disguise, rendering services\r\nunto king Virata.'\""

And, O monarch,\r\nalthough herself deserving to be waited upon by others, the daughter of\r\nYajnasena, O Janamejaya, passed her days in extreme misery, waiting upon\r\nSudeshna. And residing thus in Sudeshna's apartments, the princess of\r\nPanchala pleased that lady as also the other females of the inner\r\napartments. And it came to pass that as the year was about to expire, the\r\nredoubtable Kichaka, the Commander of Virata's forces, chanced to behold\r\nthe daughter of Drupada. And beholding that lady endued with the\r\nsplendour of a daughter of the celestials, treading the earth like a\r\ngoddess, Kichaka, afflicted with the shafts of Kama, desired to possess\r\nher. And burning with desire's flame, Virata's general came to Sudeshna\r\n(his sister) and smilingly addressed her in these words, 'This beauteous\r\nlady had never before been seen by me in king Virata's abode. This damsel\r\nmaddens me with her beauty, even as a new wine maddens one with its\r\nfragrance. Tell me, who is this graceful and captivating lady possessed\r\nof the beauty of a goddess, and whose she is, and whence she hath come.\r\nSurely, grinding my heart she hath reduced me to subjection. It seems to\r\nme that (save her) there is no other medicine for my illness. O, this\r\nfair hand-maid of thine seemeth to me to be possessed of the beauty of a\r\ngoddess. Surely, one like her is ill suited to serve thee. Let her rule\r\nover me and whatever is mine. O, let her grace my spacious and beautiful\r\npalace, decked with various ornaments of gold, full of viands and drinks\r\nin profusion, with excellent plates, and containing every kind of plenty,\r\nbesides elephants and horses and cars in myriads. And having consulted\r\nwith Sudeshna thus, Kichaka went to princess Draupadi, and like a jackal\r\nin the forest accosting a lioness, spoke unto Krishna these words in a\r\nwinning voice, 'Who and whose art thou, O beautiful one? And O thou of\r\nbeautiful face, whence hast thou come to the city of Virata? Tell me all\r\nthis, O fair lady. Thy beauty and gracefulness are of the very first\r\norder and the comeliness of thy features is unparalleled. With its\r\nloveliness thy face shineth ever like the resplendent moon. O thou of\r\nfair eye-brows, thy eyes are beautiful and large like lotus-petals. Thy\r\nspeech also, O thou of beautiful limbs, resembles the notes of the\r\ncuckoo. O thou of fair hips, never before in this world have I beheld a\r\nwoman possessed of beauty like thine, O thou of faultless features. Art\r\nthou Lakshmi herself having her abode in the midst of lotuses or, art\r\nthou, O slender-waisted one, she who is called Bhuti[13]. Or, which\r\namongst these--Hri, Sri, Kirti and Kanti,--art thou, O thou of beautiful\r\nface? Or possessed of beauty like Rati's, art thou, she who sporteth in\r\nthe embraces of the God of love? O thou that possessest the fairest of\r\neye-brows, thou shinest beautifully even like the lovely light of the\r\nmoon. Who is there in the whole world that will not succumb to the\r\ninfluence of desire beholding thy face? Endued with unrivalled beauty and\r\ncelestial grace of the most attractive kind, that face of thine is even\r\nlike the full moon, its celestial effulgence resembling his radiant face,\r\nits smile resembling his soft-light, and its eye-lashes looking like the\r\nspokes on his disc? Both thy bosoms, so beautiful and well-developed and\r\nendued with unrivalled gracefulness and deep and well-rounded and without\r\nany space between them, are certainly worthy of being decked with\r\ngarlands of gold. Resembling in shape the beautiful buds of the lotus,\r\nthese thy breast, O thou of fair eye-brows, are even as the whips of Kama\r\nthat are urging me forward, O thou of sweet smiles, O damsel of slender\r\nwaist, beholding that waist of thine marked with four wrinkles and\r\nmeasuring but a span, and slightly stooping forward because of the weight\r\nof thy breasts, and also looking on those graceful hips of thine broad as\r\nthe banks of a river, the incurable fever of desire, O beauteous lady,\r\nafflicteth me sore. The flaming fire of desire, fierce as a forest\r\nconflagration, and fanned by the hope my heart cherisheth of a union with\r\nthee is consuming me intensely. O thou of exceeding beauty quench thou\r\nthat flaming fire kindled by Manmatha. Union with thee is a rain-charged\r\ncloud, and the surrender of thy person is the shower that the cloud may\r\ndrop. O thou of face resembling the moon, the fierce and maddening shafts\r\nof Manmatha whetted and sharpened by the desire of a union with thee,\r\npiercing this heart of mine in their impetuous course, have penetrated\r\ninto its core. O black-eyed lady, those impetuous and cruel shafts are\r\nmaddening me beyond endurance. It behoveth thee to relieve me from this\r\nplight by surrendering thyself to me and favouring me with thy embraces.\r\nDecked in beautiful garlands and robes and adorned with every ornament,\r\nsport thou, O sweet damsel, with me to thy fill. O thou of the gait of an\r\nelephant in rut, deserving as thou art of happiness though deprived of it\r\nnow, it behoveth thee not to dwell here in misery. Let unrivalled weal be\r\nthine. Drinking various kinds of charming and delicious and ambrosial\r\nwines, and sporting at thy pleasure in the enjoyment of diverse objects\r\nof delight, do thou, O blessed lady, attain auspicious prosperity. This\r\nbeauty of thine and this prime of thy youth, O sweet lady, are now\r\nwithout their use. For, O beauteous and chaste damsel, endued with such\r\nloveliness, thou dost not shine, like a graceful garland lying unused and\r\nunworn. I will forsake all my old wives. Let them, O thou of sweet\r\nsmiles, become thy slaves. And I also, O fair damsel, will stay by thee\r\nas thy slave, ever obedient to thee, O thou of the most handsome face.'\r\nHearing these words of his, Draupadi replied, 'In desiring me, a female\r\nservant of low extraction, employed in the despicable office of dressing\r\nhair, O Suta's son, thou desirest one that deserves not that honour.\r\nThen, again, I am the wife of others. Therefore, good betide thee, this\r\nconduct of thine is not proper. Do thou remember the precept of morality,\r\nviz., that persons should take delight only in their wedded wives. Thou\r\nshouldst not, therefore, by any means bend thy heart to adultery. Surely\r\nabstaining from improper acts is ever the study of those that are good.\r\nOvercome by ignorance sinful men under the influence of desire come by\r\neither extreme infamy or dreadful calamity.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the Sairindhri, the wicked\r\nKichaka losing control over his senses and overcome by lust, although\r\naware of the numerous evils of fornication, evils condemned by everybody\r\nand sometimes leading to the destruction of life itself,--then spoke unto\r\nDraupadi, 'It behoveth thee not, O beauteous lady, O thou of graceful\r\nfeatures, thus to disregard me who am, O thou of sweet smiles, under the\r\npower of Manmatha on thy account. If now, O timid one, thou disregardest\r\nme who am under thy influence and who speak to thee so fair, thou wilt, O\r\nblack-eyed damsel, have to repent for it afterwards. O thou of graceful\r\neye-brows, the real lord of this entire kingdom, O slender-waisted lady,\r\nis myself. It is me depending upon whom the people of this realm live. In\r\nenergy and prowess I am unrivalled on earth. There is no other man on\r\nearth who rivals me in beauty of person, in youth, in prosperity, and in\r\nthe possession of excellent objects of enjoyment. Why it is, O auspicious\r\nlady, that having it in thy power to enjoy here every object of desire\r\nand every luxury and comfort without its equal, thou preferest servitude.\r\nBecoming the mistress of this kingdom which I shall confer on thee, O\r\nthou of fair face, accept me, and enjoy, O beauteous one, all excellent\r\nobjects of desire.' Addressed in these accursed words by Kichaka, that\r\nchaste daughter of Drupada answered him thus reprovingly, 'Do not, O son\r\nof a Suta, act so foolishly and do not throw away thy life. Know that I\r\nam protected by my five husbands. Thou canst not have me. I have\r\nGandharvas for my husbands. Enraged they will slay thee. Therefore, do\r\nthou not bring destruction on thyself. Thou intendest to tread along a\r\npath that is incapable of being trod by men. Thou, O wicked one, art even\r\nlike a foolish child that standing on one shore of the ocean intends to\r\ncross over to the other. Even if thou enterest into the interior of the\r\nearth, or soarest into the sky, or rushest to the other shore of the\r\nocean, still thou wilt have no escape from the hands of those sky-ranging\r\noffspring of gods, capable of grinding all foes. Why dost thou today, O\r\nKichaka, solicit me so persistently even as a sick person wisheth for the\r\nnight that will put a stop to his existence? Why dost thou desire me,\r\neven like an infant lying on its mother's lap wishing to catch the moon?\r\nFor thee that thus solicitest their beloved wife, there is no refuge\r\neither on earth or in sky. O Kichaka, hast thou no sense which leads thee\r\nto seek thy good and by which thy life may be saved?'\""

I shall then send my Sairindhri to thee on the pretence of bringing\r\nwine. And when she will repair thither do thou in solitude, free from\r\ninterruption, humour her as thou likest.

Thereupon the Sairindhri replied, 'O princess, I\r\nshall not be able to repair to Kichaka's apartments. Thou thyself\r\nknowest, O queen, how shameless he is. O thou of faultless limbs, O\r\nbeauteous lady, in thy palace I shall not be able to lead a lustful life,\r\nbecoming faithless to my husbands.

And filled with apprehension, and weeping,\r\nDraupadi mentally prayed for the protection of the gods, and set out for\r\nKichaka's abode for fetching wine.

Hearing these words,\r\nDraupadi said, 'I have been sent to thee by the princess for taking away\r\nwine. Do thou speedily bring me wine, for she told me that she is\r\nexceedingly thirsty.' And this, Kichaka said, 'O gentle lady, others will\r\ncarry what the princess wants.' And saying this, the Suta's son caught\r\nhold of Draupadi's right arm. And at this, Draupadi exclaimed, 'As I have\r\nnever, from intoxication of the senses, been unfaithful to my husbands\r\neven at heart, by that Truth, O wretch, I shall behold thee dragged and\r\nlying powerless on the ground.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Seeing that large-eyed lady reproving him in\r\nthat strain, Kichaka suddenly seized her by the end of her upper garment\r\nas she attempted to run away.

And both\r\nYudhishthira and Bhimasena who were seated there, beheld with wrathful\r\neyes that outrage on Krishna by Kichaka. And desirous of compassing the\r\ndestruction of the wicked Kichaka, the illustrious Bhima gnashed his\r\nteeth in rage. And his forehead was covered with sweat, and terrible\r\nwrinkles appeared thereon. And a smoky exhalation shot forth from his\r\neyes, and his eye-lashes stood on end. And that slayer of hostile heroes\r\npressed his forehead with his hands. And impelled by rage, he was on the\r\npoint of starting up with speed. Thereat king Yudhishthira, apprehensive\r\nof discovery, squeezed his thumbs and commanded Bhima to forbear. And\r\nBhima who then looked like an infuriate elephant eyeing a large tree, was\r\nthus forbidden by his elder brother. And the latter said, 'Lookest thou,\r\nO cook, for trees for fuel. If thou art in need of faggots, then go out\r\nand fell trees.' And the weeping Draupadi of fair hips, approaching the\r\nentrance of the court, and seeing her melancholy lords, desirous yet of\r\nkeeping up the disguise duty-bound by their pledge, with eyes burning in\r\nfire, spoke these words unto the king of the Matsyas, 'Alas, the son of a\r\nSuta hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those whose foe can\r\nnever sleep in peace even if four kingdoms intervene between him and\r\nthem. Alas, the son of a Suta hath kicked today the proud and beloved\r\nwife of those truthful personages, who are devoted to Brahmanas and who\r\nalways give away without asking any thing in gift. Alas! the son of a\r\nSuta hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those, the sounds of\r\nwhose kettle-drums and the twangs of whose bow-strings are ceaselessly\r\nheard. Alas, the son of a Suta hath kicked today the proud and beloved\r\nwife of those who are possessed of abundant energy and might, and who are\r\nliberal in gifts and proud of their dignity. Alas, the son of a Suta hath\r\nkicked today the proud and beloved wife of those who, if they had not\r\nbeen fettered by the ties of duty, could destroy this entire world.\r\nWhere, alas, are those mighty warriors today who, though living in\r\ndisguise, have always granted protection unto those that solicit it? Oh,\r\nwhy do those heroes today, endued as they are with strength and possessed\r\nof immeasurable energy, quietly suffer, like eunuchs, their dear and\r\nchaste wife to be thus insulted by a Suta's son? Oh, where is that wrath\r\nof theirs, that prowess, and that energy, when they quietly bear their\r\nwife to be thus insulted by a wicked wretch? What can I (a weak woman) do\r\nwhen Virata, deficient in virtue, coolly suffereth my innocent self to be\r\nthus wronged by a wretch? Thou dost not, O king, act like a king towards\r\nthis Kichaka. Thy behaviour is like that of a robber, and doth not shine\r\nin a court. That I should thus be insulted in thy very presence, O\r\nMatsya, is highly improper. Oh, let all the courtiers here look at this\r\nviolence of Kichaka. Kichaka is ignorant of duty and morality, and Matsya\r\nalso is equally so.

Then the courtiers, having learnt every thing, applauded\r\nKrishna, and they all exclaimed, 'Well done!' 'Well done!' and censured\r\nKichaka. And the courtiers said, 'That person who owneth this large-eyed\r\nlady having every limb of hers endued with beauty for his wife,\r\npossesseth what is of exceeding value and hath no occasion to indulge in\r\nany grief. Surely, such a damsel of transcendent beauty and limbs\r\nperfectly faultless is rare among men. Indeed, it seems to us that she is\r\na goddess.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'And while the courtiers, having beheld Krishna\r\n(under such circumstances), were applauding her thus, Yudhishthira's\r\nforehead, from ire, became covered with sweat. And that bull of the Kuru\r\nrace then addressed that princess, his beloved spouse, saying, 'Stay not\r\nhere, O Sairindhri; but retire to the apartments of Sudeshna. The wives\r\nof heroes bear affliction for the sake of their husbands, and undergoing\r\ntoil in ministering unto their lords, they at last attain to region where\r\ntheir husbands may go. Thy Gandharva husbands, effulgent as the sun, do\r\nnot, I imagine, consider this as an occasion for manifesting their wrath,\r\ninasmuch as they do not rush to thy aid. O Sairindhri, thou art ignorant\r\nof the timeliness of things, and it is for this that thou weepest as an\r\nactress, besides interrupting the play of dice in Matsya's court. Retire,\r\nO Sairindhri; the Gandharvas will do what is agreeable to thee. And they\r\nwill surely display thy woe and take the life of him that hath wronged\r\nthee.' Hearing these words the Sairindhri replied, 'They of whom I am the\r\nwedded wife are, I ween, extremely kind. And as the eldest of them all is\r\naddicted to dice, they are liable to be oppressed by all.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'And having said this, the fair-hipped Krishna\r\nwith dishevelled hair and eyes red in anger, ran towards the apartments\r\nof Sudhesna. And in consequence of having wept long her face looked\r\nbeautiful like the lunar disc in the firmament, emerged from the clouds.\r\nAnd beholding her in that condition, Sudeshna asked, 'Who, O beauteous\r\nlady, hath insulted thee? Why, O amiable damsel, dost thou weep? Who,\r\ngentle one, hath done thee wrong? Whence is this thy grief?' Thus\r\naddressed, Draupadi said, 'As I went to bring wine for thee, Kichaka\r\nstruck me in the court in the very presence of the king, as if in the\r\nmidst of a solitary wood.' Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'O thou of\r\ntresses ending in beautiful curls, as Kichaka, maddened by lust hath\r\ninsulted thee that art incapable of being possessed by him, I shall cause\r\nhim to be slain if thou wishest it.' Thereupon Draupadi answered, 'Even\r\nothers will slay him,--even they whom he hath wronged, I think it is\r\nclear that he will have to go to the abode of Yama this very day!'\""

And Drupada's daughter of dark\r\nhue and slender waist then performed her ablutions. And washing her body\r\nand cloths with water Krishna began to ponder weepingly on the means of\r\ndispelling her grief. And she reflected, saying, 'What am I to do?\r\nWhither shall I go? How can my purpose be effected?' And while she was\r\nthinking thus, she remembered Bhima and said to herself, 'There is none\r\nelse, save Bhima, that can today accomplish the purpose on which my heart\r\nis set!' And afflicted with great grief, the large-eyed and intelligent\r\nKrishna possessed of powerful protectors then rose up at night, and\r\nleaving her bed speedily proceeded towards the quarters of Bhimasena,\r\ndesirous of beholding her lord. And possessed of great intelligence, the\r\ndaughter of Drupada entered her husband's quarters, saying, 'How canst\r\nthou sleep while that wretched commander of Virata's forces, who is my\r\nfoe, yet liveth, having perpetrated today that (foul act)?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the chamber where Bhima slept, breathing\r\nhard like a lion, being filled with the beauty of Drupada's daughter and\r\nof the high-souled Bhima, blazed forth in splendour. And Krishna of sweet\r\nsmiles, finding Bhimasena in the cooking apartments, approached him with\r\nthe eagerness of a three-year old cow brought up in the woods,\r\napproaching a powerful bull, in her first season, or of a she-crane\r\nliving by the water-side approaching her mate in the pairing season. And\r\nthe Princess of Panchala then embraced the second son of Pandu, even as a\r\ncreeper embraces a huge and mighty Sala on the banks of the Gomati. And\r\nembracing him with her arms, Krishna of faultless features awaked him as\r\na lioness awaketh a sleeping lion in a trackless forest. And embracing\r\nBhimasena even as a she-elephant embraceth her mighty mate, the faultless\r\nPanchali addressed him in voice sweet as the sound of a stringed\r\ninstrument emitting Gandhara note. And she said, 'Arise, arise! Why dost\r\nthou, O Bhimasena, lie down as one dead? Surely, he that is not dead,\r\nnever suffereth a wicked wretch that hath disgraced his wife, to live.'\r\nAnd awakened by the princess, Bhima of mighty arms, then rose up, and sat\r\nupon his couch overlaid with a rich bed. And he of the Kuru race then\r\naddressed the princess--his beloved wife, saying, 'For what purpose hast\r\nthou come hither in such a hurry? Thy colour is gone and thou lookest\r\nlean and pale. Tell me everything in detail. I must know the truth.\r\nWhether it be pleasurable or painful, agreeable, or disagreeable, tell me\r\nall. Having heard everything, I shall apply the remedy. I alone, O\r\nKrishna, am entitled to thy confidence in all things, for it is I who\r\ndeliver thee from perils again and again! Tell me quickly what is thy\r\nwish, and what is the purpose that is in thy view, and return thou to thy\r\nbed before others awake.'\""

Of what value is life, O Bharata, when\r\nthou, O son of Kunti, dost not think me miserable, although I am\r\nafflicted with such woes? That vile and wicked wretch, O Bharata, known\r\nby the name of Kichaka, who is the brother-in-law of king Virata and the\r\ncommander of his forces, every day, O tiger among men, addresses me who\r\nam residing in the palace as a Sairindhri, saying, 'Do thou become my\r\nwife.'--Thus solicited, O slayer of foes, by that wretch deserving to be\r\nslain, my heart is bursting like a fruit ripened in season. Censure thou\r\nthat elder brother of thine addicted to execrable dice, through whose act\r\nalone I have been afflicted with such woe.

Alas, he who, while sojourning, was\r\nfollowed by ten thousand elephants adorned with golden garlands now\r\nsupports himself by casting dice. That Yudhishthira who at Indraprastha\r\nwas adored by kings of incomparable prowess by hundreds of thousands,\r\nthat mighty monarch in whose kitchen a hundred thousand maid-servants,\r\nplate in hand, used every day to feed numerous guests day and night, that\r\nbest of liberal men, who gave (every day) a thousand nishkas, alas, even\r\nhe overwhelmed with woe in consequence of gambling which is the root of\r\nall evil, now supporteth himself by casting dice. Bards and encomiasts by\r\nthousands decked with ear-rings set with brilliant gems, and gifted with\r\nmelodious voice, used to pay him homage morning and evening. Alas, that\r\nYudhishthira, who was daily waited upon by a thousand sages of ascetic\r\nmerit, versed in the Vedas and having every desire gratified, as his\r\ncourtiers,--that Yudhishthira who maintained eighty-eight thousands of\r\ndomestic Snatakas with thirty maid-servants assigned unto each, as also\r\nten thousand yatis not accepting anything in gift and with vital seed\r\ndrawn up,--alas, even that mighty king now liveth in such guise.

Who is there whose grief is not enhanced at sight\r\nof thee, O bull of the Bharata race, engaged in the ignoble office of a\r\ncook, so entirely beneath thee and calling thyself as one of Vallava\r\ncaste? What can be sadder than this, that people should know thee as\r\nVirata's cook, Vallava by name, and therefore one that is sunk in\r\nservitude? Alas, when thy work of the kitchen is over, thou humbly\r\nsittest beside Virata, calling thyself as Vallava the cook, then\r\ndespondency seizeth my heart. When the king of kings in joy maketh thee\r\nfight with elephants, and the women of the inner apartments (of the\r\npalace) laugh all the while, then I am sorely distressed. When thou\r\nfightest in the inner apartments with lions, tigers, and buffaloes, the\r\nprincess Kaikeyi looking on, then I almost swoon away. And when Kaikeyi\r\nand those maidservants, leaving their seats, come to assist me and find\r\nthat instead of suffering any injury in limbs mine is only a swoon, the\r\nprincess speaks unto her women, saying, 'Surely, it is from affection and\r\nthe duty begot of intercourse that this lady of sweet smiles grieveth for\r\nthe exceedingly powerful cook when he fights with the beasts. Sairindhri\r\nis possessed of great beauty and Vallava also is eminently handsome. The\r\nheart of woman is hard to know, and they, I fancy, are deserving of each\r\nother. It is, therefore, likely that the Sairindhri invariably weepeth\r\n(at such times) on account of her connection with her lover. And then,\r\nthey both have entered this royal family at the same time. And speaking\r\nsuch words she always upbraideth me. And beholding me wroth at this, she\r\nsuspects me to be attached to thee.' When she speaketh thus, great is the\r\ngrief that I feel. Indeed, on beholding thee, O Bhima of terrible\r\nprowess, afflicted with such calamity, sunk as I already am in grief on\r\naccount of Yudhishthira. I do not desire to live. That youth who on a\r\nsingle car had vanquished all celestials and men, is now, alas, the\r\ndancing master of king Virata's daughter. That Pritha's son of\r\nimmeasurable soul, who had gratified Agni in the forest of Khandava, is\r\nnow living in the inner apartments (of a palace) like fire hid in a well.\r\nAlas, the bull among men, Dhananjaya, who was ever the terror of foes, is\r\nnow living in a guise that is despaired by all. Alas, he whose mace-like\r\narms have been cicatrized in consequence of the strokes of his\r\nbow-string, alas that Dhananjaya is passing the days in grief covering\r\nhis wrists with bracelets of conchs. Alas, that Dhananjaya the twang of\r\nwhose bow-string and the sound of whose leathern fences made every foe\r\ntremble, now entertains only gladdened women with his songs. Oh, that\r\nDhananjaya whose head was formerly decked with a diadem of solar\r\nsplendour, is now wearing braids ending in unsightly curls. O Bhima,\r\nbeholding that terrible bowman, Arjuna, now wearing braids and in the\r\nmidst of women, my heart is stricken with woe. That high-souled hero who\r\nis master of all the celestial weapons, and who is the repository of all\r\nthe sciences, now weareth ear-rings (like one of the fair sex). That\r\nyouth whom kings of incomparable prowess could not overpower in fight,\r\neven as the waters of the mighty ocean cannot overleap the continents, is\r\nnow the dancing-master of king Virata's daughters and waits upon them in\r\ndisguise. O Bhima, that Arjuna the clatter of whose car-wheels caused the\r\nentire earth with her mountains and forests, her mobile and immobile\r\nthings to tremble, and whose birth dispelled all the sorrows of Kunti,\r\nthat exalted hero, that younger brother of thine, O Bhimasena, now maketh\r\nme weep for him. Beholding him coming towards me, decked in golden\r\near-rings and other ornaments, and wearing on the wrists bracelets of\r\nconchs, my heart is afflicted with despondency. And Dhananjaya who hath\r\nnot a bowman equal unto him on earth in prowess, now passeth his days in\r\nsinging, surrounded by women. Beholding that son of Pritha who in virtue,\r\nheroism and truth, was the most admired in the world, now living in the\r\nguise of a woman, my heart is afflicted with sorrow. When I behold, the\r\ngodlike Partha in the music-hall like an elephant with rent temples\r\nsurrounded by she-elephants in the midst of females, waiting before\r\nVirata the king of the Matsyas, then I lose all sense of directions.\r\nSurely, my mother-in-law doth not know Dhananjaya to be afflicted with\r\nsuch extreme distress. Nor doth she know that descendant of the Kuru\r\nrace, Ajatasatru, addicted to disastrous dice, to be sunk in misery. O\r\nBharata, beholding the youngest of you all, Sahadeva, superintending the\r\nkine, in the guise of a cowherd, I grow pale. Always thinking of\r\nSahadeva's plight, I cannot, O Bhimasena, obtain sleep,--what to speak\r\nyou of the rest? I do not know, O mighty-armed one, what sin Sahadeva may\r\nhave committed for which that hero of unbaffled prowess suffereth such\r\nmisery. O foremost of the Bharatas, beholding that beloved brother of\r\nthine, that bull among men, employed by Matsya in looking after his kine,\r\nI am filled with woe. Seeing that hero of proud disposition gratifying\r\nVirata, by living at the head of his cowherds, attired in robes dyed in\r\nred. I am attacked with fever. My mother-in-law always applauds the\r\nheroic Sahadeva as one possessed of nobility, excellent behaviour, and\r\nrectitude of conduct. Ardently attached to her sons, the weeping Kunti\r\nstood, embracing Sahadeva while he was about to set out (with us) for the\r\ngreat forest. And she addressed me saying, \"Sahadeva is bashful and\r\nsweet-speeched, and virtuous. He is also my favourite child. Therefore, O\r\nYajnaseni, tend him in the forest day and night. Delicate and brave,\r\ndevoted to the king, and always worshipping his elder brother, do thou, O\r\nPanchali, feed him thyself.' O Pandava, beholding that foremost of\r\nwarriors, Sahadeva, engaged in tending kine, and sleeping at night on\r\ncalf-skins, how can I bear to live? He again who is crowned with the\r\nthree attributes of beauty, arms, and intelligence, is now the\r\nsuperintendent of Virata's steeds. Behold the change brought on by time.\r\nGranthika (Nakula), at sight of whom hostile hosts fled from the field of\r\nbattle, now traineth horses in the presence of the king, driving them\r\nwith the speed. Alas, I now see that handsome youth wait upon the\r\ngorgeously decked and excellent Virata, the king of the Matsyas, and\r\ndisplay horses before him. O son of Pritha, afflicted as I am with all\r\nthese hundred kinds of misery on account of Yudhishthira, why dost thou,\r\nO chastiser of foes, yet deem me happy? Listen now to me, O son of Kunti,\r\nas I tell thee of other woes far surpassing these. What can be sadder to\r\nme than miseries so various as these should emaciate me while ye are\r\nalive.'\""

And, O chastiser of foes, behold the plight of poignant woe\r\nwhich I, a princess, am now in. I am living in expectation of the close\r\nof this stated period.[14] The extreme of misery, therefore, is mine.\r\nSuccess of purpose, victory, and defeat, as regards mortals, are\r\ntransitory. It is in this belief that I am living in expectation of the\r\nreturn of prosperity to my husbands. Prosperity and adversity revolve\r\nlike a wheel. It is in this belief that I am living in expectation of the\r\nreturn of prosperity to my husbands. That cause which bringeth on\r\nvictory, may bring defeat as well. I live in this hope. Why dost thou\r\nnot, O Bhimasena, regard me as one dead? I have heard that persons that\r\ngive may beg: that they who slay may be slain; and that they who\r\nover-throw others may themselves be overthrown by foes. Nothing is\r\ndifficult for Destiny and none can over-ride Destiny. It is for this that\r\nI am awaiting the return of favourable fortune. As a tank once dried, is\r\nfilled up once again, so hoping for a change for the better, I await the\r\nreturn of prosperity. When one's business that hath been well-provided\r\nfor is seen to be frustrated, a truly wise person should never strive for\r\nbringing back good fortune. Plunged as I am an sorrow, asked or unasked\r\nby thee to explain the purpose of these words spoken by me, I shall tell\r\nthee everything. Queen of the sons of Pandu and daughter of Drupada, who\r\nelse, save myself, would wish to live, having fallen into such a plight?\r\nO represser of foes, the misery, therefore, that hath overtaken me, hath\r\nreally humiliated the entire Kuru race, the Panchalas, and the sons of\r\nPandu. Surrounded by numerous brothers and father-in-law and sons, what\r\nother woman having such cause for joy, save myself, would be afflicted\r\nwith such woe? Surely, I must, in my childhood, have committed act highly\r\noffensive to Dhatri through whose displeasure, O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, I have been visited with such consequences. Mark, O son of Pandu,\r\nthe pallour that hath come over my complexion which not even a life in\r\nthe woods fraught as it was with extreme misery, could bring about. Thou,\r\nO Pritha's son, knowest what happiness, O Bhima, was formerly mine. Even,\r\nI, who was such have now sunk into servitude. Sorely distressed, I can\r\nfind no rest. That the mighty-armed and terrible bowman, Dhananjaya the\r\nson of Pritha, should now live like a fire that hath been put out, maketh\r\nme think of all this as attributable to Destiny. Surely, O son of Pritha,\r\nit is impossible for men to understand the destinies of creatures (in\r\nthis world). I, therefore, think this downfall of yours as something that\r\ncould not be averted by forethought. Alas, she who hath you all, that\r\nresemble Indra himself to attend to her comforts--even she, so chaste and\r\nexalted, hath now to attend to the comforts of others, that are to her\r\nfar inferior in rank. Behold, O Pandava, my plight. It is what I do not\r\ndeserve. You are alive, yet behold this inversion of order that time hath\r\nbrought. She who had the whole Earth to the verge of the sea under her\r\ncontrol, is now under the control of Sudeshna and living in fear of her.\r\nShe who had dependants to walk both before and behind her, alas, now\r\nherself walketh before and behind Sudeshna. This, O Kaunteya, is another\r\ngrief of mine that is intolerable. O, listen to it. She who had never,\r\nsave for Kunti, pounded unguents even for her own use, now, good betide\r\nthee, poundeth sandal (for others). O Kaunteya, behold these hands of\r\nmine which were not so before. Saying this she showed him her hands\r\nmarked with corns. And she continued, she who had never feared Kunti\r\nherself nor thee and thy brothers, now standeth in fear before Virata as\r\na slave, anxious of what that king of kings may say unto her regarding\r\nthe proper preparation of the unguents, for Matsya liketh not sandal\r\npounded by others.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Relating her woes thus, O Bharata, unto\r\nBhimasena, Krishna began to weep silently, casting her eyes on Bhima. And\r\nthen, with words choked in tears, and sighing repeatedly, she addressed\r\nBhima in these words, powerfully stirring his heart, 'Signal, O Bhima,\r\nmust have been my offence of old unto the gods, for, unfortunate as I am.\r\nI am yet alive, when, O Pandava, I should die.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then that slayer of hostile heroes, Vrikodara,\r\ncovering his face with those delicate hands of his wife marked with\r\ncorns, began to weep.

I would have caused a carnage in Virata's court but for the fact\r\nthat Kunti's son eyed me (by way of forbidding it), or like a mighty\r\nelephant. I would, without ado, have crushed the head of Kichaka\r\nintoxicated with the pride of sovereignty. When, O Krishna, I beheld thee\r\nkicked by Kichaka, I conceived at that instant a wholesale slaughter of\r\nthe Matsyas. Yudhishthira, however, forbade me by a glance, and, O\r\nbeauteous lady, understanding his intention I have kept quiet. That we\r\nhave been deprived of our kingdom, that I have not yet slain the Kurus,\r\nthat I have not yet taken the heads of Suyodhana and Karna, and Suvala's\r\nson Sakuni, and the wicked Duhsasana, these acts and omissions, O lady,\r\nare consuming every limb of mine. The thought of those abides in my heart\r\nlike a javelin implanted in it. O thou of graceful hips, do not sacrifice\r\nvirtue, and, O noble-hearted lady, subdue thy wrath. If king Yudhishthira\r\nhear from thee such rebukes, he will surely put an end to his life. If\r\nalso Dhananjaya and the twins hear thee speak thus, even they will\r\nrenounce life. And if these, O slender-waisted maiden, give up life. I\r\nalso shall not be able to bear my own. In olden days Sarjati's daughter,\r\nthe beautiful Sukanya, followed into the forest Chyavana of Bhrigu's\r\nrace, whose mind was under complete control, and over whom, while engaged\r\nin ascetic meditation, the ants had built a hill. Thou mayst have heard\r\nthat Indrasena also who in beauty was like unto Narayani herself,\r\nfollowed her husband aged a thousand years. Thou mayst have heard that\r\nJanaka's daughter Sita, the princess of Videha, followed her lord while\r\nliving in dense woods. And that lady of graceful hips, Rama's beloved\r\nwife, afflicted with calamities and persecuted by the Rakshasas, at\r\nlength regained the company of Rama. Lopamudra also, O timid one, endued\r\nwith youth and beauty, followed Agastya, renouncing all the objects of\r\nenjoyment unattainable by men. And the intelligent and faultless Savitri\r\nalso followed the heroic Satyavan, the son of Dyumatsena, alone into the\r\nworld of Yama. Even like these chaste and beautiful ladies that I have\r\nnamed, thou, O blessed girl, bloomest with every virtue. Do thou spend a\r\nshort while more that is measured by even a half month. And when the\r\nthirteenth year is complete, thou wilt (again) become the Queen regnant\r\nof a king.' Hearing these words, Draupadi said, 'Unable, O Bhima, to bear\r\nmy griefs, it is from grief alone that I have shed these tears. I do not\r\ncensure Yudhishthira. Nor is there any use in dwelling on the past. O\r\nBhima of mighty strength, come quickly forward to the work of the hour. O\r\nBhima, Kaikeyi, jealous of my beauty, always pains me by her endeavours\r\nto prevent the king from taking a fancy to me. And understanding this\r\ndisposition of hers, the wicked-souled Kichaka of immoral ways constantly\r\nsolicits me himself. Angry with him for this, but then suppressing my\r\nwrath I answer that wretch deprived of sense by lust, saying, 'O Kichaka,\r\nprotect thyself. I am the beloved queen and wife of five Gandharvas.\r\nThose heroes in wrath will slay thee that art so rash.' Thus addressed,\r\nKichaka of wicked soul replied unto me, saying, 'I have not the least\r\nfear of the Gandharvas, O Sairindhri of sweet smiles. I will slay hundred\r\nthousand Gandharvas, encountering them in battle. Therefore, O timid one,\r\ndo thou consent.' Hearing all this, I again addressed the lust-afflicted\r\nSuta, saying, 'Thou art no match for those illustrious Gandharvas. Of\r\nrespectable percentage and good disposition, I ever adhere to virtue and\r\nnever wish for the death of any one. It is for this that thou I vest, O\r\nKichaka!' At this, that wight of wicked soul burst out into a loud\r\nlaughter. And it came to pass that Kaikeyi previously urged by Kichaka,\r\nand moved by affection for her brother, and desirous of doing him a good\r\nturn, despatched me to him, saying 'Do thou, O Sairindhri, fetch wine\r\nfrom Kichaka's quarter's!' On beholding me the Suta's son at first\r\naddressed me in sweet words, and when that failed, he became exceedingly\r\nenraged, and intended to use violence. Understanding the purpose of the\r\nwicked Kichaka, I speedily rushed towards the place where the king was.\r\nFelling me on the ground the wretch then kicked me in the very presence\r\nof the king himself and before the eyes of Kanka and many others,\r\nincluding charioteers, and royal favourites, and elephant-riders, and\r\ncitizens. I rebuked the king and Kanka again and again. The king,\r\nhowever, neither prevented Kichaka, nor inflicted any chastisement on\r\nhim. The principal ally of king Virata in war, the cruel Kichaka reft of\r\nvirtue is loved by both the king and the queen. O exalted one, brave,\r\nproud, sinful, adulterous, and engrossed in all objects of enjoyment, he\r\nearneth immense wealth (from the king), and robs the possessions of\r\nothers even if they cry in distress. And he never walketh in the path of\r\nvirtue, nor doth he any virtuous act. Of wicked soul, and vicious\r\ndisposition, haughty and villainous, and always afflicted by the shafts\r\nof Kama, though repulsed repeatedly, if he sees me again, he will outrage\r\nme. I shall then surely renounce my life. Although striving to acquire\r\nvirtue (on my death) your highly meritorious acts will come to naught. Ye\r\nthat are now obeying your pledge, ye will lose your wife. By protecting,\r\none's wife one's offspring are protected, and by protecting one's\r\noffspring, one's own self is protected. And it is because one begets\r\none's own self in one's wife that the wife is called Jaya[15] by the\r\nwise. The husband also should be protected by the wife, thinking,--How\r\nelse will he take his birth in my womb?--I have heard it from Brahmanas\r\nexpounding the duties of the several orders that a Kshatriya hath no\r\nother duty than subduing enemies. Alas, Kichaka kicked me in the very\r\npresence of Yudhishthira the Just, and also of thyself, O Bhimasena of\r\nmighty strength. It was thou, O Bhima, that didst deliver me from the\r\nterrible Jatasura. It was thou also that with thy brothers didst vanquish\r\nJayadratha. Do thou now slay this wretch also who hath insulted me.\r\nPresuming upon his being a favourite of the king, Kichaka, O Bharata,\r\nhath enhanced my woe. Do thou, therefore, smash this lustful wight even\r\nlike an earthen pot dashed upon a stone. If, O Bharata, tomorrow's sun\r\nsheds his rays upon him who is the source of many griefs of mine, I\r\nshall, surely, mixing poison (with some drink), drink it up,--for I never\r\nshall yield to Kichaka. Far better it were, O Bhima, that I should die\r\nbefore thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana Continued, 'Having said this, Krishna, hiding her face in\r\nBhima's breast began to weep. And Bhima, embracing her, consoled her to\r\nthe best of his power. And having abundantly consoled that\r\nslender-waisted daughter of Drupada by means of words fraught with grave\r\nreason and sense, he wiped with his hands her face flooded with tears.\r\nAnd thinking of Kichaka and licking with his tongue the corners of his\r\nmouth, Bhima, filled with wrath thus spake to that distressed lady.'\""

O Yajnaseni of sweet smiles,\r\ntomorrow evening, renouncing sorrow and grief, manage to have a meeting\r\nwith Kichaka. The dancing-hall that the king of the Matsya hath caused to\r\nbe erected is used by the girls for dancing during the day. They repair,\r\nhowever, to their homes at night. There in that hall, is an excellent and\r\nwell-placed wooden bed-stead. Even there I will make him see the spirits\r\nof his deceased grandsires. But, O beautiful one, when thou holdest\r\nconverse with him, thou must manage it so that others may not espy thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having thus conversed with others, and shed\r\ntears in grief, they waited for the dawn of that night with painful\r\nimpatience. And when the night had passed away, Kichaka, rising in the\r\nmorning, went to the palace, and accosted Draupadi saying, 'Throwing thee\r\ndown in the court I kicked thee in the presence of the king. Attacked by\r\nmighty self, thou couldst not obtain protection. This Virata is in name\r\nonly the king of the Matsyas. Commanding the forces of this realm it is\r\nI, who am the real lord of the Matsyas. Do thou, O timid one, accept me\r\ncheerfully. I shall become thy slave. And, O thou of graceful hips, I\r\nwill immediately give thee a hundred nishkas, and engage a hundred male\r\nand a hundred female servants (to tend thee), and will also bestow on\r\nthee cars yoked with she-mules. O timid lady, let our union take place.'\r\nDraupadi replied, 'O Kichaka, know even this is my condition. Neither thy\r\nfriends nor thy brothers should know thy union with me. I am a terror of\r\ndetection by those illustrious Gandharvas. Promise me this, and I yield\r\nto thee.' Hearing this Kichaka said, 'I will, O thou of graceful hips, do\r\neven as thou sayest. Afflicted by the god of love, I will, O beauteous\r\ndamsel, alone repair to thy abode for union with thee, O thou of thighs\r\nround and tapering like the trunks of the plantain,--so that those\r\nGandharvas, effulgent as the sun, may not come to know of this act of\r\nthine.' Draupadi said, 'Do thou, when it is dark, go to the dancing-hall\r\nerected by the king of the Matsyas where the girls dance during the day,\r\nrepairing to their respective homes at night. The Gandharvas do not know\r\nthat place. We shall then without doubt, escape all censure.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Reflecting on the subject of her conversation\r\nwith Kichaka, that half a day seemed to Krishna as long as a whole month.\r\nAnd the stupid Kichaka also, not knowing that it was Death that had\r\nassumed the form of a Sairindhri, returning home experienced the greatest\r\ndelight. And deprived of sense by lust, Kichaka became speedily engaged\r\nin embellishing his person with unguents and garlands and ornaments. And\r\nwhile he was doing all this, thinking of that damsel of large eyes, the\r\nday seemed to him to be without an end. And the beauty of Kichaka, who\r\nwas about to forsake his beauty for ever, seemed to heighten, like the\r\nwick of a burning lamp about to expire. And reposing the fullest\r\nconfidence in Draupadi, Kichaka, deprived of his senses by lust and\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of expected meeting, did not even perceive\r\nthat the day had departed. Meanwhile, the beautiful Draupadi approaching\r\nher husband Bhima of the Kuru race, stood before him in the kitchen. And\r\nthat lady with tresses ending in beautiful curls then spake unto him,\r\nsaying, 'O chastiser of foes, even as thou hadst directed, I have given\r\nKichaka to understand that our meeting will take place in the\r\ndancing-hall. Alone will he come at night to the empty hall. Slay him\r\nthere, O thou of mighty arms. Do thou, O son of Kunti, repair to that\r\ndancing-hall, and take the life, O Pandava, of Kichaka, that son of a\r\nSuta intoxicated with vanity. From vanity alone, that son of a Suta\r\nslights the Gandharvas. O best of smiters, lift him up from the earth\r\neven as Krishna had lifted up the Naga (Kaliya) from the Yamuna. O\r\nPandava, afflicted as I am with grief, wipe thou my tears, and blessed be\r\nthou, protect thy own honour and that of thy race.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhima said, 'Welcome, O beauteous lady, Except the glad tidings thou\r\nbringest me, I need, O thou of exceeding beauty, no other aid whatever.\r\nThe delight that I feel, O thou of great beauty, on hearing from thee\r\nabout my coming encounter with Kichaka, is equal to what I felt in\r\nslaying Hidimva. I swear unto thee by Truth, by my brothers, and by\r\nmorality, that I will slay Kichaka even as the lord of the celestials\r\nslew Vritra. Whether secretly or openly, I will crush Kichaka, and if the\r\nMatsyas fight for him, then I will slay them too. And slaying Duryodhana\r\nafterwards, I shall win back the earth. Let Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nKunti, continue to pay homage unto the king of Matsya.' Hearing these\r\nwords of Bhima, Draupadi said, 'In order that, O lord, thou mayst not\r\nhave to renounce the truth already pledged to me, do thou, O hero, slay\r\nKichaka in secret.' Bhima assuring her said, 'Even today I shall slay\r\nKichaka together with his friends unknown to others during the darkness\r\nof the night. I shall, O faultless lady, crush, even as an elephant\r\ncrusheth a vela fruit, [16] the head of the wicked Kichaka who wisheth\r\nfor what is unattainable by him!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Repairing first to the place of assignation at\r\nnight, Bhima sat down, disguising himself. And he waited there in\r\nexpectation of Kichaka, like a lion lying in wait for a deer. And\r\nKichaka, having embellished his person as he chose, came to the\r\ndancing-hall at the appointed time in the hope of meeting Panchali. And\r\nthinking of the assignation, he entered the chamber. And having entered\r\nthat hall enveloped in deep gloom, that wretch of wicked soul came upon\r\nBhima of incomparable prowess, who had come a little before and who was\r\nwaiting in a corner. And as an insect approacheth towards a flaming fire,\r\nor a puny animal towards a lion, Kichaka approached Bhima, lying down in\r\na bed and burning in anger at the thought of the insult offered to\r\nKrishna, as if he were the Suta's Death. And having approached Bhima,\r\nKichaka possessed by lust, and his heart and soul filled with ecstacy\r\nsmilingly said, 'O thou of pencilled eye-brows, to thee I have already\r\ngiven many and various kinds of wealth from the stores earned by me, as\r\nwell as hundred maids and many fine robes, and also a mansion with an\r\ninner apartment adorned with beauteous and lovely and youthful maid\r\nservants and embellished by every kind of sports and amusements And\r\nhaving set all those apart for thee, I have speedily come hither. And all\r\non a sudden, women have begun to praise me, saying, 'There is not in this\r\nworld any other person like unto thee in beauty and dress!' Hearing this,\r\nBhima said, 'It is well that thou art handsome, and it is well thou\r\npraisest thyself. I think, however, that thou hadst never before this\r\nsuch pleasurable touch! Thou hast an acute touch, and knowest the ways of\r\ngallantry. Skilled in the art of love-making, thou art a favourite with\r\nwomen. There is none like thee in this world!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, that son of Kunti, the\r\nmighty-armed Bhima of terrible prowess, suddenly rose up, and laughingly\r\nsaid, 'Thy sister, O wretch, shall today behold thee dragged by me to the\r\nground, like a mighty elephant, huge as a mountain, dragged to the ground\r\nby a lion. Thyself slain Sairindhri will live in peace, and we, her\r\nhusbands, will also live in peace.' Saying this, the mighty Bhima seized\r\nKichaka by the hairs of his head, which were adorned with garlands. And\r\nthus seized with force by the hair, that foremost of mighty persons,\r\nKichaka, quickly freed his hair and grasped the arms of Bhima. And then\r\nbetween those lions among men, fired with wrath, between that chief of\r\nthe Kichaka clan, and that best of men, there ensued a hand-to-hand\r\nencounter, like that between two powerful elephants for a female elephant\r\nin the season of spring, or like that which happened in days of yore\r\nbetween those lions among monkeys, the brothers Vali and Sugriva. And\r\nboth equally infuriate and both eager for victory, both those combatants\r\nraised their arms resembling snakes furnished with five hoods, and\r\nattacked each other with their nails and teeth, wrought up to frenzy of\r\nwrath. Impetuously assailed by the powerful Kichaka in that encounter,\r\nthe resolute Bhima did not waver a single step. And locked in each\r\nother's embraces and dragging each other, they fought on like two mighty\r\nbulls. And having nails and teeth for their weapons, the encounter\r\nbetween them was fierce and terrible like that of two furious tigers. And\r\nfelling each other in fury, they encountered each other like a couple of\r\nelephants with rent temples. And the mighty Bhima then seized Kichaka,\r\nand Kichaka, that foremost of strong persons threw Bhima down with\r\nviolence. And as those mighty combatants fought on, the crash of their\r\narms produced a loud noise that resembled the clatter of splitting\r\nbamboos. Then Vrikodara throwing Kichaka down by main force within the\r\nroom, began to toss him about furiously even as a hurricane tosseth a\r\ntree. And attacked thus in battle by the powerful Bhima, Kichaka grew\r\nweak and began to tremble. For all that, however, he tugged at the\r\nPandava to the best of his power. And attacking Bhima, and making him\r\nwave a little, the mighty Kichaka struck him with his knees and brought\r\nhim down to the ground. And overthrown by the powerful Kichaka, Bhima\r\nquickly rose up like Yama himself with mace in hand. And thus that\r\npowerful Suta and the Pandava, intoxicated with strength and challenging\r\neach other, grappled with each other at midnight in that solitary place.\r\nAnd as they roared at each other in wrath, that excellent and strong\r\nedifice began to shake every moment. And slapped on the chest by the\r\nmighty Bhima, Kichaka fired with wrath moved not a single pace. And\r\nbearing for a moment only that onslaught incapable of being born on\r\nearth, the Suta, overpowered by Bhima's might, became enfeebled. And\r\nseeing him waning weak, Bhima endued with great strength forcibly drew\r\nKichaka towards his breast, and began to press hard. And breathing hard\r\nagain and again in wrath, that best of victors, Vrikodara, forcibly\r\nseized Kichaka by the hair. And having seized Kichaka, the mighty 'Bhima\r\nbegan to roar like a hungry tiger that hath killed a large animal. And\r\nfinding him exceedingly exhausted, Vrikodara bound him fast with his\r\narms, as one binds a beast with a cord. And then Bhima began for a long\r\nwhile, to whirl the senseless Kichaka, who began to roar frightfully like\r\na broken trumpet.[17] And in order to pacify Krishna's wrath Vrikodara\r\ngrasped Kichaka's throat with his arms and began to squeeze it. And\r\nassailing with his knees the waist of that worst of the Kichakas, all the\r\nlimbs of whose body had been broken into fragments and whose eye-lids\r\nwere closed, Vrikodara slew him, as one would slay a beast. And beholding\r\nKichaka entirely motionless, the son of Pandu began to roll him about on\r\nthe ground. And Bhima then said, 'Slaying this wretch who intended to\r\nviolate our wife,--this thorn in the side of Sairindhri, I am freed from\r\nthe debt I owed to my brothers, and have attained perfect peace.' And\r\nhaving said this, that foremost of men, with eyes red in wrath,\r\nrelinquished his hold of Kichaka, whose dress and ornaments had been\r\nthrown off his person, whose eyes were rolling, and whose body was yet\r\ntrembling. And that foremost of mighty persons, squeezing his own hands,\r\nand biting his lips in rage, again attacked his adversary and thrust his\r\narms and legs and neck and head into his body like the wielder of the\r\nPinaka reducing into shapeless mass the deer, which form sacrifice had\r\nassumed in order to escape his ire. And having; crushed all his limbs,\r\nand reduced him into a ball of flesh, the mighty Bhimasena showed him\r\nunto Krishna. And endued with mighty energy that hero then addressed\r\nDraupadi, that foremost of all women, saying, 'Come princess of Panchala,\r\nand see what hath become of that lustful wretch!' And saying this, Bhima\r\nof terrible prowess began to press with his feet the body of that wicked\r\nwight. And lighting a torch then and showing Draupadi the body of\r\nKichaka, that hero addressed her, saying, 'O thou of tresses ending in\r\nbeautiful curls, those that solicit thee, endued as thou art with an\r\nexcellent disposition and every virtue, will be slain by me even as this\r\nKichaka hath been, O timid one.' And having accomplished that difficult\r\ntask so highly agreeable to Krishna--having indeed slain Kichaka and\r\nthereby pacified his wrath, Bhima bade farewell to Krishna, the daughter\r\nof Drupada, and quickly went back to the kitchen. And Draupadi also, that\r\nbest of women, having caused Kichaka to be slain had her grief removed\r\nand experienced the greatest delight. And addressing the keepers of the\r\ndancing-hall, she said, 'Come ye and behold Kichaka who had violated\r\nafter other people's wives lieth down here, slain by my Gandharva\r\nhusbands.' And hearing these words the guards of the dancing hall soon\r\ncame by thousands to that spot, torches in hand. And repairing to that\r\nroom, they beheld the lifeless Kichaka thrown on the ground, drenched\r\nwith blood. And beholding him without arms and legs, they were filled\r\nwith grief. And as they gazed at Kichaka, they were struck with\r\namazement. And seeing that superhuman act, viz., the overthrow of\r\nKichaka, they said, 'Where is his neck, and where are his legs?' And\r\nbeholding him in this plight they all concluded that he had been killed\r\nby a Gandharva.'\""

And beholding Kichaka with every limb mangled, and lying like a\r\ntortoise dragged to dry ground from the water, all of them were overcome\r\nwith exceeding fright, and the bristles of their bodies stood on end. And\r\nseeing him crushed all over by Bhima, like a Danava by Indra, they\r\nproceeded to take him outside, for performing his funeral obsequies. And\r\nthen those persons of the Suta clan thus assembled together espied\r\nKrishna of faultless limbs hard by, who stood reclining on a pillar. And\r\nall the Kichakas assembled there, exclaimed, 'Let this unchaste woman be\r\nslain for whom Kichaka hath himself lost his life. Or, without slaying\r\nher here, let us cremate her with him that had lusted after her,--for it\r\nbehoveth us to accomplish in every way what is agreeable to that deceased\r\nson of Suta.' And then they addressed Virata, saying, 'It is for her sake\r\nthat Kichaka hath lost his life. Let him, therefore, be cremated along\r\nwith her. It behoveth thee to grant this permission.' Thus addressed by\r\nthem, king Virata, O monarch, knowing fully well the prowess of the Suta\r\ngave his assent to Sairindhri being burnt along with the Suta's son. And\r\nat this, the Kichakas approaching the frightened and stupefied Krishna of\r\nlotus-like eyes, seized her with violence. And binding that damsel of\r\nslender-waist and placing her upon the bier, they set out with great\r\nenergy towards the cemetary. And, O king, while thus forcibly carried\r\ntowards the cemetary by those sons of the Suta tribe, the blameless and\r\nchaste Krishna living under the protections of her lords, then wailed\r\naloud for the help of her husbands, saying, 'Oh, let Jaya, and Jayanta,\r\nand Vijaya and Jayatsena, and Jayadvala listen to my words.

Let those illustrious Gandharvas endued with speed of\r\nhand, the clatter of whose cars is loud and the twang of whose bowstrings\r\nin the midst of the mighty conflict are heard like the roar of thunder,\r\nlisten to my words,--the Sutas are taking me away!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing those sorrowful words and lamentations\r\nof Krishna, Bhima, without a moment's reflection started up from his bed\r\nand said, 'I have heard, O Sairindhri the words thou hast spoken. Thou\r\nhast, therefore, O timid lady, no more fear at the hands of the Sutas.\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the mighty-armed Bhima\r\ndesirous of slaying the Kichakas, began to swell his body. And carefully\r\nchanging his attire, he went out of the palace by a wrong egress. And\r\nclimbing over a wall by the aid of a tree, he proceeded towards the\r\ncemetary whither the Kichakas had gone. And having leapt over the wall,\r\nand gone out of the excellent city, Bhima impetuously rushed to where the\r\nSutas were. And, O monarch, proceeding towards the funeral pyre he beheld\r\na large tree, tall as palmyra-palm, with gigantic shoulders and withered\r\ntop. And that slayer of foes grasping with his arms that tree measuring\r\nten Vyamas, uprooted it, even like an elephant, and placed it upon his\r\nshoulders. And taking up that tree with trunk and branches and measuring\r\nten Vyamas, that mighty hero rushed towards the Sutas, like Yama himself,\r\nmace in hand. And by the impetus of his rush[18] banians and peepals and\r\nKinsukas falling down on the earth lay in clusters. And beholding that\r\nGandharva approach them like a lion in fury, all the Sutas trembling with\r\nfear and greatly distressed, became panic-struck. And they addressed each\r\nother, saying, 'Lo, the powerful Gandharva cometh hither, filled with\r\nrage, and with an upraised tree in hand. Let Sairindhri, therefore, from\r\nwhom this danger of ours hath arisen, be set free.' And beholding the\r\ntree that had been uprooted by Bhimasena, they set Draupadi free and ran\r\nbreathlessly towards the city And seeing them run away, Bhima, that\r\nmighty son of the Wind-god, despatched, O foremost of kings, by means of\r\nthat tree, a hundred and five of them unto the abode of Yama, like the\r\nwielder of the thunderbolt slaying the Danavas. And setting Draupadi free\r\nfrom her bonds, he then, O king, comforted her. And that mighty-armed and\r\nirrepressible Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, then addressed the distressed\r\nprincess of Panchala with face bathed in tears, saying, 'Thus, O timid\r\none, are they slain that wrong thee without cause. Return, O Krishna, to\r\nthe city.

Sairindhri also, having been set free, returneth to thy\r\npalace in the city. Alas, O king, if Sairindhri cometh, thy entire\r\nkingdom will be endangered. Sairindhri is endued with great beauty; the\r\nGandharvas also here exceedingly powerful. Men again, without doubt, are\r\nnaturally sexual. Devise, therefore, O king, without delay, such means\r\nthat in consequence of wrongs done to Sairindhri, thy kingdom may not\r\nmeet with destruction.' Hearing those words of theirs, Virata, that lord\r\nof hosts, said unto them, 'Do ye perform the last rites of the Sutas.

And filled with fear, the king then addressed his\r\nqueen Sudeshna, saying, 'When Sairindhri comes back, do thou tell her\r\nthese words from me, 'Blessed be thou, O fair-faced Sairindhri. Go thou\r\nwhithersoever thou likest.

And beholding her, the citizens,\r\nO king, afflicted with the fear of the Gandharvas fled in all directions.\r\nAnd some of them went so far as to shut their eyes. And then, O king at\r\nthe gate of the kitchen, the princess of Panchala saw Bhimasena staying,\r\nlike an infuriate elephant of gigantic proportions. And looking upon him\r\nwith wonder-expanded eyes, Draupadi, by means of words intelligible to\r\nthem alone, said, 'I bow unto that prince of the Gandharvas, who hath\r\nrescued me.' At these words of her, Bhima said, 'Hearing these words of\r\nhers in obedience to whom those persons were hitherto living in the city,\r\nthey will henceforth range here, regarding themselves as freed from the\r\ndebt.'[19]\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then she beheld the mighty-armed Dhananjaya, in\r\nthe dancing-hall instructing king Virata's daughters in dancing. And\r\nissuing with Arjuna from the dancing-hall, all those damsels came to\r\nKrishna who had arrived there, and who had been persecuted so sorely, all\r\ninnocent though she was. And they said, 'By good luck also it is, O\r\nSairindhri, that thou hast been delivered from thy dangers. By good luck\r\nit is that thou hast returned safe. And by good luck also it is that\r\nthose Sutas have been slain that had wronged thee, innocent though thou\r\nart.' Hearing this, Virhannala said, 'How hast thou, O Sairindhri, been\r\ndelivered? And how have those sinful wretches been slain? I wish to learn\r\nall this from thee exactly as it occurred.' Sairindhri replied, 'O\r\nblessed Vrihannala, always passing thy days happily in the apartments of\r\nthe girls, what concern hast thou with Sairindhri's fate to say? Thou\r\nhast no grief to bear that Sairindhri hath to bear! It is for this, that\r\nthou askest me thus, distressed as I am in ridicule.'

The\r\nwicked Kichaka, however, had been an oppressor of men and a dishonourer\r\nof other people's wives. And it was for this that wicked of sinful soul\r\nhad been slain by the Gandharvas. And it was thus, O king, that people\r\nbegan to speak, from province to province of the invincible Kichaka, that\r\nslayer of hostile ranks.\r\n\r\n'Meanwhile, the spies employed by Dhritarashtra's son, having searched\r\nvarious villages and towns and kingdoms and done all that they had been\r\ncommanded to do and completed their examination, in the manner directed,\r\nof the countries indicated in their orders, returned to Nagarupa,\r\ngratified with at least one thing that they had learnt.[20] And seeing\r\nDhritarashtra's son king Duryodhana of the Kuru race seated in his court\r\nwith Drona and Karna and Kripa, with the high-souled Bhishma, his own\r\nbrothers, and those great warriors--the Trigartas, they addressed him,\r\nsaying, 'O lord of men, great hath been the care always bestowed by us in\r\nthe search after the sons of Pandu in that mighty forest.

Searched have we\r\nalso in arbours of matted woods and plants and creepers of every species,\r\nbut we have failed in discovering that track by which Pritha's son of\r\nirrepressible energy may have gone. Searched have we in these and other\r\nplaces for their foot-prints. Searched have we closely, O king, on\r\nmountain tops and in inaccessible fastnesses, in various kingdoms and\r\nprovinces teeming with people, in encampments and cities. No trace have\r\nyet been found of the sons of Pandu. Good betide thee, O bull among men,\r\nit seems that they have perished without leaving a mark behind.

They will then return like mighty elephants\r\nwith temporal juice trickling down, or like snakes of virulent poison.\r\nFilled with wrath, they will, without doubt, be inflicters of terrible\r\nchastisement on the Kurus.

Indeed,\r\nadopt ye such means as may remove all causes of quarrel and anxiety from\r\nthe kingdom, making it tranquil and foeless and incapable of sustaining a\r\ndiminution of territory.' Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Kama said,\r\n'Let other spies, abler and more cunning, and capable of accomplishing\r\ntheir object, quickly go hence, O Bharata. Let them, well-disguised,\r\nwander through swelling kingdoms and populous provinces, prying into\r\nassemblies of the learned and delightful retreats of provinces. In the\r\ninner apartments of palaces, in shrines and holy spots, in mines and\r\ndiverse other regions, the sons of Pandu should be searched after with\r\nwell-directed eagerness. Let the sons of Pandu who are living in disguise\r\nbe searched after by well-skilled spies in large numbers, devoted to\r\ntheir work, themselves well-disguised, and all well-acquainted with the\r\nobjects of their search.

Let these and others engage in\r\nthe search from province to province according to approved rules. It is\r\nmy belief, however, that the track the Pandavas have followed or their\r\npresent abode or occupation will not be discovered. Perhaps, they are\r\nclosely concealed; perhaps, they have gone to the other side of the\r\nocean. Or, perhaps, proud as they are of their strength and Courage, they\r\nhave been devoured by wild beasts; or perhaps, having been overtaken by\r\nsome unusual danger, they have perished for eternity.

And the words that Bhishma spake were\r\nthoroughly impartial and worshipped by the wise. And the grandsire of the\r\nKurus said, 'The words that the regenerate Drona acquainted with the\r\ntruth of every affair hath uttered, are approved by me. I have no\r\nhesitation in saying so. Endued with every auspicious mark, observant of\r\nvirtuous vows, possessed of Vedic lore, devoted to religious observances,\r\nconversant with various sciences, obedient to the counsels of the aged,\r\nadhering to the vow of truth, acquainted with the proprieties of time,\r\nobservant of the pledge they have given (in respect of their exile), pure\r\nin their behaviour, ever adhering to the duties of the Kshatria order,\r\nalways obedient to Kesava, high-souled, possessed of great strength, and\r\never-bearing the burthens of the wise, those heroic ones can never wither\r\nunder misfortune. Aided by their own energy, sons of Pandu who are now\r\nleading a life of concealment in obedience to virtue, will surely never\r\nperish. It is even this that my mind surmiseth. Therefore, O Bharata, I\r\nam for employing the aid of honest counsel in our behaviour towards the\r\nsons of Pandu. It would not be the policy of any wise man to cause them\r\nto be discovered now by means of spies,[21] what we should do unto the\r\nsons of Pandu, I shall say, reflecting with the aid of the intellect.\r\nKnow that I shall say nothing from ill will to thee. People like me\r\nshould never give such counsels to him that is dishonest, for only\r\ncounsels (like those I would give) should be offered unto them that are\r\nhonest. Counsels, however, that are evil, should under no circumstances\r\nbe offered. He, O child, that is devoted to truth and obedient to the\r\naged, he, indeed, that is wise, while speaking in the midst of an\r\nassembly, should under all circumstances speak the truth, if the\r\nacquisition of virtue be an object with him. I should, therefore, say\r\nthat I think differently from all those people here, in respect of the\r\nabode of Yudhishthira the just in this the thirteenth year of his exile.\r\nThe ruler, O child, of the city or the province where king Yudhishthira\r\nresides cannot have any misfortune. Charitable and liberal and humble and\r\nmodest must the people be of the country where king Yudhishthira resides.\r\nAgreeable in speech, with passions under control, observant of truth,\r\ncheerful, healthy, pure in conduct, and skilful in work must the people\r\nbe of the country where king Yudhishthira resides. The people of the\r\nplace, where Yudhishthira is, cannot be envious or malicious, or vain, or\r\nproud, but must all adhere to their respective duties. Indeed, in the\r\nplace where Yudhishthira resides, Vedic hymns will be chanted all around,\r\nsacrifices will be performed, the last full libations will always be\r\npoured, [22] and gifts to Brahmanas will always be in profusion. There\r\nthe clouds, without doubt, pour abundant rain, and furnished with good\r\nharvest the country will ever be without fear. There the paddy will not\r\nbe without grain, fruits will not be bereft of juice, floral garlands\r\nwill not be without fragrance, and the conversation of men will always be\r\nfull of agreeable words. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the\r\nbreezes will be delicious, the meetings of men will always be friendly,\r\nand cause of fear there will be none. There kine will be plentiful,\r\nwithout any of them being lean-fleshed or weak, and milk and curds and\r\nbutter will all be savoury and nutritious. There where king Yudhishthira\r\nresides, every kind of corn will be full of nutrition and every edible\r\nfull of flavour. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the objects of\r\nall the senses, viz.,--taste, touch, smell, and hearing, will be endued\r\nwith excellent attributes. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the\r\nsights and scenes will be gladdening. And the regenerate ones of that\r\nplace will be virtuous and steady in observing their respective duties.\r\nIndeed, in the country where the sons of Pandu may have taken up their\r\nabode during this thirteenth year of their exile, the people will be\r\ncontented and cheerful, pure in conduct and without misery of any kind.\r\nDevoted to gods and guests and the worship of these with their whole\r\nsoul, they will be fond of giving away, and filled with great energy,\r\nthey will all be observant of eternal virtue. There where king\r\nYudhishthira resides, the people, eschewing all that is evil, will be\r\ndesirous of achieving only what is good. Always observant of sacrifices\r\nand pure vows, and hating untruth in speech, the people of the place\r\nwhere king Yudhishthira may reside will always be desirous of obtaining\r\nwhat is good, auspicious and beneficial. There where Yudhishthira\r\nresides, the people will certainly be desirous of achieving what is good,\r\nand their hearts will always incline towards virtue, and their vows being\r\nagreeable they themselves are ever-engaged in the acquisition of\r\nreligious merit. O child, that son of Pritha in whom are intelligence and\r\ncharity, the highest tranquillity and undoubted forgiveness, modesty and\r\nprosperity, and fame and great energy and a love for all creatures, is\r\nincapable of being found out (now that he hath concealed himself) even by\r\nBrahmanas, let alone ordinary persons. The wise Yudhishthira is living in\r\nclose disguise in regions whose characteristics I have described.\r\nRegarding his excellent mode of life, I dare not say anything more.\r\nReflecting well upon all this, do without loss of time what thou mayst\r\nthink to be beneficial, O prince of the Kuru race, if indeed, thou hast\r\nany faith in me.'\""

And then the terrible and infuriate elephants\r\nridden over by the skilful combatants of both sides were urged on with\r\nspiked clubs and hooks. And the encounter, O king, that took place when\r\nthe sun was low in the horizon, between the infantry and cavalry and\r\nchariots and elephants of both parties, was like unto that of old between\r\nthe gods and the Asuras, terrible and fierce and sufficient for making\r\none's hair stand on end and calculated to increase the population of\r\nYama's kingdom. And as the combatants rushed against one another, smiting\r\nand slashing, thick clouds of dust began to rise, so that nothing could\r\nbe discovered. And covered with the dust raised by the contending armies,\r\nbirds began to drop down on the earth. And the sun himself disappeared\r\nbehind the thick cloud of arrows shot, and the firmament looked bright as\r\nif with myriads of the fireflies. And shifting their bows, the staves of\r\nwhich were decked with gold, from one hand to another, those heroes began\r\nto strike each other down, discharging their arrows right and left. And\r\ncars encountered cars, and foot-soldiers fought with foot-soldiers, and\r\nhorse-men with horsemen, and elephants with mighty elephants. And they\r\nfuriously encountered one another with swords and axes, bearded darts and\r\njavelins, and iron clubs. And although, O king, those mighty-armed\r\nwarriors furiously assailed one another in that conflict, yet neither\r\nparty succeeded in prevailing over the other. And severed heads, some\r\nwith beautiful noses, some with upper lips deeply gashed, some decked\r\nwith ear-rings, and some divided with wounds about the well-trimmed hair\r\nwere seen rolling on the ground covered with dust. And soon the field of\r\nbattle was overspread with the limbs of Kshatriya warriors, cut off by\r\nmeans of arrows and lying like trunks of Sala trees. And scattered over\r\nwith heads decked in ear-rings, and sandal-besmeared arms looking like\r\nthe bodies of snakes, the field of battle became exceedingly beautiful.\r\nAnd as cars encountered cars, and horsemen encountered horsemen, and\r\nfoot-soldiers fought with foot-soldiers, and elephants met with\r\nelephants, the frightful dust soon became drenched with torrents of\r\nblood. And some amongst the combatants began to swoon away, and the\r\nwarriors began to fight reckless of consideration of humanity, friendship\r\nand relationship. And both their course and sight obstructed by the\r\narrowy shower, vultures began to alight on the ground. But although those\r\nstrong-armed combatants furiously fought with one another, yet the heroes\r\nof neither party succeeded in routing their antagonists. And Satanika\r\nhaving slain a full hundred of the enemy and Visalaksha full four\r\nhundred, both those mighty warriors penetrated into the heart of the\r\ngreat Trigarta host. And having entered into the thick of the Trigarta\r\nhost, those famous and mighty heroes began to deprive their antagonists\r\nof their senses by causing a closer conflict to set in--a conflict, in\r\nwhich the combatants seized one another by the hair and tore one another\r\nwith their nails.[29] And eyeing the point where the cars of the\r\nTrigartas had been mustered in strong numbers, those heroes at last\r\ndirected their attack towards it. And that foremost of car-warriors, king\r\nVirata also, with Suryadatta in his van and Madiraksha in his rear,\r\nhaving destroyed in that conflict five hundred cars, eight hundred\r\nhorses, and five warriors on great cars, displayed various skilful\r\nmanoeuvres on his car on that field of battle. And at last the king came\r\nupon the ruler of the Trigartas mounted on a golden chariot. And those\r\nhigh-souled and powerful warriors, desirous of fighting, rushed roaring\r\nagainst each like two bulls in a cow-pen. Then that bull among men,\r\nirrepressible in battle, Susarman, the king of the Trigartas, challenged\r\nMatsya to a single combat on car. Then those warriors excited to fury\r\nrushed against each other on their cars and began to shower their arrows\r\nupon each other like clouds pouring torrents of rain.[30] And enraged\r\nwith each other, those fierce warriors, both skilled in weapons, both\r\nwielding swords and darts and maces, then moved about (on the field of\r\nbattle) assailing each other with whetted arrows. Then king Virata\r\npierced Susarman with ten shafts and each of his four horses also with\r\nfive shafts. And Susarman also, irresistible in battle and conversant\r\nwith fatal weapons, pierced king of Matsya with fifty whetted shafts. And\r\nthen, O mighty monarch, in consequence of the dust on the field of\r\nbattle, the soldiers of both Susarman and Matsya's king could not\r\ndistinguish one another.'\""

And when everything became visible, the battle\r\nonce more began. And it raged on so furiously that the combatants could\r\nnot distinguish one another. And then Trigarta's lord, Susarman with his\r\nyounger brother, and accompanied by all his cars, rushed towards the king\r\nof Matsya. And descending from their cars, those bulls among Kshatriyas,\r\nthe (royal) brothers, mace in hand, rushed furiously towards the cars of\r\nthe foe. And the hostile hosts fiercely assailed each other with maces\r\nand swords and scimitars, battle-axes and bearded darts with keen edges\r\nand points of excellent temper. And king Susarman, the lord of the\r\nTrigartas having by his energy oppressed and defeated the whole army of\r\nthe Matsyas, impetuously rushed towards Virata himself endued with great\r\nenergy. And the two brothers having severally slain Virata's two steeds\r\nand his charioteer, as also those soldiers that protected his rear, took\r\nhim captive alive, when deprived of his car. Then afflicting him sorely,\r\nlike a lustful man afflicting a defenceless damsel, Susarman placed\r\nVirata on his own car, and speedily rushed out of the field. And when the\r\npowerful Virata, deprived of his car, was taken captive, the Matsyas,\r\nharrassed solely by the Trigartas, began to flee in fear in all\r\ndirections. And beholding them panic-stricken, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira,\r\naddressed that subduer of foes, the mighty-armed Bhima, saying, 'The king\r\nof the Matsyas hath been taken by the Trigartas. Do thou, O mighty-armed\r\none, rescue him, so that he may not fall under the power of the enemy. As\r\nwe have lived happily in Virata's city, having every desire of ours\r\ngratified, it behoveth thee, O Bhimasena, to discharge that debt (by\r\nliberating the king).' Thereat Bhimasena replied, 'I will liberate him, O\r\nking, at thy command. Mark the feat I achieve (today) in battling with\r\nthe foe, relying solely on the might of my arms. Do thou, O king, stay\r\naside, along with our brothers and witness my prowess today. Uprooting\r\nthis mighty tree of huge trunk looking like a mace, I will rout the\r\nenemy.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding Bhima casting his eyes on that tree\r\nlike a mad elephant, the heroic king Yudhishthira the just spake unto his\r\nbrother, saying, 'Do not, O Bhima, commit such a rash act. Let the tree\r\nstand there. Thou must not achieve such feats in a super-human manner by\r\nmeans of that tree, for if thou dost, the people, O Bharata, will\r\nrecognise thee and say, This is Bhima. Take thou, therefore, some human\r\nweapon such as a bow (and arrows), or a dart, or a sword, or a\r\nbattle-axe. And taking therefore, O Bhima, some weapon that is human,\r\nliberate thou the king without giving anybody the means of knowing thee\r\ntruly. The twins endued with great strength will defend thy wheels.\r\nFighting together, O child, liberate the king of the Matsyas!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the mighty Bhimasena endued\r\nwith great speed, quickly took up an excellent bow and impetuously shot\r\nfrom it a shower of arrows, thick as the downpour of a rain-charged\r\ncloud. And Bhima then rushed furiously towards Susarman of terrible\r\ndeeds, and assuring Virata with the words--O good king![32] said unto the\r\nlord of the Trigartas,--Stay! Stay! Seeing Bhima like unto Yama himself\r\nin his rear, saying, Stay! Stay! Do thou witness this mighty feat,--this\r\ncombat that is at hand!--the bull among warriors, Susarman, seriously\r\nconsidered (the situation), and taking up his bow turned back, along with\r\nhis brothers. Within the twinkling of an eye, Bhima destroyed those cars\r\nthat sought to oppose him. And soon again hundreds of thousands of cars\r\nand elephants and horses and horsemen and brave and fierce bowmen were\r\noverthrown by Bhima in the very sight of Virata. And the hostile infantry\r\nalso began to be slaughtered by the illustrious Bhima, mace in hand. And\r\nbeholding that terrible onslaught, Susarman, irrepressible in fight,\r\nthought within himself, 'My brother seems to have already succumbed in\r\nthe midst of his mighty host. Is my army going to be annihilated?' And\r\ndrawing his bow-string to his ear Susarman then turned back and began to\r\nshoot keen-edged shafts incessantly. And seeing the Pandavas return to\r\nthe charge on their car, the Matsya warriors of mighty host, urging on\r\ntheir steeds, shot excellent weapons for grinding the Trigarta soldiers.\r\nAnd Virata's son also, exceedingly exasperated began to perform\r\nprodigious fears of valour. And Kunti's son Yudhishthira slew a thousand\r\n(of the foe), and Bhima showed the abode of Yama unto seven thousand. And\r\nNakula sent seven hundred (to their last account) by means of his shafts.\r\nAnd powerful Sahadeva also, commanded by Yudhishthira, slew three hundred\r\nbrave warriors. And having slain such numbers, that fierce and mighty\r\nwarrior, Yudhishthira, with weapons upraised, rushed against Susarman.\r\nAnd rushing impetuously at Susarman, that foremost of car-warriors, king\r\nYudhishthira, assailed him with vollies of shafts. And Susarman also, in\r\ngreat rage, quickly pierced Yudhishthira with nine arrows, and each of\r\nhis four steeds with four arrows. Then, O king, Kunti's son Bhima of\r\nquick movements, approaching Susarman crushed his steeds. And having\r\nslain also those soldiers that protected his rear, he dragged from the\r\ncar his antagonist's charioteer to the ground. And seeing the king of\r\nTrigarta's car without a driver, the defender of his car-wheels, the\r\nfamous and brave Madiraksha speedily came to his aid. And thereat,\r\nleaping down from Susarman's car, and securing the latter's mace the\r\npowerful Virata ran in pursuit of him. And though old, he moved on the\r\nfield, mace in hand, even like a lusty youth. And beholding Susarman flee\r\nBhima addressed him, saying, 'Desist, O Prince! This flight of thine is\r\nnot proper! With this prowess of thine, how couldst thou wish to carry\r\noff the cattle by force? How also, forsaking thy follower, dost thou\r\ndroop so amidst foes? Thus addressed by Pritha's son, the mighty\r\nSusarman, that lord of countless cars saying unto Bhima, Stay!\r\nStay!--suddenly turned round and rushed at him. Then Bhima, the son of\r\nPandu, leaping down from his car, as he alone could do,[33] rushed\r\nforward with great coolness, desirous of taking Susarman's life. And\r\ndesirous of seizing Trigarta's king advancing towards him, the mighty\r\nBhimasena rushed impetuously towards him, even like a lion rushing at a\r\nsmall deer. And advancing impetuously, the mighty-armed Bhima seized\r\nSusarman by the hair, and lifting him up in wrath, dashed him down on the\r\nground. And as he lay crying in agony, the mighty-armed Bhima kicked him\r\nat the head, and placing his knee on his breast dealt him severe blows.\r\nAnd sorely afflicted with that kicking, the king of Trigartas became\r\nsenseless. And when the king of the Trigartas deprived of his car, had\r\nbeen seized thus, the whole Trigarta army stricken with panic, broke and\r\nfled in all directions, and the mighty sons of Pandu, endued with modesty\r\nand observant of vows and relying on the might of their own arms, after\r\nhaving vanquished Susarman, and rescued the kine as well as other kinds\r\nof wealth and having thus dispelled Virata's anxiety, stood together\r\nbefore that monarch. And Bhimasena then said, 'This wretch given to\r\nwicked deeds doth not deserve to escape me with life. But what can I do?\r\nThe king is so lenient!' And then taking Susarman by the neck as he was\r\nlying on the ground insensible and covered with dust, and binding him\r\nfast, Pritha's son Vrikodara placed him on his car, and went to where\r\nYudhishthira was staying in the midst of the field. And Bhima then showed\r\nSusarman unto the monarch. And beholding Susarman in that plight, that\r\ntiger among men king Yudhishthira smilingly addressed Bhima--that\r\nornament of battle,--saying, 'Let this worst of men be set free.' Thus\r\naddressed, Bhima spoke unto the mighty Susarman, saying, 'If, O wretch,\r\nthou wishest to live, listen to those words of mine. Thou must say in\r\nevery court and assembly of men,--I am a slave. On this condition only I\r\nwill grant thee thy life. Verily, this is the law about the vanquished.'\r\nThereupon his elder brother affectionately addressed Bhima, saying, 'If\r\nthou regardest us as an authority, liberate this wicked wight. He hath\r\nalready become king Virata's slave. And turning then to Susarman, he\r\nsaid, 'Thou art freed. Go thou a free man, and never act again in this\r\nway.'\""

Hearing this command uttered by the\r\nking of the Matsyas, the men, laying the mandate on their head, all\r\ndeparted with cheerful hearts.

If it is song or dance\r\nof musical instruments or such other things, I can entertain thee\r\ntherewith, but where is my skill for becoming a charioteer?'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'O Vrihannala, be thou a singer or a dancer, hold thou (for\r\nthe present), without loss of time, the reins of my excellent steeds,\r\nmounting upon my car!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Although that oppressor of foes, the son of\r\nPandu, was acquainted with everything, yet in the presence of Uttara, he\r\nbegan to make many mistakes for the sake of fun. And when he sought to\r\nput the coat of mail on his body by raising it upwards, the large-eyed\r\nmaidens, beholding it, burst out into a loud laughter. And seeing him\r\nquite ignorant of putting on armour, Uttara himself equipped Vrihannala\r\nwith a costly coat of mail. And casing his own person in an excellent\r\narmour of solar effulgence, and hoisting his standard bearing the figure\r\nof a lion, the prince caused Vrihannala to become his charioteer. And\r\nwith Vrihannala to hold his reins, the hero set out, taking with him many\r\ncostly bows and a large number of beautiful arrows. And his friend,\r\nUttara and her maidens then said unto Vrihannala, 'Do thou, O Vrihannala,\r\nbring for our dolls (when thou comest back) various kinds of good and\r\nfine cloths after vanquishing the Kurus assembled for battle of whom\r\nBhishma and Drona are foremost!' Thus addressed, Partha the son of Pandu,\r\nin a voice deep as the roar of the clouds, smilingly said unto that bevy\r\nof fair maidens. If, thus 'Uttara can vanquish those mighty warriors in\r\nbattle, I will certainly bring excellent and beautiful cloths.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the heroic Arjuna\r\nurged the steeds towards the Kuru army over which floated innumerable\r\nflags. Just, however, as they were starting elderly dames and maidens,\r\nand Brahmanas of rigid vows, beholding Uttara seated on his excellent car\r\nwith Vrihannala as charioteer and under that great banner hoisted on\r\nhigh, walked round the car to bless the hero. And the women said, 'Let\r\nthe victory that Arjuna treading like a bull had achieved of old on the\r\noccasion of burning the forest of Khandava, be thine, O Vrihannala, when\r\nthou encounterest the Kurus today with prince Uttara.'\""

Defeating the assembled Kurus who have come hither from desire of\r\nvictory, and quickly rescuing my kine from them. I will return to the\r\ncapital.' At these words of the prince, the son of Pandu urged those\r\nexcellent steeds. And endued with the speed of the wind and decked with\r\nnecklaces of gold, those steeds, urged by that lion among men, seemed to\r\nfly through the air. And they had not proceeded far when those smiters of\r\nfoes, Dhananjaya and the son of Matsya, sighted the army of the powerful\r\nKurus. And proceeding towards the cemetary, they came upon the Kurus and\r\nbeheld their army arrayed in order of battle.[40] And that large army of\r\ntheirs looked like the vast sea or a forest of innumerable trees moving\r\nthrough the sky. And then was seen, O best among the Kurus, the dust\r\nraised by that moving army which reached the sky and obstructed the sight\r\nof all creatures. And beholding that mighty host abounding in elephants,\r\nhorses and chariots, and protected by Karna and Duryodhana and Kripa and\r\nSantanu's son, and that intelligent and great bowman Drona, with his son\r\n(Aswatthaman), the son of Virata, agitated with fear and the bristles on\r\nhis body standing on their ends, thus spake unto Partha, 'I dare not\r\nfight with the Kurus. See, the bristles on my body have stood on their\r\nends. I am incapable of battling with this countless host of the Kurus,\r\nabounding in the heroic warriors, that are extremely fierce and difficult\r\nof being vanquished even by the celestials. I do not venture to penetrate\r\ninto the army of the Bharatas consisting of terrible bowmen and abounding\r\nin horses and elephants and cars and footsoldiers and banners. My mind is\r\ntoo much perturbed by the very sight of the foe on the field of battle on\r\nwhich stand Drona and Bhishma, and Kripa, and Karna, and Vivingsati, and\r\nAswatthaman and Vikarna, and Saumadatti, and Vahlika, and the heroic king\r\nDuryodhana also--that foremost of car-warriors, and many other splendid\r\nbowmen, all skilled in battle. My hairs have stood on their ends, and I\r\nam fainting with fear at the very sight of these smiters, the Kurus\r\narrayed in order of battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'And the low-minded and foolish Uttara out of\r\nfolly alone, began to bewail (his fate) in the presence of the\r\nhigh-spirited (Arjuna) disguised (as his charioteer) in these words, 'My\r\nfather hath gone out to meet the Trigartas taking with him his whole\r\narmy, leaving me in the empty city. There are no troops to assist me.\r\nAlone and a mere boy who has not undergone much exercise in arms, I am\r\nunable to encounter these innumerable warriors and all skilled in\r\nweapons. Do thou, therefore, O Vrihannala, cease to advance!'\r\n\r\n\"Vrihannala said, 'Why dost thou look so pale through fear and enhance\r\nthe joy of thy foes? As yet thou hast done nothing on the field of battle\r\nwith the enemy. It was thou that hadst ordered me, saying, Take me\r\ntowards the Kauravas. I will, therefore, take thee, thither where those\r\ninnumerable flags are. I will certainly take thee, O mighty-armed one,\r\ninto the midst of the hostile Kurus, prepared to fight as they are for\r\nthe kine like hawks for meat. I would do this, even if I regarded them to\r\nhave come hither for battling for a much higher stake such as the\r\nsovereignty of the earth. Having, at the time of setting out, talked\r\nbefore both men and women so highly of thy manliness, why wouldst thou\r\ndesist from the fight? If thou shouldst return home without recapturing\r\nthe kine, brave men and even women, when they meet together, will laugh\r\nat thee (in derision). As regards myself, I cannot return to the city\r\nwithout having rescued the kine, applauded as I have been so highly by\r\nthe Sairindhri in respect of my skill in driving cars. It is for those\r\npraises by the Sairindhri and for those words of thine also (that I have\r\ncome). Why should I not, therefore, give battle to the Kurus? (As regards\r\nthyself), be thou still.'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'Let the Kurus rob the Matsyas off all their wealth. Let\r\nmen and women, O Vrihannala, laugh at me. Let my kine perish, let the\r\ncity be a desert. Let me stand exposed before my father. Still there is\r\nno need of battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, that much affrighted prince decked\r\nin ear-ring jumped down from his car, and throwing down his bow and\r\narrows began to flee, sacrificing honour and pride. Vrihannala, however,\r\nexclaimed, 'This is not the practice of the brave, this flight of a\r\nKshatriya from the field of battle. Even death in battle is better than\r\nflight from fear.' Having said this, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, coming\r\ndown from that excellent car ran after that prince thus running away, his\r\nown long braid and pure red garments fluttering in the air. And some\r\nsoldiers, not knowing that it was Arjuna who was thus running with his\r\nbraid fluttering in the air, burst out into laughter at the sight. And\r\nbeholding him thus running, the Kurus began to argue, 'Who is this\r\nperson, thus disguised like fire concealed in ashes? He is partly a man\r\nand partly a woman. Although bearing a neuter form, he yet resembleth\r\nArjuna. His are the same head and neck, and his the same arms like unto a\r\ncouple of maces. And this one's gait also is like unto his. He can be\r\nnone else than Dhananjaya. As Indra is among the celestials, so\r\nDhananjaya is among men. Who else in this world than Dhananjaya, would\r\nalone come against us? Virata left a single son of his in the empty city.\r\nHe hath come out from childishness and not from true heroism. It is\r\nUttara who must have come out of the city, having, without doubt, made as\r\na charioteer Arjuna, the son of Pritha, now living in disguise. It seems\r\nthat he is now flying away in panic at sight of our army. And without\r\ndoubt Dhananjaya runneth after him to bring him back.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding the disguised son of Pandu, the\r\nKauravas, O Bharata, began to indulge in these surmises, but they could\r\nnot come to any definite conclusion. Meanwhile, Dhananjaya, hastily\r\npursuing the retreating Uttara, seized him by the hair within a hundred\r\nsteps. And seized by Arjuna, the son of Virata began to lament most\r\nwoefully like one in great affliction, and said, 'Listen, O good\r\nVrihannala, O thou of handsome waist. Turn thou quickly the course of the\r\ncar. He that liveth meeteth with prosperity. I will give thee a hundred\r\ncoins of pure gold and eight lapis lazuli of great brightness set with\r\ngold, and one chariot furnished with a golden flag-staff and drawn by\r\nexcellent steeds, and also ten elephants of infuriate prowess. Do thou, O\r\nVrihannala, set me free.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, that tiger among men laughingly\r\ndragged Uttara who was almost deprived of his senses and who was uttering\r\nthese words of lamentation towards the car. And the son of Pritha then\r\naddressed the affrighted prince who had nearly lost his senses, saying,\r\n'If, O chastiser of foes, thou dost not venture to fight with enemy, come\r\nthou and hold the reins of the steeds as I fight with the foe. Protected\r\nby the might of my arms, penetrate thou yon formidable and invincible\r\narray of cars guarded by heroic and mighty warriors. Fear not, O\r\nchastiser of foes, thou art a Kshatriya and the foremost of royal\r\nprincess. Why dost thou, O tiger among men, succumb in the midst of the\r\nfoe? I shall surely fight with the Kurus and recover the kine,\r\npenetrating into this formidable and inaccessible array of cars. Be thou\r\nmy charioteer, O best of men, I will fight with the Kurus.' Thus speaking\r\nunto Uttara, the son of Virata, Vibhatsu, heretofore unconquered in\r\nbattle, for a while comforted him. And then the son of Pritha, that\r\nforemost of smiters, raised on the car that fainting and reluctant prince\r\nstricken with fear!'\""

Commanded by\r\nthee, I would drive thee thither?'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'I am pleased with thee, O tiger among men. Thou hast no\r\ncause of fear. I will rout all thy foes in battle, O great warrior, And,\r\nO thou of mighty arms, be at thy ease. Accomplishing great and terrible\r\nfeats in the melee, I will fight with thy foes. Tie quickly all those\r\nquivers to my car, and take (from among those) a sword of polished blade\r\nand adorned with gold.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, Uttara cast off\r\nall inactivity. And he speedily alighted from the tree, bringing with him\r\nArjuna's weapons. Then Arjuna addressed him, saying, 'Yes, I will fight\r\nwith the Kurus and recover thy kine. Protected by me, the top of this car\r\nwill be to thee as a citadel. The passages and alleys and other divisions\r\nof this car will be the streets and edifices of that fortified city.\r\nThese my arms will be its ramparts and gateways. This treble pole and my\r\nquiver will constitute defensive works inaccessible to the foe. This my\r\nbanner--single and grand--will it not alone be equal unto those of thy\r\ncity? This my bow-string will constitute the catapults and cannons for\r\nvomiting forth missiles on the besiezing ghost. My excited wrath will\r\nmake that fortress formidable, and the clatter of my car-wheels--will it\r\nnot resemble the kettle-drums of thy capital? Ridden by myself wielding\r\nthe Gandiva, this car will be incapable of being vanquished by the\r\nhostile host, O son of Virata, let thy fear be dispelled.'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'I am no longer afraid of these. I know thy steadiness in\r\nbattle, which is even like unto that of Kesava or Indra himself. But\r\nreflecting on this, I am continually bewildered. Foolish as I am, I am\r\nincapable of arriving at certain conclusion. By what distressful\r\ncircumstances could a person of such handsome limbs and auspicious signs\r\nbecome deprived of manhood! Indeed, thou seemest to me to be Mahadeva, or\r\nIndra, or the chief of the Gandharvas, dwelling in the guise only of one\r\nof the third sex.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'I tell thee truly that I am only observing this vow for a\r\nwhole year agreeable to the behest of my elder brother. O thou of mighty\r\narms, I am not truly one of the neuter sex, but I have adopted this vow\r\nof eunuchism from subservience to another's will and from desire of\r\nreligious merit. O prince, know me now to have completed my vow.'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'Thou hast conferred a great favour on me today, for I now\r\nfind that my suspicion was not altogether unfounded. Indeed, such a\r\nperson as thou, O best of men, cannot be of the neuter sex. I have now an\r\nally in battle. I can now fight with the celestials themselves. My fears\r\nhave been dispelled. What shall I do? Command me now. Trained in driving\r\ncars by a learned preceptor I will, O bull among men, hold the reins of\r\nthy horses that are capable of breaking the ranks of hostile cars. Know\r\nme, O bull among men, to be as competent a charioteer as Daruka of\r\nVasudeva, or Matali of Sakra. The horse that is yoked unto the right-hand\r\npole (of thy car) and whose hoofs as they light on the ground are\r\nscarcely visible when running, is like unto Sugriva of Krishna. This\r\nother handsome horse, the foremost of his race, that is yoked unto the\r\nleft pole, is, I regard, equal in speed to Meghapushpa. This (third)\r\nbeautiful horse, clad in golden mail, yoked unto the rear-pole on the\r\nleft, is, I regard, Sivya equal in speed to but superior in strength. And\r\nthis (fourth) horse, yoked to the rear-pole on the right, is regarded as\r\nsuperior to Valahaka in speed and strength. This car is worthy of bearing\r\non the field of battle a bowman like thee, and thou also art worthy of\r\nfighting on this car. This is what I think!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Arjuna, endued with great energy, took off\r\nthe bracelets from his arms and wore on his hands a pair of beautiful\r\ngloves embroidered with gold. And he then tied his black and curling\r\nlocks with a piece of white cloth. And seated on that excellent car with\r\nface turned to the east, the mighty-armed hero, purifying his body and\r\nconcentrating his soul, recalled to his mind all his weapons. And all the\r\nweapons came, and addressing the royal son of Partha, said, 'We are here,\r\nO illustrious one. We are thy servants, O son of Indra.' And bowing unto\r\nthem, Partha received them unto his hands and replied unto them, saying,\r\n'Dwell ye all in my memory.' And obtaining all his weapons, the hero\r\nlooked cheerful. And quickly stringing his bow, the Gandiva, he twanged\r\nit. And the twang of that bow was as loud as the collision of two mighty\r\nbulls. And dreadful was the sound that filled the earth, and violent was\r\nthe wind that blew on all sides. And thick was the shower of fallen\r\nmeteors [50] and all sides were enveloped in gloom. And the birds began\r\nto totter in the skies and large trees began to shake. [51] And loud as\r\nthe burst of the thunder, the Kurus knew from that sound that it was\r\nArjuna that drew with his hands the string of his best of bows from his\r\ncar. And Uttara said, 'Thou, O best of Pandavas, art alone. These mighty\r\ncar-warriors are many. How wilt thou vanquish in battle all these that\r\nare skilled in every kind of weapon? Thou, O son of Kunti, art without a\r\nfollower, while the Kauravas have many. It is for this, O thou of mighty\r\narms, that I stay beside thee, stricken with fear.' Bursting out into\r\nloud laughter, Partha said unto him, 'Be not afraid, O hero, what\r\nfriendly follower had I while fighting with the mighty Gandharvas on the\r\noccasion of the Ghoshayatra? Who was my ally while engaged in the\r\nterrific conflict at Khandava against so many celestials and Danavas? Who\r\nwas my ally when I fought, on behalf of the lord of the celestials\r\nagainst the mighty Nivatakavachas and the Paulomas! And who was my ally,\r\nO child, while I encountered in battle innumerable kings at the\r\nSwayamvara to the princess of Panchala? Trained in arms by the preceptor\r\nDrona, by Sakra, and Vaisravana, and Yama, and Varuna, and Agni, and\r\nKripa, and Krishna of Madhu's race, and by the wielder of the Pinaka\r\n(Siva), why shall I not fight with these? Drive thou my car speedily, and\r\nlet thy heart's fever be dispelled.'\""

And he hoisted on that car his own golden\r\nbanner bearing the figure of an ape with a lion's tail, which was a\r\ncelestial illusion contrived by Viswakarman himself. For, as soon,\r\nindeed, as he had thought of that gift of Agni, than the latter, knowing\r\nhis wish, ordered those superhuman creatures (that usually sat there) to\r\ntake their place in that banner. And furnished with a beautiful flag of\r\nhandsome make, with quivers attached to it, and adored with gold, that\r\nexcellent flag-staff of celestial beauty than quickly fell from the\r\nfirmament on his car. [52] And beholding that banner arrived on his car,\r\nthe hero circumambulated it (respectively). And then the ape-bannered\r\nVibhatsu, the son of Kunti, called also Swetavahana, with fingers cased\r\nin leathern fences of the Iguana skin, and taking up his bow and arrows\r\nset out in a northernly direction. And that grinder of foes, possessed of\r\ngreat strength, then forcibly blew his large conch-shell, of thundering\r\nsound, capable of making the bristles of foes to stand on their ends. And\r\nat the sound of that conch, those steeds endued with swiftness dropped\r\ndown on the ground on their knees. And Uttara also, greatly affrighted,\r\nsat down on the car. And thereupon the son of Kunti took the reins\r\nhimself and raising the steeds, placed them in their proper positions.\r\nAnd embracing Uttara, he encouraged him also, saying, 'Fear not, O\r\nforemost of princes, thou art, O chastiser of foes, a Kshatriya by birth.\r\nWhy, O tiger among men, dost thou become so dispirited in the midst of\r\nfoes? Thou must have heard before the blare of many conchs and the note\r\nof many trumpets, and the roar also of many elephants in the midst of\r\nranks arrayed for battled. Why art thou, therefore, so dispirited and\r\nagitated and terrified by the blare of this conch, as if thou wert an\r\nordinary person?'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'Heard have I the blare of many a conch and many a trumpet\r\nand the roar of many an elephant stationed in the battle-array, but never\r\nhave I heard before the blare of such conch. Nor have I ever seen a\r\nbanner like this. Never before have I heard also the twang of a bow such\r\nas this. Truly, sir, with the blare of this conch, the twang of this bow,\r\nthe superhuman cries of the creatures stationed on this banner, and the\r\nbattle of this car, my mind is greatly bewildered. My perception of the\r\ndirections also is confused, and my heart is painfully afflicted. The\r\nwhole firmament seemeth to me to have been covered by this banner, and\r\neverything seemeth to be hidden from my view! My ears also have been\r\ndeafened by the twang of the Gandiva![53]\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Firmly stand thou on the car, pressing thy feet on it, and\r\ntightly catch hold of the bridles, for I will blow the conch again.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Arjuna then blew his conch again, that conch which\r\nfilled foes with grief and enhanced the joy of friends. And the sound was\r\nso loud that it seemed to split hills and mountains, and pierce\r\nmountain-caves and the cardinal points. And Uttara once again sat down on\r\nthe car, clinging to it in fear. And with the blare of the conch and the\r\nrattle of the car-wheels, and the twang of the Gandiva, the earth itself\r\nseemed to tremble. And beholding Uttara's fight, Dhananjaya began to\r\ncomfort him again.'\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Drona said, 'From the rattle of the car, and from the manner\r\nin which the clouds have enveloped the sky and the earth itself trembles,\r\nthis warrior can be none else than Savyasachin. Our weapons do not shine,\r\nour steeds are dispirited, and our fires, though fed with fuel, do not\r\nblare up. All this is ominous. All our animals are setting up a frightful\r\nhowl, gazing towards the sun. The crows are perching on our banners. All\r\nthis is ominous. Yon vultures and kites on our right portend a great\r\ndanger. That jackal also, running through our ranks, waileth dismally.\r\nLo, it hath escaped unstruck. All this portends a heavy calamity. The\r\nbristles also of ye all are on their ends. Surely, this forebodes a great\r\ndestruction of Kshatriyas in battle. Things endued with light are all\r\npale; beasts and birds look fierce; and there are to be witnessed many\r\nterrific portents indicative of the destruction of Kshatriyas. And these\r\nomens forebode great havoc among ourselves. O king, thy ranks seem to be\r\nconfounded by these blazing meteors, and thy animals look dispirited and\r\nseem to be weeping. Vultures and kites are wheeling all around thy\r\ntroops. Thou shalt have to repent upon beholding thy army afflicted by\r\nPartha's arrows. Indeed, our ranks seem to have been already vanquished,\r\nfor none is eager to go to fight. All our warriors are of pale face, and\r\nalmost deprived of their senses. Sending the kine ahead we should stand\r\nhere, ready to strike, with all our warriors arrayed in order of battle.\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'King Duryodhana then, on the field of battle said\r\nunto Bhishma, and unto Drona--that tiger among warriors, and unto\r\nKripa--that mighty car-warrior, these words, 'Both myself and Kama had\r\nsaid this unto the preceptors[54] I refer to the subject again, for I am\r\nnot satisfied with having said it once. Even this was the pledge of the\r\nsons of Pandu that if defeated (at dice) they would reside to our\r\nknowledge in countries and woods for twelve years, and one more year\r\nunknown to us. That thirteenth year, instead of being over, is yet\r\nrunning. Vibhatsu, therefore, who is still to live undiscovered hath\r\nappeared before us. And if Vibhatsu hath come before the term of exile is\r\nat end, the Pandavas shall have to pass another twelve years in the\r\nwoods. Whether it is due to forgetfulness (on their part) induced by\r\ndesire of dominion, or whether it is a mistake of ours, it behoveth\r\nBhishma to calculate the shortness or excess (of the promised period).\r\nWhen an object of desire may or may not be attained, a doubt necessarily\r\nattaches to one of the alternatives, and what is decided in one way often\r\nends differently. [55] Even moralists are puzzled in judging of their own\r\nacts. [56] As regards ourselves, we have come hither to fight with the\r\nMatsyas and to seize their kine stationed towards the north. If,\r\nmeanwhile, it is Arjuna that hath come, what fault can attach to us? We\r\nhave come hither to fight against the Matsyas on behalf of the Trigartas;\r\nand as numerous were the acts represented unto us of the oppressions\r\ncommitted by the Matsyas. it was for this that we promised aid to the\r\nTrigartas who were overcome with fear. And it was agreed between us that\r\nthey should first seize, on the afternoon of the seventh lunar day, the\r\nenormous wealth of kine that the Matsyas have, and that we should, at\r\nsunrise of the eighteen day of the moon, seize these kine when the king\r\nof the Matsyas would be pursuing those first seized. It may be that the\r\nTrigartas are now bringing a way the kine, or being defeated, are coming\r\ntowards us for negotiating with the king of the Matsyas. Or, it may be,\r\nthat having driven the Trigartas off, the king of the Matsyas, at the\r\nhead of this people and his whole army of fierce warriors, appeareth on\r\nthe scene and advanceth to make night-attacks upon us. It may be that\r\nsome one leader among them, endued with mighty energy, is advancing for\r\nvanquishing us, or, it may be that the king himself of the Matsyas is\r\ncome. But be it the king of the Matsyas or Vibhatsu, we must all fight\r\nhim. Even this hath been our pledge. Why are all these of foremost\r\ncar-warriors,--Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Vikarna and Drona's\r\nson,--now sitting on their cars, panic-stricken? At present there is\r\nnothing better than fighting. Therefore, make up your minds. If, for the\r\ncattle we have seized, an encounter takes place with the divine wielder\r\nhimself of the thunderbolt or even with Yama, who is there that will be\r\nliable to reach Hastinapura? Pierced by the shafts (of the foe), how will\r\nthe foot-soldiers, in flying through the deep forest with their backs on\r\nthe field, escape with life, when escape for the cavalry is doubtful?\r\nHearing these words of Duryodhana, Karna said, 'Disregarding the\r\npreceptor, make all arrangements. He knoweth well the intentions of the\r\nPandavas and striketh terror in our hearts. I see that his affection for\r\nArjuna is very great. Seeing him only coming, he chanteth his praises.\r\nMake ye such arrangements that our troops may not break. Everything is in\r\nconfusion for Drona's having only heard the neigh of (Arjuna's) steeds.\r\nMake ye such arrangements that these troops, come to a distant land in\r\nthis hot season and in the midst of this mighty forest, may not fall into\r\nconfusion and be subjugated by the foe. The Pandavas are always the\r\nspecial favourites of the preceptor. The selfish Pandavas have stationed\r\nDrona amongst us. Indeed, he betrayeth himself by his speech. Who would\r\never extol a person upon hearing the neigh only of his steeds? Horses\r\nalways neigh, whether walking or standing, the winds blow at all times;\r\nand Indra also always showereth rain. The roar of the clouds may\r\nfrequently be heard. What hath Partha to do with these, and why is he to\r\nbe praised for these? All this (on Drona's part), therefore, is due only\r\nto either the desire of doing good to Arjuna or to his wrath and hatred\r\ntowards us. Preceptors are wise, and sinless, and very kind to all\r\ncreatures. They, however, should never be consulted at times of peril. It\r\nis in luxurious palaces, and assemblies and pleasure-gardens, that\r\nlearned men, capable of making speeches, seem to be in their place.\r\nPerforming many wonderful things, in the assembly, it is there that\r\nlearned men find their place, or even there where sacrificial utensils\r\nand their proper placing and washing are needed. In a knowledge of the\r\nlapses of others, in studying the characters of men, in the science of\r\nhorses and elephants and cars, in treating the diseases of asses and\r\ncamels and goats and sheeps and kine, in planning buildings and gateways,\r\nand in pointing out the defects of food and drink, the learned are truly\r\nin their own sphere. Disregarding learned men that extol the heroism of\r\nthe foe, make ye such arrangements that the foe may be destroyed. Placing\r\nthe kine securely, array the troops in order of battle. Place guards in\r\nproper places so that we may fight the foe.'\""

Shot from my bow these straight and flying\r\narrows, like gliding snakes, are all sure of aim. Discharged by my light\r\nhands, these keen-edged arrows furnished with golden wings shall cover\r\nPartha all over, like locusts shrouding a tree. Strongly pressed by these\r\nwinged arrows, the bow-string will cause these my leathern fences to\r\nproduce sounds that will be heard to resemble those of a couple of\r\nkettle-drums. Having been engaged in ascetic austerities for the (last)\r\neight and five years, Vibhatsu will strike me but mildly in this\r\nconflict, and the son of Kunti having become a Brahmana endued with good\r\nqualities, hath thus become a fit person to quietly receive shafts by\r\nthousands shot by me. This mighty bowman is indeed, celebrated over the\r\nthree worlds. I, too, am, by no means, inferior to Arjuna, that foremost\r\nof human beings. With golden arrows furnished with vulturine wings shot\r\non all sides, let the firmament seem today to swarm with fire-flies.\r\nSlaying Arjuna in battle, I will discharge today that debt, difficult of\r\nrepayments, but promised of old by me unto Dhritarashtra's son. When man\r\nis there, even amongst all the gods and the Asuras, that will endure to\r\nstand in the teeth of the straight arrows shot from my bow? Let my flying\r\narrows, winged and depressed at the middle, present the spectacle of the\r\ncoursing of the fire-flies through the welkin. Hard though he be as\r\nIndra's thunderbolt and possessed of the energy of the chief of the\r\ncelestials, I will surely grind Partha, even as one afflicts an elephant\r\nby means of burning brands. A heroic and mighty car-warrior as he is, and\r\nthe foremost of all wielders of weapons I shall seize the unresisting\r\nPartha, even like Garuda seizing a snake. Irresistible like fire, and fed\r\nby the fuel of swords, darts, and arrows, the blazing Pandava-fire that\r\nconsumeth foes, will be extinguished even by myself who am like unto a\r\nmighty cloud incessantly dropping an arrowy shower,--the multitude of\r\ncars (I will lead) constituting its thunder, and the speed of my horses,\r\nthe wind in advance. Discharged from my bow, my arrows like venomous\r\nsnakes will pierce Partha's body, like serpent penetrating through an\r\nant-hill. Pierced with well-tempered and straight shafts endued with\r\ngolden wings and great energy, behold ye today the son of Kunti decked\r\nlike a hill covered with Karnikara flowers. Having obtained weapons from\r\nthat best of ascetics--the son of Jamadagni, I would, relying on their\r\nenergy, fight with even the celestials. Struck with my javelin, the ape\r\nstationed on his banner-top shall fall down today on the ground, uttering\r\nterrible cries. The firmament will today be filled with the cries of the\r\n(super-human) creatures stationed in the flagstaff of the foe, and\r\nafflicted by me, they will fly away in all directions. I shall today\r\npluck up by the roots the long-existing dart in Duryodhan's heart by\r\nthrowing Arjuna down from his car.

There are various kinds of expedients\r\ninferrable from the scriptures. Of these, a battle hath been regarded by\r\nthose acquainted with the past, as the most sinful. It is only when time\r\nand place are favourable that military operations can lead to success. In\r\nthe present instance, however, the time being unfavourable, no good\r\nresults will be deprived. A display of prowess in proper time and place\r\nbecometh beneficial. It is by the favourableness or otherwise (of time\r\nand place) that the opportuneness of an act is determined. Learned men\r\ncan never act according to the ideas of a car-maker. Considering all\r\nthis, an encounter with Partha is not advisible for us. Alone he saved\r\nthe Kurus (from the Gandharvas), and alone he satiated Agni. Alone he led\r\nthe life of a Brahmacharin for five years (on the breast of Himavat).\r\nTaking up Subhadra on his car, alone he challenged Krishna to single\r\ncombat. Alone he fought with Rudra who stood before him as a forester. It\r\nwas in this very forest that Partha rescued Krishna while she was being\r\ntaken away (by Jayadratha). It is he alone that hath, for five years,\r\nstudied the science of weapons under Indra. Alone vanquishing all foes he\r\nhath spread the fame of the Kurus. Alone that chastiser of foes\r\nvanquished in battle Chitrasena, the king of the Gandharvas and in a\r\nmoment his invincible troops also. Alone he overthrew in battle the\r\nfierce Nivatakavachas and the Kalakhanchas, that were both incapable of\r\nbeing slain by the gods themselves. What, however, O Kama, hath been\r\nachieved by thee single-handed like any of the sons of Pandu, each of\r\nwhom had alone subjugated many lords of earth? Even Indra himself is\r\nunfit to encounter Partha in battle. He, therefore, that desireth to\r\nfight with Arjuna should take a sedative. As to thyself, thou desirest to\r\ntake out the fangs of an angry snake of virulent poison by stretching\r\nforth thy right hand and extending thy forefinger. Or, wandering alone in\r\nthe forest thou desirest to ride an infuriate elephant and go to a boar\r\nwithout a hook in hand. Or, rubbed over with clarified butter and dressed\r\nin silken robes, thou desirest to pass through the midst of a blazing\r\nfire fed with fat and tallow and clarified butter. Who is there that\r\nwould, binding his own hands and feet and tying a huge stone unto his\r\nneck, cross the ocean swimming with his bare arms? What manliness is\r\nthere in such an act? O Kama, he is a fool that would, without, skill in\r\nweapons and without strength, desire to fight with Partha who is so\r\nmighty and skilled in weapons? Dishonestly deceived by us and liberated\r\nfrom thirteen years' exile, will not the illustrious hero annihilate us?\r\nHaving ignorantly come to a place where Partha lay concealed like fire\r\nhidden in a well, we have, indeed, exposed to a great danger. But\r\nirresistible though he be in battle, we should fight against him. Let,\r\ntherefore, our troops, clad in mail, stand here arrayed in ranks and\r\nready to strike. Let Drona and Duryodhana and Bhishma and thyself and\r\nDrona's son and ourselves, all fight with the son of Pritha. Do not O\r\nKama, act so rashly as to fight alone. If we six car-warriors be united,\r\nwe can then be a match for and fight with that son of Pritha who is\r\nresolved to fight and who is as fierce as the wielder of the thunderbolt.\r\nAided by our troops arrayed in ranks, ourselves--great bowmen--standing\r\ncarefully will fight with Arjuna even as the Danavas encounter Vasava in\r\nbattle.'\""

Why dost thou, therefore, boast of thyself?\r\nHaving won numerous battles, and acquired enormous wealth, and vanquished\r\nhostile hosts, men of true heroism speak not a word of their prowess.\r\nFire burneth mutely and mutely doth the sun shine. Mutely also doth the\r\nEarth bear creatures, both mobile and immobile. The Self-existent hath\r\nsanctioned such offices for the four orders that having recourse to them\r\neach may acquire wealth without being censurable. A Brahmana, having\r\nstudied the Vedas, should perform sacrifices himself, and officiate at\r\nthe sacrifices of others. And a Kshatriya, depending upon the bow, should\r\nperform sacrifices himself but should never officiate at the sacrifices\r\nof others. And of Vaisya, having earned wealth, should cause the rites\r\nenjoined in the Vedas to be performed for himself. A Sudra should always\r\nwait upon and serve the other three orders. As regards those that live by\r\npractising the profession of flowers and vendors of meat, they may earn\r\nwealth by expedients fraught with deceit and fraud. Always acting\r\naccording to the dictates of the scriptures, the exalted sons of Pandu\r\nacquired the sovereignty of the whole earth, and they always act\r\nrespectfully towards their superiors, even if the latter prove hostile to\r\nthem. What Kshatriya is there that expressed delight at having obtained a\r\nkingdom by means of dice, like this wicked and shameless son of\r\nDhritarashtra?

In what battle didst thou defeat\r\nYudhishthira, or Bhima that foremost of strong men? In what battle was\r\nIndraprastha conquered by thee? What thou hast done, however, O thou of\r\nwicked deeds, is to drag that princess to court while she was ill and had\r\nbut one raiment on? Thou hast cut the mighty root, delicate as the\r\nsandal, of the Pandava tree. Actuated by desire of wealth, when thou\r\nmadest the Pandavas act as slaves, rememberest thou what Vidura said! We\r\nsee that men and others, even insects and ants, show forgiveness\r\naccording to their power of endurance. The son of Pandu, however, is\r\nincapable of forgiving the sufferings of Draupadi. Surely, Dhananjaya\r\ncometh here for the destruction of the sons of Dhritarashtra. It is true,\r\naffecting great wisdom, thou art for making speeches but will not\r\nVibhatsu, that slayer of foes, exterminate us all! If it be gods, or\r\nGandharvas or Asuras, or Rakshasas, will Dhananjaya the son of Kunti,\r\ndesist to fight from panic? Inflamed with wrath upon whomsoever he will\r\nfall, even him he will overthrow like a tree under the weight of Garuda!\r\nSuperior to thee in prowess, in bowmanship equal unto the lord himself of\r\nthe celestials, and in battle equal unto Vasudeva himself, who is there\r\nthat would not praise Partha? Counteracting celestial weapons with\r\ncelestial, and human weapons with human, what man is a match for Arjuna?\r\nThose acquainted with the scriptures declare that a disciple is no way\r\ninferior to a son, and it is for this that the son of Pandu is a\r\nfavourite of Drona. Employ thou the means now which thou hadst adopted in\r\nthe match at dice,--the same means, viz., by which thou hadst subjugated\r\nIndraprastha, and the same means by which thou hadst dragged Krishna to\r\nthe assembly! This thy wise uncle, fully conversant with the duties of\r\nthe Kshatriya order--this deceitful gambler Sakuni, the prince of\r\nGandhara, let him fight now! The Gandiva, however, doth not cast dice\r\nsuch as the Krita or the Dwapara, but it shooteth upon foes blazing and\r\nkeen-edged shafts by myriads. The fierce arrows shot from the Gandiva,\r\nendued with great energy and furnished with vulturine wings, car, pierce\r\neven mountains. The destroyer of all, named Yama, and Vayu, and the\r\nhorse-faced Agni, leave some remnant behind, but Dhananjaya inflamed with\r\nwrath never doth so. As thou hadst, aided by thy uncle, played a dice in\r\nthe assembly so do fight in this battle protected by Suvala's son. Let\r\nthe preceptor, if he chooses fight; I shall not, however, fight with\r\nDhananjaya. We are to fight with the king of the Matsyas, if indeed, he\r\ncometh in the track of the kine.'\""

As for Kama, it is only out of regard for the duties of the\r\nKshatriya order that he desireth to fight. No man of wisdom can blame the\r\npreceptor. I, however, am of opinion that fight we must, considering both\r\nthe time and the place. Why should not that man be bewildered who hath\r\nfive adversaries effulgent as five suns, who are heroic combatants and\r\nwho have just emerged from adversity? Even those conversant with morality\r\nare bewildered in respect of their own interests. It is for this, O king,\r\nthat I tell thee this, whether my words be acceptable to you or not. What\r\nKarna said unto thee was only for raising our (drooping) courage. As\r\nregards thyself, O preceptor's son, forgive everything. The business at\r\nhand is very grave. When the son of Kunti hath come, this is not the time\r\nfor quarrel. Everything should now be forgiven by thyself and the\r\npreceptor Kripa. Like light in the sun, the mastery of all weapons doth\r\nreside in you. As beauty is never separated from Chandramas, so are the\r\nVedas and the Brahma weapon both established in you. It is often seen\r\nthat the four Vedas dwell in one object and Kshatriya attributes in\r\nanother. We have never heard of these two dwelling together in any other\r\nperson than the preceptor of the Bharata race and his son. Even this is\r\nwhat I think. In the Vedantas, in the Puranas, and in old histories, who\r\nsave Jamadagni, O king, would be Drona's superior? A combination of the\r\nBrahma weapon with the Vedas,--this is never to be seen anywhere else. O\r\npreceptor's son, do thou forgive. This is not the time for disunion. Let\r\nall of us, uniting, fight with Indra's son who hath come. Of all the\r\ncalamities that may befall an army that have been enumerated by men of\r\nwisdom, the worst is disunion among the leaders. Aswatthaman said, 'O\r\nbull among men, these thy just observations, need not be uttered in our\r\npresence; the preceptor, however, filled with wrath, had spoken of\r\nArjuna's virtues. The virtues of even an enemy should be admitted, while\r\nthe faults of even one's preceptor may be pointed out; therefore one\r\nshould, to the best of his power, declare the merits of a son or a\r\ndisciple.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'Let the preceptor grant his forgiveness and let peace\r\nbe restored. If the preceptor be at one with us, whatever should be done\r\n(in view of the present emergency) would seem to have been already done.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O Bharata, Duryodhana assisted by Kama\r\nand Kripa, and the high-souled Bhishma pacified Drona.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'Appeased I have already been at the words first spoken by\r\nBhishma, the son of Santanu. Let such arrangements be made that Partha\r\nmay not be able to approach Duryodhana in battle. And let such\r\narrangements be made that king Duryodhana may not be captured by the foe,\r\nin consequence either of his rashness or want of judgment. Arjuna hath\r\nnot, to be sure, revealed himself before the expiry of the term of exile.\r\nNor will he pardon this act (of ours) today, having only recovered the\r\nkine. Let such arrangements, therefore, be made that he may not succeed\r\nin attacking Dhritarashtra's son and defeating our troops. Like myself\r\n(who am doubtful of the completion of period of exile) Duryodhana also\r\nhad said so before. Bearing it in mind, it behoveth the son of Ganga to\r\nsay what is true.'\""

In consequence of their\r\nfractional excesses and the deviations of also of the heavenly bodies,\r\nthere is an increase of two months in every five years. It seems to me\r\nthat calculating this wise, there would be an excess of five months and\r\ntwelve nights in thirteen years. Everything, therefore, that the sons of\r\nPandu had promised, hath been exactly fulfilled by them. Knowing this to\r\nbe certain, Vibhatsu hath made his appearance. All of them are\r\nhigh-souled and fully conversant with the meanings of the scriptures. How\r\nwould they deviate from virtue that have Yudhishthira for their guide?\r\nThe sons of Kunti do not yield to temptation. They have achieved a\r\ndifficult feat. If they had coveted the possession of their kingdom by\r\nunfair means, then those descendants of the Kuru race would have sought\r\nto display their prowess at the time of the match at dice. Bound in bonds\r\nof virtue, they did not deviate from the duties of the Kshatriya order.\r\nHe that will regard them to have behaved falsely will surely meet with\r\ndefeat. The sons of Pritha would prefer death to falsehood. When the\r\ntime, however, comes, those bulls among men--the Pandava's--endued with\r\nenergy like that of Sikra, would not give up what is theirs even if it is\r\ndefended by the wielder himself of the thunderbolt. We shall have to\r\noppose in battle the foremost of all wielders of weapons. Therefore, let\r\nsuch advantageous arrangements as have the sanction of the good and the\r\nhonest be now made without loss of time so that our possessions may not\r\nbe appropriated by the foe. O king of kings, O Kaurava, I have never seen\r\na battle in which one of the parties could say,--we are sure to win. When\r\na battle occurs, there must be victory or defeat, prosperity or\r\nadversity. Without doubt, a party to a battle must have either of the\r\ntwo. Therefore, O king of kings, whether a battle be now proper or not\r\nconsistent with virtue or not, make thy arrangements soon, for Dhananjaya\r\nis at hand.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'I will not, O grandsire, give back the Pandavas their\r\nkingdom. Let every preparation, therefore, for battle be made without\r\ndelay.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'Listen to what I regard as proper, if it pleases thee. I\r\nshould always say what is for thy good, O Kaurava. Proceed thou towards\r\nthe capital, without loss of time, taking with thee a fourth part of the\r\narmy. And let another fourth march, escorting the kine. With half the\r\ntroops we will fight the Pandava. Myself and Drona, and Karna and\r\nAswatthaman and Kripa will resolutely withstand Vibhatsu, or the king of\r\nthe Matsyas, or Indra himself, if he approaches. Indeed, we will\r\nwithstand any of these like the bank withstanding the surging sea.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'These words spoken by the high-souled Bhishma\r\nwere acceptable to them, and the king of the Kauravas acted accordingly\r\nwithout delay. And having sent away the king and then the kine, Bhishma\r\nbegan to array the soldiers in order of battle. And addressing the\r\npreceptor, he said, 'O preceptor, stand thou in the centre, and let\r\nAswatthaman stand on the left, and let the wise Kripa, son of Saradwata,\r\ndefend the right wing, and let Karna of the Suta caste, clad in mail,\r\nstand in the van.

And the Kurus beheld his banner-top\r\nand heard the rattle and din of his car as also the twang of the Gandiva\r\nstretched repeatedly by him. And noting all this, and seeing that great\r\ncar-warrior--the wielder of the Gandiva--come, Drona spoke thus, 'That is\r\nthe banner-top of Partha which shineth at a distance, and this is the\r\nnoise of his car, and that is the ape that roareth frightfully. Indeed,\r\nthe ape striketh terror in the troops. And there stationed on that\r\nexcellent car, the foremost of car-warriors draweth that best of bows,\r\nthe Gandiva, whose twang is as loud as the thunder. Behold, these two\r\nshafts coming together fall at my feet, and two others pass off barely\r\ntouching my ears. Completing the period of exile and having achieved many\r\nwonderful feats, Partha saluteth me and whispereth in my ears.

I suspect that anxious to save his life, he retreateth by the\r\nsouthern road, taking away with him the kine. Leaving this array of\r\ncar-warriors, proceed to the spot where Suyodhana is. There will I fight,\r\nO son of Virata, for there the battle will not be fruitless, Defeating\r\nhim I will come back, taking away the kine.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Virata restrained\r\nthe steeds with an effort and turned them by a pull at the bridle from\r\nthe spot where those bulls of the Kuru race were, and urged them on\r\ntowards the place where Duryodhana was. And as Arjuna went away leaving\r\nthat thick array of cars, Kripa, guessing his intention, addressed his\r\nown comrades, saying, 'This Vibhatsu desireth not to take up his stand at\r\na spot remote from the king. Let us quickly fall upon the flanks of the\r\nadvancing hero. When inflamed with wrath, none else, unassisted, can\r\nencounter him in battle save the deity of a thousand eyes, or Krishna the\r\nson of Devaki. Of what use to us would the kine be or this vast wealth\r\nalso, if Duryodhana were to sink, like a boat, in the ocean of Partha?'\r\nMeanwhile, Vibhatsu, having proceeded towards that division of the army,\r\nannounced himself speedily by name, and covered the troops with his\r\narrows thick as locusts. And covered with those countless shafts shot by\r\nPartha, the hostile warriors could not see anything, the earth itself and\r\nthe sky becoming overwhelmed therewith. And the soldiers who had been\r\nready for the fight were so confounded that none could even the flee from\r\nthe field. And beholding the light-handedness of Partha they all\r\napplauded it mentally. And Arjuna then blew his conch which always made\r\nthe bristles of the foe stand erect. And twanging his best of bows, he\r\nurged the creatures on his flagstaff to roar more frightfully. And at the\r\nblare of his conch and the rattle of his car-wheels, and the twang of the\r\nGandiva, and the roar of the superhuman creatures stationed on his\r\nflagstaff, the earth itself began to tremble.

And beholding the kine running wild\r\ntowards the city of the Matsyas, the foremost warriors of the Kurus\r\nregarded Kiritin to have already achieved success. And all of a sudden\r\nthey fell upon Arjuna who was advancing towards Duryodhana. And beholding\r\ntheir countless divisions firmly arrayed in order of battle with\r\ncountless banners waving over them, that slayer of foes, addressing the\r\nson of the king of the Matsyas, said, 'Urge on, to the best of their\r\nspeed by this road, these white steeds decked with golden bridles. Strive\r\nthou well, for I would approach this crowd of Kuru lions. Like an\r\nelephant desiring an encounter with another, the Suta's son of wicked\r\nsoul eagerly desireth a battle with me. Take me, O prince, to him who\r\nhath grown so proud under the patronage of Duryodhana. Thus addressed,\r\nthe son of Virata by means of those large steeds endued with the speed of\r\nthe wind and furnished with golden armour, broke that array of cars and\r\ntook the Pandava into the midst of the battle-field. And seeing this\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, Chitrasena and Sangramajit and Satrusaha and\r\nJaya, desirous of aiding Karna, rushed with arrows and long shafts,\r\ntowards the advancing hero of Bharata's race. Then that foremost of men,\r\ninflamed with wrath, began to consume by means of fiery arrows shot from\r\nhis bow, that array of cars belonging to those bulls among the Kurus,\r\nlike a tremendous conflagration consuming a forest. Then, when the battle\r\nbegan to rage furiously, the Kuru hero, Vikarna, mounted on his car,\r\napproached that foremost of car-warriors, Partha, the younger brother of\r\nBhima,--showering upon him terrible shafts thick and long. Then cutting\r\nVikarna's bow furnished with a tough string and horns overlaid with gold,\r\nArjuna cut off his flagstaff. And Vikarna, beholding his flagstaff cut\r\noff, speedily took to flight. And after Vikarna's flight, Satruntapa,\r\nunable to repress his ire, began to afflict Partha, that obstructer of\r\nfoes and achiever of super-human feats, by means of a perfect shower of\r\narrows. And drowned, as it were, in the midst of the Kuru-array, Arjuna,\r\npierced by that mighty car-warrior,--king Satruntapa--pierced the latter\r\nin return with five and then slew his car-driver with ten shafts, and\r\npierced by that bull of the Bharata race with an arrow capable of\r\ncleaving the thickest coat of mail, Satruntapa fell dead on the field of\r\nbattle, like a tree from a mountain-top torn up by the wind. And those\r\nbrave bulls among men, mangled in battle by that braver bull among men,\r\nbegan to waver and tremble like mighty forests shaken by the violence of\r\nthe wind that blows at the time of the universal dissolution. And struck\r\nin battle by Partha, the son of Vasava, those well-dressed heroes among\r\nmen--those givers of wealth endued with the energy of Vasava--defeated\r\nand deprived of life, began to measure their lengths on the ground, like\r\nfull-grown Himalayan elephants clad in mails of black steel decked with\r\ngold. And like unto a raging fire consuming a forest at the close of\r\nsummer, that foremost of men, wielding the Gandiva, ranged the field in\r\nall directions, slaying his foes in battle thus. And as the wind rangeth\r\nat will, scattering masses of clouds and fallen leaves in the season of\r\nspring, so did that foremost of car-warriors--Kiritin--ranged in that\r\nbattle, scattering all his foes before him. And soon slaying the red\r\nsteeds yoked unto the car of Sangramajit, the brother of Vikatana's son,\r\nthat hero decked in diadem and endued with great vigour then cut off his\r\nantagonist's head by a crescent-shaped arrow. And when his brother was\r\nslain, Vikartana's son of the Suta caste, mustering all his prowess,\r\nrushed at Arjuna, like a huge elephant with out-stretched tusks, or like\r\na tiger at a mighty bull. And the son of Vikarna quickly pierced the son\r\nof Pandu with twelve shafts and all his steeds also in every part of\r\ntheir bodies and Virata's son too in his hand. And rushing impetuously\r\nagainst Vikarna's son who was suddenly advancing against him, Kiritin\r\nattacked him fiercely like Garuda of variegated plumage swooping down\r\nupon a snake. And both of them were foremost of bowmen, and both were\r\nendued with great strength, and both were capable of slaying foes. And\r\nseeing that an encounter was imminent between them, the Kauravas, anxious\r\nto witness it, stood aloof as lookers on. And beholding the offender\r\nKarna, the son of Pandu, excited to fury, and glad also at having him,\r\nsoon made him, his horses, his car, and car-driver invisible by means of\r\na frightful shower of countless arrows. And the warriors of the Bharatas\r\nheaded by Bhishma, with their horses, elephants, and cars, pierced by\r\nKiritin and rendered invisible by means of his shafts, their ranks also\r\nscattered and broken, began to wail aloud in grief. The illustrious and\r\nheroic Karna, however counteracting with numberless arrows of his own\r\nthose shafts by Arjuna's hand, soon burst forth in view with bow and\r\narrows like a blazing fire. And then there arose the sound of loud\r\nclapping of hands, with the blare of conchs and trumpets and kettle-drums\r\nmade by the Kurus while they applauded Vikartana's son who filled the\r\natmosphere with the sound of his bow-string flapping against his fence.\r\nAnd beholding Kiritin filling the air with the twang of Gandiva, and the\r\nupraised tail of the monkey that constituted his flag and that terrible\r\ncreature yelling furiously from the top of his flagstaff, Karna sent\r\nforth a loud roar. And afflicting by means of his shafts, Vikartana's son\r\nalong with his steeds, car and car-driver, Kiritin impetuously poured an\r\narrowy shower on him, casting his eyes on the grandsire and Drona and\r\nKripa. And Vikartana's son also poured upon Partha a heavy shower of\r\narrows like a rain-charged cloud. And the diadem-decked Arjuna also\r\ncovered Karna with a thick down-pour of keen-edged shafts. And the two\r\nheroes stationed on their cars, creating clouds of keen-edged arrows in a\r\ncombat carried on by means of countless shafts and weapons, appeared to\r\nthe spectators like the sun and the moon covered by clouds, and the\r\nlight-handed Karna, unable to bear the sight of the foe, pierced the four\r\nhorses of the diadem-decked hero with whetted arrows, and then struck his\r\ncar-driver with three shafts, and his flagstaff also with three. Thus\r\nstruck, that grinder of all adversaries in battle, that bull of the Kuru\r\nrace, Jishnu wielding the Gandiva, like a lion awaked from slumber,\r\nfuriously attacked Kama by means of straight-going arrows. And afflicted\r\nby the arrowy shower (of Karna), that illustrious achiever of super-human\r\ndeeds soon displayed a thick shower of arrows in return. And he covered\r\nKarna's car with countless shafts like the sun covering the different\r\nworlds with rays. And like a lion attacked by an elephant, Arjuna, taking\r\nsome keen crescent-shaped arrows from out of his quiver and drawing his\r\nbow to his ear, pierced the Suta's son on every part of his body. And\r\nthat grinder of foes pierced Karna's arms and thighs and head and\r\nforehead and neck and other principal parts of his body with whetted\r\nshafts endued with the impetuosity of the thunderbolt and shot from the\r\nGandiva in battle. And mangled and afflicted by the arrows shot by Partha\r\nthe son of Pandu, Vikartana's son, quitted the van of battle, and quickly\r\ntook to flight, like one elephant vanquished by another.'\""

And like the shore withstanding\r\nthe fury of the surging sea, that warrior withstood the rage of that\r\ncountless host rushing towards him, arrayed in order of battle and\r\nshowering clouds of arrows. And that foremost of car-warriors, Kunti's\r\nson Vibhatsu of white steeds, rushed towards the foe, discharging\r\ncelestial weapons all the while. Partha soon covered all the points of\r\nthe horizon with countless arrows shot from the Gandiva, like the sun\r\ncovering the whole earth with his rays. And amongst those that fought on\r\ncars and horses and elephants, and amongst the mail-clad foot-soldiers,\r\nthere was none that had on his body a space of even two finger's breadth\r\nunwounded with sharp arrows. And for his dexterity in applying celestial\r\nweapons, and for the training of the steeds and the skill of Uttara, and\r\nfor the coursing of his weapons, and his prowess and light-handedness,\r\npeople began to regard Arjuna as the fire that blazeth forth during the\r\ntime of the universal dissolution for consuming all created things. And\r\nnone amongst the foe could cast his eyes on Arjuna who shone like a\r\nblazing fire of great effulgence. And mangled by the arrows of Arjuna,\r\nthe hostile ranks looked like newly-risen clouds on the breast of a hill\r\nreflecting the solar rays, or like groves of Asoka trees resplendent with\r\nclusters of flowers. Indeed, afflicted by the arrows of Partha, the\r\nsoldiers looked like these, or like a beautiful garland whose flowers\r\ngradually wither and drop away: And the all-pervading wind bore on its\r\nwings in the sky the torn flags and umbrellas of the hostile host. And\r\naffrighted at the havoc amongst their own ranks, the steeds fled in all\r\ndirections, freed from their yokes by means of Partha's arrows and\r\ndragging after them broken portions of cars and elephants, struck on\r\ntheir ears and ribs and tusks and nether lips and other delicate parts of\r\nthe body, began to drop down on the battle-field. And the earth, bestrewn\r\nin a short time with the corpses of elephants belonging to the Kauravas,\r\nlooked like the sky overcast with masses of black clouds. And as that\r\nfire of blazing flames at the end of the yuga consumeth all perishable\r\nthings of the world, both mobile and immobile, so did Partha, O king,\r\nconsumeth all foes in battle. And by the energy of his weapons and the\r\ntwang of his bow, and the preter-natural yells of the creatures stationed\r\non his flagstaff, and the terrible roar of the monkey, and by the blast\r\nof his conch, that mighty grinder of foes, Vibhatsu, struck terror into\r\nthe hearts of all the troops of Duryodhana. And the strength of every\r\nhostile warrior seemed, as it were, to be levelled to the dust at the\r\nvery sight of Arjuna. And unwilling to commit the daring act of sin of\r\nslaying them that were defenceless, Arjuna suddenly fell back and\r\nattacked the army from behind by means of clouds of keen-edged arrows\r\nproceeding towards their aims like hawks let off by fowlers. And he soon\r\ncovered the entire welkin with clusters of blood-drinking arrows. And as\r\nthe (infinite) rays of the powerful sun, entering a small vessel, are\r\ncontracted within it for want of space, so the countless shafts of Arjuna\r\ncould not find space for their expansion even within the vast welkin.\r\nFoes were able to behold Arjuna's car, when near, only once, for\r\nimmediately after, they were with their horses, sent to the other world.\r\nAnd as his arrows unobstructed by the bodies of foes always passed\r\nthrough them, so his car, unimpeded by hostile ranks, always passed\r\nthrough the latter. And, indeed, he began to toss about and agitate the\r\nhostile troops with great violence like the thousand-headed Vasuki\r\nsporting in the great ocean. And as Kiritin incessantly shot his shafts,\r\nthe noise of the bow-string, transcending every sound, was so loud that\r\nthe like of it had never been heard before by created beings. And the\r\nelephants crowding the field, their bodies pierced with (blazing) arrows\r\nwith small intervals between looked like black clouds coruscated with\r\nsolar rays. And ranging in all directions and shooting (arrows) right and\r\nleft, Arjuna's bow was always to be seen drawn to a perfect circle. And\r\nthe arrows of the wielder of the Gandiva never fell upon anything except\r\nthe aim, even as the eye never dwelleth on anything that is not\r\nbeautiful. And as the track of a herd of elephants marching through the\r\nforest is made of itself, so was the track was made of itself for the car\r\nof Kiritin. And struck and mangled by Partha, the hostile warriors\r\nthought that,--Verily, Indra himself, desirous of Partha's victory,\r\naccompanied by all the immortals is slaying us! And they also regarded\r\nVijaya, who was making a terrible slaughter around, to be none else than\r\nDeath himself who having assumed the form of Arjuna, was slaying all\r\ncreatures. And the troops of the Kurus, struck by Partha, were so mangled\r\nand shattered that the scene looked like the achievement of Partha\r\nhimself and could be compared with nothing else save what was observable\r\nin Partha's combats. And he severed the heads of foes, even as reapers\r\ncut off the tops of deciduous herbs. And the Kurus all lost their energy\r\nowing to the terror begot of Arjuna. And tossed and mangled by the\r\nArjuna-gale, the forest of Arjuna's foes reddened the earth with purple\r\nsecretions. And the dust mixed with blood, uplifted by the wind, made the\r\nvery rays of the sun redder still. And soon the sun-decked sky became so\r\nred that it looked very much like the evening. Indeed, the sun ceaseth to\r\nshed his rays as soon as he sets, but the son of Pandu ceased not to\r\nshoot his shafts. And that hero of inconceivable energy overwhelmed, by\r\nmeans of all celestial weapons, all the great bowmen of the enemy,\r\nalthough they were possessed of great prowess. And Arjuna then shot three\r\nand seventy arrows of sharp points at Drona, and ten at Dussaha and eight\r\nat Drona's son, and twelve at Dussasana, and three at Kripa, the son of\r\nSaradwat. And that slayer of foes pierced Bhishma, the son of Santanu,\r\nwith arrows, and king Duryodhana with a hundred. And, lastly, he pierced\r\nKarna in the ear with a bearded shaft. And when that great bowmen Karna,\r\nskilled in all weapons, was thus pierced, and his horses and car and\r\ncar-driver were all destroyed, the troops that supported him began to\r\nbreak. And beholding those soldiers break and give way the son of Virata\r\ndesirous of knowing Partha's purpose, addressed him on the field of\r\nbattle, and said, 'O Partha, standing on this beautiful car, with myself\r\nas charioteer, towards which division shall I go? For, commanded by thee,\r\nI would soon take thee thither.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna replied, 'O Uttara, yonder auspicious warrior whom thou seest\r\ncased in coat of tiger-skin and stationed on his car furnished with a\r\nblue-flag and drawn by red steeds, is Kripa. There is to be seen the van\r\nof Kripa's division. Take me thither. I shall show that great bowman my\r\nswift-handedness in archery. And that warrior whose flag beareth the\r\ndevice of an elegant water-pot worked in gold, is the preceptor\r\nDrona--that foremost of all wielders of weapons. He is always an object\r\nof regard with me, as also with all bearers of arms. Do thou, therefore,\r\ncircumambulate that great hero cheerfully. Let us bend our heads there,\r\nfor that is the eternal virtue. If Drona strikes my body first, then I\r\nshall strike him, for then he will not be able to resent it. There, close\r\nto Drona, that warrior whose flag beareth the device of a bow, is the\r\npreceptor's son, the great car-warrior Aswatthaman, who is always an\r\nobject of regard with me as also with every bearer of arms. Do thou,\r\ntherefore, stop again and again, while thou comest by his car. There,\r\nthat warrior who stayeth on his car, cased in golden mail and surrounded\r\nby a third part of the army consisting of the most efficient troops, and\r\nwhose flag beareth the device of an elephant in a ground of gold, is the\r\nillustrious king Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra. O hero, take\r\nbefore him this thy car that is capable of grinding hostile cars. This\r\nking is difficult of being vanquished in battle and is capable of\r\ngrinding all foes. He is regarded as the first of all Drona's disciples\r\nin lightness of hand. I shall, in battle, show him my superior swiftness\r\nin archery. There, that warrior whose flag beareth the device of a stout\r\nchord for binding elephants, is Karna, the son of Vikartana, already\r\nknown to thee. When thou comest before that wicked son of Radha, be thou\r\nvery careful, for he always challengeth me to an encounter. And that\r\nwarrior whose flag is blue and beareth the device of five stars with a\r\nsun (in the centre), and who endued with great energy stayeth on his car\r\nholding a huge bow in hand and wearing excellent fences, and over whose\r\nhead is an umbrella of pure white, who standeth at the head of a\r\nmultitudinous array of cars with various flags and banners like the sun\r\nin advance of masses of black clouds, and whose mail of gold looks bright\r\nas the sun or the moon, and who with his helmet of gold striketh terror\r\ninto my heart, is Bhishma, the son of Santanu and the grandsire of us\r\nall. Entertained with regal splendour by Duryodhana, he is very partial\r\nand well-affected towards that prince. Let him be approached last of all,\r\nfor he may, even now, be an obstacle to me. While fighting with me, do\r\nthou carefully guide the steeds. Thus addressed by him, Virata's son, O\r\nking, guided Savyasachin's car with great alacrity towards the spot where\r\nKripa stood anxious to fight.'\""

And there were also elephants of\r\nterrible mien, looking resplendent in beautiful armour, ridden by skilled\r\ncombatants and urged on with iron crows and hooks. And, O king, mounted\r\non a beautiful car, Sakra came there accompanied by the celestials,--the\r\nViswas and Maruts.

And making them adopt, one after another, every\r\nkind of the swifter paces, he urged those fiery steeds resembling the\r\nmoon in colour. And versed in horse-lore, Uttara, having approached the\r\nKuru host, turned back those steeds endued with the speed of the wind.\r\nAnd skilled in guiding vehicles, the prince of Matsya, sometimes wheeling\r\nabout, and sometimes proceeding in circular mazes, and sometimes turning\r\nto the left, began to be wilder the Kurus. And wheeling round, the\r\nintrepid and mighty son of Virata at last approached the car of Kripa,\r\nand stood confronting him. Then announcing his own name, Arjuna\r\npowerfully blew that best of conchs called Devadatta, of loud blare. And\r\nblown on the field of battle by the mighty Jishnu, the blare of that\r\nconch was heard like the splitting of a mountain. And seeing that the\r\nconch did not break into a hundred fragments when blown by Arjuna, the\r\nKurus with all their warriors began to applaud it highly. And having\r\nreached the very heavens, that sound coming back was heard even like the\r\ncrash of the thunderbolt hurled by Maghavat on the mountain breast.\r\nThereupon that heroic and intrepid and mighty car-warrior, Saradwat's son\r\nKripa, endued with strength and prowess, waxing wroth at Arjuna, and\r\nunable to bear that sound and eager for fight, took up his own\r\nsea-begotten conch and blew it vehemently. And filling the three worlds\r\nwith that sound, that foremost of car-warriors took up a large bow and\r\ntwanged the bow-string powerfully. And those mighty car-warriors, equal\r\nunto two suns, standing opposed to each other, shone like two masses of\r\nautumnal clouds. Then Saradwat's son quickly pierced Partha, that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, with ten swift and whetted arrows capable of entering\r\ninto the very vitals. And Pritha's son also, on his part, drawing that\r\nforemost of weapons, the Gandiva, celebrated over the world, shot\r\ninnumerable iron-arrows, all capable of penetrating into the very core of\r\nthe body. Thereupon Kripa, by means of whetted shafts, cut into hundreds\r\nand thousands of fragments, those blood-drinking arrows of Partha before\r\nthey could come up. Then that mighty car-warrior, Partha also, in wrath\r\ndisplaying various manoeuvres, covered all sides with a shower of arrows.\r\nAnd covering the entire welkin with his shafts, that mighty warrior of\r\nimmeasurable soul, the son of Pritha, enveloped Kripa with hundred of\r\nshafts. And sorely afflicted by those whetted arrows resembling flames of\r\nfire, Kripa waxed wroth and quickly afflicting the high-souled Partha of\r\nimmeasurable prowess with ten thousand shafts, set up on the field of\r\nbattle a loud roar. Then the heroic Arjuna quickly pierced the four\r\nsteeds of his adversary with four fatal arrows shot from the Gandiva,\r\nsharp and straight, and furnished with golden wings. And pierced by means\r\nof those whetted arrows resembling flames of fire those steeds suddenly\r\nreared themselves, and in consequence Kripa reeled off his place. And\r\nseeing Gautama thrown off his place, the slayer of hostile heroes, the\r\ndescendant of the Kuru race, out of regard for his opponent's dignity,\r\nceased to discharge his shafts at him. Then regaining his proper place,\r\nGautama quickly pierced Savyasachin with ten arrows furnished with\r\nfeathers of the Kanka bird. Then with a crescent-shaped arrow of keen\r\nedge, Partha cut off Kripa's bow and leathern fences. And soon Partha cut\r\noff Kripa's coat of mail also by means of arrows capable of penetrating\r\nthe very vitals, but he did not wound his person. And divested of his\r\ncoat of mail, his body resembled that of a serpent which hath in season\r\ncast off its slough. And as soon as his bow had been cut off by Partha,\r\nGautama took up another and stringed it in a trice. And strange to say,\r\nthat bow of him was also cut off by Kunti's son, by means of straight\r\nshafts. And in this way that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Pandu,\r\ncut off other bows as soon as they were taken up, one after another, by\r\nSaradwat's son. And when all his bows were thus cut off, that mighty hero\r\nhurled, from his car, at Pandu's son, a javelin like unto the blazing\r\nthunderbolt. Thereupon, as the gold-decked javelin came whizzing through\r\nthe air with the flash of a meteor, Arjuna cut it off by means of ten\r\narrows. And beholding his dart thus cut off by the intelligent Arjuna,\r\nKripa quickly took up another bow and almost simultaneously shot a number\r\nof crescent-shaped arrows. Partha, however, quickly cut them into\r\nfragments by means of ten keen-edged shafts, and endued with great\r\nenergy, the son of Pritha then, inflamed with wrath on the field of\r\nbattle, discharged three and ten arrows whetted on stone and resembling\r\nflames of fire. And with one of these he cut off the yoke of his\r\nadversary's car, and with four pierced his four steeds, and with the\r\nsixth he severed the head of his antagonist's car-driver from off his\r\nbody. And with three that mighty car-warrior pierced, in that encounter,\r\nthe triple bamboo-pole of Kripa's car and with two, its wheels. And with\r\nthe twelfth arrow he cut off Kripa's flagstaff. And with the thirteenth\r\nFalguni, who was like Indra himself as if smiling in derision, pierced\r\nKripa in the breast. Then with his bow cut off, his car broken, his\r\nsteeds slain, his car-driver killed, Kripa leapt down and taking up a\r\nmace quickly hurled it at Arjuna. But that heavy and polished mace hurled\r\nby Kripa was sent back along its course, struck by means of Arjuna's\r\narrows. And then the warriors (of Kripa's division), desirous of rescuing\r\nwrathful son of Saradwat encountered Partha from all sides and covered\r\nhim with their arrows. Then the son of Virata, turning the steed to the\r\nleft began to perform circuitous evolution called Yamaka and thus\r\nwithstood all those warriors. And those illustrious bulls among men,\r\ntaking Kripa with them who had been deprived of his car, led him away\r\nfrom the vicinity of Dhananiaya, the son of Kunti.'\""

And beholding at no\r\ngreat distance from him the preceptor advancing on his golden car, Arjuna\r\nthat foremost of victorious warriors, addressing Uttara, said, 'Blessed\r\nbe thou, O friend, carry me before that warrior on whose high banner-top\r\nis seen a golden altar resembling a long flame of fire and decked with\r\nnumerous flags placed around, and whose car is drawn by steeds that are\r\nred and large, exceedingly handsome and highly-trained, of face pleasant\r\nand of quiet mien, and like unto corals in colour and with faces of\r\ncoppery hue, for that warrior is Drona with whom I desire to fight. Of\r\nlong arms and endued with mighty energy possessed of strength and beauty\r\nof person, celebrated over all the worlds for his prowess, resembling\r\nUsanas himself in intelligence and Vrihaspati in knowledge of morality,\r\nhe is conversant with the four Vedas and devoted to the practice of\r\nBrahmacharya virtues. O friend, the use of the celestial weapons together\r\nwith the mysteries of their withdrawal and the entire-science of weapons,\r\nalways reside in him. Forgiveness, self-control, truth, abstention from\r\ninjury, rectitude of conduct,--these and countless other virtues always\r\ndwell in that regenerate one. I desire to fight with that highly-blessed\r\none on the field. Therefore, take me before the preceptor and carry me\r\nthither, O Uttara.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Arjuna, Virata's son urged\r\nhis steeds decked with gold towards the car of Bharadwaja's son. And\r\nDrona also rushed towards the impetuously advancing Partha, the son of\r\nPandu,--that foremost of car-warriors,--like an infuriate elephant\r\nrushing towards an infuriate compeer. And the son of Bharadwaja then blew\r\nhis conch whose blare resembled that of a hundred trumpets. And at that\r\nsound the whole army become agitated like the sea in a tempest. And\r\nbeholding those excellent steeds red in hue mingling in battle with\r\nArjuna's steeds of swan-like whiteness endued with the speed of the mind,\r\nall the spectators were filled with wonder. And seeing on the field of\r\nbattle those car-warriors--the preceptor Drona and his disciple\r\nPartha--both endued with prowess, both invincible, both well-trained,\r\nboth possessed of great energy and great strength, engaged with each\r\nother, that mighty host of the Bharatas began to tremble frequently. And\r\nthat mighty car-warrior Partha, possessed of great prowess and filled\r\nwith joy upon reaching Drona's car on his own, saluted the preceptor. And\r\nthat slayer of hostile heroes, the mighty armed son of Kunti, then\r\naddressed Drona in an humble and sweet tone, saying, 'Having completed\r\nour exile in the woods, we are now desirous of avenging our wrongs. Even\r\ninvincible in battle, it doth not behove thee to be angry with us. O\r\nsinless one, I will not strike thee unless thou strikest me first. Even\r\nthis is my intention. It behoveth thee to act as thou choosest.' Thus\r\naddressed Drona discharged at him more than twenty arrows. But the\r\nlight-handed Partha cut them off before they could reach him. And at\r\nthis, the mighty Drona, displaying his lightness of hand in the use of\r\nweapons, covered Partha's car with a thousand arrows. And desirous of\r\nangering, Partha, that hero of immeasurable soul, then covered his steeds\r\nof silvery whiteness with arrows whetted on stone and winged with the\r\nfeathers of the Kanka bird. And when the battle between Drona and Kiritin\r\nthus commenced, both of them discharging in the encounter arrows of\r\nblazing splendour, both well-known for their achievements, both equal to\r\nthe wind itself in speed, both conversant with celestial weapons, and\r\nboth endued with mighty energy, began shooting clouds of arrows to\r\nbewilder the royal Kshatriyas. And all the warriors that were assembled\r\nthere were filled with wonder at sight of all this. And they all admired\r\nDrona who quickly shot clouds of arrows exclaiming,--Well done! Well\r\ndone! Indeed, who else save Falguna, is worthy of fighting with Drona in\r\nbattle? Surely the duties of a Kshatriya are stern, for Arjuna fighteth\r\nwith even his own preceptor!--And it was thus that they who stood on the\r\nfield of battle said unto one another. And inflamed with fire, those\r\nmighty-armed heroes standing before other, and each incapable of\r\novercoming the other, covered each other with arrowy showers. And\r\nBharadwaja's son, waxing worth, drew his large and unconquerable bow\r\nplated on the back with gold, and pierced Falguna with his arrows. And\r\ndischarging at Arjuna's car innumerable whetted arrows possessed of solar\r\neffulgence, he entirely shrouded the light of the sun. And that great\r\ncar-warrior of mighty arms, violently pierced Pritha's son with\r\nkeen-edged shafts even as the clouds shower upon a mountain. Then taking\r\nup that foremost of bows, the Gandiva, destructive of foes and capable of\r\nwithstanding the greatest strain, the impetuous son of Pandu cheerfully\r\ndischarged countless shafts of various kinds adorned with gold, and that\r\npowerful warrior also baffled in a moment Drona's arrowy shower by means\r\nof those shafts shot from his own bow. And at this the spectators\r\nwondered greatly. And the handsome Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, ranging\r\non his car, displayed his weapons on all sides at the same time. And the\r\nentire welkin covered with his arrows, became one wide expanse of shade.\r\nAnd at this Drona become invisible like the sun enveloped in mist. And\r\nshrouded by those excellent arrows on all sides, Drona looked like a\r\nmountain on fire. And beholding his own car completely enveloped by the\r\narrows of Pritha's son, Drona that ornament of battle, bent his terrible\r\nand foremost of bows whose noise was as loud as that of the clouds. And\r\ndrawing that first of weapons, which was like unto a circle of fire, he\r\ndischarged a cloud of keen-edged shafts. And then there were heard on the\r\nfield loud sounds like the splitting of bamboos set on fire. And that\r\nwarrior of immeasurable soul, shooting from his bow arrows furnished with\r\ngolden wings, covered all sides, shrouding the very light of the sun. And\r\nthose arrows with knots well-peeled off, and furnished with golden wings,\r\nlooked like flocks of birds in the sky. And the arrows discharged by\r\nDrona from his bow, touching one another at the wings, appeared like one\r\nendless line in the sky. And those heroes, thus discharging their arrows\r\ndecked with gold, seemed to cover the sky with showers of meteors. And\r\nfurnished with feathers of the Kanka bird, those arrows looked like rows\r\nof cranes ranging in the autumnal sky. And the fierce and terrible\r\nencounter that took place between the illustrious Drona and Arjuna\r\nresembled that between Virata and Vasava of old. And discharging arrows\r\nat each other from bows drawn at their fullest stretch, they resembled\r\ntwo elephants assailing each other with their tusks. And those wrathful\r\nwarriors--those ornaments of battle--fighting strictly according to\r\nestablished usage, displayed in that conflict various celestial weapons\r\nin due order. Then that foremost of victorious men, Arjuna, by means of\r\nhis keen shafts resisted the whetted arrows shot by that best of\r\npreceptors. And displaying before the spectators various weapons, that\r\nhero of terrible prowess covered the sky with various kinds of arrows.\r\nAnd beholding that tiger among men, Arjuna, endued with fierce energy and\r\nintent upon striking him, that foremost of warriors and best of\r\npreceptors (from affection) began to fight with him playfully by means of\r\nsmooth and straight arrows. And Bharadwaja's son fought on with Falguna,\r\nresisting with his own the celestial weapons shot by the former. And the\r\nfight that took place between those enraged lions among men, incapable of\r\nbearing each other, was like unto encounter between the gods and the\r\nDanavas. And the son of Pandu repeatedly baffled with his own, the\r\nAindra, the Vayavya, and the Agneya weapons that were shot by Drona. And\r\ndischarging keen shafts, those mighty bowmen, by their arrowy showers\r\ncompletely covered the sky and made a wide expanse of shade. And then the\r\narrows shot by Arjuna, falling on the bodies of hostile warriors,\r\nproduced the crash of thunderbolt. O king, elephants, cars, and horses,\r\nbathed in blood, looked like Kinsuka trees crowned with flowers. And in\r\nthat encounter between Drona and Arjuna, beholding the field covered with\r\narms decked with bangles, and gorgeously-attired car-warriors, and coats\r\nof mail variegated with gold, and with banners lying scattered all about,\r\nand with warriors slain by means of Partha's arrows, the Kuru host became\r\npanic-stricken. And shaking their bows capable of bearing much strain,\r\nthose combatants began to shroud and weaken each other with their shafts.\r\nAnd, O bull of the Bharata race, the encounter that took place between\r\nDrona and Kunti's son was dreadful in the extreme and resembled that\r\nbetween Vali and Vasava. And staking their very lives, they began to\r\npierce each other straight arrows shot from their fully-stretched\r\nbow-strings. And a voice was heard in the sky applauding Drona, and\r\nsaying, 'Difficult is the feat performed by Drona, inasmuch as he\r\nfighteth with Arjuna,--that grinder of foes, that warrior endued with\r\nmighty energy, of firm grasp, and invincible in battle,--that conqueror\r\nof both celestials and Daityas, that foremost of all car-warriors.' And\r\nbeholding Partha's infallibility, training, fleetness of hand, and the\r\nrange also of Arjuna's, arrows, Drona became amazed. And, O bull of the\r\nBharata race, lifting up his excellent bow, the Gandiva the unforbearing\r\nPartha drew it now with one hand and now with another shot an arrowy\r\nshower. And beholding that shower resembling a flight of locusts, the\r\nspectators wondering applauded him exclaiming, 'Excellent'! 'Excellent'!\r\nAnd so ceaselessly did he shoot his arrows that the very air was unable\r\nto penetrate the thick array. And the spectators could not perceive any\r\ninterval between the taking up of the arrows and letting them off. And in\r\nthat fierce encounter characterised by lightness of hand in the discharge\r\nof weapons, Partha began to shoot his arrows more quickly than before.\r\nAnd then all at once hundreds and thousands of straight arrows fell upon\r\nDrona's car. And, O bull of the Bharata race, beholding Drona completely\r\ncovered by the wielder of the Gandiva with his arrows, the Kuru army set\r\nup exclamation of 'Oh'! and 'Alas'! And Maghavat, together with those\r\nGandharvas and Apsaras that have come there, applauded the fleetness of\r\nPartha's hand. And that mighty car-warrior, the preceptor's son, then\r\nresisted the Pandva with a mighty array of cars. And although enraged\r\nwith Arjuna, yet Aswatthaman mentally admired that feat of the\r\nhigh-souled son of Pritha. And waxing wroth, he rushed towards Partha,\r\nand discharged at him an arrowy shower like a heavy down-pour by the\r\ncloud. And turning his steeds towards Drona's son, Partha gave Drona an\r\nopportunity to leave the field. And thereupon the latter, wounded in that\r\nterrible encounter, and his mail and banner gone sped away by the aid of\r\nswift horses.'\""

And terrible was the encounter\r\nbetween them, like that between the gods and the Danavas. And they shot\r\narrows at each other like Virata and Vasava. And the welkin being\r\nenveloped on all sides with arrows, the sun was completely hidden, and\r\nthe air itself was hushed. And, O conqueror of hostile cities, as they\r\nassailed and struck each other, loud sounds arose as of bamboos on fire.\r\nAnd, O king, Aswatthaman's horses being sorely afflicted by Arjuna, they\r\nbecame bewildered and could not ascertain which way to go. And as\r\nPritha's son ranged on the field, the powerful son of Drona finding an\r\nopportunity, cut off the string of the Gandiva with an arrow furnished\r\nwith a horse-shoe head And beholding that extraordinary feat of his, the\r\ncelestials applauded him highly. And exclaiming--'Well done'!---'Well\r\ndone'! Drona and Bhishma, and Karna, and the mighty warrior Kripa, all\r\napplauded that feat of his greatly. And the son of Drona, drawing his\r\nexcellent bow, pierced with his shafts, furnished with the feathers of\r\nthe Kanka bird, the breast of Partha, that bull among warriors.\r\nThereupon, with a loud laughter, the mighty-armed son of Pritha attached\r\na strong and fresh string to Gandiva. And moistening his bow-string with\r\nthe sweat that stood on his forehead resembling the crescent moon,\r\nPritha's son advanced towards his adversary, even as an infuriated leader\r\nof a herd of elephants rusheth at another elephant. And the encounter\r\nthat took place between those two matchless heroes on the field of battle\r\nwas exceedingly fierce and made the bristles of the spectators stand on\r\ntheir ends. And as those heroes endued with mighty energy fought on, the\r\ntwo mighty elephants, the Kurus beheld them with wonder. And those brave\r\nbulls among men assailed each other with arrows of snaky forms and\r\nresembling blazing fires. And as the couple of quivers belonging to the\r\nPandava was inexhaustible, that hero was able to remain on the field\r\nimmovable as a mountain. And as Aswatthaman's arrows, in consequence of\r\nhis ceaseless discharge in that conflict, were quickly exhausted, it was\r\nfor this that Arjuna prevailed over his adversary. Then Karna, drawing\r\nhis large bow with great force twanged the bow-string. And thereupon\r\narose loud exclamation of 'Oh'! and 'Alas'! And Pritha's son, casting his\r\neyes towards the spot where that bow was twanged, beheld before him the\r\nson of Radha. And at that sight his wrath was greatly excited. And\r\ninflamed with ire and desirous of slaying Karna, that bull of the Kuru\r\nrace stared at him with rolling eyes. And, O king, beholding Partha turn\r\naway from Aswatthaman's side, the Kuru warriors discharged thousands of\r\narrows on Arjuna. And the mighty-armed Dhananjaya, that conqueror of\r\nfoes, leaving Drona's son, all on a sudden rushed towards Karna. And\r\nrushing towards Karna, with eyes reddened in anger the son of Kunti,\r\ndesirous of a single combat with him, said these words.\""

Today, O Karna, contending with me in terrible\r\nconflict, thou shalt know thy own strength, and shalt no longer disregard\r\nothers. Abandoning good breeding, thou hadst uttered many harsh words,\r\nbut this that thou endeavourest to do, is, I think, exceedingly\r\ndifficult. Do thou now, O Radha's son, contending with me in the sight of\r\nthe Kurus, make good what thou hadst said before in disregard of myself.\r\nThou who hadst witnessed Panchala's princess outraged by villains in the\r\nmidst of the court, do thou now reap the fruit of that act of thine.\r\nFettered by the bonds of morality before, I desisted from vengeance then.\r\nBehold now, O son of Radha, the fruit of that wrath in conflict at hand.\r\nO wicked wight, we have suffered much misery in that forest for full\r\ntwelve; years. Reap thou today the fruits of our concentrated vengeance.\r\nCome, O Karna, cope with me in battle. Let these thy Kaurava warriors\r\nwitness the conflict. Hearing these words, Karna replied, 'Do thou, O\r\nPartha, accomplish in deed what thou sayst in words. The world knows that\r\nthy words verily exceed thy deed. That thou hadst foreborne formerly was\r\nowing to thy inability to do anything. If we witness thy prowess even\r\nnow, we may acknowledge its truth. If thy past forbearance was due to thy\r\nhaving been bound by the bonds of morality, truly thou art equally bound\r\nnow although thou regardest thyself free. Having as thou sayst, passed\r\nthy exile in the woods in strict accordance with thy pledge and being\r\ntherefore weakened by practising an ascetic course of life, how canst\r\nthou desire a combat with me now! O Pritha's son, if Sakra himself fight\r\non thy side, still I would feel no anxiety in putting forth my prowess.\r\nThy wish, O son of Kunti, is about to be gratified. Do thou fight with me\r\nnow, and behold my strength.' Hearing this, Arjuna said, 'Even now, O\r\nRadha's son, thou hadst fled from battle with me, and it is for this that\r\nthou livest although thy younger brother hath been slain. What other\r\nperson, save thee, having beheld his younger brother slain in battle\r\nwould himself fly from the field, and boast as thou dost, amid good and\r\ntrue men?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words unto Karna, the\r\ninvincible Vibhatsu rushed at him and charged a volley, of shafts capable\r\nof penetrating through a coat of mail. But that mighty car-warrior,\r\nKarna, received with great alacrity that discharge with an arrowy shower\r\nof his own, heavy as the downpour of the clouds. And that fierce volley\r\nof arrows covered all sides and severally pierced the steeds and arms and\r\nleathern fences of the combatants. And incapable of putting up with that\r\nassault, Arjuna cut off the strings of Karna's quiver by means of a\r\nstraight and sharp arrow. Thereupon, taking out from his quiver another\r\narrow, Karna pierced the Pandava in the hand at which the latter's hold\r\nof the bow was loosened. And then the mighty-armed Partha cut off Karna's\r\nbow into fragments. And Karna replied by hurling a dart at his adversary,\r\nbut Arjuna cut it off by means of his arrows. And then the warriors that\r\nfollowed the son of Radha rushed in crowds at Arjuna, but Partha sent\r\nthem all to the abode of Yama by means of arrows shot from the Gandiva.\r\nAnd Vibhatsu slew the steeds of Karna by means of sharp and tough arrows\r\nshot from the bow-string drawn to the ear, and deprived of life they\r\ndropped down on the ground. And taking another sharp and blazing arrow\r\nendued with great energy, the mighty son of Kunti pierced the breast of\r\nKama. And that arrow, cleaving through his mail, penetrated into his\r\nbody. And at this, Karna's vision was obscured and his senses left him.\r\nAnd regaining consciousness, he felt a great pain, and leaving the combat\r\nfled in a northernly direction. And at this, the mighty car-warrior\r\nArjuna and Uttara, both began to address him contumely.'\""

Thereupon,\r\nbeholding that mighty host thronged with cars and horses and elephants,\r\nUttara, sorely pierced with arrows, said, 'O hero, I am no longer able to\r\nguide thy excellent steeds. My spirits droop and my mind is exceedingly\r\nbewildered. All the directions seem to be whirling before my eyes in\r\nconsequence of the energy of the celestial weapons used by thee and the\r\nKurus. I have been deprived of my senses by the stench of fat and blood\r\nand flesh. Beholding all this, from terror my mind is, as it were, cleft\r\nin twain. Never before had I beheld such a muster of horses in battle.\r\nAnd at the flapping of fences, and the blare of conchs, the leonine roars\r\nmade by the warriors and the shrieks of elephants, and the twang of the\r\nGandiva resembling the thunder, I have, O hero, been so stupefied that I\r\nhave been deprived of both hearing and memory. And, O hero, beholding\r\nthee incessantly drawing to a circle, in course of the conflict, the\r\nGandiva which resembleth a circle of fire, my sight faileth me and my\r\nheart is rent asunder. And seeing thy fierce form in battle, like that of\r\nthe wielder of the Pinaka while inflamed with wrath, and looking also at\r\nthe terrible arrows shot by thee, I am filled with fear. I fail to see\r\nwhen thou takest up thy excellent arrows, when thou fixest them on the\r\nbow-string, and when thou lettest them off. And though all this is done\r\nbefore my eyes, yet, deprived of my senses, I do not see it. My spirits\r\nare drooping and earth itself seems to be swimming before me. I have no\r\nstrength to hold the whip and the reins.' Hearing these words, Arjuna\r\nsaid, 'Do thou not fear. Assure thyself. Thou also hast, on the field of\r\nbattle performed, O bull among men, wonderful feats. Blessed be thou,\r\nthou art a prince and born in the illustrious line of Matsyas. It\r\nbehoveth thee not to feel dispirited in chastising thy foes. Therefore, O\r\nprince, stationed on my car, muster all thy fortitude and hold the reins\r\nof my steeds, O slayer of foes, when I once more become engaged in\r\nbattle.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this unto Virata's son, that best\r\nof men and foremost of car-warriors, the mighty-armed Arjuna, again\r\naddressed the son of Virata, saying. 'Take me without delay to the van of\r\nBhishma's division. I will cut off his very bow-string in the battle.\r\nThou shalt behold today the celestial weapons of blazing beauty, shot by\r\nme, look like flashes of lightning disporting amid the clouds in the sky.\r\nThe Kauravas shall behold the gold decked back of my Gandiva today, and\r\nassembled together the foe shall dispute, saying,--By which hand of his,\r\nthe right or the left, doth he should? And I shall cause a dreadful river\r\n(of death) to flow today towards the other world with blood for its\r\nwaters and cars for its eddies, and elephants for its crocodiles. I shall\r\ntoday, with my straight arrows, extirpate the Kuru forest having hands\r\nand feet and heads and backs and arms for the branches of its trees.\r\nAlone, bow in hand, vanquishing the Kuru host, a hundred paths shall open\r\nbefore me like those of a forest in conflagration. Struck by me thou\r\nshalt today behold the Kuru army moving round and round like a wheel\r\n(unable to fly off the field). I shall show thee today my excellent\r\ntraining in arrows and weapons. Stay thou on my car firmly, whether the\r\nground be smooth or uneven. I can pierce with my winged arrows even the\r\nmountain of Sumeru that stands touching the very heavens. I slew of old,\r\nat Indra's command, hundreds and thousands of Paulomas and Kalakhanjas in\r\nbattle. I have obtained my firmness of grasp from Indra, and my lightness\r\nof hand from Brahman, and I have learnt various modes of fierce attack\r\nand defence amid crowds of foes from Prajapati. I vanquished, on the\r\nother side of the great ocean, sixty thousands of car-warriors--all\r\nfierce archers--residing in Hiranyapura. Behold, now I defeat the\r\nmultitudinous host of the Kurus like a tempest scattering a heap of\r\ncotton. With my fiery arrows I shall today set the Kuru-forest to fire,\r\nhaving banners for its trees, the foot-soldiers for its shrubs, and the\r\ncar-warriors for its beasts of prey. Like unto the wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt overthrowing the Danavas, alone I shall, with my straight\r\narrows, bring down from the chambers of their cars the mighty warrior of\r\nthe Kuru army stationed therein and struggling in the conflict to the\r\nbest of their power. I have obtained from Rudra the Raudra, from Varuna\r\nthe Varuna from Agni the Agneya, from the god of Wind the Vayava, and\r\nfrom Sakra the thunderbolt and other weapons. I shall certainly\r\nexterminate the fierce Dhartarashtra-forest though protected by many\r\nleonine warriors. Therefore, O Virata's son, let thy fears be dispelled.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus assured by Savyasachin, the son of Virata\r\npenetrated into that fierce array of cars protected by Bhishma. The son\r\nof Ganga, however, of fierce deeds, cheerfully withstood the mighty-armed\r\nhero advancing from desire of vanquishing the heroes in battle. Jishnu,\r\nthen, confronting Bhishma, cut off his standard clean off at the roots by\r\nshooting a gold-decked arrow pierced by which it fell to the ground. And\r\nat this, four mighty warriors, Dussasana and Vikarna and Dussaha and\r\nVivingsati, skilled in weapons and endued with great energy, and all\r\ndecked with handsome garlands and ornaments, rushed towards that terrible\r\nbowman. And advancing towards Vibhatsu--that fierce archer, these all\r\nencompassed him around. Then the heroic Dussasana pierced the son of\r\nVirata with a crescent-shaped arrow and he pierced Arjuna with another\r\narrow in the breast. And Jishnu, confronting Dussasana, cut off by means\r\nof a sharp-edged arrow furnished with vulturine wings his adversary's bow\r\nplaited with gold, and then pierced his person in the breast by means of\r\nfive arrows. And afflicted by the arrows of Partha. Dussasana fled,\r\nleaving the combat. Then Vikarna, the son of Dhritarashtra, pierced\r\nArjuna--that slayer of hostile heroes, by means of sharp and straight\r\narrows furnished with vulturine wings. But the son of Kunti within a\r\nmoment hit him also in the forehead with straight shafts. And pierced by\r\nArjuna, he fell down from his car. And at this, Dussaha, supported by\r\nVivingsati, covered Arjuna with a cloud of sharp arrows, impelled by the\r\ndesire of rescuing his brother. Dhananjaya, however, without the least\r\nanxiety, pierced both of them almost at the same instant by means of\r\ncouple of keen-edged arrows and then slew the steeds of both. And there\r\nupon, both those sons of Dhritarashtra, deprived of their steeds and\r\ntheir bodies mangled were taken away by the warrior behind them who had\r\nrushed forward with other cars. Then the unvanquished Vibhatsu, the\r\nmighty son of Kunti, decked with diadem and sure of aim, simultaneously\r\nattacked all sides with his arrows.'\""

But that hero of immeasurable soul\r\ncompletely covered all those mighty car-warriors with clouds of arrows,\r\neven as the mist covereth the mountains. And the roars of huge elephants\r\nand conchs, mingling together, produced a loud up roar. And penetrating\r\nthrough the bodies of elephants and horses as also through steel coats of\r\nmail, the arrows shot by Partha fell by thousands. And shooting shafts\r\nwith the utmost celerity, the son of Pandu seemed in that contest to\r\nresemble the blazing sun of an autumnal midday. And afflicted with fear,\r\nthe car-warriors began to leap down from their cars and the\r\nhorse-soldiers from horse-back, while the foot-soldiers began to fly in\r\nall directions. And loud was the clatter made by Arjuna's shafts as they\r\ncleft the coats of mail belonging to mighty warriors, made of steel,\r\nsilver, and copper. And the field was soon covered with the corpses of\r\nwarriors mounted on elephants and horses, all mangled by the shafts of\r\nPartha of great impetuosity like unto sighing snakes. And then it seemed\r\nas if Dhananjaya, bow in hand, was dancing on the field of battle. And\r\nsorely affrighted at the twang of the Gandiva resembling the noise of the\r\nthunder, many were the combatants that fled from that terrible conflict.\r\nAnd the field of battle was bestrewn with severed heads decked with\r\nturbans, ear-rings and necklaces of gold, and the earth looked beautiful\r\nby being scattered all over with human trunks mangled by shafts, and arms\r\nhaving bows in their grasp and hands decked with ornaments. And, O bull\r\nof the Bharata race, in consequence of heads cut off by whetted shafts\r\nceaselessly falling on the ground, it seemed as if a shower of stones\r\nfell from the sky. And that Partha of formidable prowess, displaying his\r\nfierceness, now ranged the field of battle, pouring the terrible fire of\r\nhis wrath upon the sons of Dhritarashtra. And beholding the fierce\r\nprowess of Arjuna who thus scorched the hostile host, the Kuru warriors,\r\nin the very presence of Duryodhana, became dispirited and ceased to\r\nfight. And, O Bharata, having struck terror into that host and routed\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, that fore-most of victors, ranged on the\r\nfield. And the son of Pandu then created on the field of battle a\r\ndreadful river of blood, with waving billows, like unto the river of\r\ndeath that is created by Time at the end of the Yuga, having the\r\ndishevelled hair of the dead and the dying for its floating moss and\r\nstraw, with bows and arrows for its boats, fierce in the extreme and\r\nhaving flesh and animal juices for its mire. And coats of mail and\r\nturbans floated thick on its surface. And elephants constituted its\r\nalligators and the cars its rafts. And marrow and fat and blood\r\nconstituted its currents. And it was calculated to strike terror into the\r\nhearts of the spectators. And dreadful to behold, and fearful in the\r\nextreme, and resounding with the yells of ferocious beasts, keen edged\r\nweapons constituted its crocodiles. And Rakshasas and other cannibals\r\nhaunted it from one end to the other. And strings of pearls constituted\r\nits ripples, and various excellent ornaments, its bubbles. And having\r\nswarms of arrows for its fierce eddies and steeds for its tortoises, it\r\nwas incapable of being crossed. And the mighty car warrior constituted\r\nits large island, and it resounded with the bleat of conchs and the sound\r\nof drums. And the river of blood that Partha created was incapable of\r\nbeing crossed. Indeed, so swift-handed was Arjuna that the spectators\r\ncould not perceive any interval between his taking up an arrow, and\r\nfixing it on the bow-string, and letting it off by a stretch of the\r\nGandiva.'\""

And in consequence of a white umbrella\r\nbeing held over his head, that tiger among men looked beautiful like unto\r\na hill at sunrise. And the son of Ganga, blowing his conch cheered the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra, and wheeling along his right came upon Vibhatsu\r\nand impeded his course. And that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of\r\nKunti, beholding him approach, received him with a glad heart, like a\r\nhill receiving a rain-charged cloud. And Bhishma, endued with great\r\nenergy, pierced Partha's flag-staff with eight arrows. The arrows\r\nreaching the flag-staff of Pandu's son, struck the blazing ape and those\r\ncreatures also stationed in the banner-top. And then the son of Pandu,\r\nwith a mighty javelin of sharp-edge cut of Bhishma's umbrella which\r\ninstantly fell on the ground. And then the light-handed son of Kunti\r\nstruck his adversary's flag-staff also with many shafts, and then his\r\nsteeds and then the couple of drivers that protected Bhishma's flanks.\r\nAnd unable to bear this, Bhishma though cognisant of the Pandava's might,\r\ncovered Dhananjaya with a powerful celestial weapon. And the son of\r\nPandu, of immeasurable soul, hurling in return a celestial weapon at\r\nBhishma, received that from Bhishma like a hill receiving a deep mass of\r\nclouds. And the encounter that took place between Partha and Bhishma, was\r\nfierce and the Kaurava warriors with their troops stood as lookers on.\r\nAnd in the conflict between Bhishma and the son of Pandu, shafts striking\r\nagainst shafts shone in the air like fireflies in the season of rains.\r\nAnd, O king, in consequence of Partha's shooting arrows with both his\r\nright and left hands, the bent Gandiva seemed like a continuous circle of\r\nfire. And the son of Kunti then covered Bhishma with hundreds of sharp\r\nand keen-edged arrows, like a cloud covering the mountain-breast with its\r\nheavy downpour. And Bhishma baffled with the own arrows that arrowy\r\nshower, like the bank resisting the swelling sea, and covered the son of\r\nPandu in return. And those warriors, cut into a thousand pieces in\r\nbattle, fell fast in the vicinity of Falguna's car. And then there was a\r\ndownpour, from the car of Pandu's son, of arrows furnished with golden\r\nwing, and raining through the sky like a flight of locusts. And Bhishma\r\nagain repelled that arrowy shower with hundreds of whetted shafts shot by\r\nhim. And then the Kauravas exclaimed.--Excellent! Excellent!--Indeed,\r\nBhishma hath performed an exceedingly difficult feat inasmuch as he hath\r\nfought with Arjuna. Dhananjaya is mighty and youthful, and dexterous and\r\nswift of hand. Who else, save Bhishma, the son of Santanu, or Krishna,\r\nthe son of Devaki, or the mighty son of Bharadwaja, the foremost of\r\npreceptors, is able to bear the impetus of Partha in battle? And\r\nrepelling weapons with weapons, those two bulls of the Bharata race, both\r\nendued with great might, fought on playfully and infatuated the eyes of\r\nall created beings. And those illustrious warriors ranged on the field of\r\nbattle, using the celestials weapons obtained from Prajapati and Indra,\r\nand Agni and the fierce Rudra, and Kuvera, and Varuna, and Yama, and\r\nVayu. And all beings were greatly surprised, upon beholding those\r\nwarriors engaged in combat. And they all exclaimed,--Bravo Partha of long\r\narms? Bravo Bhishma! Indeed, this application of celestial weapons that\r\nis being witnessed in the combat between Bhishma and Partha is rare among\r\nhuman beings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus raged that conflict with weapons between\r\nthose warriors conversant with all weapons. And when that conflict of\r\ncelestial weapons ceased, then commenced a conflict with arrows. And\r\nJishnu approaching his opponent, cut of with an arrow sharp like a razor\r\nthe gold-decked bow of Bhishma. Within the twinkling of the eye, however,\r\nBhishma, that mighty-armed and great car-warrior, took up another bow and\r\nstringed it. And inflamed with wrath, he showered upon Dhananjaya a cloud\r\nof arrows. And Arjuna, too, endued with great energy, rained upon Bhishma\r\ninnumerable sharp-pointed and keen-edged arrows. And Bhishma also shot\r\nclouds of arrows upon Pandu's son. And conversant with celestial weapons\r\nand engaged in shooting and each other, arrows of keen points, no\r\ndistinction, O king, could then be perceived between those illustrious\r\nwarriors. And that mighty car-warrior, Kunti's son, covered with a\r\ndiadem, and the heroic son of Santanu, obscured the ten directions with\r\ntheir arrows. And the Pandava covered Bhishma, and Bhishma also covered\r\nthe Pandava, with clouds of shafts. And, O king, wonderful was this\r\ncombat that took place in this world of men. And the heroic warriors that\r\nprotected Bhishma's car, slain by the son of Pandu, fell prostrate, O\r\nmonarch, beside the car of Kunti's son. And the feathery arrows of\r\nSvetavahana, shot from the Gandiva, fell in all directions as if with the\r\nobject of making a wholesale slaughter of the foe. And issuing forth from\r\nhis car those blazing arrows furnished with golden wings looked like rows\r\nof swans in the sky. And all the celestials with Indra, stationed in the\r\nfirmament, gazed with wonder upon another celestial weapon hurled with\r\ngreat force by that wonderful archer Arjuna. And beholding that wonderful\r\nweapon of great beauty, the mighty Gandiva, Chitrasena, highly pleased,\r\naddressed the lord of celestials, saying, 'Behold these arrows shot by\r\nPartha coursing through the sky in one continuous line. Wonderful is the\r\ndexterity of Jishnu in evolving this celestial weapon! Human beings are\r\nincapable of shooting such a weapon, for it does not exist among men. How\r\nwonderful again is this concourse of mighty weapons existing from days of\r\nold! No interval can be perceived between his taking up the arrows,\r\nfixing them on the bow-string, and letting them off by stretching the\r\nGandiva. The soldiers are incapable of even looking at the son of Pandu,\r\nwho is like unto the midday sun blazing in the sky. So also none ventures\r\nto look at Bhishma, the son of Ganga. Both are famous for their\r\nachievements, and both are of fierce prowess. Both are equal in feats of\r\nheroism, and both are difficult of being vanquished in battle.'\r\n\r\n'Thus addressed by the Gandharva about that combat between Partha and\r\nBhishma, the lord of the celestials, O Bharata, paid proper respect unto\r\nboth by a shower of celestial flowers. Meanwhile, Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu, assailed Arjuna on the left side, while that drawer of the bow\r\nwith either hands was on the point of piercing him. And at this,\r\nVibhatsu, laughing aloud, cut off with an arrow of keen edge and\r\nfurnished with vulturine wings, the bow of Bhishma, that hero of solar\r\neffulgence. And then Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, pierced Bhishma in the\r\nbreast with ten shafts although the latter was contending with all his\r\nprowess. And sorely afflicted with pain Ganga's son of mighty arms and\r\nirresistible in battle, stood for a long time leaning on the pole of his\r\ncar. And beholding him deprived of consciousness the driver of his\r\ncar-steeds, calling to mind the instructions about protecting the\r\nwarriors when in a swoon, led him away for safety.'\""

And with a spear-headed\r\nshaft shot from his bow stretched to the ear, he pierced on the forehead\r\nof that terrible bowman of fierce prowess, Dhanajaya, ranging amidst the\r\nfoes. And pierced with that keen shaft of golden point on the forehead,\r\nthat hero of famous deeds looked resplendent, O king, like unto a\r\nbeautiful hill with a single peak. And cut by that arrow, the warm\r\nlife-blood gushed out profusely from the wound. And the blood trickling\r\ndown his body shone beautifully like a wreath of golden flowers. And\r\nstruck by Duryodhana with the shaft, the swift-handed Arjuna of unfailing\r\nstrength, swelling with rage, pierced the king in return, taking up\r\narrows that were endued with the energy of snakes of virulent poison. And\r\nDuryodhana of formidable energy attacked Partha, and Partha also, that\r\nforemost of heroes, attacked Duryodhana. And it was that those foremost\r\nof men, both born in the race of Ajamida, struck each other alike in the\r\ncombat.

And like the thunderbolt\r\nhurled by Indra splitting a mountain, that arrow furnished with vulturine\r\nwings, shot by Partha, penetrated, up to the very feathers, into the body\r\nof that elephant huge as hill. And sorely afflicted by the shaft, that\r\nlord of the elephant species began to tremble, and deprived of strength\r\nfell down on the ground in intense anguish, like the peak of mountain\r\nriven by thunder. And that best of elephants falling down on the earth,\r\nVikarna suddenly alighting in great terror, ran back full eight hundred\r\npaces and ascended on the car of Vivingsati. And having slain with that\r\nthunder-like arrow that elephant huge as a mighty hill and looking like a\r\nmass of clouds, the son of Pritha smote Duryodhana in the breast with\r\nanother arrow of the same kind. And both the elephant and the king having\r\nthus been wounded, and Vikarna having broken and fled along with the\r\nsupporters of the king's car, the other warriors, smitten with the arrows\r\nshot from the Gandiva, fled from the field in panic. And beholding the\r\nelephant slain by Partha, and all the other warriors running away,\r\nDuryodhana, the foremost of the Kurus, turning away his car precipitately\r\nfled in that direction where Partha was not. And when Duryodhana was fast\r\nrunning away in alarm, pierced by that arrow and vomitting forth blood,\r\nKiritin, still eager for battle and capable of enduring every enemy, thus\r\ncensured him from wrath, 'Sacrificing thy great fame and glory, why dost\r\nthou fly away, turning the back? Why are not those trumpet? sounded now,\r\nas they were when thou hadst set out from thy kingdom? Lo, I am an\r\nobedient servant of Yudhishthira, myself being the third son of Pritha,\r\nstanding here for battle. Turn back, show me thy face, O son of\r\nDhritarashtra, and bear in thy mind the behaviour of kings. The name\r\nDuryodhana bestowed on thee before is hereby rendered meaningless.

And beholding Duryodhana turn back with his wounds,\r\nKarna, that hero among men, decked with a golden necklace, stopped the\r\nking on the way and soothing him, himself proceeded along the north of\r\nDuryodhana's car to meet Partha in battle. And the mighty-armed Bhishma\r\nalso, the son of Santanu, turning back his steeds decked with gold,\r\nenormous in size, and of tawny hue, rushed bow in hand, for protecting\r\nDuryodhana from Partha's hand. And Drona and Kripa and Vivingsati and\r\nDussasana and others also, quickly turning back, rushed forward with\r\nspeed with drawn bows and arrows fixed on the bow-strings, for protecting\r\nDuryodhana. And beholding those divisions advance towards him like the\r\nswelling surges of the ocean, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, quickly\r\nrushed at them like a crane rushing at a descending cloud. And with\r\ncelestial weapons in their hands, they completely surrounded the son of\r\nPritha and rained on him from all sides a perfect shower of shafts, like\r\nclouds showering on the mountain breast a heavy downpour of rain, And\r\nwarding off with weapons, all the weapons of those bulls among the Kurus,\r\nthe wielder of the Gandiva who was capable of enduring all foes, evolved\r\nanother irresistible weapon obtained from Indra, called Sanmohana. And\r\nentirely covering the cardinal and other directions with sharp and\r\nkeen-edged arrows furnished with beautiful feathers, that mighty hero\r\nstupefied their senses with the twang of the Gandiva. And once more,\r\ntaking up with both his hands that large conch of loud blare, Partha,\r\nthat slayer of foes, blew it with force and filled the cardinal and other\r\npoints, the whole earth, and sky, with that noise. And those foremost of\r\nthe Kuru heroes were all deprived of their senses by the sound of that\r\nconch blown by Partha. And all of them stood still, their bows, from\r\nwhich they were never separated, dropping down from their hands. And when\r\nthe Kuru army became insensible, Partha calling to mind the words of\r\nUttara, addressed the son of the Matsya king, saying, 'O best of men, go\r\nthou among the Kurus, so long as they remain insensible, and bring away\r\nthe white garments of Drona and Kripa, and the yellow and handsome ones\r\nof Karna, as also the blue ones of the king and Drona's son. Methinks,\r\nBhishma is not stupefied, for he knoweth how to counteract this weapon of\r\nmine. So, pass thou on, keeping his steeds to thy left; for those that\r\nare sensible should thus be avoided,' Hearing these words, the\r\nillustrious son of Matsya, giving up the reins of the steeds, jumped down\r\nfrom the car and taking off the garments of the warriors, came back to\r\nhis place. And the son of Virata then urged the four handsome steeds with\r\nflanks adorned with golden armours. And those white steeds, urged on,\r\ntook Arjuna away from the midst of battle-field and beyond the array of\r\nthe infantry bearing standards in their hands. And, Bhishma, beholding\r\nthat best of men thus going away, struck him with arrows. And Partha,\r\ntoo, having slain Bhishma's steeds, pierced him with ten shafts. And\r\nabandoning Bhishma on the field of battle, having first slain his\r\ncar-driver, Arjuna with a good-looking bow in hand came out of that\r\nmultitude of cars, like the sun emerging from the clouds. And\r\nDhritarashtra's son, that foremost of heroes among the Kurus, recovering\r\nhis senses, saw the son of Pritha standing like the lord of the\r\ncelestials, alone on the battle-field. And he said in hurry (unto\r\nBhishma), 'How hath this one escape from thee? Do thou afflict him in\r\nsuch a way that he may not escape.' And at this, Santanu's son, smiling,\r\nsaid unto him, 'Where had been this sense of thine, and where had been\r\nthy prowess too, when thou hadst been in a state of unconsciousness\r\nrenouncing thy arrows and handsome bow? Vibhatsu is not addicted to the\r\ncommission of atrocious deeds; nor is his soul inclined to sin. He\r\nrenounceth not his principles even for the sake of the three worlds. It\r\nis for this only that all of us have not been slain in this battle. O\r\nthou foremost of Kuru heroes, go back to the city of the Kurus, and let\r\nPartha also go away, having conquered the kine. Do thou never foolishly\r\nthrow away thy own good. Indeed, that which leadeth to one's welfare\r\nought to be accomplished.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having listened to the words of the grandsire\r\nthat tended to his own welfare, the wrathful king Duryodhana no longer\r\neager for battle, drew a deep sigh and became silent. And reflecting that\r\nthe advice of Bhishma was beneficial and seeing that the Pandavas gaining\r\nin strength, the other warriors also, desirous of protecting Duryodhana,\r\nresolved to return. And beholding those foremost of Kuru heroes departing\r\nfor their city, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, with a cheerful heart\r\nfollowed them for a while, desirous of addressing and worshipping them.\r\nAnd having worshipped the aged grandsire--the son of Santanu, as also the\r\npreceptor Drona, and having saluted with beautiful arrows Drona's son and\r\nKripa and other venerable ones among the Kurus, the son of Pritha broke\r\ninto fragments Duryodhana's crown decked with precious gems, with another\r\narrow. And having saluted all the venerable and brave warriors thus, he\r\nfilled the three worlds with the twang of the Gandiva. And suddenly\r\nblowing his conch called Devadatta, the hero pierced the hearts of all\r\nhis foes. And having humbled the hostile, he looked resplendent on his\r\ncar decked with a handsome flag. And beholding the Kurus depart, Kiritin\r\ncheerfully said unto Matsya's son, 'Turn back thy steeds; thy kine have\r\nbeen recovered; the foe is going away and do thou also return to thy city\r\nwith a cheerful heart.' And the celestials also, having witnessed that\r\nmost wonderful encounter between Falguna and the Kurus, were highly\r\ndelighted, and went to their respective abodes, reflecting upon Partha's\r\nfeats.'\""

Do not eulogise them upon entering the city, for then\r\nthe king of the Matsyas may hide himself in fear. On the other hand,\r\nentering the city, do thou proclaim in the presence of thy father that\r\nthe deed is thy own, saying,--By me hath the army of the Kurus been\r\nvanquished and by me have the kine been recovered from the foe!'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'The feat thou hast achieved is beyond my power.

Then that terrible monkey\r\nblazing like fire ascended into the sky with those other creatures in the\r\nflag-staff. And the illusion created (by Viswakarma) melted away and\r\nUttara's own banner bearing the device of a lion was set up on the car\r\nagain. And having replaced the arrows and quivers of those foremost of\r\nthe Kuru princes, and also that other weapon the (Gandiva) which enhances\r\nthe fierceness of a battle, the illustrious prince of Matsya set out for\r\nthe city with a glad heart, having Kiritin as his charioteer.

And as the brave\r\nking, that enhancer of the joys of friends, was seated on his throne, all\r\nhis subjects headed by the Brahmanas stood before him. And worshipped by\r\nthem, the king of the Matsyas, at the head of his army, saluted the\r\nBrahmanas and his subjects in return and dismissed them cheerfully. And\r\nVirata, the king of the Matsyas owning a large army, enquired after\r\nUttara, saying, 'Where hath Uttara gone?' And the women and the maidens\r\nof the palace and the other females living in the inner apartments\r\njoyfully said unto him, 'Our kine having been seized by the Kurus,\r\nBhuminjaya incensed at this and from excess of bravery hath issued forth\r\nalone with only Vrihannala as his second, for vanquishing the six mighty\r\ncar-warriors, Bhishma the son of Santanu, and Kripa, and Karna, and\r\nDuryodhana, and Drona, and Drona's son who have all come with the Kuru\r\narmy.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then king Virata, hearing that his brave son\r\nhad gone forth with only one car and with Vrihannala as his car-driver,\r\nbecame filled with grief, and addressing his chief counsellors, said,\r\n'Without doubt, the Kauravas and other lords of earth, learning the\r\ndefeat of the Trigartas, will never keep their ground. Therefore, let\r\nthose of my warriors that have not been wounded by the Trigartas go out,\r\naccompanied by a mighty force, for the protection of Uttara.'

And it was thus that\r\nVirata, the king of the Matsyas, owning a large army, quickly ordered out\r\na large division consisting of four kinds of troops.

And he said, 'All the kine have been\r\nbrought back, the Kurus have been defeated, and Uttara, that slayer of\r\nfoes, is well with his car-driver.'

Kanka said in reply, 'O monarch, O bestower of\r\nhonours, what business hast thou with gamble which is attended with\r\nnumerous evils? Gambling is fraught with many evils; it should,\r\ntherefore, be shunned. Thou mayst have seen or at least heard of\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Pandu. He lost his extensive and prosperous\r\nkingdom and his god-like brothers at dice. For this, I am averse to\r\ngambling.

Upon this, the illustrious king\r\nYudhishthira said, 'Why should not he conquer that hath Vrihannala for\r\nhis charioteer?'\r\n\r\n'Thus addressed, King Matsya became angry and said unto Pandu's son,\r\n'Thou wretch of a Brahmana, dost thou compare one of the neuter sex with\r\nmy son! Hast thou no knowledge of what is proper and what improper for\r\none to say? Without doubt, thou disregardest me. Why should not my son\r\nvanquish all those with Bhishma and Drona as their leaders? O Brahmana,\r\nfor friendship only I pardon thee this thy offence. Thou must not,\r\nhowever, say so again if thou wishest to live.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'There where Bhishma and Drona and Drona's son and\r\nthe son of Vikartana and Kripa and king Duryodhana and other royal and\r\nmighty car-warriors are assembled or there where Indra himself is\r\nsurrounded by the Maruts, what other person than Vrihannala can fight,\r\nencountering them all! None hath been, none will be, his equal in\r\nstrength of arms! Indeed, it is Vrihannala only whose heart is filled\r\nwith joy at sight of a terrible conflict. It is he who had vanquished the\r\ncelestials and the Asuras and human beings fighting together. With such a\r\none for his ally, why should not thy son conquer the foe? Virata said,\r\n'Repeatedly forbidden by me, thou dost not yet restrain thy tongue. If\r\nthere is none to punish, no one would practise virtue.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, the king inflamed with anger\r\nforcibly struck Yudhishthira in the face with a dice, and reproached him\r\nangrily, saying, 'Let it not occur again! And having been violently\r\nstruck, blood began to flow from his nose. But the son of Pritha held it\r\nin his hands before it fell on the ground. And the virtuous Yudhishthira\r\nthen glanced at Draupadi who was standing by his side. Ever obedient to\r\nthe wishes of her lord, the faultless Draupadi, understanding his\r\nmeaning, and bringing a golden vessel filled with water, received the\r\nblood that flowed from his nose. Meanwhile; Uttara, entertained with\r\nsweet perfumes of diverse kinds and decked with floral chaplets, slowly\r\nentered the city, received with respect by the citizens, the women, and\r\nthe people of the provinces. And approaching the gate of the palace he\r\nsent the news of his arrival to his father. And the porter then,\r\napproaching the king, said, 'Thy son Uttara, waiteth at the gate with\r\nVrihannala as his companion.' And the Matsya king, with a cheerful heart,\r\nsaid unto him, 'Do thou usher both, as I am very anxious to see them.'\r\nThen Yudhishthira, the king of t e Kurus, gently whispered unto the ears\r\nof the warder, 'Let Uttara enter alone; Vrihannala must not come in. Such\r\nis the vow of that hero of mighty arms that whoever causeth a wound on my\r\nperson or sheddeth my blood except in battle, shall not live. Inflamed\r\nwith rage he will never bear patiently to see me bleeding, but will slay\r\nVirata even now with his counsellors and troops and steeds.'\""

No other person among the mobile and immobile creatures of the\r\nthree worlds possesseth or will ever possess such knowledge of weapons.\r\nAnd there is none even amongst the gods, or Asuras, or men, or Rakshasas,\r\nor Gandharvas, or Yaksha chiefs, or Kinnaras--or mighty Uragas, who is\r\nlike him. Endued with great foresight and energy, beloved by the citizens\r\nand inhabitants of the provinces, he is the mightiest of car-warriors\r\namongst the sons of Pandu. A performer of sacrifices, devoted to\r\nmorality, and of subdued passions, like unto a great Rishi, this royal\r\nsage is celebrated over all the worlds. Possessed of great strength and\r\ngreat intelligence, able and truthful, he hath all his senses under\r\ncomplete control. Equal unto Indra in wealth and Kuvera in hoarding, he\r\nis the protector of the worlds like unto Manu himself of mighty prowess.\r\nEndued with great might, he is even such. Kind unto all creatures he is\r\nno other than the bull of the Kuru race, king Yudhishthira the just. The\r\nachievements of this king resemble the sun himself of blazing effulgence.\r\nAnd his fame hath travelled in all directions like the rays of that\r\nluminary. And like the rays following the risen sun of blazing\r\neffulgence, ten thousand swift elephants followed him, O king, when he\r\ndwelt among the Kurus. And, O king, thirty thousand cars decked in gold\r\nand drawn by the best steeds, also used to follow him then. And full\r\neight hundred bards adorned with ear-rings set with shining gems, and\r\naccompanied by minstrels, recited his praises in those days, like the\r\nRishis adorning Indra. And, O king, the Kauravas and other lords of earth\r\nalways waited upon him like slaves, as the celestials upon Kuvera. This\r\neminent king, resembling the bright-rayed sun, made all lords of earth\r\npay tribute unto him like persons of the agricultural class. And\r\neighty-eight thousands of high-souled Snatakas depended for their\r\nsubsistence upon this king practising excellent vows. This illustrious\r\nlord protected the aged and the helpless, the maimed and the blind, as\r\nhis sons, and he ruled over his subjects virtuously. Steady in morality\r\nand self-control, capable of restraining his anger, bountiful, devoted to\r\nthe Brahmanas, and truthful, this one is the son of Pandu. The prosperity\r\nand prowess of this one afflict king Suyodhana with his followers\r\nincluding Kama and Suvala's son. And, O lord of men, the virtues of this\r\none are incapable of being enumerated. This son of Pandu is devoted to\r\nmorality and always abstains from injury. Possessed of such attributes,\r\ndoth not this bull among kings, this son of Pandu, deserve, O monarch, to\r\noccupy a royal seat?'\""

Which of these is Nakula, and which Sahadeva and where is\r\nthe celebrated Draupadi? After their defeat at dice, the sons of Pritha\r\nhave not been heard of by any one.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Even this one, O king, who is called Vallava and is thy\r\ncook, is that Bhima of mighty arms and terrible prowess and furious\r\nimpetus. It was he who slew the furious Rakshasas on the mountains of\r\nGandhamadana, and procured for Krishna celestial flowers of great\r\nfragrance. Even he is that Gandharva, who slew the Kichaka of wicked soul\r\nand it was he who killed tigers and bears and boars in the inner\r\napartment of thy palace. He who had been the keeper of thy horse is that\r\nslayer of foes called Nakula, and this one is Sahadeva, the keeper of thy\r\nkine. Both these sons of Madri are great car-warriors, possessed of great\r\nfame and beauty of person. These two bulls of the Bharata race, attired\r\nin handsome robes and decked in excellent ornaments, are a match for a\r\nthousand great car-warriors. And even this lady of eyes like lotus-petals\r\nand slender-waist and sweet smiles is Drupada's daughter, thy wife's\r\nSairindhri, for whose sake, O king, the Kichakas were slain. I am, O\r\nking, Arjuna who, it is evident, thou hast heard, is that son of Pritha,\r\nwho is Bhima's junior and the senior of the twins! We have, O king,\r\nhappily passed in thy abode the period of non-discovery, like infants in\r\nthe womb!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Arjuna had pointed out those heroes--the\r\nfive Pandavas, the son of Virata then spoke of Arjuna's prowess. And\r\nUttara once again identified the sons of Pritha. And the prince said,\r\n'That one whose complexion is bright like that of pure gold, who is stout\r\nlike a full-grown lion, whose nose is so prominent, whose eyes are large\r\nand expansive, and whose face is broad and of coppery hue, is the king of\r\nthe Kurus. And behold, that one whose tread is like that of an infuriate\r\nelephant, whose complexion is like that of heated gold, whose shoulders\r\nare broad and expanded, and whose arms are long and thick, is Vrikodara.\r\nAnd he who stands by his side, that youth of darkish hue, who is like\r\nunto a leader of a herd of elephants, whose shoulders are broad like\r\nthose of a lion, whose tread is like that of a mighty elephant, and whose\r\neyes are large and expansive like lotus-leaves, is Arjuna that foremost\r\nof bowmen. All lo, close to the king, are those foremost of men, the\r\ntwins, like unto Vishnu and Indra, and who have no equals, in the world\r\nof men, in beauty, might, and behaviour. And close by them, behold,\r\nstandeth Krishna, beautiful as gold, like unto the very embodiment of\r\nlight, possessing the complexion of the blue lotus, like unto a celestial\r\ndamsel, and resembling the living embodiment of Lakshmi herself.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Virata's son began to describe the prowess\r\nof Arjuna, saying, 'Even this one is he that slew the foe, like unto a\r\nlion devastating a flock of deer. Even he ranged through, crowds of\r\nhostile cars, slaying their best of car-warriors. By him was slain a\r\nhuge, infuriate elephant by means of a single arrow. Pierced by him, that\r\nhuge beast having its flanks adorned with an armour of gold, fell down\r\npiercing the earth with his tusks. By him have the kine been recovered\r\nand the Kauravas vanquished in battle. My ears have been deafened by the\r\nblare of his conch. It was by this hero of fierce deeds that Bhishma and\r\nDrona, along with Duryodhana, were vanquished. That achievement is his\r\nand not mine.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of his, the mighty king of\r\nthe Matsyas, considering himself guilty of having offended Yudhishthira,\r\nsaid unto Uttara in reply, 'I think the time hath come for me to\r\npropitiate the sons of Pandu. And, if thou likest, I shall bestow my\r\ndaughter Uttara upon Arjuna.'\r\n\r\n\"Uttara said, 'Worthy of our adorations and worship and respect, the time\r\nhath come for worshipping the illustrious sons of Pandu who deserve to be\r\nworshipped by us.'\r\n\r\n\"Virata said, 'When brought under the foe's subjection in battle, it was\r\nBhimasena that rescued me. My kine also have been recovered by Arjuna. It\r\nis through the might of their arms that we have obtained victory in\r\nbattle. Such being the case, all of us, with our counsellors, shall\r\npropitiate Yudhishthira the son of Kunti. Blessed be thou, with all thy\r\nbrothers, O bull among the sons of Pandu. If, O king, we have ever said\r\nor done anything in ignorance to offend thee, it behoveth thee to forgive\r\nus. The son of Pandu is virtuous.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the high-souled Virata, delighted greatly,\r\napproached king Yudhishthira and made an alliance with him, and offered\r\nhim his whole kingdom together with the sceptre and treasury and\r\nmetropolis. And addressing all the Pandavas, and especially Dhananjaya,\r\nthe mighty king of the Matsyas repeatedly said, 'By good luck it is that\r\nI see you.' And having again and again embraced Yudhishthira and Bhima\r\nand the sons of Madri, and smelt their heads, Virata, that owner of a\r\nlarge army, was not satiated with gazing at them. And being highly\r\npleased, he said unto king Yudhishthira, 'By good luck it is that I see\r\nyou safe from woods. By good luck it is that ye have accomplished with\r\ndifficulty the period of exile, undiscovered by those wicked wights. I\r\nmake over my entire kingdom to the sons of Pritha, and what else I have.\r\nLet the sons of Pandu accept these without the slightest hesitation. And\r\nlet Dhananjaya, called also Savyasachin, accept the hand of Uttara: for\r\nthat best of men is fit to be her lord.' Thus addressed, king\r\nYudhishthira the just cast a look upon Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha. And\r\nlooked at by his brother, Arjuna said unto the Matsya king, 'O monarch, I\r\naccept thy daughter as my daughter-in-law. And alliance of this kind\r\nbetween the Matsya and the Bharatas is, indeed, desirable.'\""

      "content": "\"Virata said, 'Why, O best among the Pandavas, dost thou not wish to\r\naccept as wife this my daughter that I bestow upon thee?'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Residing in thy inner apartments, I had occasion always to\r\nbehold thy daughter, and she too, alone or in company trusted me as her\r\nfather. Well-versed in singing and dancing, I was liked and regarded by\r\nher, and, indeed, thy daughter always regardeth me as her protector. O\r\nking, I lived for one whole year with her though she had attained the age\r\nof puberty. Under these circumstances, thyself or other men may not\r\nwithout reason, entertain suspicions against her or me. Therefore, O\r\nking, myself who am pure, and have my senses under control, beg to thee,\r\nO monarch, thy daughter as my daughter-in-law. Thus do I attest her\r\npurity. There is no difference between a daughter-in-law and a daughter,\r\nas also between a son and son's own-self. By adopting this course,\r\ntherefore, her purity will be proved. I am afraid of slanderous and false\r\naccusations. I accept, therefore, O king, thy daughter Uttara as my\r\ndaughter-in-law. Surpassing all in knowledge of weapons, resembling a\r\ncelestial youth in beauty, my son, the mighty-armed Abhimanyu is the\r\nfavourite nephew of Vasudeva, the wielder of the discus. He, O king, is\r\nfit to be thy son-in-law and the husband of thy daughter.'\r\n\r\n\"Virata said, 'It behoveth the best of the Kurus, Dhananjaya, the son of\r\nKunti, who is so virtuous and wise, to say this. O son of Pritha, do thou\r\ncarry out what thou thinkest should be done after this. He that hath\r\nArjuna for the father of his son-in-law, hath all his desires gratified.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'The monarch having said this, Yudhishthira, the\r\nson of Kunti, gave his assent to what was thus agreed upon between the\r\nMatsya king and Arjuna. And, O Bharata, the son of Kunti sent invitations\r\nto Vasudeva and to all his friends and relatives, and Virata also did the\r\nsame. And then, after the expiry of the thirteenth year, the five\r\nPandavas took up their abode in one of Virata's towns called Upaplavya,\r\nand Vibhatsu, the son of Pandu, brought over Abhimanyu and Janardana, and\r\nalso many people of the Dasarha race from the Anarta country. And the\r\nking of Kasi, and also Saivya, being very friendly to Yudhishthira,\r\narrived there, each accompanied by an Akshauhini of troops. And the\r\nmighty Drupada, also with the heroic sons of Draupadi and the\r\nunvanquished Sikhandin, and that foremost of wielder of weapons, the\r\ninvincible Dhrishtadyumna came there with another Akshauhini of troops.\r\nAnd all the kings that came were not only lords of Akshauhini, but\r\nperformers of sacrifices with gifts in profusion to Brahmanas, conversant\r\nwith the Vedas endued with heroism, and ready to die in battle. And\r\nbeholding them arrived, that foremost of virtuous men, the king of the\r\nMatsyas, adored them duly, and entertained their troops and servants and\r\ncarriers of burdens. And he was highly pleased to bestow his daughter\r\nupon Abhimanyu. And after the kings had come there from different parts\r\nof the country, there came Vasudeva decked in floral garlands, and\r\nHalayudha, and Kritavarman, the son of Hridika, and Yuyudhana, the son of\r\nSatyaki, and Anadhristi and Akrura, and Samva and Nisatha. And these\r\nrepressers of foes came there bringing with them Abhimanyu and his\r\nmother. And Indrasena and others, having lived at Dwaraka for one whole\r\nyear, came there, bringing with them the well adorned cars of the\r\nPandavas. And there came also ten thousand elephants and ten thousand\r\ncars, and hundred millions of horses and hundred billions of\r\nfoot-soldiers, and innumerable Vrishni and Andhaka and Bhoja warriors of\r\ngreat energy, in the train of that tiger among the Vrishnis, Vasudeva of\r\ngreat effulgence. And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of\r\nPandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial\r\nfestival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas.\r\nAnd then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical\r\ninstruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of\r\nVirata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were\r\nslain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were\r\nprofusely collected. And mimes and bards and encomiasts, versed in\r\nsinging and legendary lore, waited upon the kings, and chanted their\r\npraises and genealogies. And the matrons of the Matsyas of symmetrical\r\nbodies and limbs, and wearing ear-rings of pearls and gems, headed by\r\nSudeshna, came to the place where the marriage knot was to be tied. And\r\namongst those beautiful females of fair complexion and excellent\r\nornaments, Krishna was the foremost in beauty and fame and splendour. And\r\nthey all came there, leading forth the princess Uttara decked in every\r\nornament and resembling the daughter of the great Indra himself. And then\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Kunti, accepted Virata's daughter of faultless\r\nlimbs on behalf of his son by Subhadra. And that great king,\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, who stood there like Indra, also accepted\r\nher as his daughter-in-law. And having accepted her, the son of Pritha,\r\nwith Janardana before him, caused the nuptial ceremonies to be performed\r\nof the illustrious son of Subhadra. And Virata then gave him (as dowry)\r\nseven thousand steeds endued with the speed of the wind and two hundred\r\nelephants of the best kind and much wealth also. And having duly poured\r\nlibations of clarified butter on the blazing fire, and paid homage unto\r\nthe twice-born ones, Virata offered to the Pandavas his kingdom, army,\r\ntreasury, and his own self. And after the marriage had taken place,\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma, gave away unto the Brahmanas all the\r\nwealth that had been brought by Krishna of unfading glory. And he also\r\ngave away thousands of kine, and diverse kinds of robes, and various\r\nexcellent ornaments, and vehicles, and beds, delicious viands of various\r\nkinds, and cardinal drinks of diverse species. And the king also made\r\ngifts of land unto the Brahmanas with due rites, and also cattle by\r\nthousands. And he also gave away thousands of steeds and much gold and\r\nmuch wealth of other kinds, unto persons of all ages. And, O bull of the\r\nBharata race, the city of the Matsya king, thronged with men cheerful and\r\nwell-fed, shone brightly like a great festival.'\"\r\n\r\nThe end of Virata Parva\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1. Brahma Vadini--Nilakantha explains this as Krishna-kirtanasila.\r\n\r\n2. This speech of Vaisampayana is not included in some texts within the\r\nsecond section. To include it, however, in the third, is evidently a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n3. The sloka commencing with Adushta and ending ratheshu cha does not\r\noccur in texts except those in Bengal.\r\n\r\n4. A difference reading is observable here. The sense, however, is the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n5. An independent female artisan working in another person's\r\nhouse.--Wilson.\r\n\r\n6. Some of the Bengal text and Sarvastramaya for Sarvamantramaya. The\r\nformer is evidently incorrect.\r\n\r\n7. This is a very difficult sloka. Nilakantha adopts the reading\r\nSanjayet. The Bengal editions read Sanjapet. If the latter be the correct\r\nreading, the meaning then would be,--'Let none talk about what transpires\r\nin the presence of the king. For those even that are poor, regard it as a\r\ngrave fault.' The sense evidently is that the occurrences in respect of a\r\nking which one witnesses should not be divulged. Even they that are\r\npowerless regard such divulgence of what occurs in respect of them as an\r\ninsult to them, and, therefore, inexcusable.\r\n\r\n8. The Bengal editions, read Rajna in the instrumental case. Following a\r\nmanuscript text of a Pandit of my acquaintance I read Rajnas in the\r\ngenitive.\r\n\r\n9. Mahishasura, the son of Rambhasura. Durga had to fight for many many\r\nyears before she could slay this formidable Asura. The story occurs in\r\nthe Markandeya Purana. To this day, Bengal during the great Durga Puja\r\nfestival in autumn, worships the goddess with great veneration.\r\n\r\n10. Literally, one that rescues from difficulty.\r\n\r\n11. Kamachara is explained by Nilakantha thus, although in other places\r\nit bears a quite different meaning.\r\n\r\n12. Krita--attack; Pratikrita--warding it off; Sankata--clenched Some\r\ntexts read Sankatakais. The meaning then would be 'cased in gauntlets.'\r\n\r\n13. Bhuti, Hri, Sri, Kirti and Kanti are respectively the feminine\r\nembodiments of Prosperity, Modesty, Beauty, Fame and Loveliness.\r\n\r\n14. What Draupadi means is that instead of passing her days in joy and\r\nhappiness, instead of being able to wish time to be stationary with her,\r\nshe is obliged in consequence of her misery, to wish time to pass off\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n15. Jayate asyas--i.e., she from whom one is born.\r\n\r\n16. Some texts read, Vilwam nagaviodhara--i.e., 'As an elephant lifts up\r\na vela fruit.'\r\n\r\n17. Veri means both a kettle-drum and a trumpet. The latter however\r\nconveys a better meaning here.\r\n\r\n18. Literature, force of his thighs.\r\n\r\n19. What Bhima says is this.--Then Gandharvas, your husbands, are always\r\nobedient to thee! If they have been able to do thee a service, they have\r\nonly repaid a debt.\r\n\r\n20. Krita-krita--Nilakantha explains this to mean 'imagining themselves\r\nto have achieved success in their mission' for having learnt of Kichaka's\r\ndeath, they could readily guess the presence of the Pandavas there. This\r\nis too far-fetched and does not at all agree with the spirit of their\r\nreport to Duryodhana below. And then the same word occurs in the very\r\nlast line of the Section. I take it that in both places the word has been\r\nused in the same sense.\r\n\r\n21. This is a very difficult sloka. I am not sure that I have understood\r\nit alright. Both Nilakantha and Arjuna Misra are silent. Instead of\r\ndepending, however, on my own intelligence, I have consulted several\r\nfriends who have read the Mahabharata thoroughly. The grammatical\r\nstructure is easy. The only difficulty consists in the second half of the\r\nsloka. The meaning, however, I have given is consistent with the tenor of\r\nBhishma's advice.\r\n\r\n22. Indicating the unobstructed completion of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n23. The word tirtha here means, as Nilakantha rightly explains spies and\r\nnot holy spots.\r\n\r\n24. Satram is explained by Nilakantha to mean here 'false disguise.' I\r\nthink, however, such an interpretation to be far-fetched. It evidently\r\nmeans 'forest',--the use of 'pravisteshu' in connection with it almost\r\nsettles the point.\r\n\r\n25. This sloka is not correctly printed in any of the texts that I have\r\nseen. The reading that I adopt is that the second word is the participle\r\nof the root budh and not the instrumental of budhi; the last word again\r\nof the second line is a compound of valavatsu and avaleshu instead of (as\r\nprinted in many books) valavatswavaleshu. Any other reading would\r\ncertainly be incorrect. I have not consulted the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n26. Bhagasas lit., each in its proper place. It may also mean, 'according\r\nto their respective division.'\r\n\r\n27. Kalyana-patalam is explained by Nilakantha to mean suvarna\r\npattachchaditam.\r\n\r\n28. One of the generals of Virata.\r\n\r\n29. Some differences of reading are noticeable here, for Yasaswinau some\r\ntexts read Manaswinau, and for Vahusamravdhau-Vahusanrambhat; and for\r\nNakha-naki--Ratha-rathi.\r\n\r\n30. Some texts read Ghanabiva for Ghanarva. The latter is unquestionably\r\nbetter in form.\r\n\r\n31. The word in the original is Muhurta equal to 48 minutes. Nilakantha\r\npoints out very ingeniously that the night being the seventh of the dark\r\nfortnight, the moon would not rise till after 14 Dandas from the hour of\r\nsunset, a Danda being equal to 24 minutes. A Muhurta, therefore implies\r\nnot 48 minutes exactly, but some time.\r\n\r\n32. Some Vikshyainam, Nilakantha explains Sama as a word spoken by Bhima\r\nfor assuring the captive Virata, and Vikshya as 'assuring' or 'consoling\r\nby a glance.' Perhaps this is right.\r\n\r\n33. The adjective Bhima-sankasas as explained by Nilakantha is in this\r\nsense, quoting the celebrated simile of Valmiki.\r\n\r\n34. To understand the comparison would require in the reader a knowledge\r\nof the mechanism of the Indian Vina. Briefly, the Vina consists of a\r\nbamboo of about cubits attached to two gourds towards its ends. Along the\r\nbamboo which serves the purpose of a finger-board, is the main chord and\r\nseveral thinner wires. All these pass over a number of frets, two and a\r\nhalf heptachords, representing the total compass of the instrument. The\r\nwires rest towards their ends on two pieces of ivory called Upadhanas in\r\nSanskrit or Swaris in Urdu.\r\n\r\n35. Some read kaniasi for vaviasi. Both words are the same, and mean the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\n36. Vedi-Vilagna madhya--Vedi in this connection means a wasp and not, as\r\nexplained by Mallinatha in his commentary of the Kumarasambhava, a\r\nsacrificial platform. I would remark in passing that many of the most\r\npoetic and striking adjectives in both the Raghu and the Kumarasambhava\r\nof Kalidasa are borrowed unblushingly from the Ramayana and the\r\nMahabharata.\r\n\r\n37. Padma patrabha-nibha may also mean 'of the splendour of the gem\r\ncalled Marakata.' Nilakantha, however, shows that this would militate\r\nagainst the adjective Kankojwalatwacham below.\r\n\r\n38. The princess being of the complexion of burnished gold and Arjuna\r\ndark as a mass of clouds, the comparison is exceedingly appropriate. The\r\nVaishnava poets of Bengal never tire of this simile in speaking of Radha\r\nand Krishna in the groves of Vrindavana.\r\n\r\n39. The words in the original is pranayam, lit., love. Nilakantha,\r\nhowever, explains it as meaning modesty, humility. I think, Nilakantha is\r\nright. The relations between Arjuna and the princess were like those\r\nbetween father and daughter.\r\n\r\n40. This sloka is not correctly printed in any of the texts that I have\r\nseen. The Burdwan Pandits read tat-samim. This I think, is correct, but\r\nthen asasada in the singular when the other verbs are all dual seems to\r\nbe correct. The poet must have used some other verb in the dual for\r\nasasada.\r\n\r\n41. Some texts read Diptasya for Diptayam.\r\n\r\n42. This sloka does not occur in every text. This is a typical\r\nillustration of the round about way, frequently adopted by Sanskrit\r\nwriters, of expressing a simple truth. The excuse in the present instance\r\nconsists in Drona's unwillingness to identify the solitary hero with\r\nArjuna, in the midst of all his hearers. Nadiji is an exclamation\r\nreferring to Bhishma, the son of the river Ganga. Lankesa-vanari-ketu is\r\nsimply 'ape-bannered,' or as rendered in the text, having the devastator\r\nof the gardens of Lanka's lord for the sign of his banner. Nagahvaya is\r\n'named after tree' for Arjuna is the name of an Indian tree. Nagri-sunu\r\nis 'Indra's son',--Indra being the foe of mountain, for formerly it was\r\nhe who cut off the wings of all mountains and compelled them to be\r\nstationary. He failed only in the case of Mainaka, the son of Himavat.\r\n\r\n43. Indian insects of a particular kind.\r\n\r\n44. Most editions read chapas which is evidently wrong. The correct\r\nreading is avapas, meaning quiver. The Burdwan Pandits give this latter\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n45. Some read chandrargha-darsanas. The correct reading is\r\nchandrardha-darsanas.\r\n\r\n46. Most editions read hema-punkha and silasita in the instrumental\r\nplural; the correct reading is their nominative plural forms.\r\n\r\n47. Sayaka means here, as explained by Nilakantha, a sword, and not a\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\n48. From the colour of his steeds.\r\n\r\n49. Nilakantha spends much learning and ingenuity in making out that\r\nsixty-five years in this connection means thirty-two years of ordinary\r\nhuman computation.\r\n\r\n50. Some texts read,--'One large meteor fell.'\r\n\r\n51. In some editions read,--Bharata dwijam, and Maha-hardam for\r\nmaha-drumam. The meaning would then be,--'The banners (of the hostile\r\narmy) began to tremble in the sky, and large lakes were agitated.\"\r\n\r\n52. Some texts read Maharatham (incorrectly) for hiranmayan. Indeed,\r\nMaharatham would give no meaning in this connection. The incomplete\r\nedition of the Roy Press under the auspices of the Principal of the\r\nCalcutta Sanskrit College abounds with such incorrect readings and\r\nmisprints.\r\n\r\n53. The Roy Press edition adds here a line which looks very much like an\r\ninterpolation.\r\n\r\n54. The true reading is Acharya in the dual number, meaning Drona and\r\nKripa. Some texts read the word in the singular form. Nilakantha notices\r\nboth these reading, but prefers the dual to the singular.\r\n\r\n55. The meaning is rather doubtful. Duryodhana seems to say that 'the\r\nhostile appearance of Arjuna has been an act of imprudence on his part.\r\nThe Pandavas, after the expiry of the thirteenth year, would claim their\r\nkingdom. I, Duryodhana, may or may not accede to their demand. When,\r\ntherefore, it was not certain that Arjuna would be refused by me, his\r\nhostile appearance is unwise. He has come sure of victory, but he may yet\r\nbe defeated.'\r\n\r\n56. The sense seems to be that when moralists even are puzzled in judging\r\nof the propriety or otherwise of their acts, it can easily be imagined\r\nthat the Pandavas, however virtuous, have, in the matter of this their\r\nappearance, acted wrongly, for, after all, the thirteenth year may not\r\nhave really been over as believed by them. Or, it may mean, that as\r\nregards our presence here, we have not acted imprudently when even\r\nmoralists cannot always arrive at right conclusion. It seems that for\r\nthis Duryodhana proceeds to justify that presence in the following\r\nsentences"
