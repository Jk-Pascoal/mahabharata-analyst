      "content": "(Jamvu-khanda Nirmana Parva)\r\n\r\nOM! HAVING BOWED down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of male\r\nbeings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word 'Jaya' be\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said,--\"How did those heroes, the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the\r\nSomakas, and the high-souled kings assembled together from various\r\ncountries, fight?\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"Listen thou, O lord of the earth, how those\r\nheroes,--the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas,--fought on the sacred\r\nplain of the Kurukshetra.[1] Entering Kurukshetra, the Pandavas endued\r\nwith great might, along with the Somakas, advanced, desirous of victory,\r\nagainst the Kauravas. Accomplished in the study of the Vedas, all (of\r\nthem) took great delight in battle. Expectant of success in battle, with\r\ntheir troops (they) faced the fight. Approaching the army of\r\nDhritarashtra's son, those (warriors) invincible in battle[2] stationed\r\nthemselves with their troops on the western part (of the plain), their\r\nfaces turned towards the east. Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, caused\r\ntents by thousands to be set up according to rule, beyond the region\r\ncalled Samantapanchaka. The whole earth seemed then to be empty, divested\r\nof horses and men, destitute of cars and elephants, and with only the\r\nchildren and the old left (at home). From the whole area of Jamvudwipa\r\nover which the sun sheds his rays,[3] was collected that force, O best of\r\nkings. Men of all races,[4] assembled together, occupied an area\r\nextending for many Yojanas over districts, rivers, hills, and woods. That\r\nbull among men, king Yudhishthira, ordered excellent food and other\r\narticles of enjoyment for all of them along with their animals. And\r\nYudhishthira fixed diverse watch-words for them; so that one saying this\r\nshould be known as belonging to the Pandavas. And that descendant of\r\nKuru's race also settled names and badges for all of them for recognition\r\nduring time of battle.\r\n\r\n\"Beholding the standard-top of Pritha's son, the high-souled son of\r\nDhritarashtra, with a white umbrella held over his head, in the midst of\r\na thousand elephants, and surrounded by his century of brothers, began\r\nwith all the kings (on his side) to array his troops against the son of\r\nPandu. Seeing Duryodhana, the Panchalas who took delight in battle, were\r\nfilled with joy and blew their loud-sounding conches and cymbals of sweet\r\nsounds. Beholding those troops so delighted, Pandu's son and Vasudeva of\r\ngreat energy had their hearts filled with joy. And those tigers among\r\nmen, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, seated on one car, having felt great joy,\r\nboth blew their celestial conches. And hearing the blare of Gigantea and\r\nthe loud blast of Theodotes belonging unto the two, the combatants\r\nejected urine and excreta. As other animals are filled with fear on\r\nhearing the voice of the roaring lion, even so became that force upon\r\nhearing those blasts. A frightful dust arose and nothing could be seen,\r\nfor the sun himself, suddenly enveloped by it, seemed to have set.[5] A\r\nblack cloud poured a shower of flesh and blood over the troops all\r\naround. All this seemed extraordinary. A wind rose there, bearing along\r\nthe earth myriads of stony nodules, and afflicting therewith the\r\ncombatants by hundreds and thousands. (For all that), O monarch, both\r\narmies, filled with joy, stood addrest for battle, on Kurukshetra like\r\ntwo agitated oceans. Indeed, that encounter of the two armies was highly\r\nwonderful, like that of two oceans when the end of the Yuga is arrived.\r\nThe whole earth was empty, having only the children and the old left (at\r\nhome), in consequence of that large army mustered by the Kauravas.[6]\r\nThen the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas made certain covenants, and\r\nsettled the rules, O bull of Bharata's race, regarding the different\r\nkinds of combat. Persons equally circumstanced must encounter each other,\r\nfighting fairly. And if having fought fairly the combatants withdraw\r\n(without fear of molestation), even that would be gratifying to us. Those\r\nwho engaged in contests of words should be fought against with words.\r\nThose that left the ranks should never be slain.[7] A car-warrior should\r\nhave a car-warrior for his antagonist; he on the neck of an elephant\r\nshould have a similar combatant for his foe; a horse should be met by a\r\nhorse, and a foot-soldier, O Bharata; should be met by a foot-soldier.\r\nGuided by considerations of fitness, willingness, daring and might, one\r\nshould strike another, giving notice. No one should strike another that\r\nis unprepared[8] or panic-struck. One engaged with another, one seeking\r\nquarter, one retreating, one whose weapon is rendered unfit, uncased in\r\nmail, should never be struck. Car-drivers, animals (yoked to cars or\r\ncarrying weapons) men engaged in the transport of weapons,[9] players on\r\ndrums and blowers of conches should never be struck. Having made these\r\ncovenants, the Kurus, and the Pandavas, and the Somakas wondered much,\r\ngazing at each other. And having stationed (their forces thus), those\r\nbulls among men, those high-souled ones, with their troops, became glad\r\nat heart, their joy being reflected on their countenances.\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said,--\"Seeing then the two armies (standing) on the east\r\nand the west for the fierce battle that was impending, the holy Rishi\r\nVyasa, the son of Satyavati, that foremost of all persons acquainted with\r\nthe Vedas, that grandsire of the Bharatas, conversant with the past, the\r\npresent, and the future, and beholding everything as if it were present\r\nbefore his eyes, said these words in private unto the royal son of\r\nVichitravirya who was then distressed and giving way to sorrow,\r\nreflecting on the evil policy of his sons.\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said,--'O king, thy sons and the other monarchs have their hour\r\narrived.[10] Mustered in battle they will kill one another. O Bharata,\r\ntheir hour having come, they will all perish. Bearing in mind the changes\r\nbrought on by time, do not yield thy heart to grief. O king, if thou wish\r\nto see them (fighting) in battle, I will, O son, grant thee vision.\r\nBehold the battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said,--'O best of regenerate Rishi, I like not to behold\r\nthe slaughter of kinsmen. I shall, however, through thy potency hear of\r\nthis battle minutely.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued.--\"Upon his not wishing to see the battle but\r\nwishing to hear of it, Vyasa, that lord of boons, gave a boon to Sanjaya.\r\n(And addressing Dhritarashtra he said),--'This Sanjaya, O king, will\r\ndescribe the battle to thee. Nothing in the whole battle will be beyond\r\nthis one's eyes.' Endued, O king with celestial vision, Sanjaya will\r\nnarrate the battle to thee. He will have knowledge of everything.\r\nManifest or concealed, (happening) by day or by night, even that which is\r\nthought of in the mind, Sanjaya shall know everything. Weapons will not\r\ncut him and exertion will not fatigue him. This son of Gavalgani will\r\ncome out of the battle with life. As regards myself, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, the fame of these Kurus, as also of all the Pandavas, I will\r\nspread. Do not grieve. This is destiny, O tiger among men. It behoveth\r\nthee not to give way to grief. It is not capable of being prevented. As\r\nregards victory, it is there where righteousness is.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"That highly-blessed and holy grandsire of the\r\nKurus, having said so, once more addressed Dhritarashtra and\r\nsaid,--'Great will the slaughter be, O monarch, in this battle. I see\r\nhere also (numerous) omens indicative of terror. Hawks and vultures, and\r\ncrows and herons, together with cranes, are alighting on the tops of\r\ntrees and gathering in flocks. These birds, delighted at the prospect of\r\nbattle, are looking down (on the field) before them. Carnivorous beasts\r\nwill feed on the flesh of elephants and steeds. Fierce herons, foreboding\r\nterror, and uttering merciless cries, are wheeling across the centre\r\ntowards the southern region. In both the twilights, prior and posterior,\r\nI daily behold, O Bharata, the sun during his rising and setting to be\r\ncovered by headless trunks. Tri-coloured clouds with their extremities\r\nwhite and red and necks black, charged with lightning, and resembling\r\nmaces (in figure) envelope the sun in both twilights. I have seen the\r\nsun, the moon, and the stars to be all blazing. No difference in their\r\naspect is to be noted in the evening. I have seen this all day and all\r\nnight. All this forbodes fear. On even the fifteenth night of the\r\nlighted-fortnight in (the month of) Kartika, the moon, divested of\r\nsplendour, became invisible, or of the hue of fire, the firmament being\r\nof the hue of the lotus. Many heroic lords of earth, kings and princes,\r\nendued with great bravery and possessed of arms resembling maces, will be\r\nslain and sleep lying down on the earth. Daily I notice in the sky during\r\nnight time the fierce cries of battling boars and cats.[11] The images of\r\ngods and goddesses sometimes laugh, sometimes tremble, and sometimes\r\nagain these vomit blood through their mouths and sometimes they sweat and\r\nsometimes fall down. O monarch! drums, without being beaten, give sounds,\r\nand the great cars of Kshatriyas move without (being drawn by) animals\r\nyoked to them. Kokilas, wood-peckers, jaws, water-cocks, parrots, crows,\r\nand peacocks, utter terrible cries. Here and there, cavalry soldiers,\r\ncased in mail, armed with weapons, send forth fierce shouts. At sun-rise\r\nflights of insects, by hundreds are seen. In both twilights, the cardinal\r\nquarters seem to be ablaze, and the clouds, O Bharata, shower dust and\r\nflesh. She, O king, who is celebrated over the three worlds and is\r\napplauded by the righteous, even that (constellation) Arundhati keepeth\r\n(her lord) Vasistha on her back. The planet Sani also, O king, appeareth\r\nafflicting (the constellation) Rohini. The sign of the deer in the Moon\r\nhath deviated from its usual position. A great terror is indicated. Even\r\nthough the sky is cloudless, a terrible roar is heard there. The animals\r\nare all weeping and their tears are falling fast.'\""

      "content": "\"Vyasa said,--'Asses are taking births in kine. Some are having sexual\r\npleasure with mothers. The trees in the forests are exhibiting\r\nunseasonable flowers and fruits. Women quick with child, and even those\r\nthat are not so, are giving birth to monsters. Carnivorous beasts,\r\nmingling with (carnivorous) birds, are feeding together. Ill-omened\r\nbeasts, some having three horns, some with four eyes, some with five\r\nlegs, some with two sexual organs, some with two heads, some with two\r\ntails, some having fierce teeth, are being born, and with mouths wide\r\nopen are uttering unholy cries. Horses with three legs, furnished with\r\ncrests, having four teeth, and endued with horns, are also being born. O\r\nking! in thy city is also seen that the wives of many utterers of Brahma\r\nare bringing forth Garudas and peacocks. The mare is bringing forth the\r\ncow-calf and the bitch is bringing forth, O king, jackals and cocks, and\r\nantelopes and parrots are all uttering inauspicious cries.[12] Certain\r\nwomen are bringing forth four or five daughters (at a time), and these as\r\nsoon as they are born, dance and sing and laugh. The members of the\r\nlowest orders are laughing and dancing and singing, and thus indicating\r\ndireful consequences. Infants, as if urged by death, are drawing armed\r\nimages, and are running against one another, armed with clubs, and\r\ndesirous of battle are also breaking down the towns (they erect in\r\nsport). Lotuses of different kinds and lilies are growing on trees.\r\nStrong winds are blowing fiercely and the dust ceaseth not. The earth is\r\nfrequently trembling, and Rahu approacheth towards the sun. The white\r\nplanet (Ketu) stayeth, having passed beyond the constellation Chitra. All\r\nthis particularly bodeth the destruction of the Kurus. A fierce comet\r\nriseth, afflicting the constellation Pusya. This great planet will cause\r\nfrightful mischief to both the armies. Mars wheeleth towards Magha and\r\nVrihaspati (Jupiter) towards Sravana. The Sun's offspring (Sani)\r\napproaching towards the constellation Bhaga, afflicteth it. The planet\r\nSukra, ascending towards Purva Bhadra, shineth brilliantly, and wheeling\r\ntowards the Uttara Bhadra, looketh towards it, having effected a junction\r\n(with a smaller planet). The white planet (Ketu), blazing up like fire\r\nmixed with smoke, stayeth, having attacked the bright constellation\r\nJeshtha that is sacred to Indra. The constellation Dhruva, blazing\r\nfiercely, wheeleth towards the right. Both the Moon and the Sun are\r\nafflicting Rohini. The fierce planet (Rahu) hath taken up its position\r\nbetween the constellations Chitra and Swati.[13] The red-bodied (Mars)\r\npossessed of the effulgence of fire, wheeling circuitously, stayeth in a\r\nline with the constellation Sravana over-ridden by Vrihaspati. The earth\r\nthat produceth particular crops at particular seasons is now covered with\r\nthe crops of every season.[14] Every barley-stalk is graced with five\r\nears, and every paddy-stalk with a hundred. They that are the best of\r\ncreatures in the worlds and upon whom depends the universe, viz., kine,\r\nwhen milked after the calves have their suck, yield only blood. Radiant\r\nrays of light emanate from bows, and swords blaze forth brilliantly. It\r\nis evident that the weapons behold (before them) the battle, as if it\r\nwere already arrived. The hue of weapons and the water, as also of coats\r\nof mail and standards, is like that of fire. A great slaughter will take\r\nplace. In this battle,[15] O Bharata, of the Kurus with the Pandavas, the\r\nearth, O monarch, will be a river of blood with the standards (of\r\nwarriors) as its rafts. Animals and birds on all sides, with mouths\r\nblazing like fire, uttering fierce cries, and displaying these evil\r\nomens, are foreboding terrible consequences. A (fierce) bird with but one\r\nwing, one eye, and one leg, hovering over the sky in the night, screameth\r\nfrightfully in wrath, as if for making the hearers vomit blood? It\r\nseemeth, O great king, that all weapons are now blazing with radiance.\r\nThe effulgence of the constellation known by the name of the seven\r\nhigh-souled Rishis, hath been dimmed. Those two blazing planets, viz.,\r\nVrihaspati and Sani, having approached the constellation called Visakha,\r\nhave become stationary there for a whole year. Three lunations twice\r\nmeeting together in course of the same lunar fortnight, the duration of\r\nthe latter is shortened by two days.[16] On the thirteenth day therefore,\r\nfrom the first lunation, according as it is the day of the full moon or\r\nthe new moon, the moon and the sun are afflicted by Rahu. Such strange\r\neclipses, both lunar and solar, forebode a great slaughter.[17] All the\r\nquarters of the earth, being overwhelmed by showers of dust, look\r\ninauspicious. Fierce clouds, portentous of danger, drop bloody showers\r\nduring the night. Rahu of fierce deeds is also, O monarch, afflicting the\r\nconstellation Kirtika. Rough winds, portending fierce danger, are\r\nconstantly blowing. All these beget a war characterised by many sad\r\nincidents.[18] The constellations are divided into three classes. Upon\r\none or another of each class, a planet of evil omen has shed its\r\ninfluence, foreboding terrible dangers.[19] A lunar fortnight had\r\nhitherto consisted of fourteen days, or fifteen days (as usual), or\r\nsixteen days. This, however, I never knew that the day of new-moon would\r\nbe on the thirteenth day from the first lunation, or the day of full-moon\r\non the thirteenth day from the same. And yet in course of the same month\r\nboth the Moon and the Sun have undergone eclipses on the thirteenth days\r\nfrom the day of the first lunation.[20] The Sun and the Moon therefore,\r\nby undergoing eclipses on unusual days,[21] will cause a great slaughter\r\nof the creatures of the earth. Indeed, Rakshasas, though drinking blood\r\nby mouthful, will yet not be satiated. The great rivers are flowing in\r\nopposite directions. The waters of rivers have become bloody. The wells,\r\nfoaming up, are bellowing like bulls.[22] Meteors, effulgent like Indra's\r\nthunder-bolt, fall with loud hisses.[23] When this night passeth away,\r\nevil consequences will overtake you. People, for meeting together, coming\r\nout of their houses with lighted brands, have still to encounter a thick\r\ngloom all round.[24] Great Rishis have said that in view of such\r\ncircumstances the earth drinks the blood of thousands of kings. From the\r\nmountains of Kailasa and Mandara and Himavat thousands of explosions are\r\nheard and thousands of summits are tumbling down. In consequence of the\r\nEarth's trembling, each of the four oceans having swelled greatly, seems\r\nready to transgress its continents for afflicting the Earth.[25] Fierce\r\nwinds charged with pointed pebbles are blowing, crushing mighty trees. In\r\nvillages and towns trees, ordinary and sacred, are falling down, crushed\r\nby mighty winds and struck by lightning. The (sacrificial) fire, when\r\nBrahmanas pour libations on it, becomes blue, or red, or yellow. Its\r\nflames bend towards the left, yielding a bad scent, accompanied by loud\r\nreports. Touch, smell, and taste have, O monarch, become what they were\r\nnot. The standards (of warriors), repeatedly trembling are emitting\r\nsmoke. Drums and cymbals are throwing off showers of coal-dust. And from\r\nthe tops of tall trees all around, crows, wheeling in circles from the\r\nleft, are uttering fierce cries. All of them again are uttering frightful\r\ncries of pakka, pakka and are perching upon the tops of standards for the\r\ndestruction of the kings. Vicious elephants, trembling all over, are\r\nrunning hither and thither, urinating and ejecting excreta. The horses\r\nare all melancholy, while the elephants are resorting to the water.\r\nHearing all this, let that be done which is suitable, so that, O Bharata,\r\nthe world may not be depopulated.'\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of his father,\r\nDhritarashtra said,--'I think all this hath been ordained of old. A great\r\nslaughter of human beings will take place. If the kings die in battle\r\nobserving the duties of the Kshatriya order, they will then, attaining to\r\nthe regions reserved for heroes, obtain only happiness. These tigers\r\namong men, casting away their lives in great battle, will win fame in\r\nthis and great bliss for ever in the next world.'\r\n\r\nVaisampayana continued,--\"O best of kings, thus addressed by his son\r\nDhritarashtra, that prince of poets, the Muni (Vyasa) concentrated his\r\nmind in supreme Yoga. Having contemplated for only a short space of time,\r\nVyasa once more said,--'Without doubt, O king of kings, it is Time that\r\ndestroyeth the universe. It is Time also that createth the worlds. There\r\nis nothing here that is eternal. Show the path of righteousness to the\r\nKurus, to thy kinsmen, relatives, and friends. Thou art competent to\r\nrestrain them. The slaughter of kinsmen hath been said to be sinful. Do\r\nnot do that which is disagreeable to me. O king, Death himself hath been\r\nborn in the shape of thy son. Slaughter is never applauded in the Vedas.\r\nIt can never be beneficial. The usages of one's race are as one's own\r\nbody. Those usages slay him that destroyeth them. For the destruction of\r\nthis race and of those kings of the earth it is Time that maketh thee\r\ndeviate into the wrong path like one in distress, although thou art\r\ncompetent (to walk along the path of righteousness). O king, in the shape\r\nof thy kingdom hath calamity come to thee. Thy virtue is sustaining a\r\nvery great diminution.[26] Show what righteousness is unto thy sons. O\r\nthou that art invincible, of what value is that kingdom to thee which\r\nbringeth sin to thee? Take care of thy good name, thy virtue, and thy\r\nfame. Thou wilt then win heaven. Let the Pandavas have their kingdom, and\r\nlet the Kauravas have peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"While that best of Brahmanas was saying these words in a sorrowful tone,\r\nDhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, accomplished in speech, once more\r\naddressed him, saying.---'My knowledge of life and death is similar to\r\nthine. The truth is known to me as regards these. Man, however, in what\r\nconcerns his own interests, is deprived of judgment. O sire, know me to\r\nbe one who is an ordinary person. Of immeasurable power thou art. I pray\r\nthee to extend thine towards us. Of soul under complete control, thou art\r\nour refuge and instructor. My sons are not obedient to me, O great Rishi.\r\nMy understanding too is not inclined to commit sin.[27] Thou art the\r\ncause of the fame, the achievements, and the inclination for virtue, of\r\nthe Bharatas. Thou art the reverend grandsire of both the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said,--'O royal son of Vichitravirya, tell me freely what is in\r\nthy mind. I will remove thy doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said,--'O holy one, I desire to hear from thee of all\r\nthose indications that happen unto those that become victorious in\r\nbattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said,--'The (sacred) fire assumes a cheerful radiance. Its light\r\nascends upwards. Its flame bends towards the right. It blazes up without\r\nbeing smoky. The libations poured on it yield a fragrant scent. It is\r\nsaid that these are the indications of future success. The conches and\r\ncymbals yield sounds that are deep and loud. The Sun as well as the Moon\r\ngives pure rays. It is said that these are the indications of future\r\nsuccess. Crows, whether stationary or on their wings, utter cries that\r\nare agreeable. They again that are behind, urge the warriors to advance;\r\nwhile they that are ahead, forbid all advance.[28] Where vultures, swans,\r\nparrots, cranes, and wood-peckers utter delightful cries, and wheel\r\ntowards the right, the Brahmanas say that their victory in battle is\r\ncertain. They whose divisions, in consequence of ornaments, coats of\r\nmail, and standards, or the melodious neigh of their steeds, become\r\nresplendent and incapable of being gazed at, always conquer their foes.\r\nThey who utter cheerful shouts, those warriors, O Bharata, whose energies\r\nare not damped and whose garlands do not fade, always cross the ocean of\r\nbattle. They who utter cheerful shouts having penetrated into the\r\ndivisions of the foe, who utter even kind words,[29] to the enemy, and\r\nwho, before striking, forewarn the foe, win victory. The objects of\r\nhearing, vision, taste, touch, and smell, without undergoing any change\r\nfor the worse, become auspicious. This also is another indication of a\r\nvictorious army, viz., there is joy among the combatants at all time.\r\nThis also is another indication of success, viz. the winds that blow, the\r\nclouds, and the birds, all become favourable; while the clouds (so\r\nfavourable) and the rain-bows drop beneficial showers. These, O king, are\r\nthe indications of armies to be crowned with victory, while O monarch,\r\nall these become otherwise in the case of those that are about to be\r\ndestroyed. Whether the army be small or large, cheerfulness, as an\r\nattribute of the combatants, is said to be a certain indication of\r\nvictory. One soldier, struck with panic, can cause even a large army to\r\ntake fright and fly. And when an army, struck with panic, takes to\r\nflight, it causes even heroic warriors to take fright. If a large army is\r\nonce broken and put to rout, it cannot like a herd of deer disordered in\r\nfright or a mighty current of water be easily checked. If a large army is\r\nonce routed, it is incapable of being rallied; on the other hand,\r\nbeholding it broken, even those well-skilled in battle, O Bharata, become\r\nheartless. Beholding soldiers struck with fear and flying, the panic\r\nspreads in other directions, and soon, O king, the whole army is broken\r\nand flies in all directions. And when an army is routed, even brave\r\nleaders, O king, at the head of large divisions consisting of the four\r\nkinds of forces, are incapable of rallying them. An intelligent man,\r\nalways exerting himself with activity, should strive (to win success) by\r\nthe aid of means. It is said that that success which is won by\r\nnegotiation and other means is the very best. That which is achieved by\r\nproducing disunion (among the foe) is indifferent. While that success, O\r\nking, which is won by battle, is the worst. In battle are many evils, the\r\ninitial one, as it is said, being slaughter. Even fifty brave men who\r\nknow one another, who are underpressed, who are free from family ties,\r\nand who are firmly resolved, can crush a large army. Even five, six,\r\nseven men, who are unretreating, win victory. Vinata's son Garuda, O\r\nBharata, beholding even a large concourse of birds, asketh not the aid of\r\nmany followers (to vanquish them). The strength in number, therefore of\r\nan army is not always the cause of victory. Victory is uncertain. It\r\ndepends on chance. Even they that become victorious have to sustain\r\nloss.'\""

      "content": "Vaisampayana said,--\"Having said these words unto Dhritarashtra, Vyasa\r\ntook his departure. And Dhritarashtra also, having heard those words,\r\nbegan to reflect in silence. And having reflected for only a short space\r\nof time, he began to sigh repeatedly. And, soon, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, the king asked Sanjaya of soul worthy of praise,--saying,--'O\r\nSanjaya, these kings, these lords of earth, so brave and taking delight\r\nin battle, are for smiting one another with weapons of diverse kinds,\r\nbeing prepared to lay down their very lives for the sake of earth.\r\nIncapable of being restrained, they are, indeed, smiting one another for\r\nincreasing the population of Yama's domain. Desirous of prosperity\r\nconnected with the possession of earth they are incapable of bearing one\r\nanother. I, therefore, think that earth must be possessed of many\r\nattributes. Tell me all these, O Sanjaya, Many thousands, many millions,\r\nmany tens of millions, many hundreds of millions, heroic men have come\r\ntogether at Kurujangala. I desire to hear, O Sanjaya, with accurate\r\ndetails, about the situation and dimensions of those countries and cities\r\nfrom which they have come. Through the potency of that regenerate Rishi\r\nVyasa of immeasurable energy, thou art endued with the lamp of celestial\r\nperception and the eye of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--'O thou of great wisdom, I will recount to thee the\r\nmerits of earth according to my knowledge. Behold them with thy eye of\r\nwisdom. I bow to thee, O bull of Bharata's race. Creatures in this world\r\nare of two kinds, mobile and immobile. Mobile creatures are of three\r\nkinds according to their birth, viz., oviparous, viviparous, and those\r\nengendered by heat and damp. Of mobile creatures, O king, the foremost\r\nare certainly those called viviparous. Of viviparous creatures the\r\nforemost are men and animals. Animals, O king, of diverse forms, are of\r\nfourteen species. Seven have their abodes in the woods, and seven of\r\nthese are domestic. Lions, tigers, boars, buffaloes, and elephants as\r\nalso bears and apes, are, O king, regarded as wild. Kine, goats, sheep,\r\nmen, horses, mules, and asses,--these seven amongst animals are reckoned\r\nas domestic by the learned. These fourteen, O king, complete the tale of\r\ndomestic and wild animals, mentioned, O lord of earth, in the Vedas, and\r\non which the sacrifices rest. Of creatures that are domestic, men are\r\nforemost, while lions are the foremost of those that have their abode in\r\nthe woods. All creatures support their life by living upon one another.\r\nVegetables are said to be immobile, and they are of four species viz.,\r\ntrees, shrubs, creepers, creeping plants existing for only a year, and\r\nall stemless plants of the grass species.[30] Of mobile and immobile\r\ncreatures, there are thus one less twenty; and as regards their universal\r\nconstituents, there are five. Twenty-four in all, these are described as\r\nGayatri (Brahma) as is well-known to all.[31] He who knows these truly to\r\nbe the sacred Gayatri possessed of every virtue, is not liable, O best of\r\nthe Bharatas, to destruction in this world. Everything springeth from the\r\nearth and everything, when destroyed, mergeth into the Earth. The Earth\r\nis the stay and refuge of all creatures, and the Earth is eternal. He\r\nthat hath the Earth, hath the entire universe with its mobile and\r\nimmobile population. It is for this that longing for (the possession of\r\nthe) Earth, kings slay one another.'\""

These elements, are space, air, fire, water, and\r\nearth. Their (respective) attributes are sound, touch, vision, taste, and\r\nscent. Every one of these elements possesses (in addition to what is\r\nespecially its own) the attribute or attributes of that or those coming\r\nbefore it. The earth, therefore, is the foremost of them all, possessing\r\nas it does the attributes of all the other four, besides what is\r\nspecially its own, as said by Rishis acquainted with truth.[32] There are\r\nfour attributes, O king, in water. Scent does not exist in it. Fire has\r\nthree attributes viz., sound, touch, and vision. Sound and touch belong\r\nto air, while space has sound alone. These five attributes, O king, exist\r\n(in this way) in the five principal elements depending on which all\r\ncreatures in the universe exist. They exist separately and independently\r\nwhen there is homogeneity in the universe.[33] When, however, these do\r\nnot exist in their natural state but with one another, then creatures\r\nspring into life, furnished with bodies. This is never otherwise. The\r\nelements are destroyed, in the order of the one succeeding, merging into\r\nthe one that proceeds; and they spring also into existence, one arising\r\nfrom the one before it.[34] All of these are immeasurable, their forms\r\nbeing Brahma itself. In the universe are seen creatures consisting of the\r\nfive elements. Men endeavour to ascertain their proportions by exercising\r\ntheir reason. Those matters, however, that are inconceivable, should\r\nnever be sought to be solved by reason. That which is above (human)\r\nnature is an indication of the inconceivable.\r\n\r\n\"'O son of Kuru's race, I will, however, describe to thee the island\r\ncalled Sudarsana. This island, O king, is circular and of the form of a\r\nwheel. It is covered with rivers and other pieces of water and with\r\nmountains looking like masses of clouds, and with cities and many\r\ndelightful provinces. It is also full of trees furnished with flowers and\r\nfruits, and with crops of diverse kinds and other wealth. And it is\r\nsurrounded on all sides with the salt ocean. As a person can see his own\r\nface in a mirror, even so is the island called Sudarsana seen in the\r\nlunar disc. Two of its parts seem to be a peepul tree, while two others\r\nlook like a large hare. It is surrounded on all sides with an assemblage\r\nof every kind of deciduous plants. Besides these portions, the rest is\r\nall water. What remains I will describe to thee shortly. The rest I will\r\nspeak of afterwards. Listen now to this that I describe in brief.[35]\""

Tell us now of the island in detail. Tell us now of\r\nthe dimension of the expanse of land that lies in the portion looking\r\nlike a hare. Thou mayst then speak of the portion resembling peepul tree.\"\r\n\r\nVaisampayana said,--\"Thus addressed by the king, Sanjaya began to say.\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--'Stretching from east to west, are these six mountains\r\nthat are equal[36] and that extend from the eastern to the western ocean.\r\nThey are Himavat, Hemakuta, that best of mountains called Nishadha, Nila\r\nabounding with stones of lapis lazuli, Sweta white as the moon, and the\r\nmountains called Sringavat composed of all kinds of metals.[37] These are\r\nthe six mountains, O king, which are always the resorts of Siddhas and\r\nCharanas. The space lying between each of these measures a thousand\r\nYojanas, and thereon are many delightful kingdoms. And these divisions\r\nare called Varshas, O Bharata. In all those kingdoms reside creatures of\r\ndiverse species. This (the land where we are) is in the Varsha that is\r\ncalled after Bharata. Next to it (northwards) is the Varsha called after\r\nHimavat. The land that is beyond Hemakuta is called Harivarsha, South of\r\nthe Nila range and on the north of the Nishadha is a mountain, O king,\r\ncalled Malyavat that stretches from east to west. Beyond Malyavat\r\nnorthwards is the mountain called Gandhamadana.[38] Between these two\r\n(viz., Malyavat and Gandhamadana) is a globular mountain called Meru made\r\nof gold. Effulgent as the morning sun, it is like fire without smoke.[39]\r\nIt is eighty-four thousand Yojanas high, and, O king, its depth also is\r\neighty-four Yojanas. It standeth bearing the worlds above, below and\r\ntransversely. Besides Meru are situated, O lord, these four islands,\r\nviz., Bhadraswa, and Ketumala, and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata,\r\nand Uttar-Kuru which is the abode of persons who have achieved the merit\r\nof righteousness. The bird Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that\r\nall the birds on Meru were of golden plumage, reflected that he should\r\nleave that mountain inasmuch as there was no difference between the good,\r\nmiddling, and bad birds. The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always\r\ncircumambulates Meru, as also the moon with (his) attendant\r\nconstellation, and the Wind-god too. The mountain, O king, is endued with\r\ncelestial fruits and flowers, and it is covered all over with mansions\r\nmade of furnished gold. There, on that mountain, O king, the celestials,\r\nthe Gandharvas, the Asuras, and the Rakshasas, accompanied by the tribes\r\nof Apsaras, always sport. There Brahman, and Rudra, and also Sakra the\r\nchief of the celestials, assembled together, performed diverse kinds of\r\nsacrifices with plentiful gifts. Tumvuru, and Narada and Viswavasu, and\r\nthe Hahas and the Huhus, repairing thither, adored the foremost of the\r\ncelestials with diverse hymns. The high-souled seven Rishis, and Kasyapa\r\nthe lord of creatures, repair thither, blessed be thou, on every parva\r\nday.[40] Upon the summit of that mountain, Usanas, otherwise called the\r\nPoet, sporteth with the Daityas (his disciples).[41] The jewels and gems\r\n(that we see) and all the mountains abounding in precious stones are of\r\nMeru. Therefrom a fourth part is enjoyed by the holy Kuvera. Only a\r\nsixteenth part of that wealth he giveth unto men. On the northern side of\r\nMeru is a delightful and excellent forest of Karnikaras, covered with the\r\nflowers of every season,[42] and occupying a range of hills. There the\r\nillustrious Pasupati himself, the creator of all things, surrounded by\r\nhis celestial attendants and accompanied by Uma, sporteth bearing a chain\r\nof Karnikara flowers (on his neck) reaching down to his feet, and blazing\r\nwith radiance with his three eyes resembling three risen suns. Him\r\nSiddhas truthful in speech, of excellent vows and austere ascetic\r\npenances, can behold. Indeed, Maheswara is incapable of being seen by\r\npersons of wicked conduct. From the summit of that mountain, like a\r\nstream of milk, O ruler of men, the sacred and auspicious Ganga,\r\notherwise called Bhagirathi, adored by the most righteous, of universal\r\nform and immeasurable and issuing out with terrific noise, falleth with\r\nimpetuous force on the delightful lake of Chandramas.[43] Indeed that\r\nsacred lake, like an ocean, hath been formed by Ganga herself. (While\r\nleaping from the mountains), Ganga, incapable of being supported by even\r\nthe mountains, was held for a hundred thousand years by the bearer of\r\nPinaka  on his head.[44] On the western side of Meru, O king, is\r\nKetumala.[45] And there also is Jamvukhanda. Both are great seats of\r\nhumanity, O king.[46] There, O Bharata, the measure of human life is ten\r\nthousand years. The men are all of a golden complexion, and the women are\r\nlike Apsaras. And all the residents are without sickness, without sorrow,\r\nand always cheerful. The men born there are of the effulgence of melted\r\ngold. On the summits of Gandhamadana, Kuvera the lord of the Guhyakas,\r\nwith many Rakshasas and accompanied by tribes of Apsaras, passeth his\r\ntime in joy. Besides Gandhamadana there are many smaller mountains and\r\nhills. The measure of human life there is eleven thousand years. There, O\r\nking, the men are cheerful, and endued with great energy and great\r\nstrength and the women are all of the complexion of the lotus and highly\r\nbeautiful. Beyond Nila is (the Varsha called) Sweta, beyond Sweta is (the\r\nVarsha called) Hiranyaka. Beyond Hiranyaka is (the Varsha called)\r\nAiravata covered with provinces. The last Varsha in the (extreme) north\r\nand Bharata's Varsha in the (extreme) south are both, O king, of the form\r\nof a bow. These five Varshas (viz., Sweta, Hiranyaka, Elavrita,\r\nHarivarsha, and Haimavat-varsha) are in the middle, of which Elavrita\r\nexists in the very middle of all. Amongst these seven Varshas (the five\r\nalready mentioned and Airavata and Bharata) that which is further north\r\nexcels the one to its immediate south in respect of these attributes,\r\nviz., the period of life, stature, health, righteousness, pleasure, and\r\nprofit. In these Varshas, O Bharata, creatures (though of diverse\r\nspecies) yet, live together. Thus, O king, is Earth covered with\r\nmountains. The huge mountains of Hemakuta are otherwise called Kailasa.\r\nThere, O king, Vaisravana passeth his time in joy with his Guhyakas.\r\nImmediately to the north of Kailasa and near the mountains of Mainaka\r\nthere is a huge and beautiful mountain called Manimaya endued with golden\r\nsummits. Beside this mountain is a large, beautiful, crystal and\r\ndelightful lake called Vindusaras with golden sands (on its beach). There\r\nking Bhagiratha, beholding Ganga (since) called after his own name,\r\nresided for many years. There may be seen innumerable sacrificial stakes\r\nmade of gems, and Chaitya tree made of gold. It was there that he of a\r\nthousand eyes and great fame won (ascetic) success by performing\r\nsacrifices. There the Lord of all creatures, the eternal Creator of all\r\nthe worlds, endued with supreme energy surrounded by his ghostly\r\nattendants, is adored. There Nara and Narayana, Brahman, and Manu, and\r\nSthanu as the fifth, are (ever present). And there the celestial stream\r\nGanga having three currents,[47] issuing out of the region of Brahman,\r\nfirst showed herself, and then dividing herself into seven streams,\r\nbecame Vaswokasara, Nalini, the sin-cleansing Saraswati, Jamvunadi, Sita,\r\nGanga and Sindhu as the seventh. The Supreme Lord hath (himself) made the\r\narrangement with reference to that inconceivable and celestial stream. It\r\nis there that[48] sacrifices have been performed (by gods and Rishis) on\r\na thousand occasions after the end of the Yuga (when creation begins). As\r\nregards the Saraswati, in some parts (of her course) she becometh visible\r\nand in some parts not so. This celestial sevenfold Ganga is widely known\r\nover the three worlds. Rakshasas reside on Himavat, Guhyakas on Hemakuta,\r\nand serpents and Nagas on Nishadha, and ascetics on Gokarna. The Sweta\r\nmountains are said to be the abode of the celestial and the Asuras. The\r\nGandharvas always reside on Nishadhas, and the regenerate Rishis on Nila.\r\nThe mountains of Sringavat also are regarded as the resort of the\r\ncelestials.\r\n\r\n\"'These then, O great king, are the seven Varshas of the world as they\r\nare divided. Diverse creatures, mobile[49] and immobile, are placed in\r\nthem all. Diverse kinds of prosperity, both providential and human, are\r\nnoticeable in them. They are incapable of being counted. Those desirous,\r\nhowever, of their own good believe (all this), I have now told thee of\r\nthat delightful region (of land) of the form of a hare about which thou\r\nhadst asked me. At the extremities of that region are the two Varshas,\r\nviz., one on the north and the other on the south. Those two also have\r\nnow been told to thee. Then again the two islands Naga-dwipa and\r\nKasyapa-dwipa are the two ears of this region of the form of a hare. The\r\nbeautiful mountains of Maleya, O king, having rocks like plates of\r\ncopper, form another (prominent) part of Jamvudwipa that having its shape\r\nresembling a hare.'\""

The trees there bear sweet fruits, and are always covered\r\nwith fruits and flowers. All the flowers (there) are fragrant, and the\r\nfruits of excellent taste. Some of the trees, again, O king, yield fruits\r\naccording to (the) will (of the plucker). There are again some other\r\ntrees, O king, that are called milk-yielding. These always yield milk and\r\nthe six different kinds of food of the taste of Amrita itself. Those\r\ntrees also yield cloths and in their fruits are ornaments (for the use of\r\nman). The entire land abounds with fine golden sands. A portion of the\r\nregion there, extremely delightful, is seen to be possessed of the\r\nradiance of the ruby or diamond, or of the lapis lazuli or other jewels\r\nand gems.[51] All the seasons there are agreeable and nowhere does the\r\nland become miry, O king. The tanks are charming, delicious, and full of\r\ncrystal water. The men born there have dropped from the world of the\r\ncelestials.[52] All are of pure birth and all are extremely handsome in\r\nappearance. There twins (of opposite sexes) are born and the women\r\nresemble Apsaras in beauty. They drink the milk, sweet as Amrita, of\r\nthose milk-yielding trees (already mentioned). And the twins born there\r\n(of opposite sexes) grow up equally. Both possessed of equal beauty, both\r\nendued with similar virtues, and both equally dressed, both grow up in\r\nlove, O monarch, like a couple of chakrabakas. The people of that country\r\nare free from illness and are always cheerful. Ten thousand and ten\r\nhundred years they live, O king, and never abandon one another. A class\r\nof birds called Bharunda, furnished with sharp beaks and possessed of\r\ngreat strength, take them up when dead and throw them into mountain\r\ncaves. I have now described to thee, O king, the Northern Kurus briefly.\r\n\r\n\"I will now describe to thee the eastern side of Meru duly. Of all the\r\nregions there, the foremost, O king, is called Bhadraswa, where there is\r\na large forest of Bhadra-salas, as also a huge tree called Kalamra. This\r\nKalamra, O king, is always graced with fruits and flowers. That tree\r\nagain is a Yojana in height and is adored by Siddhas[53] and the\r\nCharanas. The men there are all of a white complexion, endued with great\r\nenergy, and possessed of great strength. The women are of the complexion\r\nof lilies, very beautiful, and agreeable to sight. Possessed of radiance\r\nof the moon,[54] and white as the moon, their faces are as the full-moon.\r\nTheir bodies again are as cool as the rays of the moon and they are all\r\naccomplished in singing and dancing. The period of human life there, O\r\nbull of the Bharata's race, is ten thousand years. Drinking the juice of\r\nthe Kalamra they continue youthful for ever. On the south of Nila and the\r\nnorth of Nishadha, there is a huge Jamvu tree that is eternal. Adored by\r\nthe Siddhas and Charanas, that sacred tree granteth every wish. After the\r\nname of that tree this division hath ever been called Jamvudwipa. O bull\r\nof Bharata race, a thousand and a hundred Yojanas is the height of that\r\nprince of trees, which touches the very heavens, O king of men. Two\r\nthousand and five hundred cubits measure the circumference of a fruit of\r\nthat tree which bursts when ripe. In falling upon the earth these fruits\r\nmake a loud noise, and then pour out, O king, a silvery juice on the\r\nground. That juice of the Jamvu, becoming, O king, a river, and passing\r\ncircuitously round Meru, cometh to the (region of the) Northern Kurus. If\r\nthe juice of that fruit is quaffed, it conduces to peace of mind. No\r\nthirst is felt ever after, O king. Decrepitude never weakens them. And\r\nthere a species of gold called Jamvunada and used for celestial\r\nornaments, very brilliant and like the complexion of Indragopoka insects,\r\nis produced. The men born there are of the complexion of the morning sun.\r\n\r\n\"'On the summit of Malyavat is always seen, O bull of Bharata's race, the\r\nfire called Samvataka which blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga for the\r\ndestruction of the universe. On Malyavat's summit towards the east are\r\nmany small mountains and Malyavat, O king, measures eleven thousand[55]\r\nYojanas. The men born there are of the complexion of gold. And they are\r\nall fallen from the region of Brahman and are utterers of Brahma. They\r\nundergo the severest of ascetic austerities, and their vital seed is\r\ndrawn up. For the protection of creatures they all enter the sun.\r\nNumbering sixty-six thousand, they proceed in advance of Aruna,\r\nsurrounding the sun. Heated with the sun's rays for sixty-six thousand\r\nyears, they then enter the lunar disc.'\""

Aryans and Mlecchas, O Kauravya,\r\nand many races, O lord, mixed of the two elements, drink the waters of\r\nthe following rivers, viz., magnificent Ganga, Sindhu, and Saraswati; of\r\nGodavari, and Narmada, and the large river called Yamuna; of\r\nDhrishadwati, and Vipapa, and Vipasa and Sthulavaluka; of the river\r\nVetravati, and that other one called Krishna-vena; of Iravati, and\r\nVitasta, and Payosyini, and Devika; of Vedasmrita and Vedavati, and\r\nTridiva, and Ikshumalavi;[59] of Karishini, and Chitravaha, and the river\r\ncalled Chitrasena; of Gomati, and Dhutapada and the large river called\r\nGandaki[60], of Kausiki, and Nischitra, and Kirtya, and Nichita, and\r\nLohatarini;[61] of Rashasi and Satakumbha, and also Sarayu; of\r\nCharmanwati, and Vetravati,[62] and Hastisoma, and Disa; of the river\r\ncalled Saravati, and Venna, and Bhimarathi; of Kaveri, and Chuluka, and\r\nVina, and Satavala; of Nivara, and Mahila, and Suprayoga, O king; of\r\nPavitra, and Kundala, and Rajani, and Puramalini; of Purvabhirama, and\r\nVira, and Bhima, and Oghavati; of Palasini, and Papahara, and Mahendra,\r\nand Patalavati, of Karishini, and Asikni, and the large river Kusachira:\r\nof Makari, and Pravara, and Mena, and Hema, and Dhritavati; of Puravati,\r\nand Anushna, and Saivya, and Kapi, O Bharata; of Sadanira, and Adhrishya,\r\nand the mighty stream Kusadhara; of Sadakanta, and Siva, and Viravati; of\r\nVatsu, and Suvastu, and Kampana with Hiranwati; of Vara, and the mighty\r\nriver Panchami, of Rathachitra, and Jyotiratha, and Viswamitra, and\r\nKapinjala; of Upendra, and Vahula, and Kuchira, and Madhuvahini: of\r\nVinadi, and Pinjala, and Vena, and the great river Pungavena; of Vidisa\r\nand Krishna-vena, and Tamra, and Kapila, of Salu, and Suvama, the\r\nVedaswa, and the mighty river Harisrava; of Sighra, and Pischala, and the\r\nriver Bharadwaji, of the river Kausiki, and Sona, and Chandrama; of\r\nDurgamantrasila, and Brahma-vodhya, and Vrihadvati; of Yaksha, and Rohi,\r\nand Yamvunadi; of Sunasa and Tamasa, and Dasi, and Vasa, and Varuna, and\r\nAsi; of Nila, and Dhrimati, and the mighty river Parnasa; of Pomasi, and\r\nVrishabha, and Brahma-meddhya, and Vrihaddhani.

Earth, if its resources are properly developed according to its\r\nqualities and prowess, is like an ever-yielding[63] cow, from which the\r\nthree-fold fruits of virtue, profit and pleasure, may be milked. Brave\r\nkings conversant with virtue and profit have become covetous of Earth.\r\nEndued with activity, they would even cast away their lives in battle,\r\nfrom hunger of wealth. Earth is certainly the refuge of creatures endued\r\nwith celestial bodies as also of creatures endued with human bodies.[64]\r\nDesirous of enjoying Earth, the kings, O chief of the Bharatas, have\r\nbecome like dogs that snatch meat from one another. Their ambition is\r\nunbounded, knowing no gratification.[65] It is for this that the Kurus\r\nand the Pandavas are striving for possession of Earth, by negotiation,\r\ndisunion, gift, and battle, O Bharata. If Earth be well looked after, it\r\nbecometh the father, mother, children, firmament and heaven, of all\r\ncreatures, O bull among men.'\""

The Yuga that sets in\r\nfirst is Krita. O Lord; after the expiry of Krita comes Treta; after\r\nexpiry of Treta comes Dwapara; and after that last of all, sets in Kali.\r\nFour thousand years, O best of the Kurus, are reckoned as the measure of\r\nlife, O best of kings, in the Krita epoch. Three thousand years is the\r\nperiod in Treta, O ruler of men. At present in Dwapara, persons live on\r\nEarth for two thousand years. In Kali, however, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nthere is no fixed limit of life's measure, in so much that men die while\r\nin the womb, as also soon after birth. In the Krita age, O king, men are\r\nborn and beget children, by hundreds and thousands, that are of great\r\nstrength and great power, endued with the attribute of great wisdom, and\r\npossessed of wealth and handsome features. In that age are born and\r\nbegotten Munis endued with wealth of asceticism, capable of great\r\nexertion, possessed of high souls, and virtuous, and truthful in speech.\r\nThe Kshatriyas also, born in that age are of agreeable features,\r\nable-bodied, possessed of great energy, accomplished in the use of the\r\nbow, highly skilled in battle and exceedingly brave. In the Treta age, O\r\nking, all the Kshatriya kings were emperors ruling from sea to sea. In\r\nTreta are begotten brave Kshatriyas not subject to any one, endued with\r\nlong lives, possessed of heroism, and wielding the bow in battle with\r\ngreat skill. When Dwapara sets in, O king, all the (four) orders born\r\nbecome capable of great exertion, endued with great energy, and desirous\r\nof conquering one another. The men born in Kali, O king, are endued with\r\nlittle energy, highly wrathful, covetous, and untruthful. Jealousy,\r\npride, anger, deception, malice and covetousness, O Bharata, are the\r\nattributes of creatures in the Kali age. The portion that remains, O\r\nking, of this the Dwapara age, is small, O ruler of men. The Varsha known\r\nas Haimavat is superior to Bharatavarsha, while Harivarsha is superior to\r\nHainavatvarsha, in respect of all qualities.'"

Tell me also, O\r\nSanjaya, of the extent of the ocean of Sakadwipa, and Kusadwipa, of\r\nSalmalidwipa and Kraunchadwipa, truly and without leaving anything and\r\ntell me also, O son of Gavalgani, of Rahu and Soma and Surya.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--'There are, O king, many islands, over which the Earth\r\nextended. I will describe to thee, however, only seven islands, and the\r\nmoon, and the sun, and the planet (Rahu), also. The Jamvu mountain, O\r\nking, extends over full eighteen thousand and six hundred Yojanas. The\r\nextent of the salt ocean is said to be twice this. That ocean is covered\r\nwith many kingdoms, and is adorned with gems and corals. It is, besides,\r\ndecked with many mountains that are variegated with metals of diverse\r\nkinds. Thickly peopled by Siddhas and Charanas, the ocean is circular in\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\"I will now tell thee truly of Sakadwipa, O Bharata. Listen to me, O son\r\nof Kuru's race, as I describe it to thee duly. That island, O ruler of\r\nmen, is of twice the extent of Jamvudwipa. And the ocean also, O great\r\nking, is of twice the extent of that island. Indeed, O best of the\r\nBharatas, Sakadwipa is surrounded on all sides by the ocean. The kingdoms\r\nthere are full of righteousness, and the men there never die. How can\r\nfamine take place there? The people are all endued with forgiveness and\r\ngreat energy. I have now, O bull of Bharata's race, given thee duly a\r\nbrief description of Sakadwipa. What else, O king, dost thou wish to\r\nhear?'\"[66]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said,--'Thou hast given me, O Sanjaya, a description of\r\nSakadwipa in brief. O thou that art possessed of great wisdom, tell me\r\nnow everything in detail truly.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--'In that island, O king, there are seven mountains that\r\nare decked with jewels and that are mines of gems, precious stones. There\r\nare many rivers also in that island. Listen to me as I recount their\r\nnames. Everything there, O king, is excellent and delightful, The first\r\nof these mountains is called Meru. It is the abode of the gods, Rishis,\r\nand Gandharvas. The next mountain, O king, is called Malaya stretching\r\ntowards the east. It is there that the clouds are generated and it is\r\nthence that they disperse on all sides. The next, O thou of Kuru's race,\r\nis the large mountain called Jaladhara.[67] Thence Indra daily taketh\r\nwater of the best quality. It is from that water that we get showers in\r\nthe season of rains, O ruler of men. Next cometh the high mountain called\r\nRaivataka, over which, in the firmament, hath been permanently placed the\r\nconstellation called Revati. This arrangement hath been made by the\r\nGrandsire himself. On the north of this, O great king, is the large\r\nmountain called Syama. It hath the splendour of newly-risen clouds, is\r\nvery high, beautiful and of bright body. And since the hue of those\r\nmountains is dark, the people residing there are all dark in complexion,\r\nO king.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said,--'A great doubt ariseth in my mind, O Sanjaya, from\r\nwhat thou hast said. Why, O Suta's son, would the people there be of dark\r\ncomplexion?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--'O great king, in all islands, O son of Kuru's race, men\r\nmay be found that are fair, and those that are dark, and those also that\r\nare produced by a union of the fair and the dark races. But because the\r\npeople there are all dark, therefore is that mountain called the Dark\r\nMountain. After this, O chief of the Kurus, is the large mountain called\r\nDurgasaila. And then cometh the mountain called Kesari. The breezes that\r\nblow from that mountain are all charged with (odoriferous) effluvia. The\r\nmeasure of each of these mountains is double that of the one mentioned\r\nimmediately before. O thou of Kuru's race, it hath been said by the wise\r\nthat there are seven Varshas in that island. The Varsha of Meru is called\r\nMahakasa; that of the water-giving (Malaya) is called Kumudottara. The\r\nVarsha of Jaladhara is called Sukumara: while that of Raivatak is called\r\nKaumara; and of Syama, Manikanchana. The Varsha of Kesara is called\r\nMandaki, and that called after the next mountain is called Mahapuman. In\r\nthe midst of that island is a large tree called Saka. In height and\r\nbreadth the measure of that tree is equal to that of the Jamvu tree in\r\nJamvudwipa. And the people there always adore that tree. There in that\r\nisland are, many delightful provinces where Siva is worshipped, and\r\nthither repair the Siddhas, the Charanas, and the celestials. The people\r\nthere, O king, are virtuous, and all the four orders, O Bharata, are\r\ndevoted to their respective occupation. No instance of theft can be seen\r\nthere. Freed from decrepitude and death and gifted with long life, the\r\npeople there, O king, grow like rivers during the season of rains. The\r\nrivers there are full of sacred water, and Ganga herself, distributed as\r\nshe hath been into various currents, is there, Sukumari, and Kumari, and\r\nSeta, and Keveraka, and Mahanadi, O Kauravya, and the river Manijala, and\r\nChakshus, and the river Vardhanika, O thou best of the Bharatas,--these\r\nand many other rivers by thousands and hundreds, all full of sacred\r\nwater, are there, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, from which Vasava draweth\r\nwater for showering it as rain. It is impossible to recount the names and\r\nlengths of rivers. All of them are foremost of rivers and sin-cleansing.\r\nAs heard by all men there, in that island of Saka, are four sacred\r\nprovinces. They are the Mrigas, the Masakas, the Manasas, and the\r\nMandagas. The Mrigas for the most part are Brahmanas devoted to the\r\noccupations of their order. Amongst the Masakas are virtuous Kshatriyas\r\ngranting (unto Brahmanas) every wish (entertained by them). The Manasas,\r\nO king, live by following the duties of the Vaisya order. Having every\r\nwish of theirs gratified, they are also brave and firmly devoted to\r\nvirtue and profit. The Mandagas are all brave Sudras of virtuous\r\nbehaviour. In these provinces, O monarch, there is no king, no\r\npunishment, no person that deserves to be punished. Conversant with the\r\ndictates of duty they are all engaged in the practice of their respective\r\nduties and protect one another. This much is capable of being said of the\r\nisland called Saka. This much also should be listened to about that\r\nisland endued with great energy.\"[68]"

(Thither\r\nin the north) is the ocean whose waters are clarified butter. Then is the\r\nocean whose waters are curds. Next cometh the ocean whose waters are\r\nwine, and then is another ocean of water. The islands, O king, are double\r\nin area of one another as they proceed further and further towards the\r\nnorth. And they are surrounded, O king, by these oceans.[69] In the\r\nisland that is in the middle, there is a large mountain called Goura made\r\nof red arsenic; on the western island, O king, is the mountain Krishna\r\nthat is the favourite (abode) of Narayana. There Kesava guardeth\r\ncelestial gems (in profusion), and thence, inclined to grace, he\r\nbestoweth happiness on creatures. Along with the kingdoms there, O king,\r\nthe (celestial) clump of Kusa grass in Kusadwipa, and the Salmali tree in\r\nthe island of Salmalika, are adored. In the Krauncha island also, the\r\nmountain called Maha-krauncha that is a mine of all kinds of gems is, O\r\nking, always adored by all the four orders of men. (There), O monarch, is\r\nthe mountain called Gomanta that is huge and consists of all kinds of\r\nmetals, and whereon always resideth, mingling with those that have been\r\nemancipated, the puissant Narayana, otherwise called Hari, graced with\r\nprosperity and possessed of eyes like lotus leaves. In Kusadwipa, O king\r\nof kings, there is another mountain variegated with corals and called\r\nafter the name of that island itself. This mountain is inaccessible and\r\nmade of gold. Possessed of great splendour, O Kauravya, there is a third\r\nmountain there that is called Sumida. The sixth is called Harigiri. These\r\nare the six principal mountains. The intervening spaces between one\r\nanother of these six mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two as\r\nthey proceed further and further towards the north. The first Varsha is\r\ncalled Audhido; the second is Venumandala; the third is called Suratha;\r\nthe fourth is known by the name of Kamvala; the fifth Varsha is called\r\nDhritimat; and the sixth is named Prabhakara; the seventh Varsha is\r\ncalled Kapila. These are the seven successive Varshas. In these, gods and\r\nGandharvas, and other creatures of the universe, sport and take delight.\r\nIn these Varshas the inhabitants never die. There, O king, are no\r\nrobbers, nor any tribes of Mlecchas. All the residents are almost white\r\nin complexion, and very delicate, O king.\r\n\r\n\"'As regards the rest of the islands, O ruler of men, I will recount all\r\nthat hath been heard by me. Listen, O monarch, with an attentive mind. In\r\nthe Krauncha island, O great king, there is a large mountain called\r\nKrauncha. Next to Krauncha is Vamanaka; and next to Vamanaka is\r\nAndhakara. And next to Andhakara,[70] O king, is that excellent of\r\nmountains called Mainaka. After Mainaka, O monarch, is that best of\r\nmountains called Govinda; and after Govinda, O king, is the mountain\r\ncalled Nivida. O multiplier of thy race, the intervening spaces between\r\none another of these mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two. I\r\nwill now tell thee the countries that lie there. Listen to me as I speak\r\nof them. The region near Krauncha is called Kusala; that near Vamanaka is\r\nManonuga. The region next to Manonuga, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, is\r\ncalled Ushna. After Ushna is Pravaraka; and after Pravaraka is\r\nAndhakaraka. The country after Andhakaraka is named Munidesa. After\r\nMunidesa the region is called Dundubhiswana teeming with Siddhas and\r\nCharanas. The people are almost white in complexion, O king. All these\r\ncountries, O monarch, are the habitations of gods and Gandharvas. In (the\r\nisland of) Pushkara is a mountain called Pushkara that abounds with\r\njewels and gems. There always dwelleth the divine Prajapati himself. Him\r\nall the gods and great Rishis always adore with gratifying words and\r\nworship reverently, O king. Diverse gems from Jamvudwipa are used there.\r\nIn all these islands, O king, Brahmacharyya, truth, and self-control of\r\nthe dwellers, as also their health and periods of life, are in the ratio\r\nof one to two as the islands are more and more remote (northwards). O\r\nking, the land in those islands, O Bharata, comprises but one country,\r\nfor that is said to be one country in which one religion is met with. The\r\nSupreme Prajapati himself, upraising the rod of chastisement, always\r\ndwelleth there, protecting those islands. He, O monarch, is the king. He\r\nis their source of bliss. He is the father, and he is the grand-father.\r\nHe it is, O best of men, that protecteth all creatures there, mobile or\r\nimmobile. Cooked food, O Kauravya, cometh there of itself and the\r\ncreatures eat it daily. O mighty-armed one. After these regions is seen a\r\nhabitation of the name of Sama. It is of a starry-shape having four\r\ncorners, and it hath, O king, thirty-three mandalas. There dwell, O\r\nKauravya, four princely elephants adored by all.[71] They are, O best of\r\nthe Bharatas, Vamana, and Airavata, and another, and also Supratika.[72]\r\nO king, with rent cheeks and mouth, I do not venture to calculate the\r\nproportions of these four elephants.[73] Their length, breadth and\r\nthickness have for ever remained unascertained. There in those regions, O\r\nking, winds blow irregularly from all directions.[74] These are seized by\r\nthose elephants with the tips of their trunks which are of the complexion\r\nof the lotus and endued with great splendour and capable of drawing up\r\neverything in their way. And soon enough after seizing them they then\r\nalways let them out. The winds, O king, thus let out by those respiring\r\nelephants, come over the Earth and in consequence thereof creatures draw\r\nbreath and live.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said,--'Thou hast, O Sanjaya, told me everything about the\r\nfirst subject very elaborately. Thou hast also indicated the positions of\r\nthe islands. 'Tell now, O Sanjaya, about what remains.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said,--'Indeed, O great king, the islands have all been\r\ndescribed to thee. Listen now to what I truly say about the heavenly\r\nbodies and about Swarbhanu, O chief of the Kauravas, as regards its\r\ndimensions. It is heard, O king, that the planet Swarbhanu is globular.\r\nIts diameter is twelve thousand Yojanas, and its circumference, because\r\nit is very large, is forty-two thousand Yojanas, O sinless one,[75] as\r\nsaid by the learned of olden times. The diameter of the moon, O king, is\r\nstated to be eleven thousand Yojanas. Its circumference, O chief of the\r\nKurus, is stated to be thirty-eight thousand nine hundred Yojanas of the\r\nillustrious planet of cool rays. It hath been heard that the diameter of\r\nthe beneficent, fast going and light-giving Sun, O thou of Kuru's race,\r\nis ten thousand Yojanas, and his circumference, O king, is thirty-five\r\nthousand eight hundred miles, in consequence of his largeness, O sinless\r\none. These are the dimensions reckoned here, O Bharata, of Arka. The\r\nplanet Rahu, in consequence of his greater bulk, envelops both the Sun\r\nand the Moon in due times. I tell thee this in brief. With the eye of\r\nscience, O great king, I have now told thee all that thou hadst asked.\r\nLet peace be thine.

What became of my sons, O Sanjaya, when they were\r\ndeprived of the mighty Bhishma who was like unto a celestial, and who led\r\nlife of Brahmacharyya for the sake of his father?[79] Upon the fall of\r\nthat tiger among men who was endued with great wisdom, great capacity for\r\nexertion, great might and great energy, how did our warriors feel?\r\nHearing that bull amongst the Kurus, that foremost of men, that\r\nunwavering hero is slain, great is the grief that pierceth my heart.\r\nWhile advancing (against the foe), who followed him and who proceeded\r\nahead? Who stayed by his side? Who proceeded with him? What brave\r\ncombatants followed behind (protecting his rear) that tiger among\r\ncar-warriors, that wonderful archer, that bull among Kshatriyas, while he\r\npenetrated into the divisions of the foe?[80] While seizing the hostile\r\nranks, what warriors opposed that slayer of foes resembling the luminary\r\nof thousand rays, who spreading terror among the foe destroyed their\r\nranks like the Sun destroying darkness, and who achieved in battle\r\namongst the ranks of Pandu's sons feats exceedingly difficult of\r\naccomplishment? How, indeed, O Sanjaya, did the Pandavas oppose in battle\r\nthe son of Santanu, that accomplished and invincible warrior when he\r\napproached them smiting? Slaughtering the (hostile) ranks, having arrows\r\nfor his teeth, and full of energy, with the bow for his wide-open mouth,\r\nand with the terrible sword for his tongue, and invincible, a very tiger\r\namong men, endued with modesty, and never before vanquished, alas, how\r\ndid Kunti's son overthrow in battle that unconquered one, undeserving as\r\nhe was of such a fate,[81]--that fierce bowman shooting fierce shafts,\r\nstationed on his excellent car, and plucking off the heads of foes (from\r\ntheir bodies)--that warrior, irresistible as the Yuga-fire, beholding\r\nwhom addrest for battle the great army of the Pandavas always used to\r\nwaver? Mangling the hostile troops for ten nights, alas, that slayer of\r\nranks hath set like the Sun, having achieved feats difficult of\r\nachievement. He who, scattering like Sakra himself and inexhaustible\r\nshower of arrows, slew in battle a hundred millions of warriors in ten\r\ndays, that scion of Bharata's race, now lieth, although he deserveth it\r\nnot, on the bare ground, in the field of battle, deprived of life, a\r\nmighty tree uprooted by the winds, as a result of my evil counsels!\r\nBeholding Santanu's son Bhishma of terrible prowess, how indeed, could\r\nthe army of the Pandavas[82] succeed in smiting him there? How did the\r\nsons of Pandu battle with Bhishma? How is it, O Sanjaya, that Bhishma\r\ncould not conquer when Drona liveth? When Kripa, again, was near him, and\r\nDrona's son (Aswatthaman) also, how could Bhishma, that foremost of\r\nsmiters be slain? How could Bhishma who was reckoned as an Atiratha and\r\nwho could not be resisted by the very gods, be slain in battle by\r\nSikhandin, the prince of Panchala? He, who always regarded himself as the\r\nequal of the mighty son of Jamadagni in battle, he whom Jamadagni's son\r\nhimself could not vanquish, he who resembled Indra himself in\r\nprowess,--alas, O Sanjaya, tell me how that hero, Bhishma, born in the\r\nrace of Maharathas, was slain in battle, for without knowing all the\r\nparticulars I cannot regain my equanimity. What great bowmen of my army,\r\nO Sanjaya, did not desert that hero of unfading glory? What heroic\r\nwarriors, again, at Duryodhana's command, stood around that hero (for\r\nprotecting him)? When all the Pandavas placing Sikhandin in their van\r\nadvanced against Bhishma, did not all the Kurus,[83] O Sanjaya, stay by\r\nthe side of that hero of unfading prowess? Hard as my heart is, surely it\r\nmust be made of adamant, for it breaketh not on hearing the death of that\r\ntiger among men, viz., Bhishma! In that irresistible bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, were truth, and intelligence, and policy, to an immeasurable\r\nextent. Alas, how was he slain in battle? Like unto a mighty cloud of\r\nhigh altitude, having the twang of his bowstring for its roar, his arrows\r\nfor its rain-drops, and the sound of his bow for its thunder, that hero\r\nshowering his shafts on Kunti's sons with the Panchalas and the Srinjayas\r\non their side, smote hostile car-warriors like the slayer of Vala smiting\r\nthe Danavas. Who were the heroes that resisted, like the bank resisting\r\nthe surging sea, that chastiser of foes, who was a terrible ocean of\r\narrows and weapons, an ocean in which shafts were the irresistible\r\ncrocodiles and bows were the waves, an ocean that was inexhaustible,\r\nwithout an island, agitated and without a raft to cross it, in which\r\nmaces and swords were like sharks and steeds and elephants like eddies,\r\nand foot-soldiers like fishes in abundance, and the sound of conches and\r\ndrums like its roar, and ocean that swallowed horses and elephants and\r\nfoot-soldiers quickly, an ocean that devoured hostile heroes and that\r\nseethed with wrath and energy which constituted its Yadava-fire?[84] When\r\nfor Duryodhana's good, that slayer of foes, Bhishma, achieved (terrible)\r\nfeats in battle, who were then in his van? Who were they that protected\r\nthe right wheel of that warrior of immeasurable energy? Who were they\r\nthat, mustering patience and energy, resisted hostile heroes from his\r\nrear? Who stationed themselves in his near front for protecting him? Who\r\nwere those heroes that protected the fore-wheel of that brave warrior\r\nwhile he battled (with the foe)? Who were they that stationing themselves\r\nby his left wheel smote the Srinjayas? Who were they that protected the\r\nirresistible advance ranks of his van? Who protected the wings of that\r\nwarrior who hath made the last painful journey? And who, O Sanjaya,\r\nfought with hostile heroes in the general engagement? If he was protected\r\nby (our) heroes, and if they were protected by. him, why could he not\r\nthen speedily vanquish in battle the army of the Pandavas, invincible\r\nthough it be? Indeed, O Sanjaya, how could the Pandavas succeed even in\r\nstriking Bhishma who was like Parameshti himself, that Lord and creator\r\nof all creatures?[85] Thou tellest me, O Sanjaya, if the disappearance of\r\nthat Bhishma, that tiger among men, who was our refuge and relying upon\r\nwhom the Kurus were fighting with their foes, that warrior of mighty\r\nstrength relying on whose energy my son had never reckoned the Pandavas,\r\nalas, how hath he been slain by the enemy?[86] In days of yore, all the\r\ngods while engaged in slaying the Danavas, sought the aid of that\r\ninvincible warrior, viz., my father of high vows. That foremost of sons\r\nendued with great energy, on whose birth the world-renowned Santanu\r\nabandoned all grief, melancholy, and sorrows, how canst thou tell me, O\r\nSanjaya, that that celebrated hero, that great refuge of all, that wise\r\nand holy personage who was devoted to the duties of his order and\r\nconversant with the truths of the Vedas and their branches, hath been\r\nslain? Accomplished in every weapon and endued with humility, gentle and\r\nwith passions under full control, and possessed of great energy as he\r\nwas, alas, hearing that son of Santanu slain I regard the rest of my army\r\nas already slain. In my judgment, unrighteousness hath now become\r\nstronger than righteousness, for the sons of Pandu desire sovereignty\r\neven by killing their venerable superior! In days of yore, Jamadagni's\r\nson Rama, who was acquainted with every weapon and whom none excelled,\r\nwhen addrest for battle on behalf of Amvya, was vanquished by Bhishma in\r\ncombat. Thou tellest me that that Bhishma, who was the foremost of all\r\nwarriors and who resembled Indra himself in the feats he achieved, hath\r\nbeen slain. What can be a greater grief to me than this? Endued with\r\ngreat intelligence, he that was not slain even by that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes, that Rama, the son of Jamadagni, who defeated in battle crowds of\r\nKshatriyas repeatedly, he hath now been slain by Sikhandin. Without\r\ndoubt, Drupada's son Sikhandin, therefore who hath slain in battle that\r\nbull of Bharata's race, that hero acquainted with the highest weapons,\r\nthat brave and accomplished warrior conversant with every weapon, is\r\nsuperior in energy, prowess, and might to the invincible Vargava endued\r\nwith the highest energy. In that encounter of arms who were the heroes\r\nthat followed that slayer of foes? Tell me how the battle was fought\r\nbetween Bhishma and the Pandavas. The army of my son, O Sanjaya, reft of\r\nits hero, is like an unprotected woman. Indeed, that army of mine is like\r\na panic-struck herd of kine reft of its herdsman. He in whom resided\r\nprowess superior to that of every one, when he was laid low on the field\r\nof battle, what was the state of mind of my army? What power is there, O\r\nSanjaya, in our life, when we have caused our father of mighty energy,\r\nthat foremost of righteous men in the world, to be slain? Like a person\r\ndesirous of crossing the sea when he beholds the boat sunk in fathomless\r\nwaters, alas, my sons, I ween, are bitterly weeping from grief on\r\nBhishma's death. My heart, O Sanjaya, is surely made of adamant, for it\r\nrendeth not even after hearing the death of Bhishma, that tiger among\r\nmen. That bull among men in whom were weapons, intelligence, and policy,\r\nto an immeasurable extent, how, alas, hath that invincible warrior been\r\nslain in battle? Neither in consequence of weapons nor of courage, nor of\r\nascetic merit, nor of intelligence, nor of firmness, nor of gift, can a\r\nman free himself from death. Indeed, time, endued with great energy, is\r\nincapable of being transgressed by anything in the world, when thou\r\ntellest me, O Sanjaya, that Santanu's son Bhishma is dead. Burning with\r\ngrief on account of my sons, in fact, overwhelmed with great sorrow, I\r\nhad hoped for relief from Bhishma, the son of Santanu. When he beheld\r\nSantanu's son, O Sanjaya, lying on earth like the Sun (dropped from the\r\nfirmament), what else was made by Duryodhana as his refuge? O Sanjaya,\r\nreflecting with the aid of my understanding, I do not see what the end\r\nwill be of the kings belonging to my side and that of the enemy and now\r\nmustered in the opposing ranks of battle. Alas, cruel are the duties of\r\nthe Kshatriya order as laid down by the Rishis, since the Pandavas are\r\ndesirous of sovereignty by even compassing the death of Santanu's son,\r\nand we also are desirous of sovereignty by offering up that hero of high\r\nvows as a sacrifice.[87] The sons of Pritha, as also my sons, are all in\r\nthe observance of Kshatriya duties. They, therefore, incur no sin (by\r\ndoing) this. Even a righteous person should do this, O Sanjaya, when\r\ndireful calamities come. The display of prowess and the exhibition of the\r\nutmost might have been laid down among the duties of the Kshatriyas.\r\n\r\n\"'How, indeed, did the sons of Pandu oppose my father Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu, that unvanquished hero endued with modesty, while he was engaged\r\nin destroying the hostile ranks? How were the troops arrayed, and how did\r\nhe battle with high-souled foes? How, O Sanjaya, was my father Bhishma\r\nslain by the enemy? Duryodhana and Karna and the deceitful Sakuni, the\r\nson of Suvala, and Dussasana also,--what did they say when Bhishma was\r\nslain? Thither where the dice-board is constituted by the bodies of men,\r\nelephants, and steeds, and, where arrows and javelins and large swords\r\nand bearded darts from the dice, entering that frightful mansion of\r\ndestructive battle's play, who were those wretched gamblers,--those bulls\r\namong men,--that gambled, making their very lives the frightful stakes?\r\nWho won, who were vanquished, who cast the dice successfully, and who\r\nhave been slain, besides Bhishma, the son of Santanu? Tell me all, O\r\nSanjaya, for peace cannot be mine, hearing that Devavrata hath been\r\nslain,--that father of mine, of terrible deeds, that ornament of battle,\r\nviz., Bhishma! Keen anguish had penetrated my heart, born of the thought\r\nthat all my children would die. Thou makest that grief of mine blaze\r\nforth, O Sanjaya, like fire by pouring clarified butter on it. My sons,\r\n\r\nI ween, are even now grieving, beholding Bhishma slain,--Bhishma\r\ncelebrated in all worlds and who had taken upon himself a heavy burden. I\r\nwill listen to all those sorrows arising from Duryodhana's act.\r\nTherefore, tell me, O Sanjaya, everything that happened\r\nthere,--everything that happened in the battle, born of the folly of my\r\nwicked son. Ill-ordered or well-ordered, tell me everything, O Sanjaya.\r\nWhatever was achieved with the aid of energy in the battle by Bhishma\r\ndesirous of victory,--by that warrior accomplished in arms,--tell me all\r\nfully and in detail. How, in fact, the battle took place between the\r\narmies of the Kurus and the manner in which each happened.'\""

Let also all the troops from\r\nthe east, the west, the south, and the north, accomplished in every kind\r\nof weapon, protect the grandsire.

Let us not, therefore, cause\r\nBhishma to be slain by Sikhandin like the lion slain by the jackal.\r\nYudhamanyu protects the left wheel, and Uttamauja protects the right\r\nwheel of Phalguni.

The\r\nlarge armies of the Kurus and the Pandavas, O king, rising at sunrise,\r\ncompleted all their arrangements. Then when the Sun rose, the fierce\r\nweapons of attack and defence and the coats of mail of both thy sons and\r\nthe Pandavas, and the large and splendid armies of both sides, became\r\nfully visible. There elephants and cars, adorned with gold, looked\r\nresplendent like clouds mingled with lightning. The ranks of cars,\r\nstanding in profusion, looked like cities. And thy father, stationed\r\nthere, shone brilliantly, like the full moon. And the warriors armed with\r\nbows and swords and scimitars and maces, javelins and lances and bright\r\nweapons of diverse kinds, took up their positions in their (respective)\r\nranks. And resplendent standards were seen, set up by thousands, of\r\ndiverse forms, belonging to both ourselves and the foe. And made of gold\r\nand decked with gems and blazing like fire, those banners in thousands\r\nendued with great effulgence, looked beautiful like heroic combatants\r\ncased in mail gazed at those standards, longing for battle.[90] And many\r\nforemost of men, with eyes large as those of bulls endued with quivers,\r\nand with hands cased in leathern fences, stood at the heads of their\r\ndivisions, with their bright weapons upraised. And Suvala's son Sakuni,\r\nand Salya, Jayadratha and the two princes of Avanti named Vinda and\r\nAnuvinda, and the Kekaya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the\r\nKamvojas and Srutayudha the ruler of the Kalingas, and king Jayatsena,\r\nand Vrihadvala the ruler of the Kosalas, and Kritavarman of Satwata's\r\nrace,--these ten tigers among men, endued with great bravery and\r\npossessing arms that looked like maces,--these performers of sacrifices\r\nwith plentiful gifts (to Brahmanas), stood each at the head of an\r\nAkshauhini of troops. These and many other kings and princes, mighty\r\ncar-warriors conversant with policy, obedient to the commands of\r\nDuryodhana, all cased in mail, were seen stationed in their respective\r\ndivisions. All of them, cased in black deer-skins, endued with great\r\nstrength, accomplished in battle, and cheerfully prepared, for\r\nDuryodhana's sake, to ascend to the region of Brahma,[91] stood there\r\ncommanding ten efficient Akshauhinis. The eleventh great division of the\r\nKauravas, consisting of the Dhartarashtra troops, stood in advance of the\r\nwhole army. There in the van of that division was Santanu's son. With his\r\nwhite head-gear, white umbrella, and white mail, O monarch, we beheld\r\nBhishma of unfailing prowess look like the risen moon. His standard\r\nbearing the device of a palmyra of gold himself stationed on a car made\r\nof silver, both the Kurus and the Pandavas beheld that hero looking like\r\nthe moon encircled by white clouds. The great bowmen amongst the\r\nSrinjayas headed by Dhrishtadyumna, (beholding Bhishma) looked like\r\nlittle animals when they would behold a mighty yawning lion. Indeed, all\r\nthe combatants headed by Dhrishtadyumna repeatedly trembled in fear.\r\nThese, O king, were the eleven splendid divisions of thy army. So also\r\nthe seven divisions belonging to the Pandavas were protected by foremost\r\nof men.

On that day on which the battle commenced Soma approached the\r\nregion of Pitris.[92] The seven large planets, as they appeared in the\r\nfirmament, all looked blazing like fire.[93] The Sun, when he rose,\r\nseemed to be divided in twain. Besides, that luminary, as it appeared in\r\nthe firmament, seemed to blaze forth in flames.[94] Carnivorous jackals\r\nand crows, expecting dead bodies to feast upon, began to utter fierce\r\ncries from all directions that seemed to be ablaze. Every day the old\r\ngrandsire of the Kurus, and the son of Bharadwaja, rising from bed in the\r\nmorning, with concentrated mind, said,--'Victory to the sons of\r\nPandu'--while those chastisers of foes used (at the same time) yet to\r\nfight for thy sake according to the pledge they had given. Thy father\r\nDevavrata, fully conversant with every duty, summoning all the kings,\r\nsaid these words (unto them). 'Ye Kshatriyas, this broad door is open to\r\nyou for entering heaven. Go ye through it to the region of Sakra and\r\nBrahman. The Rishis of olden times have showed you this eternal path.[95]\r\nHonour ye yourselves by engaging in battle with attentive minds. Nabhaga,\r\nand Yayati, and Mandhatri, and Nahusa, and Nriga, were crowned with\r\nsuccess and obtained the highest region of bliss by feats like these.

The death he meets with in\r\nbattle is his eternal duty.'--Thus addressed, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nby Bhishma, the kings, looking beautiful in their excellent cars,\r\nproceeded to the heads of their respective divisions. Only Vikartana's\r\nson Karna, with his friends and relatives, O bull of Bharata's race, laid\r\naside his weapons in battle for the sake of Bhishma. Without Karna then,\r\nthy sons and all the kings on thy side proceeded, making the ten points\r\nof the horizon resound with their leonine roars. And their divisions\r\nshone brightly, O king, with white umbrellas, banners, standards,\r\nelephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers. And the Earth was agitated\r\nwith the sounds of drums and tabors and cymbals, and the clatter of\r\ncar-wheels. And the mighty car-warriors, decked with their bracelets and\r\narmlets of gold and with their bows (variegated with gold), looked\r\nresplendent like hills of fire. And with his large palmyra-standard\r\ndecked with five stars, Bhishma, the generalissimo of the Kuru army,[96]\r\nlooked like the resplendent Sun himself. Those mighty bowmen of royal\r\nbirth, O bull of Bharata's race, that were on thy side, all took up their\r\npositions, O king, as Santanu's son ordered. (King) Saivya of the country\r\nof the Govasanas, accompanied by all the monarchs, went out on a princely\r\nelephant worthy of royal use and graced with a banner on its back. And\r\nAswatthaman, of the complexion of the lotus, went out ready for every\r\nemergency, stationing himself at the very head of all the divisions, with\r\nhis standard bearing the device of the lion's tail. And Srutayudha and\r\nChitrasena and Purumitra and Vivinsati, and Salya and Bhurisravas, and\r\nthat mighty car-warrior Vikarna,--these seven mighty bowmen on their\r\ncarts and cased in excellent mail, followed Drona's son behind but in\r\nadvance of Bhishma. The tall standards of these warriors, made of gold,\r\nbeautifully set up for adorning their excellent cars, looked highly\r\nresplendent. The standard of Drona, the foremost of preceptors, bore the\r\ndevice of a golden altar decked with a water-pot and the figure of a bow.\r\nThe standard of Duryodhana guiding many hundreds and thousands of\r\ndivisions bore the device of an elephant worked in gems. Paurava and the\r\nruler of the Kalingas, and Salya, these Rathas took up their position in\r\nDuryodhana's van. On a costly car with his standard bearing the device of\r\na bull, and guiding the very van (of his division), the ruler of the\r\nMagadhas marched against the foe.[97] That large force of the Easterners\r\nlooking like the fleecy clouds of autumn[98] was (besides) protected by\r\nthe chief of the Angas (Karna's son Vrishaketu) and Kripa endued with\r\ngreat energy. Stationing himself in the van of his division with his\r\nbeautiful standard of silver bearing the device of the boar, the famous\r\nJayadratha looked highly resplendent. A hundred thousand cars, eight\r\nthousand elephants, and sixty thousand cavalry were under his\r\ncommand.[99] Commanded by the royal chief of the Sindhus, that large\r\ndivision occupying the very van (of the army) and abounding with untold\r\ncars, elephants, and steeds, looked magnificent. With sixty thousand cars\r\nand ten thousand elephants, the ruler of the Kalingas, accompanied by\r\nKetumat, went out. His huge elephants, looking like hills, and adorned\r\nwith Yantras,[100] lances, quivers and standards, looked exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. And the ruler of the Kalingas, with his tall standard\r\neffulgent as fire, with his white umbrella, and golden curass, and\r\nChamaras (wherewith he was fanned), shone brilliantly. And Ketumat also,\r\nriding on an elephant with a highly excellent and beautiful hook, was\r\nstationed in battle, O King, like the Sun in the midst of (black) clouds.\r\nAnd king Bhagadatta, blazing with energy and riding on that elephant of\r\nhis, went out like the wielder of the thunder. And the two princes of\r\nAvanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, who were regarded as equal to\r\nBhagadatta, followed Ketumat, riding on the necks of their elephants.\r\nAnd, O king, arrayed by Drona and the royal son of Santanu, and Drona's\r\nson, and Valhika, and Kripa, the (Kaurava) Vyuha[101] consisting of many\r\ndivisions of cars was such that the elephants formed its body; the kings,\r\nits head; and the steeds, its wings. With face towards all sides, that\r\nfierce Vyuha seemed to smile and ready to spring (upon the foe).\""

And soon the\r\nwelkin and the whole Earth was filled with the neigh of chargers and the\r\nshouts of combatants. O irresistible one, the troops of thy sons and of\r\nthe Pandavas both trembled when they encountered each other. There (on\r\nthe field of battle) elephants and cars, decked in gold, looked beautiful\r\nlike clouds decked with lightning. And standards of diverse forms, O\r\nking, belonging to the combatants on thy side, and adorned with golden\r\nrings, looked resplendent like fire. And those standards of thy side and\r\ntheirs, resembled, O Bharata, the banners of Indra in his celestial\r\nmansions. And the heroic warriors all accoutred and cased in golden coats\r\nof mail endued with the effulgence of the blazing Sun, themselves looked\r\nlike blazing fire or the Sun. All the foremost warriors amongst the\r\nKurus, O king, with excellent bows, and weapons upraised (for striking),\r\nwith leathern fences on their hands, and with standards,--those mighty\r\nbowmen, of eyes large as those of bulls, all placed themselves at the\r\nheads of their (respective) divisions. And these amongst thy sons, O\r\nking, protected Bhishma from behind, viz.. Dussasana, and Durvishaha, and\r\nDurmukha, and Dussaha and Vivinsati, and Chitrasena, and that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Vikarna. And amongst them were Satyavrata, and Purumitra, and\r\nJaya, and Bhurisravas, and Sala. And twenty thousand car-warriors\r\nfollowed them. The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, and the Vasatis,\r\nthe Swalyas, the Matsyas, the Amvashtas, the Trigartas, and the Kekayas,\r\nthe Sauviras, the Kitavas, and the dwellers of the Eastern, Western, and\r\nthe Northern countries,--these twelve brave races were resolved to fight\r\nreckless of the lives. And these protected the grandsire with a\r\nmultitudinous array of cars. And with a division that consisted of ten\r\nthousand active elephants, the king of Magadha followed that large car\r\ndivision. They that protected the wheels of the cars and they that\r\nprotected the elephants, numbered full six millions. And the\r\nfoot-soldiers that marched in advance (of the army), armed with bows,\r\nswords, and shields, numbered many hundreds of thousands.

How did Kunti's son, O\r\nSanjaya, form his counter-array against that Bhishma who was acquainted\r\nwith all kinds of arrays, viz., human, celestial, Gandharva, and Asura?\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said,--\"Seeing the Dhritarashtra divisions arrayed in order of\r\nbattle, Pandu's son of virtuous soul, king Yudhishthira the just,\r\naddressed Dhananjaya, saying,--'Men are informed from the words of that\r\ngreat Rishi Vrihaspati that the few must be made to fight by condensing\r\nthem, while the many may be extended according to pleasure. In encounters\r\nof the few with the many, the array to be formed should be the\r\nneedle-mouthed one. Our troops compared with the enemy's are few. Keeping\r\nin view this precept of the great Rishi, array our troops, O son of\r\nPandu.' Hearing this, that son of Pandu answered king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, saying,--That immovable array known by the name of Vajra, which was\r\ndesigned by the wielder of the thunder-bolt,--that invincible array is\r\nthe one that I will make for thee, O best of kings. He who is like the\r\nbursting tempest, he who is incapable of being borne in battle by the\r\nfoe, that Bhima the foremost of smiters, will fight at our head. That\r\nforemost of men, conversant with all the appliances of battle, becoming\r\nour leader, will fight in the van, crushing the energy of the foe. That\r\nforemost of smiters, viz., Bhima, beholding whom all the hostile warriors\r\nheaded by Duryodhana will retreat in panic like smaller animals beholding\r\nthe lion, all of us, our fears dispelled, will seek his shelter as if he\r\nwere a wall, like the celestial seeking the shelter of Indra. The man\r\nbreathes not in the world who would bear to cast his eyes upon that bull\r\namong men, Vrikodara of fierce deeds, when he is angry.'--Having said\r\nthis, Dhananjaya of mighty arms did as he said. And Phalguni, quickly\r\ndisposing his troops in battle-array, proceeded (against the foe). And\r\nthe mighty army of the Pandavas beholding the Kuru army move, looked like\r\nthe full, immovable, and quickly rolling[103] current of Ganga. And\r\nBhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna endued with great energy, and Nakula, and\r\nSahadeva, and king Dhrishtaketu, became the leaders of that force. And\r\nking Virata, surrounded by an Akshawhini of troops and accompanied by his\r\nbrothers and sons, marched in their rear, protecting them from behind.\r\nThe two sons of Madri, both endued with great effulgence, became the\r\nprotectors of Bhima's wheels; while the (five) sons of Draupadi and the\r\nson of Subhadra all endued with great activity, protected (Bhima) from\r\nbehind. And that mighty car-warrior, Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of\r\nPanchala, with those bravest of combatants and the foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the Prabhadrakas, protected those princes from\r\nbehind. And behind him was Sikhandin who (in his turn) was protected by\r\nArjuna, and who, O bull of Bharata's race, advanced with concentrated\r\nattention for the destruction of Bhishma. Behind Arjuna was Yuyudhana of\r\nmighty strength; and the two princes of Panchala, viz., Yudhamanyu and\r\nUttamaujas, became protectors of Arjuna's wheels, along with the Kekaya\r\nbrothers, and Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana of great valour--This\r\nBhimasena, wielding his mace made of the hardest metal, and moving (on\r\nthe field of battle) with fierce speed, can dry up the very ocean. And\r\nthere also stay, with their counsellors looking on him. O king, the\r\nchildren[104] of Dhritarashtra.--Even this, O monarch, was what Vibhatsu\r\nsaid, pointing out the mighty Bhimasena (to Yudhishthira).[105] And while\r\nPartha was saying so, all the troops, O Bharata, worshipped him on the\r\nfield of battle with gratulatory words. King Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nKunti, took up his position in the centre of his army, surrounded by huge\r\nand furious elephants resembling moving hills. The high-souled Yajnasena,\r\nthe king of the Panchalas, endued with great prowess, stationed himself\r\nbehind Virata with an Akshauhini of troops for the sake of the Pandavas.\r\nAnd on the cars of those kings, O monarch, were tall standards bearing\r\ndiverse devices, decked with excellent ornaments of gold, and endued with\r\nthe effulgence of the Sun and the Moon. Causing those kings to move and\r\nmake space for him, that mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, accompanied\r\nby his brothers and sons protected Yudhishthira from behind. Transcending\r\nthe huge standards on all the cars on thy side and that of the enemy, was\r\nthe one gigantic ape on Arjuna's car. Foot-soldiers, by many hundreds of\r\nthousands, and armed with swords, spears, and scimitars, proceeded ahead\r\nfor protecting Bhimasena. And ten thousand elephants with (temporal)\r\njuice trickling down their cheek and mouth, and resembling (on that\r\naccount) showering clouds,[106] endued with great courage, blazing with\r\ngolden armour, huge hills, costly, and emitting the fragrance of lotuses,\r\nfollowed the king behind like moving mountains.[107] And the high-souled\r\nand invincible Bhimasena, whirling his fierce mace that resembled a\r\nparigha[108] seemed to crush the large army (of thy son). Incapable of\r\nbeing looked at like the Sun himself, and scorching as it were, the\r\nhostile army (like fire), none of the combatants could bear to even look\r\nat him from any neat point. And this array, fearless and having its face\r\nturned towards all sides called Vajra, having bows for its lightning\r\nsign,[109] and extremely fierce, was protected by the wielder of Gandiva.\r\nDisposing their troops in this counter-array against thy army, the\r\nPandavas waited for battle. And protected by the Pandavas, that array\r\nbecame invincible in the world of men.\r\n\r\n\"'And as (both) the armies stood at dawn of day waiting for sunrise, a\r\nwind began to blow with drops of water (falling), and although there were\r\nno clouds, the roll of thunder was heard. And dry winds began to blow all\r\naround, bearing a shower of pointed pebbles along the ground. And as\r\nthick dust arose, covering the world with darkness. And large meteors\r\nbegan to fall east-wards, O bull of Bharata's race, and striking against\r\nthe rising Sun, broke in fragments with loud noise. When the troops stood\r\narrayed, O bull of Bharata's race, the Sun rose divested of splendour,\r\nand the Earth trembled with a loud sound, and cracked in many places, O\r\nchief of the Bharatas, with loud noise. And the roll of thunder, O king,\r\nwas heard frequently on all sides. So thick was the dust that arose that\r\nnothing could be seen. And the tall standards (of the combatants),\r\nfurnished with strings of bells, decked with golden ornaments, garlands\r\nof flowers, and rich drapery, graced with banners and resembling the Sun\r\nin splendour, being suddenly shaken by the wind, gave a loud jingling\r\nnoise like that of a forest of palmyra trees (when moved by the wind). It\r\nwas thus that those tigers among men, the sons of Pandu, ever taking\r\ndelight in battle, stood having disposed their troops in counter-array\r\nagainst the army of thy son, and sucking as it were, the marrow, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race, of our warriors, and casting their eyes on Bhimasena\r\nstationed at their head, mace in hand.\""

To which side were the Sun, the\r\nMoon and the wind hostile, and against whom did the beasts of prey utter\r\ninauspicious sounds? Who were those young men, the complexions of whose\r\nfaces were cheerful? Tell me all these truly and duly.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said,--\"Both armies, when arrayed, were equally joyful, O king.\r\nBoth armies looked equally beautiful, assuming the aspect of blossoming\r\nwoods, and both armies were full of elephants, cars and horses. Both\r\narmies were vast and terrible in aspect; and so also, O Bharata, none of\r\nthem could bear the other. Both of them were arrayed for conquering the\r\nvery heavens, and both of them consisted of excellent persons. The\r\nKauravas belonging to the Dhritarashtra party stood facing the west,\r\nwhile the Parthas stood facing the east, addrest for fight. The troops of\r\nthe Kauravas looked like the army of the chief of the Danavas, while that\r\nof the Pandavas looked like the army of the celestials. The wind began to\r\nblow from behind the Pandavas (against the face of the Dhartarashtras),\r\nand the beasts of prey began to yell against the Dhartarashtras. The\r\nelephants belonging to thy sons could not bear the strong odour of the\r\ntemporal juice emitted by the huge elephants (of the Pandavas). And\r\nDuryodhana rode on an elephant of the complexion of the lotus, with rent\r\ntemples, graced with a golden Kaksha (on its back), and cased in an\r\narmour of steel net-work. And he was in the very centre of the Kurus and\r\nwas adored by eulogists and bards. And a white umbrella of lunar\r\neffulgence was held over his head graced with a golden chain. Him Sakuni,\r\nthe ruler of the Gandharas, followed with mountaineers of Gandhara placed\r\nall around. And the venerable Bhishma was at the head of all the troops,\r\nwith a white umbrella held over his head, armed with bow and sword, with\r\na white headgear, with a white banner (on his car), and with white steeds\r\n(yoked thereto), and altogether looking like a white mountain. In\r\nBhishma's division were all the sons of Dhritarashtra, and also Sala who\r\nwas a countryman of the Valhikas, and also all those Kshatriyas called\r\nAmvastas, and those called Sindhus, and those also that are called\r\nSauviras, and the heroic dwellers of the country of the five rivers. And\r\non a golden car unto which were yoked red steeds, the high-souled Drona,\r\nbow in hand and with never-failing heart, the preceptor of almost all the\r\nkings, remained behind all the troops, protecting them like Indra. And\r\nSaradwat's son, that fighter in the van,[110] that high-souled and mighty\r\nbowman, called also Gautama, conversant with all modes of warfare,\r\naccompanied by the Sakas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the Pahlavas,\r\ntook up his position at the northern point of the army. That large force\r\nwhich was well protected by mighty car-warriors of the Vrishni and the\r\nBhoja races, as also by the warriors of Surashtra well-armed and\r\nwell-acquainted with the uses of weapons, and which was led by\r\nKritavarman, proceeded towards the south of the army. Ten thousand cars\r\nof the Samasaptakas who were created for either the death or the fame of\r\nArjuna, and who, accomplished in arms, intended to follow Arjuna at his\r\nheels[111] all went out as also the brave Trigartas. In thy army, O\r\nBharata, were a thousand elephants of the foremost fighting powers. Unto\r\neach elephant was assigned a century of cars; unto each car, a hundred\r\nhorsemen; unto each horseman, ten bowmen; and unto each bowman ten\r\ncombatants armed with sword and shield. Thus, O Bharata, were thy\r\ndivisions arrayed by Bhishma. Thy generalissimo Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu, as each day dawned, sometimes disposed thy troops in the human\r\narmy, sometimes in the celestial, sometimes in the Gandharva, and\r\nsometimes in the Asura. Thronged with a large number of Maharathas, and\r\nroaring like the very ocean, the Dhartarashtra army, arrayed by Bhishma,\r\nstood facing the west for battle. Illimitable as thy army was, O ruler of\r\nmen, it looked terrible; but the army of the Pandavas, although it was\r\nnot such (in number), yet seemed to me to be very large and invincible\r\nsince Kesava and Arjuna were its leader.\""

O invincible one, thou hast Narayana (again) for aiding thee.\r\nThou art incapable of being defeated by foes, even by the wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt himself.'\r\n\r\n'\"Having said this, the boon-giving goddess disappeared soon. The son of\r\nKunti, however, obtaining that boon, regarded himself as successful, and\r\nthe son of Pritha then mounted his own excellent car. And then Krishna\r\nand Arjuna, seated on the same car, blew their celestial conches. The man\r\nthat recites this hymn rising at dawn, hath no fear any time from\r\nYakshas, Rakshasas, and Pisachas. He can have no enemies; he hath no\r\nfear, from snakes and all animals that have fangs and teeth, as also from\r\nkings. He is sure to be victorious in all disputes, and if bound, he is\r\nfreed from his bonds. He is sure to get over all difficulties, is freed\r\nfrom thieves, is ever victorious in battle and winneth the goddess of\r\nprosperity for ever. With health and strength, he liveth for a hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"I have known all this through the grace of Vyasa endued with great\r\nwisdom. Thy wicked sons, however, all entangled in the meshes of death,\r\ndo not, from ignorance, know them to be Nara and Narayana. Nor do they,\r\nentangled in the meshes of death, know that the hour of this kingdom hath\r\narrived. Dwaipayana and Narada, and Kanwa, and the sinless Rama, had all\r\nprevented thy son. But he did not accept their words. There where\r\nrighteousness is, there are glory and beauty. There where modesty is,\r\nthere are prosperity and intelligence. There where righteousness is,\r\nthere is Krishna; and there where Krishna is, there is victory.\""

There (in that army) are many\r\nbrave and mighty bowmen, who in battle are equal to Bhima and Arjuna.\r\n(They are) Yuyudhana, and Virata, and that mighty car-warrior Drupada,\r\nand Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana, and the ruler of Kasi endued with great\r\nenergy; and Purujit, and Kuntibhoja, and Saivya that bull among men; and\r\nYudhamanyu of great prowess, and Uttamaujas of great energy; and\r\nSubhadra's son, and the sons of Draupadi, all of whom are mighty\r\ncar-warriors. Hear, however, O best of regenerate ones, who are the\r\ndistinguished ones among us, the leader of army. I will name them to thee\r\nfor (thy) information. (They are) thyself, and Bhishma, and Karna, and\r\nKripa who is ever victorious; and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and\r\nSaumadatta, and Jayadratha.[124] Besides these, are many heroic warriors,\r\nprepared to lay down their lives for my sake, armed with diverse kinds of\r\nweapons, and all accomplished in battle. Our army, therefore, protected\r\nby Bhishma, is insufficient. This force, however, of these (the\r\nPandavas), protected by Bhima, is sufficient.[125] Stationing yourselves\r\nthen in the entrances of the divisions that have been assigned to you,\r\nall of you protect Bhishma alone.--(Just at this time) the valiant and\r\nvenerable grandsire of the Kurus, affording great joy to him (Duryodhana)\r\nby loudly uttering a leonine roar, blew (his) conch. Then conches and\r\ndrums and cymbals and horns were sounded at once and the noise (made)\r\nbecame a loud uproar. Then Madhava and Pandu's son (Arjuna), both\r\nstationed on a great car unto which were yoked white steeds, blew their\r\ncelestial conches. And Hrishikesha blew (the conch called) Panchajanya\r\nand Dhananjaya (that called) Devadatta; and Vrikodara of terrible deeds\r\nblew the huge conch (called) Paundra. And Kunti's son king Yudhishthira\r\nblew (the conch called) Anantavijaya; while Nakula and Sahadeva, (those\r\nconches called respectively) Sughosa and Manipushpaka.[126] And that\r\nsplendid bowman, the ruler of Kasi and that mighty car-warrior,\r\nSikhandin, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and that unvanquished Satyaki, and\r\nDrupada, and the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of\r\nSubhadra--all these, O lord of earth, severally blew their conches. And\r\nthat blare, loudly reverberating through the welkin, and the earth, rent\r\nthe hearts of the Dhartarashtras. Then beholding the Dhartarashtra troops\r\ndrawn up, the ape-bannered son of Pandu, rising his bow, when, the\r\nthrowing of missiles had just commenced, said these words, O lord of\r\nearth, to Hrishikesha.[127]\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,--'O thou that knoweth no deterioration, place my car (once)\r\nbetween the two armies, so that I may observe these that stand here\r\ndesirous of battle, and with whom I shall have to contend in the labours\r\nof this struggle.[128] I will observe those who are assembled here and\r\nwho are prepared to fight for doing what is agreeable in battle to the\r\nevil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued,---'Thus addressed by Gudakesa, O Bharata, Hrishikesa,\r\nplacing that excellent car between the two armies, in view of Bhishma and\r\nDrona and all the kings of the earth, said,--'Behold, O Partha these\r\nassembled Kurus,--And there the son of Pritha beheld, standing (his)\r\nsires and grandsons, and friends, and father-in-law and well-wishers, in\r\nboth the armies. Beholding all those kinsmen standing (there), the son of\r\nKunti, possessed by excessive pity, despondingly said (these words).\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,--'Beholding these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled together\r\nand eager for the fight, my limbs, become languid, and my mouth becomes\r\ndry. My body trembles, and my hair stands on end. Gandiva slips from my\r\nhand, and my skin burns. I am unable to stand (any longer); my mind seems\r\nto wander. I behold adverse omens, too, O Kesava. I do not desire\r\nvictory, O Krishna, not sovereignty, nor pleasures. Of what use would\r\nsovereignty be to us, O Govinda, or enjoyments, or even life, since they,\r\nfor whose sake sovereignty, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us,\r\nare here arrayed for battle ready to give up life and wealth, viz.,\r\npreceptors, sires, sons and grandsires, maternal uncles, father-in-laws,\r\ngrandsons, brother-in-laws, and kinsmen. I wish not to slay these though\r\nthey slay me, O slayer of Madhu, even for the sake of the sovereignty of\r\nthe three worlds, what then for the sake of (this) earth?[129] What\r\ngratification can be ours, O Janardana, by slaying the Dhartarashtras?\r\nEven if they be regarded as foes,[130] sin will overtake us if we slay\r\nthem. Therefore, it behoveth us not to slay the sons of Dhritarashtra who\r\nare our own kinsmen.[131] How, O Madhava can we be happy by killing our\r\nown kinsmen? Even if these, with judgments perverted by avarice, do not\r\nsee the evil that ariseth from the extermination of a race, and the sin\r\nof internecine quarrels, why should not we, O Janarddana, who see the\r\nevils of the extermination of a race, learn to abstain from that sin? A\r\nrace being destroyed, the eternal customs of that race are lost; and upon\r\nthose customs being lost, sin overpowers the whole race. From the\r\npredominance of sin, O Krishna, the women of that race become corrupt.\r\nAnd the women becoming corrupt, an intermingling of castes happeneth, O\r\ndescendant of Vrishni. This intermingling of castes leadeth to hell both\r\nthe destroyer of the race and the race itself. The ancestors of those\r\nfall (from heaven), their rites of pinda and water ceasing. By these sins\r\nof destroyers of races, causing intermixture of castes, the rules of\r\ncaste and the eternal rites of families become extinct. We have heard, O\r\nJanarddana, that men whose family rites become extinct, ever dwell in\r\nhell. Alas, we have resolved to perpetrate a great sin, for we are ready\r\nto slay our own kinsmen from lust of the sweets of sovereignty. Better\r\nwould it be for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapon in hand, should\r\nin battle slay me (myself) unavenging unarmed.--'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued,--\"Having spoken thus on the field of battle, Arjuna,\r\nhis mind troubled with grief, casting aside his bow and arrows, sat down\r\non his car.\"\r\n\r\n[Here ends the first lesson entitled \"Survey of Forces\"[132] in the\r\ndialogue between Krishna and Arjuna of the Bhagavadgita, the essence of\r\nreligion, the knowledge of Brahma, and the system of Yoga, comprised\r\nwithin the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata of Vyasa containing one\r\nhundred thousand verses.]"

Let no\r\neffeminacy be thine, O son of Kunti. This suits thee not. Shaking off\r\nthis vile weakness of hearts, arise, O chastiser of foes.--\"\r\n\r\nArjuna said,--\"How, O slayer of Madhu, can I with arrows contend in\r\nbattle against Bhishma and Drona, deserving as they are. O slayer of\r\nfoes, of worship?[133] Without slaying (one's) preceptors of great glory,\r\nit is well (for one), to live on even alms in this world. By slaying\r\npreceptors, even if they are avaricious of wealth, I should only enjoy\r\npleasures that are bloodstained![134] We know not which of the two is of\r\ngreater moment to us, viz., whether we should conquer them or they should\r\nconquer us. By slaying whom we would not like to live,--even they, the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra, stand before (us). My nature affected by the taint\r\nof compassion, my mind unsettled about (my) duty, I ask thee. Tell me\r\nwhat is assuredly good (for me). I am thy disciple. O, instruct me, I\r\nseek thy aid.[135] I do not see (that) which would dispel that grief of\r\nmine blasting my very senses, even if I obtain a prosperous kingdom on\r\nearth without a foe or the very sovereignty of the gods.[136]'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said,--Having said this unto Hrishikesa, that chastiser of\r\nfoes-Gudakesa--(once more) addressed Govinda, saying,--'I will not\r\nfight,'--and then remained silent.[137] Unto him overcome by despondency,\r\nHrishikesa, in the midst of the two armies, said.\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said,--'Thou mournest those that deserve not to be mourned.\r\nThou speakest also the words of the (so-called) wise. Those, however,\r\nthat are (really) wise, grieve neither for the dead nor for the living.\r\nIt is not that, I or you or those rulers of men never were, or that all\r\nof us shall not hereafter be. Of an Embodied being, as childhood, youth,\r\nand, decrepitude are in this body, so (also) is the acquisition of\r\nanother body. The man, who is wise, is never deluded in this.[138] The\r\ncontacts of the senses with their (respective) objects producing\r\n(sensations of) heat and cold, pleasure and pain, are not permanent,\r\nhaving (as they do) a beginning and an end. Do thou. O Bharata, endure\r\nthem. For the man whom these afflict not, O bull among men, who is the\r\nsame in pain and pleasure and who is firm in mind, is fit for\r\nemancipation.[139] There is no (objective) existence of anything that is\r\ndistinct from the soul; nor non-existence of anything possessing the\r\nvirtues of the soul. This conclusion in respect of both these hath been\r\narrived at by those that know the truths (of things).[140] Know that [the\r\nsoul] to be immortal by which all this [universe] is pervaded. No one can\r\ncompass the destruction of that which is imperishable. It hath been said\r\nthat those bodies of the Embodied (soul) which is eternal, indestructible\r\nand infinite, have an end. Do thou, therefore, fight, O Bharata. He who\r\nthinks it (the soul) to be the slayer and he who thinks it to be the\r\nslain, both of them know nothing; for it neither slays nor is slain. It\r\nis never born, nor doth it ever die; nor, having existed, will it exist\r\nno more. Unborn, unchangeable, eternal, and ancient, it is not slain upon\r\nthe body being perished. That man who knoweth it to be indestructible,\r\nunchangeable, without decay, how and whom can he slay or cause to be\r\nslain? As a man, casting off robes that are worn out, putteth on others\r\nthat are new, so the Embodied (soul), casting off bodies that are worn\r\nout, entereth other bodies that are new. Weapons cleave it not, fire\r\nconsumeth it not; the waters do not drench it, nor doth the wind waste\r\nit. It is incapable of being cut, burnt, drenched, or dried up. It is\r\nunchangeable, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal. It is said to be\r\nimperceivable, inconceivable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing it to\r\nbe such, it behoveth thee not to mourn (for it). Then again even if thou\r\nregardest it as constantly born and constantly dead, it behoveth thee not\r\nyet, O mighty-armed one, to mourn (for it) thus. For, of one that is\r\nborn, death is certain; and of one that is dead, birth is certain.\r\nTherefore. it behoveth thee not to mourn in a matter that is unavoidable.\r\nAll beings (before birth) were unmanifest. Only during an interval\r\n(between birth and death), O Bharata, are they manifest; and then again,\r\nwhen death comes, they become (once more) unmanifest. What grief then is\r\nthere in this? One looks upon it as a marvel; another speaks of it as a\r\nmarvel. Yet even after having heard of it, no one apprehends it truly.\r\nThe Embodied (soul), O Bharata, is ever indestructible in everyone's\r\nbody. Therefore, it behoveth thee not to grieve for all (those)\r\ncreatures. Casting thy eyes on the (prescribed) duties of thy order, it\r\nbehoveth thee not to waver, for there is nothing else that is better for\r\na Kshatriya than a battle fought fairly. Arrived of itself and (like\r\nunto) an open gate of heaven, happy are those Kshatriyas, O Partha, that\r\nobtain such a fight. But if thou dost not fight such a just battle, thou\r\nshalt then incur sin by abandoning the duties of thy order and thy fame.\r\nPeople will then proclaim thy eternal infamy, and to one that is held in\r\nrespect, infamy is greater (as an evil) than death itself. All great\r\ncar-warriors will regard thee as abstaining from battle from fear, and\r\nthou wilt be thought lightly by those that had (hitherto) esteemed thee\r\nhighly. Thy enemies, decrying thy prowess, will say many words which\r\nshould not be said. What can be more painful than that? Slain, thou wilt\r\nattain to heaven; or victorious, thou wilt enjoy the Earth. Therefore,\r\narise, O son of Kunti, resolved for battle. Regarding pleasure and pain,\r\ngain and loss, victory and defeat, as equal, do battle for battle's sake\r\nand sin will not be thine.[141] This knowledge, that hath been\r\ncommunicated to thee is (taught) in the Sankhya (system). Listen now to\r\nthat (inculcated) in Yoga (system). Possessed of that knowledge, thou, O\r\nPartha, wilt cast off the bonds of action. In this (the Yoga system)\r\nthere is no waste of even the first attempt. There are no impediments.\r\nEven a little of this (form of) piety delivers from great fear.[142] Here\r\nin this path, O son of Kuru, there is only one state of mind, consisting\r\nin firm devotion (to one object, viz., securing emancipation). The minds\r\nof those, however, that are not firmly devoted (to this), are\r\nmany-branched (un-settled) and attached to endless pursuits. That flowery\r\ntalk which, they that are ignorant, they that delight in the words of the\r\nVedas, they, O Partha, that say that there is nothing else, they whose\r\nminds are attached to worldly pleasures, they that regard (a) heaven (of\r\npleasures and enjoyments) as the highest object of acquisition,--utter\r\nand promises birth as the fruit of action and concerns itself with\r\nmultifarious rites of specific characters for the attainment of pleasures\r\nand power,--delude their hearts and the minds of these men who are\r\nattached to pleasures and power cannot be directed to contemplation (of\r\nthe divine being) regarding it as the sole means of emancipation.[143]\r\nThe Vedas are concerned with three qualities, (viz., religion, profit,\r\nand pleasure). Be thou, O Arjuna, free from them, unaffected by pairs of\r\ncontraries (such as pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc.), ever\r\nadhering to patience without anxiety for new acquisitions or protection\r\nof those already acquired, and self-possessed, whatever objects are\r\nserved by a tank or well, may all be served by a vast sheet of water\r\nextending all around; so whatever objects may be served by all the Vedas,\r\nmay all be had by a Brahmana having knowledge (of self or Brahma).[144]\r\nThy concern is with work only, but not with the fruit (of work). Let not\r\nthe fruit be thy motive for work; nor let thy inclination be for\r\ninaction. Staying in devotion, apply thyself to work, casting off\r\nattachment (to it), O Dhananjaya, and being the same in success or\r\nunsuccess. This equanimity is called Yoga (devotion). Work (with desire\r\nof fruit) is far inferior to devotion, O Dhananjaya. Seek thou the\r\nprotection of devotion. They that work for the sake of fruit are\r\nmiserable. He also that hath devotion throws off, even in this world,\r\nboth good actions and bad actions. Therefore, apply thyself to devotion.\r\nDevotion is only cleverness in action. The wise, possessed of devotion,\r\ncast off the fruit born of action, and freed from the obligation of\r\n(repeated) birth, attain to that region where there is no unhappiness.\r\nWhen thy mind shall have crossed the maze of delusion, then shalt thou\r\nattain to an indifference as regards the hearable and the heard.[145]\r\nWhen thy mind, distracted (now) by what thou hast heard (about the means\r\nof acquiring the diverse objects of life), will be firmly and immovably\r\nfixed on contemplation, then wilt thou attain to devotion.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,--What, O Kesava, are the indications of one whose mind is\r\nfixed on contemplation? How should one of steady mind speak, how sit, how\r\nmove?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said,--'When one casts off all the desires of his heart and\r\nis pleased within (his) self with self, then is one said to be of steady\r\nmind. He whose mind is not agitated amid calamities, whose craving for\r\npleasure is gone, who is freed from attachment (to worldly objects), fear\r\nand wrath, is said to be a Muni of steady mind. His is steadiness of mind\r\nwho is without affection everywhere, and who feeleth no exultation and no\r\naversion on obtaining diverse objects that are agreeable and\r\ndisagreeable. When one withdraws his senses from the objects of (those)\r\nsenses as the tortoise its limbs from all sides, even his is steadiness\r\nof mind. Objects of senses fall back from an abstinent person, but not so\r\nthe passion (for those objects). Even the passion recedes from one who\r\nhas beheld the Supreme (being).[146] The agitating senses, O son of\r\nKunti, forcibly draw away the mind of even a wise man striving hard to\r\nkeep himself aloof from them. Restraining them all, one should stay in\r\ncontemplation, making me his sole refuge. For his is steadiness of mind\r\nwhose senses are under control. Thinking of the objects of sense, a\r\nperson's attachment is begotten towards them. From attachment springeth\r\nwrath; from wrath ariseth want of discrimination; from want of\r\ndiscrimination, loss of memory; from loss of memory, loss of\r\nunderstanding; and from loss of understanding (he) is utterly ruined. But\r\nthe self-restrained man, enjoying objects (of sense) with senses freed\r\nfrom attachment and aversion under his own control, attaineth to peace\r\n(of mind). On peace (of mind) being attained, the annihilation of all his\r\nmiseries taketh place, since the mind of him whose heart is peaceful soon\r\nbecometh steady.[147] He who is not self-restrained hath no contemplation\r\n(of self). He who hath no contemplation hath no peace (of mind).[148]\r\nWhence can there be happiness for him who hath no peace (of mind)? For\r\nthe heart that follows in the wake of the sense moving (among their\r\nobjects) destroys his understanding like the wind destroying a boat in\r\nthe waters.[149] Therefore, O thou of mighty arms, his is steadiness of\r\nmind whose senses are restrained on all sides from the objects of sense.\r\nThe restrained man is awake when it is night for all creatures; and when\r\nother creatures are awake that is night to a discerning Muni.[150] He\r\ninto whom all objects of desire enter, even as the waters enter the ocean\r\nwhich (though) constantly replenished still maintains its water-mark\r\nunchanged--(he) obtains peace (of mind) and not one that longeth for\r\nobjects of desire. That man who moveth about, giving up all objects of\r\ndesire, who is free from craving (for enjoyments) and who hath no\r\naffection and no pride, attaineth to peace (of mind). This, O Partha, is\r\nthe divine state. Attaining to it, one is never deluded. Abiding in it\r\none obtains, on death, absorption into the Supreme Self.'"

Therefore,\r\ntell (me) one thing definitely by which I may attain to what is good.'\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said,--'It hath already been said by me, O sinless one,\r\nthat here are, in this world, two kinds of devotion; that of the Sankhyas\r\nthrough knowledge and that of the yogins through work. A man doth not\r\nacquire freedom from work from (only) the non-performance of work. Nor\r\ndoth he acquire final emancipation from only renunciation (of work). No\r\none can abide even for a moment without doing work.[151] That man of\r\ndeluded soul who, curbing the organs of sense, liveth mentally cherishing\r\nthe objects of sense, is said to be a dissembler. He however, O Arjuna,\r\nwho restraining (his) senses by his mind, engageth in devotion (in the\r\nform) of work with the organs of work, and is free from attachment, is\r\ndistinguished (above all). (Therefore), do thou always apply yourself to\r\nwork, for action is better than inaction. Even the support of thy body\r\ncannot be accomplished without work.[152] This world is fettered by all\r\nwork other than that which is (performed) for Sacrifice. (Therefore), O\r\nson of Kunti, perform work for the sake of that, freed from\r\nattachment.[153] In olden times, the Lord of Creation, creating men and\r\nsacrifice together, said,--flourish by means of this (Sacrifice). Let\r\nthis (Sacrifice) be to you (all) the dispenser of all objects cherished\r\nby you. Rear the gods with this, and let the gods (in return) rear you.\r\nThus fulfilling the mutual interest you will obtain that which is\r\nbeneficial (to you).[154] Propitiated with sacrifices the gods will\r\nbestow on you the pleasures you desire. He who enjoyeth (himself) without\r\ngiving them what they have given, is assuredly a thief. The good who eat\r\nthe remnant of sacrifices are freed from all sins. Those unrighteous ones\r\nincur sin who dress food for their own sake.--From food are all\r\ncreatures; and sacrifice is the outcome of work.[155] Know that work\r\nproceeds from the Vedas; Vedas have proceeded from Him who hath no decay.\r\nTherefore, the all-pervading Supreme Being is installed in\r\nsacrifice.[156] He who conformeth not to this wheel that is thus\r\nrevolving, that man of sinful life delighting (the indulgence of) his\r\nsenses, liveth in vain, O Partha.[157] The man, however, that is attached\r\nto self only, that is contented with self, and that is pleased in his\r\nself,--hath no work (to do). He hath no concern whatever with action nor\r\nwith any omission here. Nor, amongst all creatures, is there any upon\r\nwhom his interest dependeth.[158] Therefore, always do work that should\r\nbe done, without attachment. The man who performeth work without\r\nattachment, attaineth to the Supreme. By work alone, Janaka and others,\r\nattained the accomplishment of their objects. Having regard also to the\r\nobservance by men of their duties, it behoveth thee to work. Whatever a\r\ngreat man doth, is also done by vulgar people. Ordinary men follow the\r\nideal set by them (the great).[159] There is nothing whatever for me, O\r\nPartha, to do in the three worlds, (since I have) nothing for me which\r\nhath not been acquired; still I engage in action.[160] Because if at any\r\ntime I do not, without sloth, engage in action, men would follow my path,\r\nO Partha, on all sides. The worlds would perish if I did not perform\r\nwork, and I should cause intermixture of castes and ruin these people. As\r\nthe ignorant work, O Bharata, having attachment to the performer, so\r\nshould a wise man work without being attached, desiring to make men\r\nobservant of their duties. A wise man should not cause confusion of\r\nunderstanding amongst ignorant persons, who have attachment to work\r\nitself; (on the other hand) he should (himself) acting with devotion\r\nengage them to all (kinds of) work. All works are, in every way, done by\r\nthe qualities of nature. He, whose mind is deluded by egoism, however,\r\nregards himself as the actor.[161] But he, O mighty-armed one, who\r\nknoweth the distinction (of self) from qualities and work, is not\r\nattached to work, considering that it is his senses alone (and not his\r\nself) that engage in their objects.[162] Those who are deluded by the\r\nqualities of nature, become attached to the works done by the qualities.\r\nA person of perfect knowledge should not bewilder those men of imperfect\r\nknowledge.[163] Devoting all work to me, with (thy) mind directed to\r\nself, engage in battle, without desire, without affection and with thy\r\n(heart's) weakness dispelled.[164] Those men who always follow this\r\nopinion of mine with faith and without cavil attain to final emancipation\r\neven by work. But they who cavil at and do not follow this opinion of\r\nmine, know, that, bereft of all knowledge and without discrimination,\r\nthey are ruined. Even a wise man acts according to his own nature. All\r\nliving beings follow (their own) nature. What then would restraint avail?\r\nThe senses have, as regards the objects of the senses, either affection\r\nor aversion fixed. One should not submit to these, for they are obstacles\r\nin one's way.[165] One's own duty, even if imperfectly performed, is\r\nbetter than being done by other even if well performed. Death in\r\n(performance of) one's own duty is preferable. (The adoption of) the duty\r\nof another carries fear (with it).\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Impelled by whom, O son of the Vrishni race, doth a man\r\ncommit sin, even though unwilling and as if constrained by force'?\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said,--'It is desire, it is wrath, born of the attribute of\r\npassion; it is all devouring, it is very sinful. Know this to be the foe\r\nin this world.[166] As fire is enveloped by smoke, a mirror by dust, the\r\nfoetus by the womb, so is this enveloped by desire. Knowledge, O son of\r\nKunti, is enveloped by this constant foe of the wise in the form of\r\ndesire which is insatiable and like a fire. The senses, the mind and the\r\nunderstanding are said to be its abode. With these it deludeth the\r\nembodied self, enveloping (his) knowledge. Therefore, restraining (thy)\r\nsenses first, O bull of Bharata's race, cast off this wicked thing, for\r\nit destroyeth knowledge derived from instruction and meditation.[167] It\r\nhath been said that the senses are superior (to the body which is inert).\r\nSuperior to the senses is the mind. Superior to the mind is the\r\nknowledge. But which is superior to knowledge is He.[168] Thus knowing\r\nthat which is superior to knowledge and restraining (thy) self by self,\r\nslay, O mighty-armed one, the enemy in the shape of desire which is\r\ndifficult to conquer.'\""

Descending thus from generation, the Royal sages came to know\r\nit. But, O chastiser of foes, by (lapse of a) long time that devotion\r\nbecame lost to the world. Even the same (system of) devotion hath today\r\nbeen declared by me to thee, for thou art my devotee and friend, (and)\r\nthis is a great mystery.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,--'Thy birth is posterior; Vivaswat's birth is prior. How\r\nshall I understand then that thou hadst first declared (it)?'\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said,--'Many births of mine have passed away, O Arjuna, as\r\nalso of thine. These all I know, but thou dost not, O chastiser of foes.\r\nThough (I am) unborn and of essence that knoweth no deterioration, though\r\n(I am) the lord of all creatures, still, relying on my own (material)\r\nnature I take birth by my own (powers) of illusion. Whenever, O Bharata,\r\nloss of piety and the rise of impiety occurreth, on those occasions do I\r\ncreate myself. For the protection of the righteous and for the\r\ndestruction of the evil doers, for the sake of establishing Piety, I am\r\nborn age after age. He who truly knoweth my divine birth and work to be\r\nsuch, casting off (his body) is not born again; (on the other hand) he\r\ncometh to me, O Arjuna. Many who have been freed from attachment, fear,\r\nwrath, who were full of me, and who relied on me, have, cleansed by\r\nknowledge and asceticism, attained to my essence. In whatsoever manner\r\nmen come to me, in the selfsame manner do I accept them. It is my way, O\r\nPartha, that men follow on all sides.[169] Those in this world who are\r\ndesirous of the success of action worship the gods, for in this world of\r\nmen success resulting from action is soon attained. The quadruple\r\ndivision of castes was created by me according to the distinction of\r\nqualities and duties. Though I am the author thereof, (yet) know me to be\r\nnot their author and undecaying.[170] Actions do not touch me. I have no\r\nlonging for the fruits of actions. He that knoweth me thus is not impeded\r\nby actions. Knowing this, even men of old who were desirous of\r\nemancipation performed work. Therefore, do thou also perform work as was\r\ndone by ancients of the remote past. What is action and what is\r\ninaction,--even the learned are perplexed at this. Therefore, I will tell\r\nthee about action (so that) knowing it thou mayst be freed from evil. One\r\nshould have knowledge of action, and one should have knowledge of\r\nforbidden actions: one should also know of inaction. The course of action\r\nis incomprehensible. He, who sees inaction in action and action in\r\ninaction, is wise among men; he is possessed of devotion; and he is a\r\ndoer of all actions. The learned call him wise whose efforts are all free\r\nfrom desire (of fruit) and (consequent) will, and whose actions have all\r\nbeen consumed by the fire of knowledge.[171] Whoever, resigning all\r\nattachment to the fruit of action, is ever contented and is dependent on\r\nnone, doth nought, indeed, although engaged in action. He who, without\r\ndesire, with mind and the senses under control, and casting off all\r\nconcerns, performeth action only for the preservation of the body,\r\nincurreth no sin.[172] He who is contented with what is earned without\r\nexertion, who hath risen superior to the pairs of opposites, who is\r\nwithout jealousy, who is equable in success and failure, is not fettered\r\n(by action) even though he works. All his actions perish who acts for the\r\nsake of sacrifice,[173] who is without affections, who is free (from\r\nattachments), and whose mind is fixed upon knowledge. Brahma is the\r\nvessel (with which the libation is poured); Brahma is the libation (that\r\nis offered); Brahma is the fire on which by Brahma is poured (the\r\nlibation); Brahma is the goal to which he proceedeth by fixing his mind\r\non Brahma itself which is the action.[174] Some devotees perform\r\nsacrifice to the gods. Others, by means of sacrifice, offer up sacrifices\r\nto the fire of Brahma.[175] Others offer up (as sacrificial libation) the\r\nsenses of which hearing is the first to the fire of restraint. Others\r\n(again) offer up (as libations) the objects of sense of which sound is\r\nthe first to the fire of the senses.[176] Others (again) offer up all the\r\nfunctions of the senses and the functions of the vital winds to the fire\r\nof devotion by self-restraint kindled by knowledge.[177] Others again\r\nperform the sacrifice of wealth, the sacrifice of ascetic austerities,\r\nthe sacrifice of meditation, the sacrifice of (Vedic) study, the\r\nsacrifice of knowledge, and others are ascetics of rigid vows.[178] Some\r\noffer up the upward vital wind (Prana) to the downward vital wind\r\n(apana); and others, the downward vital wind to the upward vital wind;\r\nsome, arresting the course of (both) the upward and the downward vital\r\nwinds, are devoted to the restraint of the vital winds. Others of\r\nrestricted rations, offer the vital winds to the vital winds.[179] Even\r\nall these who are conversant with sacrifice, whose sins have been\r\nconsumed by sacrifice, and who eat the remnants of sacrifice which are\r\namrita, attain to the eternal Brahma. (Even) this world is not for him\r\nwho doth not perform sacrifice. Whence then the other, O best of Kuru's\r\nrace? Thus diverse are the sacrifices occurring in the Vedas. Know that\r\nall of them result from action, and knowing this thou wilt be\r\nemancipated. The sacrifice of knowledge, O chastiser of foes, is superior\r\nto every sacrifice involving (the attainment of) fruits of action, for\r\nall action, O Partha, is wholly comprehended in knowledge.[180] Learn\r\nthat (Knowledge) by prostration, enquiry, and service. They who are\r\npossessed of knowledge and can see the truth, will teach thee that\r\nknowledge, knowing which, O son of Pandu, thou wilt not again come by\r\nsuch delusion, and by which thou wilt see the endless creatures (of the\r\nuniverse) in thyself (first) and then in me. Even if thou be the greatest\r\nsinner among all that are sinful, thou shalt yet cross over all\r\ntransgressions by the raft of knowledge. As a blazing fire, O Arjuna,\r\nreduceth fuel to ashes, so doth the fire of knowledge reduce all actions\r\nto ashes. For there is nothing here that is so cleansing as knowledge.\r\nOne who hath attained to success by devotion finds it without effort\r\nwithin his own self in time. He obtaineth knowledge, who hath faith and\r\nis intent on it and who hath his senses under control; obtaining\r\nknowledge one findeth the highest tranquillity in no length of time. One\r\nwho hath no knowledge and no faith, and whose minds is full of doubt, is\r\nlost. Neither this world, nor the next, nor happiness, is for him whose\r\nmind is full of doubt. Actions do not fetter him, O Dhananjaya, who hath\r\ncast off action by devotion, whose doubts have been dispelled by\r\nknowledge, and who is self-restrained. Therefore, destroying, by the\r\nsword of knowledge, this doubt of thine that is born of ignorance and\r\nthat dwelleth in thy mind, betake to devotion, (and) arise, O son of\r\nBharata.'"

Tell me definitely which one of\r\nthese two is superior.\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said--'Both abandonment of actions and application to\r\nactions lead to emancipation. But of these, application to action is\r\nsuperior to abandonment. He should always be known to be an ascetic who\r\nhath no aversion nor desire. For, being free from pairs of opposites, O\r\nthou of mighty arms, he is easily released from the bonds (of action).\r\nFools say, but not those that are wise, that Sankhya and Yoga are\r\ndistinct. One who stayeth in even one (of the two) reapeth the fruit of\r\nboth[181]. Whatever seat is attained by those who profess the Sankhya\r\nsystem, that too is reached by those who profess the Yoga. He seeth truly\r\nwho seeth Sankhya and Yoga as one.[182] But renunciation, O mighty-armed\r\none, without devotion (to action), is difficult to attain. The ascetic\r\nwho is engaged in devotion (by action) reacheth the Supreme Being without\r\ndelay. He who is engaged in devotion (by action) and is of pure soul, who\r\nhath conquered his body and subdued his senses, and who indentifieth\r\nhimself with all creatures, is not fettered though performing\r\n(action).[183] The man of devotion, who knoweth truth, thinking--I am\r\ndoing nothing--When seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving,\r\nsleeping, breathing, talking, excreting, taking, opening the eyelids or\r\nclosing them; he regardeth that it is the senses that are engaged in the\r\nobjects of senses.[184] He who renouncing attachment engageth in actions,\r\nresigning them to Brahma, is not touched by sin as the lotus-leaf (is not\r\ntouched) by water.[185] Those who are devotees, casting off attachment,\r\nperform actions (attaining) purity of self, with the body, the mind, the\r\nunderstanding, and even the senses (free from desire). He who is\r\npossessed of devotion, renouncing the fruit of action, attaineth to the\r\nhighest tranquillity. He, who is not possessed of devotion and is\r\nattached to the fruit of action, is fettered by action performed from\r\ndesire. The self-restrained embodied (self), renouncing all actions by\r\nthe mind, remains at ease within the house of nine gates, neither acting\r\nhimself nor causing (anything) to act.[186] The Lord is not the cause of\r\nthe capacity for action, or of the actions of men, or of the connection\r\nof actions and (their) fruit. It is nature that engages (in action). The\r\nLord receiveth no one's sin, nor also merit. By ignorance, knowledge is\r\nshrouded. It is for this that creatures are deluded. But of whomsoever\r\nthat ignorance hath been destroyed by knowledge of self, that knowledge\r\n(which is) like the Sun discloseth the Supreme Being. Those whose mind is\r\non Him, whose very soul is He, who abide in Him, and who have Him for\r\ntheir goal, depart never more to return, their sins being all destroyed\r\nby knowledge.[187] Those, who are wise cast an equal eye on a Brahmana\r\nendued with learning and modesty, on a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a\r\nchandala.[188] Even here has birth been conquered by them whose minds\r\nrest on equality; and since Brahma is faultless and equable, therefore,\r\nthey (are said to) abide in Brahma.[189] He whose mind is steady, who is\r\nnot deluded, who knows Brahma, and who rests in Brahma, doth not exult on\r\nobtaining anything that is agreeable, nor doth he grieve on obtaining\r\nthat is disagreeable. He whose mind is not attached to external objects\r\nof sense, obtaineth that happiness which is in self; and by concentrating\r\nhis mind on the contemplation of Brahma, he enjoyeth a happiness that is\r\nimperishable. The enjoyments born of the contact (of the senses with\r\ntheir objects) are productive of sorrow. He who is wise, O son of Kunti,\r\nnever taketh pleasure in these that have a beginning and an end. That man\r\nwhoever here, before the dissolution of the body, is able to endure the\r\nagitations resulting from desire and wrath, is fixed on contemplation,\r\nand is happy. He who findeth happiness within himself, (and) who sporteth\r\nwithin himself, he whose light (of knowledge) is deprived from within\r\nhimself, is a devotee, and becoming one with Brahma attaineth to\r\nabsorption into Brahma. Those saintly personages whose sins have been\r\ndestroyed, whose doubts have been dispelled, who are self-restrained, and\r\nwho are engaged in the good of all creatures, obtain absorption into\r\nBrahma. For these devotees who are freed from desire and wrath, whose\r\nminds are under control, and who have knowledge of self, absorption into\r\nBrahma exists both here and thereafter.[190] Excluding (from his mind)\r\nall external objects of sense, directing the visual glance between the\r\nbrows, mingling (into one) the upward and the downward life-breaths and\r\nmaking them pass through the nostrils, the devotee, who has restrained\r\nthe senses, the mind, and the understanding, being intent on\r\nemancipation, and who is freed from desire, fear, and wrath, is\r\nemancipated, indeed. Knowing me to be enjoyer of all sacrifices and\r\nascetic austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds, and friend of all\r\ncreatures, such a one obtaineth tranquillity.'"

When one is no\r\nlonger attached to the objects of the senses, nor to actions, and when\r\none renounces all resolves, then is. One said to have risen to devotion.\r\nOne should raise (his ) self by self; one should not degrade (his) self;\r\nfor one's own self is one's friend, and one's own self is one's\r\nenemy.[193] To him (only) who has subjugated his self by his self is self\r\na friend. But to him who has not subjugated his self, his self behaves\r\ninimically like an enemy. The soul of one who has subjugated his self and\r\nwho is in the enjoyment of tranquillity, is steadily fixed (on itself)\r\namid cold and heat, pleasure and pain, and also honour and dishonour.\r\nThat ascetic is said to be devoted whose mind is satisfied with knowledge\r\nand experience, who hath no affection, who hath subjugated his senses,\r\nand to whom a sod, a stone and gold are alike. He, who views equally\r\nwell-wishers, friends, foes, strangers that are indifferent to him, those\r\nwho take part with both sides, those who are objects of aversion, those\r\nwho are related (to him), those who are good, and those who are wicked,\r\nis distinguished (above all others). A devotee should always fix his mind\r\non contemplation, remaining in a secluded place alone, restraining both\r\nmind and body, without expectations (of any kind), and without concern\r\n(with anything).[194] Erecting his seat immovably on a clean spot, not\r\ntoo high nor too low, and spreading over it a piece of cloth, a\r\ndeer-skin, or blades of Kusa grass, and there seated on that seat, with\r\nmind fixed on one object, and restraining the functions of the heart and\r\nthe senses, one should practise contemplation for the purification of\r\nself. Holding body, head, and neck even, unmoved and steady, and casting\r\nhis glance on the tip of his nose, and without looking about in any of\r\nthe different directions, with mind in tranquillity, freed from fear,\r\nobservant of the practices of Brahmacharins, restraining the mind, with\r\nheart fixed on me, the devotee should sit down, regarding me as the\r\nobject of his attainment. Thus applying his soul constantly, the devotee\r\nwhose heart is restrained, attains to that tranquillity which culminates\r\nin final absorption and assimilation with me. Devotion is not one's, O\r\nArjuna, who eateth much, nor one's who doth not eat at all; nor one's who\r\nis addicted to too much sleep, nor one's who is always awake, devotion\r\nthat is destructive of misery is his who is temperate in food and\r\namusements, who duly exerts himself temperately in all his works, and who\r\nis temperate in sleep and vigils. When one's heart, properly restrained,\r\nis fixed on one's own self, then, indifferent to all objects of desire,\r\nhe is one called a devotee.[195] As a lamp in a windless spot doth not\r\nflicker, even that is the resemblance declared of a devotee whose heart\r\nhath been restrained and who applieth his self to abstraction. That\r\n(condition) in which the mind, restrained by practice of abstraction,\r\ntaketh rest, in which beholding self by self, one is gratified within\r\nself; in which one experienceth that highest felicity which is beyond the\r\n(sphere of the) senses and which the understanding (only) can grasp, and\r\nfixed on which one never swerveth from the truth; acquiring which one\r\nregards no other acquisition greater than it, and abiding in which one is\r\nnever moved by even the heaviest sorrow; that (Condition) should be known\r\nto be what is called devotion in which there is a severance of connection\r\nwith pain. That devotion should be practised with perseverance and with\r\nan undesponding heart.[196] Renouncing all desires without exception that\r\nare born of resolves, restraining the group of the senses on all sides by\r\nmind alone, one should, by slow degrees, become quiescent (aided) by\r\n(his) understanding controlled by patience, and then directing his mind\r\nto self should think of nothing.[197] Wheresoever the mind, which is (by\r\nnature) restless and unsteady, may run, restraining it from those, one\r\nshould direct it to self alone. Indeed, unto such a devotee whose mind is\r\nin tranquillity, whose passions have been suppressed, who hath become one\r\nwith Brahma and who is free from sin, the highest felicity cometh (of his\r\nown accord). Thus applying his soul constantly (to abstraction), the\r\ndevotee, freed from sin, easily obtaineth that highest happiness, viz.,\r\nwith Brahma. He who hath devoted his self to abstraction casting an equal\r\neye everywhere, beholdeth his self in all creatures and all creatures in\r\nhis self. Unto him who beholdeth me in everything and beholdeth\r\neverything in me. I am never lost and he also is never lost to me.[198]\r\nHe who worshippeth me as abiding in all creatures, holding yet that all\r\nis one, is a devotee, and whatever mode of life he may lead, he liveth in\r\nme. That devotee, O Arjuna, who casteth an equal eye everywhere,\r\nregarding all things as his own self and the happiness and misery of\r\nothers as his own, is deemed to be the best.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'This devotion by means of equanimity which thou hast\r\ndeclared, O slayer of Madhu,--on account of restlessness of the mind I do\r\nnot see its stable presence.[199] O Krishna, the mind is restless,\r\nboisterous, perverse, and obstinate. Its restraint I regard to be as\r\ndifficult of accomplishment as the restraint of the wind.'\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said, 'Without doubt, O thou of mighty arms the mind is\r\ndifficult of subjugation and is restless. With practice, however, O son\r\nof Kunti, and with the abandonment of desire, it can be controlled. It is\r\nmy belief that by him whose mind is not restrained, devotion is difficult\r\nof acquisition. But by one whose mind is restrained and who is assiduous,\r\nit is capable of acquisition with the aid of means.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Without assiduity, though endued with faith, and with mind\r\nshaken off from devotion, what is the end of him, O Krishna, who hath not\r\nearned success in devotion? Fallen off from both,[200] is he lost like a\r\nseparated cloud or not, being as he is without refuge, O thou of mighty\r\narms, and deluded on the path leading to Brahma? This my doubt, O\r\nKrishna, it behoveth thee to remove without leaving anything. Besides\r\nthee, no dispeller of this doubt is to be had.[201]\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said, 'O son of Pritha, neither here, nor hereafter, doth\r\nruin exist for him, since none, O sire, who performs good (acts) comes by\r\nan evil end. Attaining to the regions reserved for those that perform\r\nmeritorious acts and living there for many many years, he that hath\r\nfallen off from devotion taketh birth in the abode of those that art\r\npious and endued with prosperity, or, he is born even in the family of\r\ndevotees endued with intelligence. Indeed, a birth such as this is more\r\ndifficult of acquisition in this world. There in those births he\r\nobtaineth contact with that Brahmic knowledge which was his in his former\r\nlife; and from that point he striveth again, O descendant of Kuru,\r\ntowards perfection. And although unwilling, he still worketh on in\r\nconsequence of that same former practice of his. Even one that enquireth\r\nof devotion riseth above (the fruits of) the Divine Word.-[202] Striving\r\nwith great efforts, the devotee, cleaned of all his sins, attaineth to\r\nperfection after many births, and then reacheth the supreme goal. The\r\ndevotee is superior to ascetics engaged in austerities; he is esteemed to\r\nbe superior to even the man of knowledge. The devotee is superior to\r\nthose that are engaged in action. Therefore, become a devotee, O Arjuna.\r\nEven amongst all the devotees, he who, full of faith and with inner self\r\nresting on me, worshippeth me, is regarded by me to be the most devout.\""

I will now, without leaving anything speak to thee\r\nabout knowledge and experience, knowing which there would be left nothing\r\nin this world (for thee) to know. One among thousands of men striveth for\r\nperfection. Of those even that are assiduous and have attained to\r\nperfection, only some one knoweth me truly.[203] Earth, water, fire, air,\r\nspace, mind, also understanding, and consciousness,--thus hath my nature\r\nbeen divided eight-fold. This is a lower (form of my) nature. Different\r\nfrom this, know there is a higher (form of my) nature which is animate, O\r\nthou of mighty arms, and by which this universe is held.[204] Know that\r\nall creatures have these for their source. I am the source of evolution\r\nand also of the dissolution of the entire universe. There is nothing\r\nelse, O Dhananjaya, that is higher than myself. Upon me is all this like\r\na row of pearls on a string. Taste I am in the waters, O soil of Kunti,\r\n(and) I am the splendour of both the moon and the sun, I am the Om in all\r\nthe Vedas, the sound in space, and the manliness in men. I am the\r\nfragrant odour in earth, the splendour in fire, the life in all (living)\r\ncreatures, and penance in ascetics. Know me, O son of Pritha, to be the\r\neternal seed of all beings. I am the intelligence of all creatures endued\r\nwith intelligence, the glory of all glorious objects. I am also the\r\nstrength of all that are endued with strength, (myself) freed from desire\r\nand thirst, and, O bull of Bharata's race, am the desire, consistent with\r\nduty, in all creatures.[205] And all existences which are of the quality\r\nof goodness, and which are of the quality of passion and quality of\r\ndarkness, know that they are, indeed, from me. I am, however, not in\r\nthem, but they are in me. This entire universe, deluded by these three\r\nentities consisting of (these) three qualities knoweth not me that am\r\nbeyond them and undecaying; since this illusion of mine, depending on the\r\n(three) qualities, is exceedingly marvellous and highly difficult of\r\nbeing transcended. They that resort to me alone cross this illusion.[206]\r\nDoers of evil, ignorant men, the worst of their species, robbed of their\r\nknowledge by (my) illusion and wedded to the state of demons, do not\r\nresort to me. Four classes of doers of good deeds worship me, O Arjuna,\r\nviz., he that is distressed, that is possessed of knowledge, being always\r\ndevoted and having his faith in only One, is superior to the rest, for\r\nunto the man of knowledge I am dear above everything, and he also is dear\r\nto me. All these are noble. But the man of knowledge is regarded (by me)\r\nto be my very self, since he, with soul fixed on abstraction, taketh\r\nrefuge in me as the highest goal. At the end of many births, the man\r\npossessed of knowledge attaineth to me, (thinking) that Vasudeva is all\r\nthis. Such a high-souled person, however, is exceedingly rare. They who\r\nhave been robbed of knowledge by desire, resort to their godheads,\r\nobservant of diverse regulations and controlled by their own nature.[207]\r\nWhatever form, (of godhead or myself) any worshipper desireth to worship\r\nwith faith, that faith of his unto that (form) I render steady. Endued\r\nwith that faith, he payeth his adorations to that (form), and obtaineth\r\nfrom that all his desire, since all those are ordained by me.[208] The\r\nfruits, however, of those persons endued with little intelligence are\r\nperishable. They that worship the divinities, go to the divinities,\r\n(while) they that worship me come even to me.[209] They that have no\r\ndiscernment, regard me who am (really) unmanifest to have become\r\nmanifest, because they do not know the transcendent and undecaying state\r\nof mine than which there is nothing higher.[210] Shrouded by the illusion\r\nof my inconceivable power, I am not manifest to all. This deluded world\r\nknoweth not me that I am unborn and undecaying. I know, O Arjuna, all\r\nthings that have been past, and all things that are present, and all\r\nthings that are to be. But there is nobody that knoweth me. All\r\ncreatures, O chastiser of foes, are deluded at the time of their birth by\r\nthe delusion, O Bharata, of pairs of opposites arising from desire and\r\naversion. But those persons of meritorious deeds whose sins have attained\r\ntheir end, being freed from the delusion of pairs of opposites, worship\r\nme, firm in their vow (of that worship). Those who, taking refuge in me,\r\nstrive for release from decay and death, know Brahman, the entire\r\nAdhyatma, and action.[211] And they who know me with the Adhibhuta, the\r\nAdhidaiva, and the Adhiyajna, having minds fixed on abstraction, know me\r\nat the time of their departure (from this world).[212]"

And how at the time of departure art thou to be known by those\r\nthat have restrained their self'?--\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said, 'Brahman is the Supreme and indestructible. Adhyatma\r\nis said to be its own manifestation. The offering (to any godhead in a\r\nsacrifice) which causeth the production and development of all--this is\r\ncalled action.[213] Remembering me alone in (his) last moments, he that,\r\ncasting off his body, departeth (hence), cometh into my essence. There is\r\nno doubt in this. Whichever form (of godhead) one remembereth when one\r\ncasteth off, at the end, (his) body, unto that one he goeth, O son of\r\nKunti, having habitually meditated on it always. Therefore, think of me\r\nat all times, and engage in battle. Fixing thy mind and understanding on\r\nme, thou wilt, without doubt, come even to me. Thinking (of the Supreme)\r\nwith a mind not running to other objects and endued with abstraction in\r\nthe form of uninterrupted application, one goeth, O son of Pritha, unto\r\nthe Divine and Supreme male Being. He who at the time of his departure,\r\nwith a steady mind, endued with reverence, with power of abstraction, and\r\ndirecting the life-breath called Prana between the eye-brows, thinketh of\r\nthat ancient seer, who is the ruler (of all), who is minuter than the\r\nminutest atom, who is the ordainer of all, who is inconceivable in form,\r\nand who is beyond all darkness, cometh unto that Divine and Supreme Male\r\nBeing, I will tell thee in brief about that seat which persons conversant\r\nwith the Vedas declare to be indestructible, which is entered by ascetics\r\nfreed from all longings, and in expectation of which (people) practise\r\nthe vows of Brahmacharins. Casting off (this) body, he who departeth,\r\nstopping up all the doors, confining the mind within the heart, placing\r\nhis own life-breath called Prana between the eye-brows, resting on\r\ncontinued meditation, uttering this one syllable Om which is Brahman, and\r\nthinking of me, attaineth to the highest goal.[214] He who always\r\nthinketh of me with mind ever withdrawn from all other objects, unto that\r\ndevotee always engaged on meditation, I am, O Partha, easy of access.\r\nHigh-souled persons who have achieved the highest perfection, attaining\r\nto me, do not incur re-birth which is the abode of sorrow and which is\r\ntransient, All the worlds, O Arjuna, from the abode of Brahman downwards\r\nhave to go through a round of births, on attaining to me, however, O son\r\nof Kunti, there is no re-birth.[215] They who know a day of Brahman to\r\nend after a thousand Yugas, and a night (of his) to terminate after a\r\nthousand Yugas are persons that know day and night.[216] On the advent of\r\n(Brahman's) day everything that is manifest springeth from the\r\nunmanifest; and when (his) night cometh, into that same which is called\r\nunmanifest all things disappear. That same assemblage of creatures,\r\nspringing forth again and again, dissolveth on the advent of night, and\r\nspringeth forth (again), O son of Pritha, when day cometh, constrained\r\n(by the force of action, etc.)[217]. There is, however, another entity,\r\nunmanifest and eternal, which is beyond that unmanifest, and which is not\r\ndestroyed when all the entities are destroyed. It is said to be\r\nunmanifest and indestructible. They call it the highest goal, attaining\r\nwhich no one hath to come back. That is my Supreme seat. That Supreme\r\nBeing, O son of Pritha, He within whom are all entities, and by whom all\r\nthis is permeated, is to be attained by reverence undirected to any other\r\nobject. I will tell thee the times, O bull of Bharata's race, in which\r\ndevotees departing (from this life) go, never to return, or to return.\r\nThe fire, the Light, the day, the lighted fortnight, the six months of\r\nthe northern solstice, departing from here, the persons knowing Brahma go\r\nthrough this path to Brahma.[218] Smoke, night, also the dark-fortnight\r\n(and) the six months of the southern solstice, (departing) through this\r\npath, devotee, attaining to the lunar light, returneth. The bright and\r\nthe dark, these two paths, are regarded to be the eternal (two paths) of\r\nthe universe. By the one, (one) goeth never to return; by the other, one\r\n(going) cometh back. Knowing these two paths, O son of Pritha, no devotee\r\nis deluded. Therefore, at all times, be endued with devotion, O Arjuna.\r\nThe meritorious fruit that is prescribed for the (study of the) Vedas,\r\nfor sacrifices, for ascetic austerities and for gifts, a devotee knowing\r\nall this (that hath been said here), attaineth to it all, and (also)\r\nattaineth the Supreme and Primeval seat.'"

This is royal science, a royal mystery, highly\r\ncleansing, directly apprehensible, consistent with the sacred laws, easy\r\nto practise, (and) imperishable. Those persons, O chastiser of foes, who\r\nhave no faith in this sacred doctrine, not attaining to me, return to the\r\npath of this world that is subject to destruction. This entire universe\r\nis pervaded by me in my unmanifest form. All entities are in me, but I do\r\nnot reside in them. Nor yet are all entities in me. Behold my divine\r\npower. Supporting all entities and producing all entities, myself doth\r\nnot (yet) reside in (those) entities. As the great and obiquitious\r\natmosphere always occupieth space, understand that all entities reside in\r\nme in the same way.[219] All entities, O son of Kunti, attain to my\r\nnature at the close of a Kalpa. I create them again at the beginning of a\r\nKalpa.[220] Regulating my own (independent) nature I create again and in\r\nthis whole assemblage of entities which is plastic in consequence of its\r\nsubjection to nature.[221] Those acts, however, O Dhananjaya, do not\r\nfetter me who sitteth as one unconcerned, being unattached to those acts\r\n(of creation). Through me, the overlooker, primal nature produceth the\r\n(universe of) mobiles and immobiles. For the reason, O son of Kunti, the\r\nuniverse passeth through its rounds (of birth and destruction).[222] Not\r\nknowing my supreme nature of the great lord of all entities, ignorant\r\npeople of vain hopes, vain acts, vain knowledge, confounded minds, wedded\r\nto the delusive nature of Asuras and Rakshasas, disregard me (as one)\r\nthat hath assumed a human body. But high-souled ones, O son of Pritha,\r\npossessed of divine nature, and with minds directed to nothing else,\r\nworship me, knowing (me) to be the origin of all entities and\r\nundestructible. Always glorifying me, (or) striving with firm vows, (or)\r\nbowing down to me, with reverence and ever devoted, (they) worship\r\nme.[223] Others again, performing the sacrifice of knowledge, worship me,\r\n(some) as one, (some) as distinct, (some) as pervading the universe, in\r\nmany forms.[224] I am the Vedic sacrifice, I am the sacrifice enjoined in\r\nthe Smritis, I am Swadha, I am the medicament produced from herbs; I am\r\nthe mantra, I am the sacrificial libation, I am the fire, and I am the\r\n(sacrificial) offering.[225] I am the father of this universe, the\r\nmother, the creator, grandsire; (I am) the thing to be known, the means\r\nby which everything is cleaned, the syllable Om, the Rik, the Saman and\r\nthe Yajus, (I am) the goal, the supporter, the lord, the on-looker, the\r\nabode, the refuge, the friend, the source, the destruction, the support,\r\nthe receptacle; and the undestructible seed. I give heat, I produce and\r\nsuspend rain; I am immortality, and also death; and I am the existent and\r\nthe non-existent, O Arjuna. They who know the three branches of\r\nknowledge, also drink the Soma juice, and whose sins have been cleansed\r\nworshipping me by sacrifices, seek admission into heaven; and these\r\nattaining to the sacred region of the chief of the gods, enjoy in heaven\r\nthe celestial pleasure of the gods. Having enjoyed that celestial world\r\nof vast extent, upon exhaustion of their merit they re-enter the mortal\r\nworld. It is thus that they who accept the doctrines of the three Vedas\r\nand wish for objects of desires, obtain going and coming. Those persons\r\nwho, thinking (of me) without directing their minds to anything else,\r\nworship me, of those who are (thus) always devoted (to me)--I make them\r\ngifts and preserve what they have. Even those devotees who, endued with\r\nfaith worship other godheads even they, O son of Kunti, worship me alone,\r\n(though) irregularly.[226] I am the enjoyer, as also the lord, of all\r\nsacrifices. They, however, do not know me truly; hence they fall off\r\n(from heaven). They whose vows are directed to the Pitris attain to the\r\nPitris; who direct (their) worship to the inferior spirits called Bhutas\r\nattain to Bhutas; they who worship me, attain even to myself. They who\r\noffer me with reverence, leaf, flower, fruit, water--that offered with\r\nreverence, I accept from him whose self is pure.[227] Whatever thou dost,\r\nwhatever eatest, whatever drinkest, whatever givest, whatever austerities\r\nthou performest, manage it in such a way, O son of Kunti, that it may be\r\nan offering to me. Thus mayst thou be freed from the fetters of action\r\nhaving good and evil fruits. With self endued with renunciation and\r\ndevotion, thou wilt be released and will come to me. I am alike to all\r\ncreatures; there is none hateful to me, none dear. They, however, who\r\nworship me with reverence are in me and I also am in them. If even a\r\nperson of exceedingly wicked conduct worshippeth me, without worshipping\r\nany one else, he should certainly be regard as good, for his efforts are\r\nwell-directed. (Such a person) soon becometh of virtuous soul, and\r\nattaineth to eternal tranquillity. Know, O son of Kunti, that none\r\ndevoted to me is ever lost. For, O son of Pritha, even they who may be of\r\nsinful birth, women, Vaisyas, and also Sudras, even they, resorting to\r\nme, attain to the supreme goal. What then (shall I say) of holy Brahmanas\r\nand saints who are my devotees? Having come to this transient and\r\nmiserable world, be engaged in my worship.[228] Fix thy mind on me; be my\r\ndevotee, my worshipper; bow to me; and thus making me thy refuge and\r\napplying thy self to abstraction, thou wilt certainly come to me.'"

Thou art the First God, the ancient (male) Being,\r\nthou art the Supreme refuge of this universe. Thou art the Knower, thou\r\nart the Object to be known, thou art the highest abode. By thee is\r\npervaded this universe, O thou of infinite form.[255] Thou art Vayu,\r\nYama, Agni, Varuna, Moon, Prajapati, and Grandsire. Obeisance be to thee\r\na thousand times, and again and yet again obeisance to thee. Obeisance to\r\nthee in front, and also from behind. Let obeisance be to thee from every\r\nside, O thou that art all. Thou art all, of energy that is infinite, and\r\nprowess that is immeasurable. Thou embracest the All. Regarding (thee) a\r\nfriend whatever hath been said by me carelessly, such as--O Krishna, O\r\nYadava, O friend,--not knowing this thy greatness from want of judgement\r\nor from love either, whatever disrespect hath been shown thee for purpose\r\nof mirth, on occasions of play, lying, sitting, (or) at meals, while\r\nalone or in the presence of others, O undeteriorating one, I beg thy\r\npardon for it, that art immeasurable. Thou art the father of this\r\nuniverse of mobiles and immobiles. Thou art the great master deserving of\r\nworship. There is none equal to thee, how can there be one greater? O\r\nthou whose power is unparalleled in even three worlds?[256] Therefore\r\nbowing (to thee) prostrating (my) body, I ask thy grace, O Lord, O\r\nadorable one. It behoveth thee. O God, to bear (my faults) as a father\r\n(his) son's, a friend (his) friend's, a lover (his) loved one's.\r\nBeholding (thy) form (unseen) before, I have been joyful, (yet) my mind\r\nhath been troubled, with fear. Show me that (other ordinary) form, O God.\r\nBe gracious, O Lord of the gods, O thou that art the refuge of the\r\nuniverse. (Decked) in diadem, and (armed) with mace, discus in hand, as\r\nbefore, I desire to behold thee. Be of that same four-armed form, O thou\r\nof a thousand arms, thou of universal form.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said, 'Pleased with thee, O Arjuna, I have, by my (own)\r\nmystic power, shown thee this supreme form, full of glory, Universal,\r\nInfinite, Primeval, which hath been seen before by none save thee. Except\r\nby thee alone, hero of Kuru's race, I cannot be seen in this form in the\r\nworld of men by any one else, (aided) even by the study of the Vedas and\r\nof sacrifices, by gifts, by actions, (or) by the severest\r\nausterities.[257] Let no fear be thine, nor perplexity of mind at seeing\r\nthis awful form of mine. Freed from fear with a joyful heart, thou again\r\nsee Me assuming that other form.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued,--\"Vasudeva, having said all this to Arjuna, once more\r\nshowed (him) his own (ordinary) form, and that High-Souled one, assuming\r\nonce more (his) gentle form, comforted him who had been afflicted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Beholding this gentle human form of thine, O Janardana, I\r\nhave now become of right mind and have come to my normal state.'\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said, 'This form of mine which thou hast seen is difficult\r\nof being seen. Even the gods are always desirous of becoming spectators\r\nof this (my) form. Not by the Vedas, nor by austerities, nor by gifts,\r\nnor by sacrifices, can I be seen in this form of mine which thou hast\r\nseen. By reverence, however, that is exclusive (in its objects), O\r\nArjuna, I can in this form be known, seen truly, and attained to, O\r\nchastiser of foes. He who doth everything for me, who hath me for his\r\nsupreme object, who is freed from attachment, who is without enmity\r\ntowards all beings, even he, O Arjuna, cometh to me.'"

The trouble is the greater for those\r\nwhose minds are fixed on the Unmanifest; for the path to the Unmanifest\r\nis hard to find by those that are embodied. They (again) who, reposing\r\nall action on me (and) regarding me as their highest object (of\r\nattainment), worship me, meditating on me with devotion undirected to\r\nanything else, of them whose minds are (thus) fixed on me, I, without\r\ndelay, become the deliverer from the ocean of (this) mortal world. Fix\r\nthy heart on me alone, place thy understanding on me, Hereafter then\r\nshalt thou dwell in me. (There is) no doubt (in this).[258] If however,\r\nthou art unable to fix thy heart steadily on me, then, O Dhananjaya,\r\nstrive to obtain me by devotion (arising) from continuous application. If\r\nthou beest unequal to even (this) continuous application, then let\r\nactions performed for me be thy highest aim. Even performing all thy acts\r\nfor my sake, thou wilt obtain perfection. If even this thou art unable to\r\ndo, then resorting to devotion in me, (and) subduing thy soul, abandon\r\nthe fruit of all actions.

What that Kshetra (is), and what (it is) like, and what\r\nchanges it undergoes, and whence (it comes), what is he (viz.,\r\nKshetrajna), and what his powers are, hear from me in brief. All this\r\nhath in many ways been sung separately, by Rishis in various verses, in\r\nwell-settled texts fraught with reason and giving indications of Brahman.\r\nThe great elements, egoism, intellect, the unmanifest (viz., Prakriti),\r\nalso the ten senses, the one (manas), the five objects of sense, desire,\r\naversion, pleasure, pain, body consciousness, courage,--all this in brief\r\nhath been declared to be Kshetra in its modified form. Absence of vanity,\r\nabsence of ostentation, abstention from injury, forgiveness, uprightness,\r\ndevotion to preceptor, purity, constancy, self-restraint, indifference to\r\nobjects of sense, absence of egoism, perception of the misery and evil of\r\nbirth, death, decrepitude and disease,[261] freedom from attachment,\r\nabsence of sympathy for son, wife, home, and the rest, and constant\r\nequanimity of heart on attainment of good and evil, unswerving devotion\r\nto me without meditation on anything else, frequenting of lonely places,\r\ndistaste for concourse of men,[262] constancy in the knowledge of the\r\nrelation of the individual self to the supreme, perception of the object\r\nof the knowledge of truth,--all this is called Knowledge; all that which\r\nis contrary to this is Ignorance.[263] That which is the object of\r\nknowledge I will (now) declare (to thee), knowing which one obtaineth\r\nimmortality. [It is] the Supreme Brahma having no beginning, who is said\r\nto be neither existent nor non-existent; whose hands and feet are on all\r\nsides, whose eyes, heads and faces are on all sides, who dwells pervading\r\neverything in the world, who is possessed of all the qualities of the\r\nsenses (though) devoid of the senses, without attachment (yet) sustaining\r\nall things, without attributes (yet) enjoying (a) all attributes,[264]\r\nwithout and within all creatures, immobile and mobile, not knowable\r\nbecause of (his) subtlety, remote yet near, undistributed in all beings,\r\n(yet) remaining as if distributed, who is the sustainer of (all) beings,\r\nthe absorber and the creator (of all); who is the light of all luminous\r\nbodies, who is said to be beyond all darkness; who is knowledge, the\r\nObject of knowledge, the End of knowledge and seated in the hearts of\r\nall. Thus Kshetra, and Knowledge, and the Object of Knowledge, have been\r\ndeclared (to thee) in brief. My devotee, knowing (all) this, becomes one\r\nin spirit with me. Know that Nature and Spirit are both without beginning\r\n(and) know (also) that all modifications and all qualities spring from\r\nNature.[265] Nature is said to be the source of the capacity of enjoying\r\npleasures and pains.[266] For Spirit, dwelling in nature enjoyeth the\r\nqualities born of Nature. The cause of its births in good or evil wombs\r\nis (its) connection with the qualities.[267] The Supreme Purusha in this\r\nbody is said to be surveyor, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the mighty\r\nlord, and also the Supreme Soul.[268] He who thus knows Spirit, and\r\nNature, with the qualities, in whatever state he may be, is never born\r\nagain. Some by meditation behold the self in the self by the self; others\r\nby devotion according to the Sankhya system; and others (again), by\r\ndevotion through works. Others yet not knowing this, worship, hearing of\r\nit from others. Even these, devoted to what is heard, cross over\r\ndeath.[269] Whatever entity, immobile or mobile, cometh into existence,\r\nknow that, O bull of Bharata's race, to be from the connection of Kshetra\r\nand Kshetrajna (matter and spirit). He seeth the Supreme Lord dwelling\r\nalike in all beings, the Imperishable in the Perishable. For seeing the\r\nLord dwelling alike everywhere, one doth not destroy[270] himself by\r\nhimself, and then reacheth the highest goal. He seeth (truly) who seeth\r\nall actions to be wrought by nature alone in every way and the self\r\nlikewise to be not the doer. When one seeth the diversity of entities as\r\nexisting in one, and the issue (everything) from that (One), then is one\r\nsaid to attain to Brahma. This inexhaustible Supreme Self, O son of\r\nKunti, being without beginning and without attributes, doth not act, nor\r\nis stained even when stationed in the body. As space, which is\r\nubiquitous, is never, in consequence of its subtlety tainted, so the\r\nsoul, stationed in every body, is never tainted.[271] As the single Sun\r\nlights up the entire world, so the Spirit, O Bharata, lights up the\r\nentire (sphere of) matters. They that, by the eye of knowledge, know the\r\ndistinction between matter and spirit, and the deliverance from the\r\nnature of all entities, attain to the Supreme.[272]"

The mighty Brahma is a womb for me. Therein\r\nI place the (living) germ. Thence, O Bharata, the birth of all beings\r\ntaketh place. Whatever (bodily) forms, O son of Kunti, are born in all\r\nwombs, of them Brahma is the mighty womb, (and) I the seed-imparting\r\nSire.[274] Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities, born of nature,\r\nbind down, O thou of mighty arms, the eternal embodied [soul] in the\r\nbody.[275] Amongst these, Goodness, from its unsullied nature, being\r\nenlightening and free from misery, bindeth (the soul), O sinless one,\r\nwith the attainment of happiness and of knowledge. Know that passion,\r\nhaving desire for its essence, is born of thirst and attachment. That, O\r\nson of Kunti, bindeth the embodied (soul) by the attachment of work.\r\nDarkness, however, know, is born of ignorance, (and) bewilders all\r\nembodied [soul]. That bindeth, O Bharata, by error, indolence, and sleep.\r\nGoodness uniteth (the soul) with pleasure; Passion, O Bharata, uniteth\r\nwith work; but darkness, veiling knowledge, uniteth with error. Passion\r\nand darkness, being repressed, Goodness remaineth, O Bharata. Passion and\r\ngoodness (being repressed), darkness (remaineth); (and) darkness and\r\ngoodness (being repressed), passion (remaineth). When in this body, in\r\nall its gates, the light of knowledge is produced, then should one know\r\nthat goodness hath been developed there. Avarice, activity, performance\r\nof works, want of tranquillity, desire,--these, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nare born when passion is developed. Gloom, inactivity, error, and\r\ndelusion also,--these, O son of Kuru's race, are born when darkness is\r\ndeveloped. When the holder of a body goeth to dissolution while goodness\r\nis developed, then he attaineth to the spotless regions of those that\r\nknow the Supreme. Going to dissolution when passion prevails, one is born\r\namong those that are attached to work. Likewise, dissolved during\r\ndarkness, one is born in wombs that beget the ignorant. The fruit of good\r\naction is said to be good and untainted. The fruit, however, of passion,\r\nis misery; (and) the fruit of Darkness is ignorance. From goodness is\r\nproduced knowledge; from passion, avarice; (and) from darkness are error\r\nand delusion, and also ignorance. They that dwell in goodness go on high;\r\nthey that are addicted to passion dwell in the middle; (while) they that\r\nare of darkness, being addicted to the lowest quality, go down. When an\r\nobserver recognises none else to be an agent save the qualities, and\r\nknows that which is beyond (the qualities), he attaineth to my nature.\r\nThe embodied [soul], by transcending these three qualities which\r\nconstitute the source of all bodies, enjoyeth immortality, being freed\r\nfrom birth, death, decrepitude, and misery.'[276]\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'What are indications, O Lord, of one who hath transcended\r\nthese three qualities?

Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride\r\nand intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices that are nominally\r\nso, with hypocrisy and against the (prescribed) ordinance. Wedded to\r\nvanity, power, pride, lust and wrath, these revilers hate Me in their own\r\nbodies and those of others. These haters (of Me), cruel, the vilest among\r\nmen, and unholy, I hurl continually down into demoniac wombs.

That sacrifice which is against the ordinance, in which no food\r\nis dealt out, which is devoid of mantras (sacred verse), in which no fees\r\nare paid to the brahmanas assisting to it, and which is void of faith, is\r\nsaid to be of the quality of darkness. Reverence to the gods, regenerate\r\nones, preceptors, and men of knowledge, purity, uprightness, the\r\npractices of a Brahmacharin, and abstention from injury, are said to\r\nconstitute the penance of the body. The speech which causeth no\r\nagitation, which is true, which is agreeable and beneficial, and the\r\ndiligent study of the Vedas, are said to be the penance of speech.\r\nSerenity of the mind, gentleness, taciturnity, self-restraint, and purity\r\nof the disposition,--these are said to be the penance of the mind. This\r\nthree-fold penance performed with perfect faith, by men without desire of\r\nfruit, and with devotion, is said to be of the quality of goodness. That\r\npenance which is performed for the sake of (gaining) respect, honour, and\r\nreverence, with hypocrisy, (and) which is unstable and transient is said\r\nto be of the quality of passion. That penance which is performed under a\r\ndeluded conviction, with torture of one's self, and for the destruction\r\nof another, is said to be of the quality of darkness. That gift which is\r\ngiven because it ought to be given, to one who cannot return any service\r\nfor it, in a proper time, and to a proper person, is said to be of the\r\nquality of goodness. That, however, which is given reluctantly, for\r\nreturn of services (past or expected), or even with an eye to\r\nfruit,--that gift is said to be of the quality of passion. In an unfit\r\nplace and at an unfit time, the gift that is made to an unworthy object,\r\nwithout respect, and with contempt, is said to be of the quality of\r\ndarkness. OM, TAT, SAT, this is said to be the three-fold designation of\r\nBrahma. By that (Brahma), the Brahmanas and the Vedas, and the\r\nSacrifices, were ordained of old. Therefore, uttering the syllable OM,\r\nthe sacrifices, gifts, and penances, prescribed by the ordinance, of all\r\nutterers of Brahma begin. Uttering TAT, the various rites of sacrifice,\r\npenance, and gifts, without expectation of fruit, are performed by those\r\nthat are desirous of deliverance. SAT is employed to denote existence and\r\ngoodness. Likewise, O son of Pritha, the word SAT is used in any\r\nauspicious act. Constancy in sacrifices, in penances and in gifts, is\r\nalso called SAT, and an act, too, for the sake of That is called\r\nSAT.[291] Whatever oblation is offered (to the fire), whatever is given\r\naway, whatever penance is performed, whatever is done, without faith, is,\r\nO son of Pritha, said to be the opposite of SAT; and that is nought both\r\nhere and hereafter.[292]'"

      "content": "[(Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XVIII)]\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Of renunciation, O thou of mighty arms, I desire to know\r\nthe true nature, and also of abandonment, O lord of the senses\r\ndistinctly, O slayer of Kesi.'[293]\r\n\r\n\"The Holy One said, 'The rejection of the works with desire is known by\r\nthe learned as renunciation. The abandonment of the fruit of all work,\r\nthe discerning call abandonment. Some wise men say that work (itself)\r\nshould be abandoned as evil; others (say) that the works of sacrifice,\r\ngifts, and penance, should not be abandoned. As to that abandonment,\r\nlisten to my decision, O best of the sons of Bharata, for abandonment, O\r\ntiger among men, hath been declared to be of three kinds. The works of\r\nsacrifice, gifts, and penance should not be abandoned. They should,\r\nindeed, be done. Sacrifice, gift, and penance, are the purifications of\r\nthe wise. But even those works should be done, abandoning attachment and\r\nfruit. This, O son of Pritha, is my excellent and decided opinion. The\r\nrenunciation of an act prescribed (in the scriptures) is not proper. Its\r\nabandonment (is) from delusion, (and) is (therefore,) declared to be of\r\nthe quality of darkness.[294] (Regarding it) as (a source of) sorrow,\r\nwhen work is abandoned from (fear of) bodily pain, one making such an\r\nabandonment which is of the quality of passion never obtaineth the fruit\r\nof abandonment. (Regarding it) as one that should be done, when[295] work\r\nthat is prescribed (in the scriptures) is done, O Arjuna, abandoning\r\nattachment and fruit also, that abandonment is deemed to be of the\r\nquality of goodness. Possessed of intelligence and with doubts dispelled,\r\nan abandoner that is endowed with the quality of goodness hath no\r\naversion for an unpleasant action and no attachment to pleasant\r\n(ones).[296] Since actions cannot be absolutely abandoned by an embodied\r\nperson, (therefore) he who abandons the fruit of actions is truly said to\r\nbe an abandoner. Evil, good and mixed-action hath (this) three-fold fruit\r\nhereafter for those that do not abandon. But there is none whatever for\r\nthe renouncer.[297] Listen from me, O thou of mighty arms, to those five\r\ncauses for the completion of all actions, declared in the Sankhya\r\ntreating of the annihilation of actions.[298] (They are) substratum,\r\nagent, the diverse kinds of organs, the diverse efforts severally, and\r\nwith them the deities as the fifth.[299] With body, speech, or mind,\r\nwhatever work, just or the reverse, a man undertakes, these five are its\r\ncauses. That being so, he that, owing to an unrefined understanding,\r\nbeholdeth his own self as solely the agent, he, dull in mind, beholdeth\r\nnot. He that hath no feeling of egoism, whose mind is not sullied, he,\r\neven killing all these people, killeth not, nor is fettered (by\r\naction).[300]--Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower, form\r\nthe three-fold impulse of action. Instrument, action, and the agent, form\r\nthe three-fold complement of action.[301] Knowledge, action, and agent,\r\nare declared in the enumeration of qualities to be three-fold, according\r\nto the difference of qualities. Listen to those also duly.[302] That by\r\nwhich One Eternal Essence is viewed in all things, undivided in the\r\ndivided, know that to be knowledge having the quality of goodness. That\r\nknowledge which discerneth all things as diverse essences of different\r\nkinds in consequence of their separateness, know that that knowledge hath\r\nthe quality of passion. But that which is attached to (each) single\r\nobject as if it were the whole, which is without reason, without truth,\r\nand mean, that knowledge hath been said to be of the quality of darkness.\r\nThe action which is prescribed (by the scriptures), (done) without\r\nattachment, performed without desires and aversion, by one who longeth\r\nnot for (its) fruit, is said to be of the quality of goodness. But that\r\naction which is done by one seeking objects of desire, or by one filled\r\nwith egoism, and which is attended with great trouble, is said to be of\r\nthe quality of passion. That action which is undertaken from delusion,\r\nwithout regard to consequences, loss, injury (to others), and (one's own)\r\npower also, is said to be of the quality of passion. The agent who is\r\nfree from attachment, who never speaketh of himself, who is endued with\r\nconstancy and energy, and is unmoved by success and defeat, is said to be\r\nof the quality of goodness. The agent who is full of affections, who\r\nwisheth for the fruit of actions, who is covetous, endued with cruelty,\r\nand impure, and who feeleth joy and sorrow, is declared to be of the\r\nquality of passion.[303] The agent who is void of application, without\r\ndiscernment, obstinate, deceitful, malicious, slothful, desponding, and\r\nprocrastinating, is said to be of the quality of darkness.[304] Hear now,\r\nO Dhananjaya, the three-fold division of intellect and constancy,\r\naccording to their qualities, which I am about to declare exhaustively\r\nand distinctly. The intellect which knoweth action and inaction, what\r\nought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness,\r\nbondage and deliverance, is, O son of Pritha, of the quality of goodness.\r\nThe intellect by which one imperfectly discerneth right and wrong, that\r\nwhich ought to be done and that which ought not to be done, is, O son of\r\nPritha, of the quality of passion. That intellect which, shrouded by\r\ndarkness, regardeth wrong to be right, and all things as reversed, is, O\r\nson of Pritha, of the quality of darkness. That unswerving constancy by\r\nwhich one controls the functions of the mind, the life-breaths, and the\r\nsenses, through devotion, that constancy, is, O son of Pritha, of the\r\nquality of goodness.[305] But that constancy, O Arjuna, by which one\r\nholds to religion, desire, and profit, through attachment, desiring\r\nfruit, that constancy, O son of Pritha, is of the quality of passion.\r\nThat through which an undiscerning person abandons not sleep, fear,\r\nsorrow, despondency, and folly, that constancy is deemed to be of the\r\nquality of darkness. Hear now from me, O bull of Bharata's race, of the\r\nthree kinds of happiness. That in which one findeth pleasure from\r\nrepetition (of enjoyment), which bringeth an end to pain, which is like\r\npoison first but resembleth nectar in the end, that happiness born of the\r\nserenity produced by a knowledge of self, is said to be of the quality of\r\ngoodness.[306] That which is from the contact of the senses with their\r\nobjects which resembleth nectar first but is like poison in the end, that\r\nhappiness is held to be of the quality of passion. That happiness which\r\nin the beginning and its consequences deludeth the soul, and springeth\r\nfrom sleep, indolence, and stupidity, that is described to be of the\r\nquality of darkness. There is not, either on earth or heaven among the\r\ngods, the entity that is free from these three qualities born of nature.\r\nThe duties of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and of Sudras also, O\r\nchastiser of foes, are distinguished by (these three) qualities born of\r\nnature. Tranquillity, self-restraint, ascetic austerities, purity,\r\nforgiveness, rectitude, knowledge, experience, and belief (in an\r\nexistence hereafter),--these are the duties of Brahmanas, born of (their\r\nproper) nature. Bravery, energy, firmness, skill, not flying away from\r\nbattle, liberality, the bearing of a ruler,--these are the duties of\r\nKshatriyas, born of (their proper) nature. Agriculture, tending of\r\ncattle, and trade, are the natural duties of Vaisyas. Of Sudras also, the\r\nnatural duty consists in servitude. Every man, engaged in his own duties,\r\nattains to perfection. Hear now how one obtains perfection by application\r\nto his duties. Him from whom are the movements of all beings, Him by whom\r\nall this is pervaded, worshipping him by (the performance of) one's own\r\nduty, one obtaineth perfection. Better is one's own duty though performed\r\nfaultily than another's duty well-performed. Performing the duty\r\nprescribed by (one's own) nature, one incurreth no sin. One must not\r\nabandon, O son of Kunti, one's natural duty though tainted with evil, for\r\nall actions are enveloped by evil like fire by smoke. He whose mind is\r\nunattached everywhere, who hath subdued his self, and whose desire hath\r\ndeparted, obtaineth, through renunciation, the supreme perfection of\r\nfreedom from work. Learn from me, only in brief, O son of Kunti, how one,\r\nhaving obtained (this kind of) perfection, attaineth to Brahma which is\r\nthe supreme end of knowledge. Endued with a pure mind, and restraining\r\nhis self by constancy, renouncing sound and other objects of sense, and\r\ncasting off affection and aversion, he who resideth in a lonely place,\r\neateth little, and restraineth speech, body, and mind, who is ever intent\r\non meditation and abstraction, who hath recourse to indifference, who,\r\nabandoning egoism, violence, pride, lust, wrath, and (all) surroundings,\r\nhath been freed from selfishness and is tranquil (in mind), becometh fit\r\nfor assimilation with Brahma. Becoming one with Brahma, tranquil in\r\nspirit, (such a) one grieveth not, desireth not; alike to all beings, he\r\nobtaineth the highest devotion to Me. By (that) devotion he truly\r\nunderstandeth Me. What I am, and who I am; then understanding Me truly,\r\nhe entereth into Me forthwith. Even performing all actions at all times\r\nhaving refuge in Me, he obtaineth, through my favour, the seat that is\r\neternal and imperishable. Dedicating in thy heart all actions to Me,\r\nbeing devoted to Me, resorting to mental abstraction, fix thy thoughts\r\nconstantly on Me. Fixing thy thoughts on Me, thou wilt surmount all\r\ndifficulties through my grace. But if from self-conceit thou wilt not\r\nlisten, thou wilt (then) utterly perish. If, having recourse to\r\nself-conceit, thou thinkest--I will not fight,--that resolution of thine\r\nwould be vain, (for) Nature will constrain thee. That which, from\r\ndelusion, thou dost not wish to do, thou wilt do involuntarily, bound by\r\nthy own duty springing from (thy own) nature. The Lord, O Arjuna,\r\ndwelleth in the region of the heart of beings, turning all beings as if\r\nmounted on a machine, by his illusive power. Seek shelter with Him in\r\nevery way, O Bharata. Through his grace thou wilt obtain supreme\r\ntranquillity, the eternal seat. Thus hath been declared to thee by Me the\r\nknowledge that is more mysterious than any (other) matter. Reflecting on\r\nit fully, act as thou likest. Once more, listen to my supernal words, the\r\nmost mysterious of all. Exceedingly dear art thou to Me, therefore, I\r\nwill declare what is for thy benefit. Set thy heart on Me, become My\r\ndevotee, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Then shalt thou come to Me. I\r\ndeclare to thee truly, (for) thou art dear to Me. Forsaking all\r\n(religious) duties, come to Me as thy sole refuge. I will deliver thee\r\nfrom all sins. Do not grieve. This is not to be ever declared by thee to\r\none who practiseth no austerities, to one who is not a devotee, to one\r\nwho never waiteth on a preceptor, nor yet to one who calumniateth Me. He\r\nwho shall inculcate this supreme mystery to those that are devoted to Me,\r\noffering Me the highest devotion, will come to Me, freed from (all his)\r\ndoubts.[307] Amongst men there is none who can do Me a dearer service\r\nthan he, nor shall any other on earth be dearer to Me than he. And he who\r\nwill study this holy converse between us, by him will have been offered\r\nto Me the sacrifice of knowledge. Such is my opinion. Even the man who,\r\nwith faith and without cavil, will hear it (read), even he freed (from\r\nre-birth), will obtain of the blessed regions of those that perform pious\r\nacts. Hath this, O son of Pritha, been heard by thee with mind undirected\r\nto any other objects? Hath thy delusion, (caused) by ignorance, been\r\ndestroyed, O Dhananjaya?'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'My delusion hath been destroyed, and the recollection (of\r\nwhat I am) hath been gained by me, O Undeteriorating one, through thy\r\nfavour. I am now firm. My doubts have been dispelled. I will do thy\r\nbidding.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Thus I heard this converse between Vasudeva and the\r\nhigh-souled son of Pritha, (that is) wonderful and causeth the hair to\r\nstand on end. Through Vyasa's favour heard I this supreme mystery, this\r\n(doctrine of) Yoga, from Krishna himself, the Lord of Yoga, who declared\r\nit in person. O King recollecting and (again) recollecting this wonderful\r\n(and) holy converse of Kesava and Arjuna, I rejoice over and over again.\r\nRecollecting again and again that wonderful form also of Hari, great is\r\nmy amazement, O king, and I rejoice ever more. Thither where Krishna, the\r\nLord of Yoga (is), thither where the great bowman (Partha) is, thither,\r\nin my opinion, are prosperity, and victory, and greatness, and eternal\r\njustice[308]'\"\r\n\r\n[End of the Bhagavad Gita]"

      "content": "Sanjaya said,--\"Beholding Dhananjaya then to take up once again (his)\r\narrows and Gandiva, the mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava party)\r\nuttered a tremendous shout. And those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the\r\nSomakas, and those who followed them, filled with joy, blew their\r\nsea-born conches. And drums, and Pesis, and Karkachas, and cow-horns were\r\nbeaten and blown together, and the uproar made was very loud. And then, O\r\nruler of men, there came the gods, with Gandharvas and the Pitris, and\r\nthe hosts of Siddhas and Charanas, from desire of witnessing (the sight).\r\nAnd Rishis highly blessed came there in a body with him (Indra) of a\r\nhundred sacrifices at their head, for beholding that great slaughter.\r\nThen, O king, beholding the two armies, that looked like two oceans,\r\nready for the encounter and continuously moving, the heroic king\r\nYudhishthira, the Just, putting off his coat of mail and casting aside\r\nhis excellent weapon and quickly descending from his car, with joined\r\nhands, proceeded on foot, eyeing the grandsire, with restrained speech,\r\nfacing the east, towards the direction where the hostile host was\r\n(standing).[309] And seeing him proceed (thus), Dhananjaya, the son of\r\nKunti, speedily alighting from his car, followed him, accompanied by his\r\n(other) brothers. And the Lord Vasudeva also followed him behind. And the\r\nprincipal kings too (of his army), filled with anxiety, followed in the\r\nsame path.\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'What is this act of thine, O king, that abandoning thy\r\nbrothers, thou proceedest on foot, face eastwards, to the hostile host?'\r\n\r\n\"Bhimasena said, 'Where wilt thou go, O king of kings, having cast off\r\nthy coat of mail and weapons, towards the warriors of the foe cased in\r\nmail, and leaving thy brothers, O ruler of earth?'\r\n\r\n\"Nakula said, 'Thou art my eldest brother, O Bharata, (beholding) thee\r\nproceeding in this way, fear troubleth my bosom. Tell (us), whither wilt\r\nthou go?'\r\n\r\n\"Sahadeva said, 'When these hostile divisions, terrible and numerous, are\r\nhere with whom we are to fight, whither dost thou go, O king, in the\r\ndirection of our foes?'\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Though thus addressed by his brothers, O son of\r\nKuru's race, Yudhishthira of restrained speech said nothing but continued\r\nto proceed. Unto them (then), the high-souled Vasudeva of great wisdom\r\nsmilingly said,--His object is known to me. Having paid his respects to\r\nall his superiors (such as) Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, and Salya also, he\r\nwill fight the foe. It is heard in histories of olden times that he who,\r\nhaving paid his respects according to the ordinance unto his preceptors,\r\nrevered in years and his kinsmen, fighteth with those that are his\r\nsuperiors, is sure to obtain victory in battle. Even that is my\r\nopinion.--When Krishna was saying this, among the ranks of\r\nDhritarashtra's son, a loud uproar of Alas, and Oh arose, but the other\r\n(army) remained perfectly still. Beholding Yudhishthira, the heroic\r\nwarriors of Dhritarashtra's Son conversed with one another saying,--'This\r\none is an infamous wretch of his race. It is plain that this king is\r\ncoming in terror towards Bhishma's side. Yudhishthira, with his brothers,\r\nhath become a seeker after (Bhishma's) shelter. When Dhananjaya, however,\r\nis (his) protector, and Pandu's son Vrikodara, and Nakula, and Sahadeva\r\nalso, why doth the (eldest) son of Pandu come (hither) in fear? Though\r\ncelebrated in the world, this one, however, could never have been born in\r\nthe Kshatriya order, since he is weak and his bosom is filled with fear\r\n(at the prospect) of battle.' Then those warriors all praised the\r\nKauravas. And all of them, becoming rejoiced, with cheerful hearts waved\r\ntheir garments. And, O monarch, all the warriors there (then) censured\r\nYudhishthira with all his brothers and along with Kesava too. Then the\r\nKaurava army, having said Fie to Yudhishthira, soon again, O monarch,\r\nbecame perfectly still,--What will this king say? What will Bhishma say\r\nin reply? What will Bhima boastful of his powers in battle, (say), and\r\nwhat Krishna and Arjuna? What, indeed, hath (Yudhishthira) to say?--Great\r\nwas the curiosity then, O king, of both the armies in respect of\r\nYudhishthira. The king (meanwhile), penetrating the hostile array\r\nbristling with arrows and darts, proceeded quickly towards Bhishma,\r\nsurrounded by his brothers. Seizing his feet with his two hands, the\r\nroyal son of Pandu then said unto Santanu's son Bhishma who was there\r\nready for battle, (these words).\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'I salute thee, O invincible one. With thee we will\r\ndo battle. Grant (us) thy permission in that matter. Give (us) also (thy)\r\nblessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'If, O lord of the earth, thou hadst not, in this battle\r\ncome to me thus, I would have, O great king, cursed thee, O Bharata, for\r\nbringing about thy defeat. I am gratified (with thee), O son. Do battle,\r\nand obtain victory, O son of Pandu, What else may be desired by thee,\r\nobtain thou in battle. Solicit also the boon, O son of Pritha, which thou\r\ndesirest to have from us. If it happens so, O great king, then defeat\r\nwill not be thine. A man is the slave of wealth, but wealth is no one's\r\nslave. This is very true, O king. I have been bound by the Kauravas with\r\n(their) wealth. It is for this, O son of Kuru's race, that like a eunuch\r\nI am uttering these words, viz.,--Bound I am by the Kauravas with wealth.\r\nBattle excepted, what dost thou desire?[310]'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of great wisdom, do thou, desirous of my\r\nwelfare, from day to day, consult my interests. Do battle, however for\r\nthe sake of the Kauravas. Even this is always my prayer (to thee).'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'O king, O son of Kuru's race, what aid can I render thee\r\nin this? I shall, of course, fight for (thy) foes. Tell me what thou hast\r\nto say.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Therefore, O Sire, I ask thee, I bow to thee, O\r\ngrandsire, how shall we, in battle, vanquish thee that art invincible?\r\nTell me this that is for my benefit, if indeed, thou seest any good in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'I do not, O son of Kunti, see the person who, even if he\r\nwere the chief of the celestials himself, can defeat me in battle when I\r\nfight.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'My salutations to thee, O grandsire. Therefore, do I\r\nask thee (this). Tell us how thy own death may be compassed by foes in\r\nbattle.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'I do not see the person, O sire, who can vanquish me in\r\nbattle. The time also of my death is not yet come to me once again.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued,--\"Then, O son of Kuru's race, Yudhishthira, once more\r\nsaluting him, accepted Bhishma's words with a bend of his head. And that\r\nmighty-armed one then proceeded towards the car of the preceptor ( Drona)\r\nthrough the midst of all the soldiers who were eyeing him, accompanied by\r\nhis brothers. Then saluting Drona and walking round him, the king spoke\r\nto that invincible warrior words that were for his own benefit.[311]\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'I ask thee, O invincible one, how I may fight\r\nwithout incurring sin, and how, with thy permission, O regenerate one, I\r\nmay vanquish all my foes?[312]\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'If, having resolved to fight, thou hadst not come to me\r\n(thus), I would have cursed thee. O king, for thy complete overthrow. I\r\nam, however, gratified, O Yudhishthira, and honoured by thee, O sinless\r\none. I permit thee, fight and obtain victory. I will also fulfil thy\r\nwish. Say what thou hast to say. Under these circumstances, battle\r\nexcepted, what dost thou wish? A man is the slave of wealth, but wealth\r\nis not one's slave. This is quite true, O king! Bound I have been with\r\n(their) wealth by the Kauravas! It is for this that like a eunuch I shall\r\nfight for the sake of the Kauravas. It is for this that like a eunuch I\r\nam uttering these words--Battle excepted, what dost thou wish? I shall\r\nfight for the sake of the Kauravas, but will pray for thy victory.'[313]\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Pray for my victory, O regenerate one, and counsel\r\nwhat is for my good. Fight, however, for the Kauravas. This is the boon\r\nsolicited by me.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'Victory, O king, is certain for thee that hast Hari for thy\r\ncounsellor. I (also) grant thee that thou wilt vanquish thy foes in\r\nbattle. Thither where righteousness is, thither is Krishna, and thither\r\nwhere Krishna is, thither is victory. Go, fight, O son of Kunti! Ask me,\r\nwhat shall I say unto thee?'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'I ask thee, O foremost of regenerate ones, listen to\r\nwhat I have to say. How shall we in battle vanquish thee that art\r\ninvincible?'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'As long as I will fight, so long victory can never be\r\nthine. (Therefore) O king, seek with thy brothers, for my speedy\r\nslaughter.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, for this, O thou of mighty arms, tell (us) the\r\nmeans of thy death. O preceptor, prostrating myself I ask thee this. (My)\r\nsalutations to thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'The foe, O sire, I see not who may slay me while standing\r\nin battle I am engaged in fight, with wrath excited, and scattering (my)\r\narrowy showers continually. Except when addrest for death O king, having\r\nabandoned my arms and withdrawn (in Yoga meditation) from surrounding\r\nsights, none will be able to slay me. This that I tell thee is true. I\r\nalso tell thee truly that I will cast off my arms in battle, having heard\r\nsomething very disagreeable from some one of credible speech.--'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Hearing these words, O king, of the wise son of\r\nBharadwaja, and honouring the preceptor, (Yudhishthira then) proceeded\r\ntowards the son of Saradwat. And saluting Kripa and walking round him, O\r\nking, Yudhishthira, accomplished in speech, said these words unto that\r\nwarrior of great valour.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Obtaining thy permission, O preceptor, I will fight\r\nwithout incurring sin, and permitted by thee, O sinless one, I will\r\nvanquish all (my) foes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kripa said, 'If having resolved on fight, thou hadst not come to me\r\n(thus), I would have cursed thee, O king, for thy complete overthrow. A\r\nman is the slave of wealth, but wealth is no one's slave. This is very\r\ntrue, O king, and bound I have been with wealth by the Kauravas. I must,\r\nO king, fight for their sake. This is my opinion. I therefore, speak like\r\na eunuch in asking thee,--Battle excepted, what dost thou desire?'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, I ask thee, therefore., O preceptor, listen to\r\nmy words.--Saying this, the king, greatly agitated and deprived of his\r\nsense, stood silent.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued.--\"Understanding, however, what he intended to say,\r\nGautama (Kripa) replied to him, saying,--I am incapable of being slain, O\r\nking. Fight, and obtain victory. I am gratified with thy coming. Rising\r\nevery day [from bed] I will pray for thy victory, O monarch. I say this\r\nto thee truly.--Hearing, O king, these words of Gautama, and paying him\r\ndue honours, the king proceeded thither where the ruler of the Madra was.\r\nSaluting Salya and walking round him the king said unto that invincible\r\nwarrior those words that were for his own benefit.\r\n\r\n'Yudhishthira said,--'Obtaining thy permission, O invincible one, I will\r\nfight without incurring sin, and permitted by thee, O king, I will\r\nvanquish (my) valourous foes.'[314]--\r\n\r\n\"Salya said, 'If, having resolved on fight, thou hadst not come to me\r\n(thus), I would have, O king, cursed thee for thy overthrow in battle. I\r\nam gratified (with thee) and honoured (by thee). Let it be as thou\r\nwishest. I grant thee permission, fight and obtain victory. Speak, O\r\nhero, for what hast thou any need? What shalt I give thee? Under these\r\ncircumstances, O king, battle excepted, what dost thou desire? A man is\r\nthe slave of wealth but wealth is no one's slave. This is true, O king.\r\nBound I have been with wealth by the Kauravas, O nephew, it is for this\r\nthat I am speaking to thee like a eunuch,--I will accomplish the desire\r\nthou mayst cherish. Battle excepted, what dost thou wish.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Think, O king, daily of what is for my great good.\r\nFight, according to thy pleasure, for the sake of the foe. This is the\r\nboon that I solicit.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya said, 'Under these circumstances, say, O best of kings what aid\r\nshall I render thee? I shall, of course, fight for the sake of (thy)\r\nenemy, for I have been made one of their party by the Kauravas with their\r\nwealth.[315]\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Even that is my boon, O Salya, which was solicited\r\nby me during the preparations (for the fight). The energy of the Suta's\r\nson (Karna) should be weakened by thee in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya said, 'This thy wish, O Yudhishthira, shall be accomplished, O son\r\nof Kunti. Go, fight according to thy pleasure. I shall look after thy\r\nvictory.\"\r\n\r\n'Sanjaya continued, \"Having obtained the permission of his maternal\r\nuncle, the ruler of the Madra, the son of Kunti, surrounded by his\r\nbrothers, came out of that vast army. Vasudeva then went to Radha's son\r\non the field of battle. And the elder brother of Gada, for the sake of\r\nthe Pandavas, then said to Karna,--It hath been heard by me, O Karna,\r\nthat from hatred of Bhishma thou wilt not fight. Come to our side, O son\r\nof Radha, and (stay with us) as long as Bhishma is not slain. After\r\nBhishma is slain, O son of Radha, thou mayst then again engage in battle\r\non Duryodhana's side, if thou hast no preference for any of the\r\nparties.--'\r\n\r\n\"Karna said, 'I will not do anything that is disagreeable to\r\nDhritarashtra's son, O Kesava. Devoted to Duryodhana's good, know that I\r\nhave cast off my life (for him).--Hearing these words (of Karna), Krishna\r\nceased, O Bharata, and reunited himself with the sons of Pandu headed by\r\nYudhishthira. Then amid all the warriors the eldest son of Pandu, loudly\r\nexclaimed,--He who will choose us, him we shall choose for our\r\nally!--Casting his eyes then upon them, Yuyutsu said these words, with a\r\ncheerful heart, unto Kunti's son king Yudhishthira the Just,--I will\r\nfight under thee in battle, for the sake of you all, with the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, if, O king, thou wilt accept me, sinless one.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Come, come, all of us will fight with thy foolish\r\nbrothers. O Yuyutsu, both Vasudeva and we all say to thee--I accept thee,\r\nO thou of mighty arms, fight for my cause. On thee rests, it seems, the\r\nthread of Dhritarashtra's line as also his funeral cake. O prince, O thou\r\nof great splendour, accept us that accept thee. The wrathful Duryodhana\r\nof wicked understanding will cease to live.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, 'Yuvutsu then, abandoning the Kurus thy sons, went\r\nover to the army of the Pandavas, with beat of drums and cymbals. Then\r\nking Yudhishthira of mighty arms, filled with joy, again put on his\r\nshining coat of mail of golden effulgence. And those bulls among men then\r\nmounted their respective cars. And they counter-arrayed their troops in\r\nbattle-array as before. And they caused drums and cymbals in many\r\nhundreds to be sounded. And those bulls among men also set up diverse\r\nleonine roars.[316] And beholding those tigers among men, viz., the sons\r\nof Pandu, on their cars, the kings (on their side) with Dhrishtadyumna\r\nand others, once more set up shouts of joy. And beholding the nobility of\r\nthe sons of Pandu who had paid due honour to those that were deserving of\r\nhonour, all the kings there present applauded them highly. And the\r\nmonarchs, talked with one another about the friendship, the compassion,\r\nand the kindness to kinsmen, displayed at the proper season by those\r\nhigh-souled personages. Excellent,--Excellent,--were the delightful words\r\neverywhere bruited about, coupled with eulogistic hymns about those\r\nfamous men. And in consequence of this the minds and hearts of every one\r\nthere were attracted towards them. And the Mlechchhas and the Aryas there\r\nwho witnessed or heard of that behaviour of the sons of Pandu, all wept\r\nwith choked voices. And those warriors then, endued with great energy,\r\ncaused large drums and Pushkaras by hundreds upon hundreds to be sounded\r\nand also blew their conches all white as the milk of cows.'\""

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said, 'When the divisions of both my side and the foe were\r\nthus arrayed, who struck first, the Kurus or the Pandavas?'\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Hearing those words of his (elder) brother, thy son\r\nDussasana advanced with his troops, with Bhishma at their head, and the\r\nPandavas also advanced with cheerful hearts, desiring battle with\r\nBhishma, having Bhimasena at their head. Then leonine, shouts, and\r\nclamorous uproars and the noise of Krakachas, the blare of cow-horns, and\r\nthe sound of drums and cymbals and tabors, arose in both armies. And the\r\nwarriors of the foe rushed against us, and we also (rushed) against them\r\nwith loud shouts. And the uproar (caused by this rush) was\r\ndeafening.[317] The vast hosts of the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, in\r\nthat awfully murderous encounter shook in consequence of that uproar of\r\nconches and cymbals, like forests shaken by the wind.[318] And the din\r\nmade by those hosts teeming with kings, elephants, and steeds, rushing\r\nagainst one another in that evil hour, was as loud as that of oceans\r\nagitated by the tempest. And when that din, loud and causing the hair to\r\nstand on end, arose, the mighty-armed Bhimasena began to roar like a\r\nbull. And those roars of Bhimasena rose above the clamour of conches and\r\ndrums, the grunts of elephants, and the leonine shouts of the combatants.\r\nIndeed, the shouts of Bhimasena transcended the noise made by the\r\nthousands of chargers neighing in (both) the armies. And hearing those\r\nshouts of Bhimasena who was roaring like the clouds, shouts that\r\nresembled the report of Sakra's thunder, thy warriors were filled with\r\nfear. And at those roars of the hero, the steeds and elephants all\r\nejected urine and excreta like other animals at the roar of the lion. And\r\nroaring like a deep mass of clouds, and assuming an awful form, that hero\r\nfrightened thy sons and fell upon them.[319] Thereupon the brothers,\r\nviz., thy sons Duryodhana, and Durmukha and Dussaha, and that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Dussasana, and Durmarshana, O king, and Vivingsati, and\r\nChitrasena, and the great car-warrior Vikarna and also Purumitra, and\r\nJaya, and Bhoja, and the valorous son of Somadatta, shaking their\r\nsplendid bows like masses of clouds exhibiting the lightning's flashes,\r\nand taking out (of their quivers) long arrows resembling snakes that have\r\njust cast off their sloughs, surrounded that mighty bowman rushing\r\n(towards them) covering him with flights of arrows like the clouds\r\nshrouding the sun. And the (five) sons of Draupadi, and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Saubhadra,[320] and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna\r\nof Prishata's race, rushed against (those) Dhartarashtras, tearing them\r\nwith whetted shafts like summits of mountains with the impetuous bolts of\r\nheaven. And in that first encounter characterised by the awful twang of\r\nbow-strings and their flapping against the leathern fences (of the\r\nwarriors)[321] no combatant, either on thy side or that of the foe,\r\nturned back. And, O bull of Bharata's race, I beheld the lightness of\r\nhand of the disciples of Drona (in particular), who, shooting innumerable\r\narrows, O king, always succeeded in hitting the mark.[322] And the twang\r\nof sounding bowstrings ceased not for a moment, and the blazing arrows\r\nshot through (the air) like meteors (falling) from the firmament. And all\r\nthe other kings, O Bharata, stood like (silent) spectators witnessing\r\nthat interesting and awful encounter of kinsmen. And then those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, with wrath excited and remembering the injuries sustained\r\nat one another's hands, strove in battle, O king, challenging one\r\nanother. And the two armies of the Kurus and the Pandavas, teeming with\r\nelephants, steeds and cars, looked exceedingly beautiful on the field of\r\nbattle like painted figures on a canvas. And then the (other) kings all\r\ntook up their bows. And the Sun himself was shrouded by the dust raised\r\nby the combatants. And they fell upon one another, at the heads of their\r\n(respective) troops, at the command of thy son. And the loud uproar made\r\nby the elephants and the chargers of those kings rushing to the combat,\r\nmingled with the leonine shouts of the combatants and the din made by the\r\nblare of conches and the sounds of drums. And the uproar of that ocean\r\nhaving arrows for its crocodiles, bows for its snakes, swords for its\r\ntortoises, and the forward leaps of the warriors for its tempest,\r\nresembled the din made by the (actual) ocean when agitated. And kings in\r\nthousands, commanded by Yudhishthira, with their (respective) troops fell\r\nupon the ranks of thy son. And the encounter between the combatants of\r\nthe two hosts was fierce in the extreme. And no difference could be\r\nperceived between the combatants of our side or that of the foe, while\r\nbattling, or retreating in broken array or rallying again to the fight.\r\nIn that terrific and awful battle, thy father (Bhishma) shone,\r\ntranscending that countless host."

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"On the forenoon of that awful day, O king, the terrible\r\nbattle that mangled the bodies of (so many) kings commenced. And the loud\r\nshouts, resembling leonine roars of the Kurus and the Srinjayas, both\r\ndesirous of victory in battle, made both the welkin and the earth resound\r\ntherewith. And a tumultuous uproar was heard mingled with the flaps of\r\nleathern fences and the blare of conches. And many were the leonine roars\r\nthat rose there of men shouting against one another. And, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, the sound of bowstrings stretched by (hands cased in)\r\nfences, the heavy tread of infantry, the furious neigh of chargers, the\r\nfalling of sticks and iron hooks (on the beads of elephants), the clash\r\nof weapons, the jingle of bells of elephants rushing against one another,\r\nand the clatter of cars resembling the roar of clouds, mingled together,\r\nproduced a loud uproar making one's hair stand on end. And all the Kuru\r\nwarriors, reckless of their very lives and with cruel intentions, rushed,\r\nwith standards upraised, against the Pandavas. And Santanu's son himself,\r\ntaking up a terrible bow that resembled the rod of Death, rushed, O king,\r\non the field of battle, against Dhananjaya. And Arjuna also, endued with\r\ngreat energy, taking up the bow Gandiva celebrated overall the world,\r\nrushed, on the field of battle, against Ganga's son. And both those\r\ntigers among the Kurus became desirous of slaying each other. The mighty\r\nson of Ganga however, piercing in battle the son of Pritha could not make\r\nhim waver. And so, O king, the son of Pandu also could not make Bhishma\r\nwaver in battle. And the mighty bowman Satyaki rushed against\r\nKritavarman. And the battle between these two was fierce in the extreme\r\nand made the hair (of onlookers) stand on end. And Satyaki afflicted\r\nKritavarman, and Kritavarman afflicted Satyaki, with loud shouts and each\r\nweakened the other. And pierced all over with arrows those mighty\r\nwarriors shone like two blossoming Kinsukas in spring adorned with\r\nflowers. And the mighty bowman Abhimanyu battled with Vrihadvala. Soon,\r\nhowever, in that encounter, O king, the ruler of Kosala cut off the\r\nstandard and overthrew the charioteer of Subhadra's son. The son of\r\nSubhadra then upon the overthrow of his charioteer, was filled with wrath\r\nand pierced Vrihadvala, O king, with nine shafts, and with a couple of\r\nsharp arrows that grinder of foes also cut off (Vrihadvala's) standard,\r\nand with one (more) cut off one of the protectors of his car-wheels and\r\nwith the other his charioteer.[323] And those chastisers of foes\r\ncontinued to weaken each other with sharp arrows. And Bhimasena struggled\r\nin battle with thy son Duryodhana, that mighty car-warrior, proud and\r\ninflated, who had injured (the sons of Pandu). Both of those foremost\r\n(princes) among the Kurus, are tigers among men and mighty car-warriors.\r\nAnd they covered each other, on the field of battle, with their arrowy\r\nshowers. And beholding those high-souled and accomplished warriors\r\nconversant with all modes of warfare, all creatures were filled with\r\namazement of Bharata. And Dussasana, rushing against that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Nakula, pierced him with many sharp arrows capable of\r\npenetrating into the very vitals. The son of Madri, then, laughing the\r\nwhile, cut off, with sharp arrows (of his), adversary's standard and bow,\r\nand then he struck him with five and twenty small-headed arrows. Thy son,\r\nhowever, then, who can with difficulty be vanquished, slew in that fierce\r\nencounter the steeds of Nakula and cut off his standard. And Durmukha\r\nrushing against the mighty Sahadeva battling in that terrific encounter,\r\npierced him with a shower of arrows. The heroic Sahadeva then, in that\r\nfearful battle, overthrew Durmukha's charioteer with an arrow of great\r\nsharpness. Both of them, irrepressible in fight, approaching each other\r\nin combat, and each attacking the other and desirous of warding off the\r\nother's attack, began to strike terror into each other with terrible\r\nshafts. And king Yudhishthira himself encountered the ruler of the\r\nMadras. The chief of the Madras then in his very sight cut off in twain\r\nYudhishthira's bow. Thereupon the son of Kunti, throwing aside that\r\nbroken bow, took up another that was stronger and capable of imparting a\r\ngreater velocity. The king then, with straight arrows, covered the ruler\r\nof the Madras, and in great wrath said, 'wait, wait'. And Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nO Bharata rushed against Drona. And Drona, then, in great wrath, cut off\r\nin that encounter the hard bow of the high-souled prince of Panchala that\r\nwas capable of always taking the lives of foes. And at the same time he\r\nshot in that conflict a terrible arrow that was like a second rod of\r\nDeath. And the arrow shot penetrated the body of the prince. Taking up\r\nthen another bow and fourteen arrows, the son of Drupada pierced Drona in\r\nthat encounter. And enraged with each other, they battled on fiercely.\r\nAnd the impetuous Sankha encountered Somadatta's son who was equally\r\nimpetuous in battle and addressed him, O king, saying 'wait, wait'. And\r\nthat hero then pierced his (adversary's) right arm in that combat. And\r\nthereupon the son of Somadatta struck Sankha on the shoulders. And the\r\nbattle that ensued between those two proud heroes, O king, soon became as\r\nterrible as a combat between the gods and the Danavas. And that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Dhrishtaketu of immeasurable soul, with wrath excited, rushed\r\nin battle, O king, against Valhika, the very embodiment of wrath.\r\nValhika, then, O king, setting up a leonine roar, weakened the wrathful\r\nDhrishtaketu with innumerable arrows. The king of the Chedis, however,\r\nexceedingly provoked, quickly pierced Valhika in that encounter with nine\r\narrows. Like an infuriate elephant against an infuriate elephant, in that\r\ncombat they roared against each other repeatedly, both exceedingly\r\nenraged. And they encountered each other with great wrath and looked like\r\nthe planets Angaraka and Sukra.[324] And Ghatotkacha of cruel deeds\r\nencountered the Rakshasa Alamvusha of cruel deeds like Sakra\r\n(encountering) Vala in battle. And Ghatotkacha, O Bharata, pierced that\r\ninfuriate and powerful Rakshasa with ninety keen-edged shafts. And\r\nAlamvusha also in that combat pierced the mighty son of Bhimasena in many\r\nplaces with straight arrows (of his). And mangled with arrows they shone\r\nin that encounter like the mighty Sakra and the powerful Vala in the\r\ncombat (of old) between the celestials and the Asuras. The powerful\r\nSikhandin, O king, rushed against Drona's son, Aswatthaman, however\r\ndeeply piercing the angry Sikhandin stationed (before him) with a\r\nkeen-edged shaft, caused him to tremble, Sikhandin also, O king, smote\r\nDrona's son with a sharp-whetted shaft of excellent temper. And they\r\ncontinued in that encounter to strike each other with various kinds of\r\narrows. And against the heroic Bhagadatta in battle, Virata, the\r\ncommander of a large division, rushed impetuously, O king, and then\r\ncommenced (their) combat. Virata, exceedingly provoked, poured on\r\nBhagadatta an arrowy shower like, O Bharata, the clouds showering rain on\r\nthe mountain breast. But Bhagadatta, that lord of the earth, speedily\r\nenveloped Virata in that encounter (with arrows) like the clouds\r\nenveloping the risen sun. Kripa, the son of Saradwat, rushed against\r\nVrihadkshatra, the ruler of the Kaikeyas. And Kripa, O Bharata, enveloped\r\nhim with a shower of arrows. Vrihadkshatra also shrouded the infuriate\r\nson of Gautama with an arrowy downpour. And those warriors, then, having\r\nslain each other's steeds and cut off each other's bows, were both\r\ndeprived of their cars. And exceedingly enraged, they then approached\r\neach other for fighting with their swords. And the combat which then took\r\nplace between them was terrible in aspect and unparalleled. That\r\nchastiser of foes, king Drupada, then, in great wrath rushed against\r\nJayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus, cheerfully waiting (for battle).\r\nThe ruler of the Sindhus pierced Drupada in that combat with three\r\nshafts, and Drupada pierced him in return. And the battle that took place\r\nbetween them was terrible and fierce, and productive of satisfaction in\r\nthe hearts of all the spectators and resembling a conflict between the\r\nplanets Sukra and Angaraka. And Vikarna, son to thee, with fleet steeds,\r\nrushed against the mighty Sutasoma and the combat between them commenced.\r\nVikarna, however, although he pierced Sutasoma with many arrows, failed\r\nto make him waver. Neither could Sutasoma make Vikarna waver. And that\r\nappeared wonderful (to all). And against Susarman, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior and tiger among men, viz., Chekitana of great prowess, rushed\r\nin exceeding wrath for the sake of the Pandavas. And Susarman also, O\r\ngreat king, in that encounter checked the advance of that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Chekitana with plentiful shower of arrows. And Chekitana\r\nalso, greatly provoked, showered on Susarman, in that terrible conflict,\r\na shower of arrows like a mighty mass of clouds showering rain on the\r\nmountain breast. And Sakuni, endued with great prowess, rushed, O king,\r\nagainst Prativindhya[325] of great prowess, like a lion against an\r\ninfuriate elephant. Thereupon the son of Yudhishthira, in exceeding\r\nwrath, mangled Suvala's son in that combat, with sharp arrows, like\r\nMaghavat[326] (mangling) a Danava. And Sakuni also, in that fierce\r\nconflict, pierced Prativindhya in return and mangled that warrior of\r\ngreat intelligence with straight arrows. And Srutakarman rushed in\r\nbattle, O great king, against that mighty car-warrior Sudakshina of great\r\nprowess, the ruler of the Kamvojas. Sudakshina, however, O great king,\r\npiercing that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Sahadeva, failed to\r\nmake him waver (for he stood) like the Mainaka mountain (against the\r\nassaults of Indra). Thereupon Srutakarman, exceedingly provoked, weakened\r\nthat mighty car-warrior of the Kamvojas with innumerable arrows and\r\nmangled him in every part of his body. And Iravan, that chastiser of\r\nfoes, in great wrath and exerting carefully, rushed in battle against the\r\nwrathful Srutayush. The powerful son of Arjuna, that mighty car-warrior,\r\nthen slaying the steeds of his adversary, set up a loud roar, and\r\nthereupon, O king, all the warriors (who saw the feat) praised him\r\ngreatly. And Srutasena also, exceedingly provoked, slew in that conflict\r\nthe steeds of Falguni's son with a powerful mace, and the battle between\r\nthem continued. And Vinda and Anuvinda, those two princes of Avanti,\r\napproached in battle that mighty car-warrior the heroic Kuntibhoja at the\r\nhead of his troops accompanied by his son. And wonderful was the prowess\r\nwe beheld of those two princes on that occasion, for they fought on very\r\ncooly though battling with a large body of troops. And Anuvinda hurled a\r\nmace at Kuntibhoja, but Kuntibhoja quickly covered him with a shower of\r\narrows. And the son of Kuntibhoja pierced Vinda with many arrows, and the\r\nlatter also pierced him in return. And the combat (between them) looked\r\nvery wonderful. And the Kekaya brothers, O sire, at the head of their\r\ntroops, encountered in battle the five Gandhara princes with their\r\ntroops. And thy son Viravahu battled with that best of car-warriors\r\nUttara, the son of Virata and pierced him with nine arrows. And Uttara\r\nalso pierced that hero with sharp-edged arrows. And the ruler of the\r\nChedis, O king, rushed in battle against Uluka. And he pierced Uluka with\r\na shower of arrows, and Uluka also pierced him with sharp arrows\r\nfurnished with excellent wing. And the combat that took place between\r\nthem, O king, was fierce in the extreme, for unable to vanquish each\r\nother, they mangled each other terribly. And thus in that general\r\nengagement thousands of single combats took place between men on car,\r\nwarriors on elephants and horsemen, and foot-soldiers, of their side and\r\nthine. For a short while only that engagement offered a beautiful sight.\r\nSoon, however, O king, it became furious and nothing could be discovered.\r\nIn the battle (that ensued) elephants rushed against elephants,\r\ncar-warriors against car-warriors, steed against steed and foot-soldier\r\nagainst foot-soldier. The conflict then became confused and fierce in the\r\nextreme, of heroes rushing against each other in the melee. And the\r\ncelestial Rishi, and Siddhas and Charanas, that were present there,\r\nbeheld that terrific battle to resemble the combat of the gods and the\r\nAsuras. And elephants in thousands, and cars also in thousands, and vast\r\nbodies of infantry, O sire, seemed to alter their character.[327] And, O\r\ntiger among men, it was seen that cars and elephants and steeds and\r\ninfantry fought with each other repeatedly on the same places.[328]"

O Bharata, in utter\r\nforgetfulness of all consideration due to others. There the son\r\nrecognised not the sire, the sire (recognised not) the son of his loins,\r\nthe brother (recognised not) the brother, the sister's son (recognised\r\nnot) the maternal uncle. The maternal uncle (recognised not) the sister's\r\nson, the friend not the friend. The Pandavas and the Kurus fought as if\r\nthey were possessed by demons. Some tigers among men, fell with cars into\r\npieces. And the shafts of cars broke clashing against shafts, and the\r\nspikes of car-yokes against spikes of car-yokes. And some (warriors)\r\nunited together encountered others that were united together, all\r\ndesirous of taking one another's life-And some cars, obstructed by cars,\r\nwere unable to move. And huge-bodied elephants with rent temples, falling\r\nupon huge elephants, angrily tore one another in many places with their\r\ntusks. Others, O king, encountering impetuous and huge ones of their\r\nspecies with arched edifices and standards (on their backs) and trained\r\nto the fight struck with their tusks, shrieked in great agony.[329]\r\nDisciplined by training and urged on by pikes and hooks, elephants not in\r\nrut rushed straight against those that were in rut.[330] And some huge\r\nelephants, encountering compeers in rut, ran, uttering cries like those\r\nof cranes, in all directions. And many huge elephants, well-trained, and\r\nwith juice trickling down from rent temples and mouth, mangle with\r\nswords, lances, and arrows, and pierced in their vital parts, shrieked\r\naloud and falling down expired. And some, uttering frightful cries, ran\r\nin all directions. The foot-soldiers that protected the elephants, endued\r\nwith broad chests, and capable of smiting effectually, with wrath\r\nexcited, and armed with pikes and bows, and bright battle-axes, and with\r\nmaces and clubs, and short arrows, and lances, and with shafts, and stout\r\nbludgeons mounted with iron spikes and swords, well-grasped of the\r\nbrightest polish, ran hither and thither, O king, and seemed resolved to\r\ntake one another's life. And the sabres of brave combatants rushing\r\nagainst one another steeped in human blood, seemed to shine brightly. And\r\nthe whiz of swords whirled and made to descend by heroic arms and falling\r\nupon the vital parts (of the bodies) of foes, became very loud. And the\r\nheart-ending wails of combatants in multitudinous hosts, crushed with\r\nmaces and clubs, and cut off with well-tempered swords, and pierced with\r\nthe tusks of elephants, and grained by tuskers, calling upon one another,\r\nwere heard, O Bharata, to resemble the wails of those that are doomed to\r\nhell. And horsemen, on chargers of exceeding speed and furnished with\r\noutstretched tails resembling (the Plumes of) swans, rushed against one\r\nanother. And hurled by them, long-bearded darts adorned with pure gold,\r\nfleet, and polished, and sharp-pointed, fell like snakes.[331] And some\r\nheroic horsemen, on coursers of speed, leaping high, cut off the heads of\r\ncar-warriors from their cars.[332] And (here and there) a car-warrior,\r\ngetting bodies of cavalry within shooting distance, slew many with\r\nstraight shafts furnished with heads. And many infuriate elephants\r\nadorned with trapping of gold, and looking like newly-risen clouds,\r\nthrowing down steed, crushed them with their own legs. And some elephants\r\nstruck on their frontal globes and flanks, and mangled by means of\r\nlances, shrieked aloud in great agony. And many huge elephants, in the\r\nbewildering of the melee, crushing steeds with their riders, threw them\r\ndown. And some elephants, overthrowing with the points of their tusks,\r\nsteeds with their riders, wandered, crushing cars with their standards.\r\nAnd some huge male elephants, from excess of energy and with the temporal\r\njuice gushing down in large quantities, slew steeds along with their\r\nriders by means of their trunks and legs. Fleet arrows polished and\r\nsharp-pointed and resembling snakes fell upon the heads, the temples, the\r\nflanks, and the limbs of elephants. And polished javelins of terrible\r\nmien, and looking like large meteoric flashes, hurled by heroic arms,\r\nfelt hither and thither, O king, piercing through the bodies of men and\r\nhorses, and cutting through coats of mail. And many taking out their\r\npolished sabres from sheaths made of the skins of leopards and tigers,\r\nslew the combatants opposed to them in battle. And many warriors, though\r\nthemselves attacked and had the flanks of their bodies cut open, yet\r\nangrily fell upon (their foes) with swords, shields and battle-axes. And\r\nsome elephants dragging down and overthrowing cars with their steeds by\r\nmeans of their trunks, began to wander in all directions, guided by the\r\ncries of those behind them. And hither and thither some pierced by\r\njavelins, and some cut asunder by battle-axes, and some crushed by\r\nelephants and others trod down by horses, and some cut by car-wheels, and\r\nsome by axes, loudly called upon their kinsmen, O king. And some called\r\nupon their sons, and some upon their sires, and some upon brother and\r\nkinsmen. And some called upon their maternal uncles, and some upon their\r\nsister's sons. And some called upon others, on the field of battle. And a\r\nvery large number of combatants, O Bharata, lost their weapons, or had\r\ntheir thighs broken. And other with arms torn off or sides pierced or cut\r\nopen, were seen to wail aloud, from desire of life. And some, endued with\r\nlittle strength, tortured by thirst, O king, and lying on the field of\r\nbattle on the bare ground, asked for water. And some, weltering in pools\r\nof blood and excessively weakened, O Bharata, greatly censured themselves\r\nand thy sons assembled together for battle. And there were brave\r\nKshatriyas, who having injured one another, did not abandon their weapons\r\nor set up any wails, O sire, On the other hand, lying in those places\r\nwhere they lay, roared with joyful hearts, and biting from wrath with\r\ntheir teeth their own lips, looked at one another with faces rendered\r\nfierce in consequence of the contraction of their eyebrows. And others\r\nendued with great strength and tenacity in great pain, afflicted by\r\narrows and smarting under their wounds, remained perfectly silent. And\r\nother heroic car-warriors, deprived, in the encounter, of their own cars\r\nand thrown down and wounded by huge elephants, asked to be taken up on\r\nthe cars of others. And many, O king, looked beautiful in their wounds\r\nlike blossoming Kinsukas. And in all the divisions were heard terrific\r\ncries, countless in number. And in that awful combat destructive of\r\nheroes, the sire slew the son, the son slew the sire, the sister's son\r\nslew the maternal uncle, the maternal uncle slew the sister's son, friend\r\nslew friend, and relatives slew kinsmen. Even thus the slaughter took\r\nplace in that encounter of the Kurus with the Pandavas. And in that\r\nfrightful and terrible battle in which no consideration was shown (by\r\nanybody for anybody), the divisions of the Pandavas, approaching Bhishma,\r\nbegan to waver. And, O bull of Bharata's race, the mighty-armed Bhishma,\r\nO king, with his standard which was made of silver and graced with the\r\ndevice of the palmyra with five stars, setting upon his great car, shone\r\nlike the lunar orb under the peak of Meru.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said,--\"After the great part of the forenoon of that awful day\r\nhad worn out, in that terrific engagement, O king, that was (so)\r\ndestructive of foremost of men[333], Durmukha and Kritavarman, and Kripa,\r\nand Salya, and Vivinsati, urged by thy son, approached Bhishma and began\r\nto protect him. And protected by those five mighty car-warriors. O bull\r\nof Bharata's race, that great car-warrior penetrated the Pandava host.\r\nAnd the palmyra standard of Bhishma was seen to glide continually, O\r\nBharata, through the Chedis, the Kasis, the Karushas, and the Panchalas.\r\nAnd that hero, with broad-headed shafts of great swiftness which were\r\nagain perfectly straight, cut off the heads (of foes) and their cars with\r\nyokes and standards. And, O bull of Bharata's race, Bhishma seemed to\r\ndance on his car as it coursed along its track. And some elephants,\r\nstruck (by him) in their vital parts, shrieked in agony. Then Abhimanyu\r\nin great wrath, stationed on his car unto which were yoked excellent\r\nsteeds of a tawny hue, rushed towards Bhishma's car. And with his\r\nstandard adorned with pure gold and resembling a Karnikara tree, he\r\napproached Bhishma and those (five) foremost of car-warriors. And\r\nstriking with a keen-edged shaft the standard of the palmyra-bannered\r\n(warrior), that hero engaged in battle with Bhishma and those other\r\ncar-warriors that protected him.[334] Piercing Kritavarman with one\r\narrow, and Salya with five, he weakened his great-grandsire with nine\r\narrows. And with one arrow well shot from his bow drawn to its fullest\r\nstretch, he cut off (his adversary's) standard adorned with pure gold.\r\nAnd with one broad-headed shaft capable of penetrating every cover, which\r\nwas perfectly straight, he cut off from his body the head of Durmukha's\r\ncharioteer. And with another keen-edged arrow he cut in twain the\r\ngold-decked bow of Kripa. And them also, with many sharp-pointed shafts,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior smote in great wrath, seeming to dance (the\r\nwhile). And beholding his lightness of hand, the very gods were\r\ngratified. And in consequence of Abhimanyu's sureness of aim, all the\r\ncar-warriors headed by Bhishma regarded him to be possessed of the\r\ncapacity of Dhananjaya himself.[335] And his bow, emitting a twang like\r\nthat of Gandiva, while stretched and re-stretched, seemed to revolve like\r\na circle of fire.[336] Bhishma then, that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\nrushing on him impetuously, speedily pierced the son of Arjuna in that\r\ncombat with nine arrows. And he also, with three broad-headed shafts, cut\r\noff the standard of that warrior of great energy. Of rigid vows, Bhishma\r\nalso struck his (adversary's) charioteer. And Kritavarman, and Kripa, and\r\nSalya also, O sire, piercing Arjuna's son, all failed to make him waver,\r\nfor he stood firm like the Mainaka mountain. And the heroic son of\r\nArjuna, though surrounded by those mighty car-warriors of the\r\nDhartarashtra army, still showered on those five car-warriors arrowy\r\ndownpours. And baffling their mighty weapons by his arrowy showers, and\r\npouring on Bhishma his shafts, the powerful son of Arjuna set up loud\r\nshout. And struggling in the battle thus and afflicting Bhishma with\r\n(his) arrows, the strength we saw of his arms then was very great. But\r\nthough endued with such prowess Bhishma also shot his arrows at him. But\r\nhe cut off in that combat the arrows shot from Bhishma's bow. And then\r\nthat heroic warrior of arrows that were never lost, cut off with nine\r\narrows, in that combat, the standard of Bhishma. And at that feat the\r\npeople there set up a loud shout. Decked with jewels and made of silver,\r\nthat tall standard bearing the device of the palmyra, cut off, O Bharata,\r\nby the shafts of Subhadra's son, fell down on the earth. And beholding, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, that standard failing in consequence of the\r\nshafts of Subhadra's son, the proud Bhima set up a loud shout for\r\ncheering the son of Subhadra. Then in fierce combat, the mighty Bhishma\r\ncaused many celestial weapons of great efficacy to appear. And the great\r\ngrandsire of immeasurable soul then covered Subhadra's son with thousands\r\nof arrows. And at this, ten great bowmen and mighty car-warriors of the\r\nPandavas, quickly rushed on their cars for protecting the son of\r\nSubhadra. And those were Virata with his son, and Dhrishtadyumna of\r\nPrishata's race, and Bhima, the five Kekaya brothers, and Satyaki also, O\r\nking. And as they were falling upon him with great impetuosity, Bhishma\r\nthe son of Santanu, in that conflict, pierced the prince of Panchala with\r\nthree arrows, and Satyaki with ten. And with one winged arrow, whetted\r\nand sharp-edged as a razor, and shot from his bow drawn to its fullest\r\nstretch, he cut off the standard of Bhimasena. And, O best of men, the\r\nstandard of Bhimasena, made of gold and bearing the device of a lion, cut\r\noff by Bhishma, fell from the car. And Bhima then, piercing Santanu's son\r\nBhishma in that combat with three arrows, pierced Kripa with one, and\r\nKritavarman with eight. And Uttara also, the son of Virata, on a tusker\r\nwith upraised trunk, rushed against the ruler of the Madras. Salya,\r\nhowever, succeeded in checking the unparalleled impetuosity of that\r\nprince of elephants rushing quickly towards his car. That prince of\r\nelephants, in great wrath, placing his leg upon the yoke of (Salya's)\r\ncar, killed his four large steeds of excellent speed. The ruler of the\r\nMadras then, staying on that car whose steeds had been slain, hurled a\r\ndart, all made of iron, and resembling a snake, for slaying Uttara\r\noutright. The latter's coat of mail being cut through by that dart, he\r\nbecame totally deprived of his senses and fell down from his elephant's\r\nneck, with the hook and the lance loosened from his grasp. And Salya\r\nthen, taking up his sword and jumping down from his excellent car, and\r\nputting forth his prowess, cut off the large trunk of that prince of\r\nelephants. His coat of mail pierced all over with a shower of arrows, and\r\nhis trunk cut off, that elephant uttered a loud shriek and fell down and\r\nexpired. Achieving such a feat, O king, the ruler of the Madras speedily\r\nmounted on the splendid car of Kritavarman. And beholding his brother\r\nUttara slain and seeing Salya staying with Kritavarman, Virata's son\r\nSweta blazed up in wrath, like fire (blazing up) with clarified butter.\r\nAnd that mighty warrior, stretching his large bow that resembled the bow\r\nof Sakra himself, rushed with the desire of slaying Salya the ruler of\r\nthe Madras. Surrounded on all sides with a mighty division of cars, he\r\nadvanced towards Salya's car pouring an arrowy shower. And beholding him\r\nrush to the fight with prowess equal to that of an infuriate elephant,\r\nseven car-warriors of thy side surrounded him on all sides, desirous of\r\nprotecting the ruler of Madras who seemed to be already within the jaws\r\nof Death. And those seven warriors were Vrihadvala the ruler of the\r\nKosalas, and Jayatsena of Magadha, and Rukmaratha, O king, who was the\r\nvalourous son of Salya, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Sudakshina\r\nthe king of the Kamvojas, and Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus and\r\nthe kinsman of Vrihadkshatra. And the stretched bows of those high-souled\r\nwarriors, decorated with diverse colours, looked like the lightning's\r\nflashes in the clouds. And they all poured on Sweta's head ceaseless\r\nshowers of arrows like the clouds tossed by the wind dropping rain on the\r\nmountain breast on the expiry of summer. That mighty bowman and commander\r\nof the forces, enraged at this, with seven broad-headed arrows of great\r\nimpetuosity, struck their bows, and then continued to grind them. And\r\nthose bows we saw were cut off, O Bharata, and thereupon they all took\r\nup, within half the time taken up in a wink of the eye, other bows. And\r\nthey then shot at Sweta seven arrows. And once again that mighty-armed\r\nwarrior of immeasurable soul, with seven fleet shafts, cut off those\r\n(other) bows of these bowmen. Those warriors then, whose large bows had\r\nbeen cut off, those mighty car-warriors swelling (with rage), grasping\r\n(seven) darts, set up a loud shout. And, O chief of the Bharatas, they\r\nhurled those seven darts at Sweta's car. And those blazing darts which\r\ncoursed (through the air) like large meteors, with the sound of thunder,\r\nwere all cut off, before they could reach him, that warrior conversant\r\nwith mighty weapons, by means of seven broad-headed arrows. Then taking\r\nup an arrow capable of penetrating into every part of the body, he shot\r\nit, O chief of the Bharatas, at Rukmaratha. And that mighty arrow,\r\nsurpassing (the force of) the thunder-bolt, penetrated into the latter's\r\nbody. Then, O king, forcibly struck by that arrow, Rukmaratha sat down on\r\nthe terrace of his car and fell into a deadly swoon. His charioteer then,\r\nwithout betraying any fear, bore him away, senseless and in a swoon, in\r\nthe very sight of all. Then taking up six other (arrows) adorned with\r\ngold, the mighty-armed Sweta cut off the standard-tops of his six\r\nadversaries. And that chastiser of foes then, piercing their steeds and\r\ncharioteers also, and covering those six warriors themselves with\r\nceaseless shafts, proceeded towards the car of Salya. And beholding that\r\ngeneralissimo of the (Pandava) forces proceeding quickly towards Salya's\r\ncar, a loud uproar of oh and alas arose in thy army, O Bharata. Then thy\r\nmighty son, with Bhishma at the head, and supported by heroic warriors\r\nand many troops, proceeded towards Sweta's car.[337] And he (thus)\r\nrescued the ruler of the Madras who had already entered the jaws of\r\nDeath. And then commenced a battle, terrific and making the hair stand on\r\nend, between thy troops and those of the enemy, in which cars and\r\nelephants all got mixed up in confusion. And upon Subhadra's son and\r\nBhimasena, and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki, and upon the ruler of the\r\nKekayas, and Virata, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishatas' race, and upon the\r\nChedi troops, the old Kuru grandsire poured showers of arrows.[338]"

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said,--\"When that great bowman Sweta proceeded towards\r\nSalya's car, what did the Kauravas and the Pandavas do, O Sanjaya? And\r\nwhat also did Bhishma the son of Santanu do? Tell me who ask thee, all\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said,--\"O king, hundreds and thousands of bulls among Kshatriyas,\r\nall brave and mighty car-warriors, placing the generalissimo Sweta in the\r\nvan, and displaying their strength. O Bharata, unto thy royal son and\r\nwith Sikhandin also at their head, desired to rescue (Sweta). And those\r\nmighty car-warriors rushed towards Bhishma's car decked with gold\r\ndesirous of slaying that foremost of warriors. And the battle that ensued\r\nthen was terrible. I shall describe to thee that wonderful and terrific\r\nbattle as it occurred between thy troops and those of the enemy. The son\r\nof Santanu made the terraces of many cars empty, (for) that best of\r\ncar-warriors showering (his) arrows, cut off many heads. Endued with\r\nenergy equal to that of the Sun himself, he shrouded the very Sun with\r\nhis arrows. And he removed his enemies from around him in that combat\r\nlike the rising Sun dispelling the darkness around. And in that battle, O\r\nking, arrows were shot by him in hundreds and thousands that were\r\npowerful and possessed of great impetuosity and that took in that\r\nconflict the lives of numberless Kshatriyas. And in that combat he felled\r\nheads, by hundreds, of heroic warriors, O king, and elephants cased in\r\nthorny mail, like summits of mountains (felled) by heaven's bolt. And\r\ncars, O king, were seen to mingle with cars. A car might be seen upon\r\nanother car, and a steed upon another steed. And impetuous chargers, O\r\nking, bore hither and thither heroic riders in the prime of youth, slain\r\nand hanging (from their saddles) with their bows (still in their\r\ngrasp).[339] With swords and quivers attached (to their persons) and\r\ncoats of mail loosened (from their bodies), hundreds of warriors,\r\ndeprived of life, lay on the ground, sleeping on beds (worthy) of heroes.\r\nRushing against one another, falling down and rising up again and rushing\r\nagain having risen up, the combatants fought hand to hand. Afflicted by\r\none another, many rolled on the field of battle. Infuriate elephants\r\nrushed hither and thither, and car-warriors by hundreds were slain. And\r\ncar-warriors, along with their cars, were crushed on all sides. And some\r\nwarriors fell upon his car, slain by another with arrows. And a mighty\r\ncar-warrior might be seen to fall down from high, his charioteer (also)\r\nhaving been slain. A thick dust arose, and thereupon unto the warrior\r\nstruggling in battle, the twang of the (hostile) bow indicated the\r\nstruggling adversary before. From the pressure also on their bodies,\r\ncombatants guessed their foes. And the warriors, O king, fought on with\r\narrows, guided by the sound of bow-strings and (hostile) division. The\r\nvery hiss of the arrows shot by the combatants at one another could not\r\nbe heard. And so loud was the sound of drums, that it seemed to pierce\r\nthe ears. And in that tumultuous uproar making the hair stand on end, the\r\nname of the combatant uttered in the battle, while displaying his\r\nprowess, could not be heard. The sire could not recognise the son of his\r\nloins. One of the wheels being broken, or the yoke being torn off or one\r\nof the steeds being slain, the brave car-warrior was overthrown from his\r\ncar, along with his charioteer, by means of straight arrows. And thus\r\nmany heroic warriors, deprived of their cars, were seen to fly away.[340]\r\nHe who was slain had cut off; he who was not slain, was struck at the\r\nvery vitals: but unstruck there was none, when Bhishma attacked the foe.\r\nAnd in that terrific battle, Sweta caused a great slaughter of the Kurus.\r\nAnd he slew many noble princes by hundreds upon hundreds.[341] And he cut\r\noff, by means of his arrows, the heads of car-warriors by hundreds upon\r\nhundreds, and (their) arms decked with Angadas, and (their) bows all\r\naround. And car-warriors and car-wheels and others that were on cars, and\r\nthe cars themselves, and standards both small and costly, O king, and\r\nlarge bodies of horses, and crowds of cars, and crowds of men, O\r\nBharata's race, were destroyed by Sweta. Ourselves, from fear of Sweta,\r\nabandoning (Bhishma) that best of car-warriors, left the battle\r\nretreating to the rear and, therefore, do we (now) behold your lordship.\r\nAnd all the Kurus, O son of Kuru's race, beyond the range of arrows, and\r\nabandoning Bhishma the son of Santanu, in that battle, stood (as\r\nspectators though) armed for the combat. Cheerful in the hour of\r\n(universal) cheerlessness, that tiger among men Bhishma, alone of our\r\narmy, in that terrible battle stood immovable like the mountain Meru.\r\nTaking the lives (of the foe) like the Sun at close of winter, he stood\r\nresplendent with the golden rays (of his car) like the Sun himself with\r\nhis rays. And that great bowman shot clouds of arrows and struck down the\r\nAsuras.[342] And while being slaughtered by Bhishma in that dreadful\r\ncombat, those warriors breaking away from their ranks, they all fled from\r\nhim, as if from a fire fed by fuel.[343] Encountering the single warrior\r\n(Sweta), that slayer of foes, Bhishma, was the only one (amongst us) who\r\nwas cheerful and whole. Devoted to the welfare of Duryodhana, he began to\r\nconsume the Pandava (warrior). Reckless of his very life which is\r\ndifficult of being cast off, and abandoning all fear he slaughtered, O\r\nking, the Pandava army in that fierce conflict.[344] And beholding the\r\ngeneralissimo (Sweta) smiting the (Dhartarashtra) divisions, thy father\r\nBhishma, called also Devavrata, impetuously rushed against him.\r\nThereupon, Sweta covered Bhishma with an extensive net-work of arrows.\r\nAnd Bhishma also covered Sweta with a flight of arrows. And roaring like\r\na couple of bulls, they rushed, like two infuriate elephants of gigantic\r\nsize or two raging tigers, against each other. Baffling each other's\r\nweapons by means of their weapons, those bulls among men, viz., Bhishma\r\nand Sweta fought with each other, desirous of taking each other's life.\r\nIn one single day Bhishma, infuriate with anger, could consume the\r\nPandava army with his arrows, if Sweta did not protect it. Beholding the\r\ngrandsire then turned off by Sweta, the Pandavas were filled with joy,\r\nwhile thy son became cheerless. Duryodhana then, with wrath excited and\r\nsurrounded by many kings, rushed with his troops against the Pandava host\r\nin battle. Then Sweta, abandoning the son of Ganga, slaughtered thy son's\r\nhost with great impetuosity like the wind (uprooting) trees with\r\nviolence. And the son of Virata, senseless with wrath, having routed thy\r\narmy, advanced (once more), O king, to the place where Bhishma was\r\nstationed. And those two high-souled and mighty warriors then, both\r\nblazing with their arrows, battled with each other like Vritra and Vasava\r\n(of old), desirous, O king, of slaying each other. Drawing (his) bow to\r\nthe fullest stretch, Sweta pierced Bhishma with seven arrows. The\r\nvalourous (Bhishma) then, putting forth his prowess, quickly checked his\r\nfoe's valour, like an infuriate elephant checking an infuriate compeer.\r\nAnd Sweta then, that delighter of Kshatriyas struck Bhishma, and Bhishma\r\nthe son of Santanu also pierced him in return with ten arrows. And though\r\npierced by him (thus), that mighty warrior stood still like a mountain.\r\nAnd Sweta again pierced Santanu's son with five and twenty straight\r\narrows, at which all wondered. Then smiling and licking with his tongue\r\nthe corners of his mouth, Sweta in that combat cut off Bhishma's bow into\r\nten fragments with ten arrows. Then aiming a plumed arrow made wholly of\r\niron, (Sweta) crushed the palmyra on the top of the standard of the\r\nhigh-souled (Bhishma). And beholding the standard of Bhishma cut down,\r\nthy sons thought that Bhishma was slain, having succumbed to Sweta. And\r\nthe Pandavas also filled with delight, blew their conches all around. And\r\nbeholding the palmyra standard of the high-souled Bhishma laid low,\r\nDuryodhana, from wrath, urged his own army to the battle. And they all\r\nbegan very carefully to protect Bhishma who 'was in great distress. Unto\r\nthem, also unto those that stood (idle) spectators, the king\r\nsaid,--Either Sweta will die (today), or Bhishma the son of Santanu. I\r\nsay this truly. Hearing the words of the king, the mighty car-warriors\r\nspeedily with four kinds of forces, advanced protecting the son of Ganga.\r\nAnd Valhika and Kritavarman, and Kripa, and Salya also, O Bharata, and\r\nthe son of Jarasandha, and Vikarna, and Chitrasena, and Vivinsati, with\r\ngreat speed, when speed was so necessary, surrounding him on all sides,\r\npoured on Sweta ceaseless showers of arrows. That mighty warrior then, of\r\nimmeasurable soul, quickly checked those angry warriors by means of sharp\r\narrows, displaying his own lightness of hand. And checking them all like\r\na lion and a multitude of elephants, Sweta then cut off Bhishma's bow\r\nwith thick shower of arrows. Then Bhishma the son of Santanu, taking up\r\nanother bow in that battle, pierced Sweta, O king, with arrows furnished\r\nwith feathers of Kanka bird. Then the commander (of the Pandava army),\r\nwith wrath excited, pierced Bhishma in that encounter O king, with a\r\ngreat many shafts in the very sight of all. Beholding Bhishma, that\r\nforemost of heroes in all the world, checked in battle by Sweta, the king\r\n(Duryodhana) became greatly troubled, and great also became the distress\r\nof thy whole army. And beholding the heroic Bhishma checked and mangled\r\nby Sweta with his arrows, all thought that Bhishma, having succumbed to\r\nSweta, was slain by him. Then thy sire Devavrata, yielding to anger, and\r\nbeholding his (own) standard overthrown and the (Dhartarashtra) army\r\nchecked, shot a great many arrows, O king, at Sweta. Sweta, however, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, baffling all those arrows of Bhishma, once more\r\ncut off, with a broad-headed shaft, thy sire's bow. Throwing aside that\r\nbow, O king, Ganga's son, senseless with anger, taking up another bow\r\nlarger and stronger, and aiming seven large broad-headed arrows whetted\r\non stone, slew with four arrows the four steeds of the generalissimo\r\nSweta, cut off his standard with two and with the seventh shaft that\r\nwarrior of great prowess, exceedingly provoked, cut off his charioteer's\r\nhead. Thereupon, that mighty car-warrior, jumping down from his car whose\r\nsteeds and charioteer had been slain[345], and yielding to the influence\r\nof wrath, became exceedingly troubled. The grandsire, beholding Sweta\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, deprived of car, began to smite him on all\r\nsides with showers of arrows. And smitten in that combat with arrows shot\r\nfrom Bhishma's bow, Sweta, leaving his bow on his (abandoned) car took up\r\na dart decked with gold and taking up that terrible and fierce dart[346]\r\nwhich resembled the fatal rod of Death and was capable of slaying Death's\r\nself. Sweta then, in great wrath, addressed Bhishma the son of Santanu in\r\nthat combat, saying,--Wait a little, and behold me, O best of men,--And\r\nhaving said this unto Bhishma in battle, that great bowman of exceeding\r\nprowess and immeasurable soul, hurled the dart resembling a snake,\r\ndisplaying his valour for the sake of the Pandavas and desiring to\r\nachieve thy evil. Then loud cries of oh and alas arose among thy sons, O\r\nking, upon beholding that terrible dart resembling the rod of Death in\r\nsplendour. And hurled from Sweta's arms, (that dart), resembling a snake\r\nthat had just cast off its slough, fell with great force, O king, like a\r\nlarge meteor from the firmament. Thy sire Devavrata then, O king, without\r\nthe slightest fear, with eight sharp and winged arrows, cut off into nine\r\nfragments, that dart decked with pure gold and which seemed to be covered\r\nwith flames of fire, as it coursed ablaze through the air. All thy troops\r\nthen, O bull of Bharata's race, set up loud shouts of joy. The son of\r\nVirata, however, beholding his dart cut off into fragments, became\r\nsenseless with anger, and like one whose heart was overcome by (the\r\narrival of) his hour, could not settle what to do. Deprived of his senses\r\nby anger, O king, the son of Virata, then, smiling, joyfully took up a\r\nmace for Bhishma's slaughter, with eyes red in wrath, and resembling a\r\nsecond Yama armed with mace, he rushed against Bhishma like a swollen\r\ntorrent against the rocks. Regarding his impetuosity as incapable of\r\ncheek, Bhishma endued with great prowess and conversant with the might\r\n(of others), suddenly alighted on the ground for warding off that blow.\r\nSweta then, O king, whirling in wrath that heavy mace, hurled it on\r\nBhishma's car like the god Maheswara.[347] And in consequence of that\r\nmace intended for Bhishma's destruction, that car was reduced to ashes,\r\nwith standard, and charioteer, and steeds and shaft. Beholding Bhishma,\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, become a combatant on foot, many\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Salya and others, speedily rushed (to his rescue).\r\nMounting then upon another car, and cheerlessly stretching his bow,\r\nBhishma slowly advanced towards Sweta, seeing that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors. Meanwhile, Bhishma heard a loud voice uttered in the skies,\r\nthat was celestial and fraught with his own good. (And the voice\r\nsaid).--'O, Bhishma, O thou of mighty arms, strive without losing a\r\nmoment. Even this is the hour fixed by the Creator of the Universe for\r\nsuccess over this one'. Hearing those words uttered by the celestial\r\nmessenger, Bhishma, filled with joy, set his heart upon Sweta's\r\ndestruction. And beholding that foremost of car-warriors, Sweta become a\r\ncombatant on foot, many mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava side) rushed\r\nunitedly (to his rescue). (They were) Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race; and the (five) Kekaya brothers, and\r\nDhrishtaketu and Abhimanyu of great energy. And beholding them rushing\r\n(to the rescue), with Drona and Salya and Kripa that hero of immeasurable\r\nsoul (Bhishma) checked them all like the mountain resisting the force of\r\nthe wind. And when all the high-souled warriors of the Pandava side were\r\n(thus) held in check, Sweta, taking up a sword cut off Bhishma's bow.\r\nCasting aside that bow, the grandsire, quickly made up his mind for\r\nSweta's destruction, having heard the words of the celestial messenger.\r\nThough baffled (by Sweta), thy sire Devavrata then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior quickly taking up another bow that resembled the bow of Sakra\r\nhimself in splendour, stringed it in a moment. Then thy sire, O chief of\r\nthe Bharatas, beholding that mighty car-warrior Sweta, though the latter\r\nwas then surrounded by those tigers among men with Bhimasena at their\r\nhead,--(thy sire) the son of Ganga-advanced steadily for the sake of the\r\ngeneralissimo Sweta alone. Beholding Bhishma advance, Bhimasena of great\r\nprowess pierced him with sixty shafts. But that mighty car-warrior, thy\r\nsire Devavrata, checking both Bhimasena and Abhimanyu and other\r\ncar-warriors with terrible shafts, struck him with three straight arrows.\r\nAnd the grandsire of the Bharatas also struck Satyaki, in that combat,\r\nwith a hundred arrows, and Dhrishtadyumna with twenty and the Kekaya\r\nbrothers with five. And checking all those great bowmen with terrible\r\narrows, thy sire Devavrata advanced towards Sweta alone. Then taking out\r\nan arrow resembling Death's self and capable of bearing a great strain\r\nand incapable of being resisted, the powerful Bhishma placed it on his\r\nbowstring. And that shaft, furnished with wings and duly endued with the\r\nforce of the Brahma weapon, was seen by the gods and Gandharvas and\r\nPisachas and Uragas, and Rakshasas. And that shaft, of splendour like\r\nthat of a blazing fire, piercing through his coat of mail (passed through\r\nhis body and) struck into the earth, with a flash like that of heaven's\r\nbolt. Like the Sun when speedily retiring to his western chambers taking\r\nalong with him the rays of light, even thus that shaft passed out of\r\nSweta's body, bearing away with itself his life. Thus slain in battle by\r\nBhishma, we beheld that tiger among men fall down like the loosened crest\r\nof a mountain. And all the mighty car-warriors of the Kshatriya race\r\nbelonging to the Pandava side indulged in lamentations. Thy sons,\r\nhowever, and all the Kurus, were filled with delight. Then, O king,\r\nbeholding Sweta overthrown, Dussasana danced in joy over the field in\r\naccompaniment With the loud music of conches and drums. And when that\r\ngreat bowman was slain by Bhishma, that ornament of battle, the mighty\r\nbowmen (of the Pandava side) with Sikhandin at their head, trembled in\r\nfear. Then when their commander was slain, Dhananjaya, O king, and he of\r\nVrishni's race, slowly withdrew the troops (for their nightly rest). And\r\nthen, O Bharata, the withdrawal took place of both theirs and thine,\r\nwhile thine and theirs were frequently setting up loud roars. And the\r\nmighty car-warriors of the Parthas entered (their quarters) cheerlessly,\r\nthinking, O chastiser of foes, of that awful slaughter in single combat\r\n(of their commander).\""

Hearing their commander Sweta slain, what happened between\r\nthose that strove for his sake and their foes that retreated before them?\r\nO Sanjaya, hearing of our victory, (thy) words please my heart? Nor doth\r\nmy heart feel any shame in remembering our transgression.[348] The old\r\nchief of Kuru's race is ever cheerful and devoted (to us). (As regards\r\nDuryodhana), having provoked hostilities with that intelligent son of his\r\nuncle, he sought at one time the protection of the sons of Pandu in\r\nconsequence of his anxiety and fear due to Yudhishthira. At that time,\r\nabandoning everything he lived in misery. In consequence of the prowess\r\nof the sons of Pandu, and everywhere receiving checks--having placed\r\nhimself amid entanglements--from his enemies Duryodhana had (for some\r\ntime) recourse to honourable behaviour. Formerly that wicked-minded king\r\nhad placed himself under their protection. Why, therefore, O Sanjaya,\r\nhath Sweta who was devoted to Yudhishthira, been slain. Indeed, this\r\nnarrow-minded prince, with all his prospects, hath been hurled to the\r\nnether regions by a number of wretches. Bhishma liked not the war, nor\r\neven did the preceptor.[349] Nor Kripa, nor Gandhari liked it. O Sanjaya,\r\nnor do I like it, nor Vasudeva of Vrishni's race, nor that just king the\r\nson of Pandu; nor Bhima, nor Arjuna, nor those bulls among men, the twins\r\n(liked it.) Always forbidden by me, by Gandhari, by Vidura, by Rama the\r\nson of Jamadagni, and by the high-souled Vyasa also, the wicked-minded\r\nand sinful Duryodhana, with Dussasana, O Sanjaya, always following the\r\ncounsels of Karna and Suvala's son, behaved maliciously towards the\r\nPandavas. I think, O Sanjaya, that he has fallen into great distress.\r\nAfter the slaughter of Sweta and the victory of Bhishma what did Partha,\r\nexcited with rage, do in battle accompanied by Krishna? Indeed, it is\r\nfrom Arjuna that my fears arise, and those fears, O Sanjaya, cannot be\r\ndispelled. He, Dhananjaya. the son of Kunti, is brave and endued with\r\ngreat activity. I think, with his arrows he will cut into fragments the\r\nbodies of his enemies. The son of Indra, and in battle equal unto Upendra\r\nthe younger brother of Indra, a warrior whose wrath and purposes are\r\nnever futile, alas, beholding him what becomes the state of your minds?\r\nBrave, acquainted with Vedas, resembling the fire and the Sun in\r\nsplendour, and possessing a knowledge of the Aindra weapon, that warrior\r\nof immeasurable soul is ever victorious when he falleth upon the foe? His\r\nweapons always falling upon the foe with the force of the thunderbolt and\r\nhis arms wonderfully quick in drawing the bowstring, the son of Kunti is\r\na mighty car-warrior. The formidable son of Drupada also, O Sanjaya, is\r\nendued with great wisdom. What, indeed, did Dhristadyumna do when Sweta\r\nwas slain in battle? I think that in consequence of the wrongs they\r\nsustained of old, and of the slaughter of their commander, the hearts of\r\nthe high-souled Pandavas blazed up. Thinking of their wrath I am never at\r\nmy ease, by day or by night, on account of Duryodhana. How did the great\r\nbattle take place? Tell me all about it, O Sanjaya.\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Hear, O king, quietly about thy transgressions. It\r\nbehoveth thee not to impute the fruit to Duryodhana. As is the\r\nconstruction of an embankment when the waters have disappeared, so is thy\r\nunderstanding, or, it is like the digging of a well when house is on\r\nfire.[350] When, after the forenoon had passed away, the commander Sweta\r\nwas, O Bharata, slain by Bhishma in that fierce conflict, Virata's son\r\nSankha, that grinder of hostile ranks ever delighting in battle,\r\nbeholding Salya stationed with Kritavarman (on his car), suddenly blazed\r\nup with wrath, like fire with clarified butter. That mighty warrior,\r\nstretching his large bow that resembled the bow of Indra himself, rushed\r\nwith the desire of slaying the ruler of the Madras in battle, himself\r\nsupported on all sides by a large division of cars. And Sankha, causing\r\nan arrowy downpour rushed towards the car on which Salya was. And\r\nbeholding him advancing like an infuriate elephant, seven mighty\r\ncar-warriors of thy side surrounded him--desirous of rescuing the ruler\r\nof the Madras already within the jaws of death. Then the mighty-armed\r\nBhishma, roaring like the very clouds, and taking up a bow full six\r\ncubits long, rushed towards Sankha in battle. And beholding that mighty\r\ncar-warrior and great bowman thus rushing, the Pandava host began to\r\ntremble like a boat tossed by a violence of the tempest. Then Arjuna,\r\nquickly advancing, placed himself in front of Sankha, thinking that\r\nSankha should, then be protected from Bhishma. And then the combat\r\ncommenced between Bhishma and Arjuna. And loud cries of oh and alas arose\r\namong the warriors engaged in battle. And one force seemed to merge into\r\nanother force. And thus all were filled with wonder.[351] Then Salya,\r\nmace in hand, alighting from his large car, slew, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, the four steeds of Sankha. Jumping down from his car thus deprived\r\nof steeds, and taking a sword, Sankha ran towards Vibhatsu's car and\r\n(mounting on it) was once more at his ease. And then there fell from\r\nBhishma's car innumerable arrows by which were covered the entire welkin\r\nand the earth. And that foremost of smiters, Bhishma, slaughtered with\r\nhis arrows the Panchala, the Matsya, the Kekaya, and the Prabhadraka\r\nhost. And soon abandoning in that battle, Pandu's son (Arjuna) capable of\r\ndrawing the bow with even his left hand, Bhishma rushed towards Drupada,\r\nthe king of the Panchalas, surrounded by his host. And he soon covered\r\nhis dear relative with innumerable arrows. Like a forest consumed by fire\r\nat the end of winter, the troops of Drupada were seen to be consumed. And\r\nBhishma stood in that battle like a blazing fire without smoke, or like\r\nthe Sun himself at midday scorching everything around with his heat. The\r\ncombatants of the Pandavas were not able to even look at Bhishma. And\r\nafflicted with fear, the Pandava host cast its eyes around, and not\r\nbeholding any protector, looked like a herd of kine afflicted by cold.\r\nSlaughtered or retreating in despondence being crushed the while, loud\r\ncries, O Bharata, of oh and alas arose among the troops of the Pandavas.\r\nThen Bhishma the son of Santanu, with bow always drawn to a circle, shot\r\ntherefrom blazing arrows that resembled virulent poison. And creating\r\ncontinuous lines of arrows in all directions, that hero of rigid vows\r\nslew Pandava car-warriors, naming each, O Bharata, beforehand. And then\r\nwhen the troops of the Pandavas were routed and crushed all over the\r\nfield, the sun set and nothing could be seen. And then beholding Bhishma,\r\nO bull of Bharata's race, proudly standing in battle, the Parthas\r\nwithdrew their forces (for nightly rest).\""

Filled with great grief thinking of his\r\ndefeat, and beholding Bhishma's prowess, O king, he addressed that scion\r\nof Vrishni's race, saying, 'Behold, O Krishna, that mighty bowman Bhishma\r\nof terrible prowess. He consumes with his arrow my troops like fire\r\n(consuming) dry grass. How shall we even look at that high-souled\r\n(warrior) who is licking up my troops like fire fed with clarified\r\nbutter? Beholding; that tiger among men, that mighty warrior armed with\r\nthe bow, my troops fly away, afflicted with arrows. Enraged Yama himself,\r\nor He armed with the thunder, or even Varuna noose in hand, or Kuvera\r\narmed with mace, may be vanquished in battle but the mighty car-warrior\r\nBhishma, of great energy is incapable of being vanquished. Such being the\r\ncase, I am sinking in the fathomless ocean represented by Bhishma,\r\nwithout a boat (to rescue me).[352] In consequence, O Kesava, of the\r\nweakness of my understanding, having obtained Bhishma (for a foe in\r\nbattle), I shall, O Govinda, retire into woods. To live there is\r\npreferable to devoting these lords of earth to Death in the form of\r\nBhishma. Conversant with mighty weapons, Bhishma, O Krishna, will\r\nannihilate my army. As insects rush into the blazing fire for their own\r\ndestruction, the combatants of my army are even so. In putting forth\r\nprowess for the sake of kingdom, O thou of Vrishni's race, I am being led\r\nto destruction. My heroic brothers also are pained and afflicted with\r\narrows for my sake, having been deprived of both sovereignty and\r\nhappiness in consequence of their love for their eldest brother. We\r\nregard life very highly, for, under these circumstances, life is too\r\nprecious (to be sacrificed). During the remainder of my days I will\r\npractise the severest of ascetic austerities. I will not, O Kesava, cause\r\nthese friends of mine to be slain.[353] The mighty Bhishma incessantly\r\nstays, with his celestial weapon, many thousands of my car-warriors who\r\nare foremost of smiters. Tell me, O Madhava, without delay, what should\r\nbe done that might do me good. As regards Arjuna, I see that he is an\r\nindifferent spectator in this battle. Endued with great might, this Bhima\r\nalone, remembering Kshatriya duties, fighteth putting forth the prowess\r\nof his arms and to the utmost of his power. With his hero-slaying mace,\r\nthis high-souled (warrior), to the full measure of his powers, achieveth\r\nthe most difficult feats upon foot-soldiers and steeds and cars and\r\nelephants. This hero, however, is incapable, O sire, of destroying in\r\nfair fight the hostile host in even a century. This thy friend (Arjuna)\r\nalone (amongst) is conversant with (mighty) weapons. He, however,\r\nbeholding us consumed by Bhishma and the high-souled Drona, looketh\r\nindifferently on us. The celestial weapons of Bhishma and the high-souled\r\nDrona, incessantly applied, are consuming all the Kshatriyas. O Krishna,\r\nsuch is his prowess, that Bhishma, with wrath excited, aided by the kings\r\n(on his side), will, without doubt annihilate us. O Lord of Yoga, look\r\nfor that great bowman, that mighty car-warrior, who will give Bhishma his\r\nquietus like rain-charged clouds quenching a forest conflagration. (Then)\r\nthrough thy grace, O Govinda, the son of Pandu, their foes being slain,\r\nwill, after recovery of their kingdom, be happy with their kinsmen.\r\n\r\n\"Having said this, the high-souled son of Pritha, with heart afflicted by\r\ngrief and mind turned within, remained silent for a long while in a\r\nreflected mood. Beholding the son of Pandu stricken with grief and\r\ndeprived of his senses by sorrow, Govinda then gladdening all the\r\nPandavas said, 'Do not grieve, O chief of the Bharatas. It behoveth thee\r\nnot to grieve, when thy brothers are all heroes and renowned bowmen in\r\nthe world. I also am employed in doing thee good, as also that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki and Virata and Drupada, both reverend in years, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna of Prishata's line. And so also, O best of kings, all\r\nthese monarchs with their (respective) troops are expectant of thy favour\r\nand devoted to thee, O king. This mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna of\r\nPrishata's race placed in command of thy army is always desirous of thy\r\nwelfare and engaged in doing that which is agreeable to thee, as also\r\nthis Sikhandin, O thou of mighty arms, who is certainly the slayer of\r\nBhishma. Hearing these words, the king (Yudhishthira), said, unto that\r\nmighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, in that very assembly and in the\r\nhearing of Vasudeva, these words, O Dhrishtadyumna, mark these words that\r\nI say unto thee, O thou of Prishata's line. The words uttered by me\r\nshould not be transgressed. Approved by Vasudeva, thou hast been the\r\ncommander of our forces. As Kartikeya, in days of old, was ever the\r\ncommander of the celestial host, so also art thou, O bull among men, the\r\ncommander of the Pandava host. Putting forth thy prowess, O tiger among\r\nmen, slay the Kauravas. I will follow thee, and Bhima, and Krishna also,\r\nO sire, and the sons of Madri united together, and the sons of Draupadi\r\naccoutred in mail, and all the other foremost of kings, O bull among men.\r\nThen gladdening (the listeners) Dhrishtadyumna said, 'Ordained of old by\r\nSambhu himself, I am, O son of Pritha, the slayer of Drona. I shall now\r\nfight in battle against Bhishma, and Drona and Kripa and Salya and\r\nJayadratha and all the proud monarchs (on the Kuru side)'. When that\r\nforemost of princes, that slayer of foes, the son of Prishata, said this\r\ndefiantly, the Pandava warriors, endued with great energy and incapable\r\nof being defeated in battle, all set up a loud shout. And then Pritha's\r\nson Yudhishthira said unto the commander of his army, the son of\r\nPrishata, (these words), 'An array known by the name of Krauncharuma,\r\nthat is destructive of all foes, and that was spoken of by Vrihaspati\r\nunto Indra in days of old when the gods and the Asuras fought,--that\r\narray destructive of hostile divisions, do thou form. Unseen before, the\r\nkings behold it, along with the Kurus.' Thus addressed by that god among\r\nmen, like Vishnu addressed by the wielder of the thunderbolt,[354] he\r\n(Dhrishtadyumna), when morning dawned, placed Dhananjaya in the van of\r\nthe whole army. And Dhananjaya's standard, created at Indra's command by\r\nthe celestial artificer, while moving through the skies, seemed\r\nwonderfully beautiful. Decked with banners bearing hues resembling those\r\nof Indra's bow,[355] coursing through the air like a ranger of the skies,\r\nand looking like the fleeting edifice of vapour in the welkin, it seemed,\r\nO sire to glide dancingly along the track of the car (to which it was\r\nattached). And the bearer of Gandiva with that (standard) graced with\r\ngems, and that standard itself with the bearer of Gandiva, looked highly\r\nadorned, like the Self-create with the Sun (and the Sun with the\r\nSelf-create).[356] And king Drupada, surrounded by a large number of\r\ntroops, became the head (of that array). And the two kings Kuntibhoja and\r\nSaivya became its two eyes. And the ruler of the Dasarnas, and the\r\nPrayagas, with the Daserakas, and the Anupakas, and the Kiratas were\r\nplaced in its neck, O bull of Bharata's race. And Yudhishthira, O king,\r\nwith the Patachcharas, the Hunas, the Pauravakas and the Nishadas, became\r\nits two wings, so also the Pisachas, with the Kundavishas, and the\r\nMandakas, the Ladakas, the Tanganas, and the Uddras, O Bharata, and the\r\nSaravas, the Tumbhumas, the Vatsas, and the Nakulas. And Nakula and\r\nSahadeva placed themselves on the left wing. And on the joints of the\r\nwings were placed ten thousand cars and on the head a hundred thousand,\r\nand on the back a hundred millions and twenty thousand and on the neck a\r\nhundred and seventy thousand. And on the joints of the wings, the wings\r\nand the extremities of the wings proceeded elephants in large bodies,\r\nlooking, O king, like blazing mountains. And the rear was protected by\r\nVirata aided by the Kekayas, and the ruler of Kasi and the king of the\r\nChedis, with thirty thousand cars.[357] Forming, O Bharata, their mighty\r\narray thus, the Pandavas, expectant of sunrise, waited for battle, all\r\ncased in armour. And their white umbrellas, clean and costly, and\r\nbrilliant as the sun, shone resplendent on their elephants and cars.\"[358]"

And horse-men and car-warriors and foremost of steeds fell\r\nfast. And the car-divisions of the Pandavas began to fly away. Then that\r\ntiger among men, Arjuna, beholding that mighty car-warrior Bhishma,\r\nangrily said unto him of Vrishni's race. 'Proceed to the place where the\r\ngrandsire is. O thou of Vrishni's race, it is evident that this Bhishma,\r\nwith wrath excited, will annihilate for Duryodhana's benefit my host. And\r\nthis Drona, and Kripa and Salya and Vikarna, O Janardana, united with\r\nDhritarashtra's sons headed by Duryodhana, and protected by this firm\r\nbowman, will slaughter the Panchalas. Even I, therefore, shall stay\r\nBhishma for the sake of my troops, O Janardana.' Unto him Vasudeva then\r\nsaid, 'Be careful, O Dhananjaya, for I will soon take thee, O hero,\r\ntowards the grandsire's car.' Having said this, O king, Saurin took that\r\ncar, which was celebrated over the world, before the car of Bhishma. With\r\nnumerous banners all waving, with steeds looking handsome like a flight\r\nof (white) cranes, with standard upraised on which was the ape roaring\r\nfiercely, upon his large car of solar effulgence and whose rattle\r\nresembled roar of the clouds, slaughtering the Kaurava divisions and the\r\nSurasenas also, the son of Pandu, that enhancer of the joys of friends\r\nspeedily came to the encounter. Him (thus) rushing impetuously like an\r\ninfuriate elephant and (thus) frightening in a battle brave combatants\r\nand felling them with his shafts, Bhishma the son of Santanu, protected\r\nby the warriors headed by Saindhava and by the combatants of the East and\r\nthe Sauviras and the Kekayas, encountered with great impetuosity. Who\r\nelse save the Kuru grandsire and those car-warriors, viz., Drona and\r\nVikartana's son (Karna), are capable of advancing in battle against the\r\nbearer of the bow called Gandiva? Then, O great king, Bhishma, the\r\ngrandsire of the Kauravas, struck Arjuna with seventy-seven arrows and\r\nDrona (struck him) with five and twenty, and Kripa with fifty, and\r\nDuryodhana with four and sixty, and Salya with nine arrows; and Drona's\r\nson, that tiger among men, with sixty, and Vikarna with three arrows; and\r\nSaindhava with nine and Sakuni with five. And Artayani O king, pierced\r\nPandu's son with three broad-headed arrows. And (though) pierced on all\r\nsides by them with sharp arrows, that great bowman,[361] that\r\nmighty-armed (warrior), wavered not like mountain that is pierced (with\r\narrows). Thereupon he, the diadem-decked, of immeasurable soul, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, in return pierced Bhishma with five and twenty, and Kripa\r\nwith nine arrows, and Drona with sixty, O tiger among men, and Vikarna\r\nwith three arrows; and Artayani with three arrows, and the king\r\n(Duryodhana) also with five. And then Satyaki, and Virata and\r\nDhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and the sons of Draupadi, and\r\nAbhimanyu, all surrounded him, (proceeding to his support). Then the\r\nprince of the Panchalas, supported by the Somakas, advanced towards the\r\ngreat bowman Drona who was engaged in seeking the welfare of Ganga's son.\r\nThen Bhishma, that foremost of car-warriors, speedily pierced the son of\r\nPandu with eighty sharp arrows, upon which the combatants on thy side\r\nwere much gratified. Hearing the shouts of those lions among\r\ncar-warriors, Dhananjaya, endued with great prowess, then cheerfully\r\nentered into the midst of those lions among car-warriors and sported with\r\nhis bow, O king, (successively) aiming those mighty car-warriors. Then\r\nthat ruler of men, king Duryodhana, said unto Bhishma, beholding his own\r\ntroops (thus) afflicted in battle by the son of Pritha. 'This mighty son\r\nof Pandu, O sire, accompanied by Krishna, felling all our troops, cutteth\r\ndown our roots, even though thou, O son of Ganga, and that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, Drona, are alive. O monarch, it is for thee only that this\r\nKarna, laying aside his weapons, doth not fight with the sons of Pritha\r\nin battle (though) he is ever a well-wisher of mine, Do, therefore, that,\r\nO son of Ganga by which Phalguni may be slain. 'Thus addressed, O king,\r\nthy sire Devavrata, saying, 'Fie to Kshatriya usage', then proceeded\r\ntowards Partha's car. And all the kings, O monarch, seeing both those\r\nwarriors with white steeds yoked unto their cars stationed (for battle),\r\nset up loud leonine roars, and also blew their conches, O sire. And\r\nDrona's son and Duryodhana, and thy son Vikarna, surrounding Bhishma in\r\nthat combat, stood, O sire, for battle. And so all the Pandavas,\r\nsurrounding Dhananjaya, stood for fierce conflict. And the battle then\r\ncommenced. And the son of Ganga pierced Partha in that combat with nine\r\nshafts. And Arjuna pierced him in return with ten shafts penetrating into\r\nthe very vitals. Then, with a thousand arrows, well shot, Pandu's son\r\nArjuna, famed for his skill in battle, shrouded Bhishma on all sides.\r\nThat arrowy net, however, of Partha, O king, Bhishma the son of Santanu\r\nbaffled with an arrowy net (of his own). And both well-pleased, and both\r\ndelighting in battle, fought with each other without each gaining any\r\nadvantage over the other, and each desirous of counteracting the other's\r\nfeats. And the successive flights of arrows shot from Bhishma's bow were\r\nseen to be dispersed by the shafts of Arjuna. And so the flights of\r\narrows shot by Arjuna, cut off by the arrows of Ganga's son, all fell\r\ndown on the ground. And Arjuna pierced Bhishma with five and twenty\r\narrows of sharp points. And Bhishma, too, in that combat, pierced Partha\r\nin return with nine arrows. And those two mighty warriors, those\r\nchastisers of foes, piercing each other's steeds, and also the shafts and\r\nthe wheels of each other's cars, began to sport. Then, O king, Bhishma,\r\nthat foremost of smiters, struck Vasudeva between his two breasts with\r\nthree arrows. And the slayer of Madhu, struck with those shafts shot from\r\nBhishma's bow, shone in that battle, O king, like a flowering Kinsuka.\r\nThen Arjuna, indignant at seeing Madhava, pierced in that combat the\r\ncharioteer of Ganga's son with three arrows. And both heroes, striving\r\nwith each other against each other's car, succeeded not in taking aim at\r\neach other in the combat. And in consequence of the ability and dexterity\r\nof the charioteers of both those warriors, both displayed, O king,\r\nbeautiful circles and advancings and retreatings in respect of their\r\nmoving cars. And, O monarch, seeing the opportunity to strike, they\r\nfrequently changed positions, O king, for obtaining what they sought. And\r\nboth the heroes blew their conches, mingling that blare with their\r\nleonine roars. And those mighty car-warriors twang their bows, both in\r\nthe same manner. And with the blare of their conches and the rattle of\r\ntheir car-wheels, the very Earth was suddenly rent. And it began to\r\ntremble and produce subterranean noises. And nobody, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, could detect any latches in either of them. Both of them was\r\npossessed of great might and great courage in battle, each was other's\r\nmatch. And by (the sight of) his standard alone, the Kauravas could\r\napproach him (for aid). And so the Pandavas approached Pritha's son (for\r\naid), guided by his standard only. And beholding, O king, prowess thus\r\ndisplayed by those two foremost of men, O Bharata, all creatures\r\n(present) in that battle were filled with wonder. And none, O Bharata,\r\nobserved any difference between the two, just as none finds any\r\ntransgression in a person observant of morality. And both of them (at\r\ntimes) became perfectly invisible in consequence of clouds of arrows. And\r\nsoon enough both of them in that battle became visible. And the gods with\r\nGandharvas and the Charanas, and the great Rishis beholding their\r\nprowess, said unto one another. These mighty car-warriors when excited\r\nwith rage, are incapable of ever being vanquished in battle by all the\r\nworlds with the gods, the Asuras and the Gandharvas. This highly\r\nwonderful battle would be wonderful in all the worlds. Indeed, a battle\r\nsuch as this will never take place again. Bhishma is incapable of being\r\nconquered in combat by Pritha's son of great intelligence, showering his\r\narrows in battle, with bow and car and steeds. So also that great bowman,\r\nthe son of Pandu, incapable of being vanquished in battle by the very\r\ngods, Bhishma is not competent to conquer in combat. As long as the world\r\nitself will last, so long will this battle continue equally. We heard\r\nthese words, O king, fraught with the praise of Ganga's son and Arjuna in\r\nbattle bruited about there. And while those two were engaged in\r\ndisplaying their prowess, other warriors of thy side and of the Pandavas,\r\nO Bharata, slew one another in battle, with sharp-edged scimitars, and\r\npolished battle-axes, and innumerable arrows, and diverse kinds of\r\nweapons. And the brave combatants of both armies cut one another down,\r\nwhile that terrible and murderous conflict lasted. And the encounter\r\nalso, O king, that took place between Drona and the prince of the\r\nPanchalas, was awful.\""

I regard destiny to be superior, O Sanjaya, to\r\nexertion, when Santanu's son Bhishma (even) could not escape Pandu's son\r\nin battle. Indeed, Bhishma, when enraged in battle could destroy all\r\nmobile and immobile creatures, why, O Sanjaya, could he not then by his\r\nprowess, escape the son of Pandu in battle?\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, quietly to this terrific battle. The son\r\nof Pandu is incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava.\r\nDrona with diverse arrows pierced Dhrishtadyumna and felled the latter's\r\ncharioteer from his niche in the car.[362] And, O sire, the enraged hero\r\nalso afflicted Dhrishtadyumna's four steeds with four excellent shafts.\r\nAnd the heroic Dhrishtadyumna too pierced Drona in the combat with nine\r\nsharp arrows and addressed him, saying, 'Wait--Wait'. 'Then, again,\r\nBharadwaja's son of great prowess and immeasurable soul, covered with his\r\narrows the wrathful Dhrishtadyumna. And he took up a dreadful arrow for\r\nthe destruction of Prishata's son whose force resembled that of Sakra's\r\nbolt and which was like a second rod of death. And beholding that arrow\r\naimed by Bharadwaja in battle, loud cries of oh and alas arose, O\r\nBharata, among all the combatants. And then we beheld the wonderful\r\nprowess of Dhrishtadyumna insomuch that the hero stood alone, immovable\r\nlike a mountain. And he cut off that terrible and blazing arrow coming\r\ntowards him like his own Death, and also showered an arrowy downpour on\r\nBharadwaja's son. And beholding that difficult feat achieved by\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the Panchalas with the Pandavas, filled with delight, set\r\nup loud shouts. And that prince, endued with great prowess, desirous of\r\nslaying Drona hurled at him a dart of great impetuosity, decked with gold\r\nand stones of lapis lazuli. Thereupon the son of Bharadwaja, smiling the\r\nwhile, cut off into three fragments that dart decked with gold that was\r\ncoming towards him impetuously. Beholding his dart thus baffled,\r\nDhrishtadyumna of great prowess rained arrowy downpours on Drona, O king.\r\nThen that mighty car-warrior Drona, baffling that arrowy shower, cut off\r\nwhen the opportunity presented, the bow of Drupada's son. His bow (thus)\r\ncut off in the combat, that mighty warrior of great fame hurled at Drona\r\na heavy mace endued with the strength of the mountain. And hurled from\r\nhis hands, that mace coursed through the air for Drona's destruction. And\r\nthen we beheld the wonderful prowess of Bharadwaja's son. By (the)\r\nlightness (of his car's motion), he baffled that mace decked with gold,\r\nand having baffled it, he shot at Prishata's son many shafts of sharp\r\nedge, well-tempered, furnished with golden wings, and whetted on stone.\r\nAnd these, penetrating through Prishata's coat of mail, drank his blood\r\nin that battle. Then the high-souled Dhrishtadyumna, taking up another\r\nbow, and putting forth his prowess pierced Drona in that encounter with\r\nfive shafts. And then those two bulls among men, both covered with blood,\r\nlooked beautiful like two blossoming Kinsukas in spring variegated with\r\nflowers. Then, O king, excited with wrath and putting forth his prowess\r\nat the head of his division, Drona once more cut off the bow of Drupada's\r\nson. And then that hero of immeasurable soul covered that warrior whose\r\nbow was cut off, with innumerable straight arrows like the clouds\r\nshowering rain on a mountain. And he also felled his foe's charioteer\r\nfrom his niche in the car. And his four steeds, too, with four sharp\r\narrows, Drona felled in that combat that set up a leonine roar. And with\r\nanother shaft he cut off the leathern fence that cased Dhrishtadyumna's\r\nhand. His bow cut off, deprived of car, his steeds slain, and charioteer\r\noverthrown, the prince of Panchala alighted from his car, mace in hand,\r\ndisplaying great prowess. But before he could come down from his car, O\r\nBharata, Drona with his shafts cut off that mace into fragments. This\r\nfeat seemed wonderful to us. And then the mighty prince of the Panchalas\r\nof strong arms, taking a large and beautiful shield decked with a hundred\r\nmoons, and a large scimitar of beautiful make, rushed impetuously from\r\ndesire of slaying Drona, like a hungry lion in the forest towards an\r\ninfuriate elephant. Then wonderful was the prowess that we behold of\r\nBharadwaja's son, and his lightness (of hand) in the use of weapons, as\r\nalso the strength of his arms, O Bharata, in as much as, alone, he\r\nchecked Prishata's son with a shower of arrows. And although possessed of\r\ngreat might in battle, he was unable to proceed further. And we behold\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna staying where he did and warding\r\noff those clouds of arrows with his shield, using his arms with great\r\ndexterity. Then the mighty-armed Bhima endued with great strength quickly\r\ncame there, desirous of aiding in battle the high-souled son of Prishata.\r\nAnd he pierced Drona, O king, with seven sharp-pointed arrows, and\r\nspeedily caused Prishata's son to be taken up on another car. Then king\r\nDuryodhana urged the ruler of the Kalingas supported by a large division,\r\nfor the protection of Bharadwaja's son. Then that terrible and mighty\r\ndivision of the Kalingas, O ruler of men, rushed against Bhima at the\r\ncommand of thy son. And Drona then, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nabandoning the prince of Panchala, encountered Virata and Drupada\r\ntogether. And Dhrishtadyumna also proceeded to support king Yudhishthira\r\nin battle. And then commenced a fierce battle, making the hair stand on\r\nend, between the Kalingas and the high-souled Bhima, a battle that was\r\ndestructive of the universe, terrific, and awful.\""

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said, \"How did the ruler of the Kalingas, that commander of\r\na large division, urged by my son, and supported by his troops, fight in\r\nbattle with the mighty Bhimasena of wonderful feats, that hero wandering\r\nover the field of battle with his mace like Death himself club in hand?\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Thus urged by thy son, O great king, the mighty king of\r\nthe Kalingas, accompanied by a large army advanced towards Bhima's car.\r\nAnd Bhimasena, then, O Bharata, supported by the Chedis, rushed towards\r\nthat large and mighty army of the Kalingas, abounding with cars, steeds,\r\nand elephants, and armed with mighty weapons, and advancing towards him\r\nwith Ketumat, the son of the king of the Nishadas. And Srutayus also,\r\nexcited with wrath, accoutred in mail, followed by his troops in\r\nbattle-array, and, accompanied by king Ketumat, came before Bhima in\r\nbattle. And the ruler of the Kalingas with many thousands of cars, and\r\nKetumat with ten thousand elephants and the Nishadas, surrounded\r\nBhimasena, O king, on all sides. Then the Chedis, the Matsyas, and\r\nKarushas, with Bhimasena at their head, with many kings impetuously\r\nrushed against the Nishadas. And then commenced the battle, fierce and\r\nterrible, between the warriors rushing at one another from desire of\r\nslaughter. And terrific was the battle that suddenly took place between\r\nBhima and his foes, resembling the battle, O great king, between Indra\r\nand the mighty host of Diti's sons. And loud became the uproar, O\r\nBharata, of that mighty army struggling in battle, that resembled the\r\nsound of the roaring ocean. And the combatants, O king, cutting one\r\nanother, made the whole field resemble a crematorium strewn with flesh\r\nand blood. And combatants, impelled by the desire of slaughter could not\r\ndistinguish friend from foe. And those brave warriors, incapable of being\r\neasily defeated in battle, even began to strike down their own friend.\r\nAnd terrific was the collision that took place between the few and many,\r\nbetween the Chedis (on the one side) and the Kalingas and the Nishadas, O\r\nking, (on the other). Displaying their manliness to the best of their\r\npower, the mighty Chedis, abandoning Bhimasena, turned back, and when the\r\nChedis ceased to follow him, the son of Pandu, encountering all the\r\nKalingas, did not turn back, depending upon the might of his own arms.\r\nIndeed, the mighty Bhimasena moved not, but from the terrace of his car\r\ncovered the division of the Kalingas with showers of sharp arrows. Then\r\nthat mighty bowman, the king of the Kalingas, and that car-warrior, his\r\nson known by the name of Sakradeva, both began to strike the son of Pandu\r\nwith their shafts. And the mighty-armed Bhima, shaking his beautiful bow,\r\nand depending on the might of his own arms, fought with Kalinga, and\r\nSakradeva, shooting in that battle innumerable arrows, slew Bhimasena's\r\nsteeds with them. And beholding that chastiser of foes Bhimasena deprived\r\nof his car, Sakradeva rushed at him, shooting sharp arrows. And upon\r\nBhimasena, O great king, the mighty Sakradeva showered arrowy downpours\r\nlike the clouds after summer is gone. But the mighty Bhimasena, staying\r\non his car whose steeds had been slain, hurled at Sakradeva a mace made\r\nof the hardest iron. And slain by that mace, O king, the son of the ruler\r\nof the Kalingas, from his car, fell down on the ground, with his standard\r\nand charioteer. Then that mighty car-warrior, the king of the Kalingas\r\nbeholding his own son slain, surrounded Bhima on all sides with many\r\nthousands of cars. Then the mighty-armed Bhima endued with great\r\nstrength, abandoning mace, took up a scimitar, desirous of achieving a\r\nfierce feat. And that bull among men also took up, O king, crescents made\r\nof gold. And the ruler of the Kalingas also, excited with wrath, and\r\nrubbing his bowstring, and taking up a terrible arrow (deadly) as poison\r\nof the snake, shot it at Bhimasena, desirous at that monarch was of\r\nslaying (the Pandava). That sharp arrow, thus shot and coursing\r\nimpetuously, Bhimasena, O king, cut in twain with his huge sword. And\r\nfilled with delight he set up a loud shout, terrifying the troops. And\r\nthe ruler of the Kalingas, excited with rage in that combat with\r\nBhimasena, quickly hurled at him fourteen bearded darts whetted on stone.\r\nThe mighty-armed son of Pandu, however, with that best of scimitars,\r\nfearlessly cut into fragments in a trice, O king, those darts while\r\ncoursing through the welkin and before they could reach him. And having\r\nin that battle (thus) cut off those fourteen darts Bhima, that bull among\r\nmen, beholding Bhanumat, rushed at him. Bhanumat then covered Bhima with\r\na shower of arrows, and set up a loud shout, making the welkin resound\r\nwith it. Bhima, however, in that fierce battle, could not bear that\r\nleonine shout. Himself endued with a loud voice, he also shouted very\r\nloudly. And at these shouts of his, the army of the Kalingas became\r\nfilled with fear. In that battle they no longer regarded Bhima, O bull\r\namong men, as a human being. Then, O great king, having uttered a loud\r\nshout, Bhima, sword in hand impetuously jumping on (Bhanumat's) excellent\r\nelephant aided by the latter's tusks, gained, O sire, the back of that\r\nprince of tuskers, and with his huge sword cut Bhanumat, dividing him in\r\nthe middle. That chastiser of foes, then, having (thus) slain in battle\r\nthe prince of the Kalingas, next[363] made his sword which was capable of\r\nbearing a great strain, to descend upon the neck of that elephant. His\r\nhead cut off, that prince of elephants fell down with a loud roar, like a\r\ncrested mountain (whose base is) eaten away by the impetuous (surges of\r\nthe) sea. And jumping down, O Bharata, from that failing elephant, the\r\nprince of Bharata's race, of undepressed soul, stood on the ground, sword\r\nin hand and accoutred in mail (as before). And felling numerous elephants\r\non all sides, he wandered (over the field), making many paths (for\r\nhimself). And then he seemed to be like a moving wheel of fire\r\nslaughtering whole divisions of cavalry, of elephants, and cars, and\r\nlarge bodies of infantry. And that lord among men, the mighty Bhima, was\r\nseen to move over the field with the activity of the hawk, quickly\r\ncutting off in that battle, with his sharp-edged sword, their bodies and\r\nheads, as also those of the combatants on elephant. And combatant on\r\nfoot, excited with rage, all alone, and like Yama at the season of\r\nuniversal dissolution, he struck terror into his foes and confounded\r\nthose brave warriors. Only they that were senseless rushed with loud\r\nshouts at him wandering in that great battle with impetuosity, sword in\r\nhand. And that grinder of foes, endued with great strength, cutting off\r\nthe shafts and yokes of warriors on their cars, slew those warriors also.\r\nAnd Bhimasena was seen, O Bharata, to display diverse kinds of motions\r\nthere. He wheeled about, and whirled about on high, and, made\r\nside-thrusts, and jumped forward, and ran above, and leapt high. And, O\r\nBharata, he was also seen to rush forward and rush upward. And some\r\nmangled by the high-souled son of Pandu by means of his excellent sword,\r\nshrieked aloud, struck at their vitals or fell down deprived of life. And\r\nmany elephants, O Bharata, some with trunks and the extremities of their\r\ntusks cut off, and others having their temporal globes cut open, deprived\r\nof riders, slew their own ranks and fell down uttering loud cries. And\r\nbroken lances, O king, and the head of elephant drivers, and beautiful\r\nhousings of elephants, and chords resplendent with gold, and collars, and\r\ndarts and mallets and quivers, diverse kinds of machines, and beautiful\r\nbows, short arrows with polished heads, with hooks and iron crows for\r\nguiding elephants, bells of diverse shape, and hilts decked with gold,\r\nwere seen by us falling down or (already) fallen along with riders of\r\nsteeds. And with elephants (lying down) having the fore parts and hind\r\nparts of their bodies and their trunks cut off, or entirely slain, the\r\nfield seemed to be strewn with fallen cliffs. That bull among men, having\r\nthus crushed the huge elephants, next crushed the steeds also. And, O\r\nBharata, that hero also felled the foremost of cavalry soldiers. And the\r\nbattle, O sire, that took place between him and them was fierce in the\r\nextreme. And hilts and traces, and saddle girths resplendent with gold,\r\nand covers for the back of steeds, and bearded darts, and costly swords,\r\nand coats of mail, and shields, and beautiful ornaments, were seen by us\r\nstrewn over the ground in that great battle. And he caused the earth to\r\nbe strewn over (with blood) as if it were variegated with lilies. And the\r\nmighty son of Pandu, jumping high and dragging some car-warriors down\r\nwith his sword felled them along with (their) standards. Frequently\r\njumping up or rushing on all sides, that hero endued with great activity,\r\nwandering along many routes, caused the combatants to be amazed. And some\r\nhe slew by his legs, and dragging down others he pressed them down under\r\nthe earth. And others he cut off with his sword, and others he frightened\r\nwith his roars. And others he threw down on the ground by the force of\r\nhis thighs (as he ran). And others, beholding him, fled away in terror.\r\nIt was thus that that vast force of the Kalingas endued with great\r\nactivity, surrounding the terrible Bhimasena in battle, rushed at him.\r\nThen, O bull of Bharata's race, beholding Srutayush at the head of\r\nKalinga troops, Bhimasena rushed at him. And seeing him advancing the\r\nruler of the Kalingas, of immeasurable soul, pierced Bhimasena between\r\nhis breasts with nine arrows. Struck with those shafts shot by the ruler\r\nof the Kalingas, like an elephant pierced with the hook, Bhimasena blazed\r\nup with wrath like fire fed with fuel. Then Asoka, that best of\r\ncharioteers, bringing a car decked with gold, caused Bhima to mount on\r\nit. And thereupon that slayer of foes, the son of Kunti, speedily mounted\r\non that car. And then he rushed at the ruler of the Kalingas,\r\nsaying,--'Wait, Wait'. And then the mighty Srutayush excited with wrath,\r\nshot at Bhima many sharp arrows, displaying his lightness of hand, and\r\nthat mighty warrior, Bhima, forcibly struck with those nine sharp arrows\r\nshot by Kalinga from his excellent bow, yielded to great wrath, O king,\r\nlike a snake struck with a rod. Then that foremost of mighty men, Bhima,\r\nthe son of Pritha, excited with rage and drawing his bow with great\r\nstrength, slew the ruler of the Kalingas with seven shafts made wholly of\r\niron. And with two shafts he slew the two mighty protectors of the\r\ncar-wheels of Kalinga. And he also despatched Satyadeva and Satya to the\r\nabode of Yama. Of immeasurable soul, Bhima also, with many sharp arrows\r\nand long shafts, caused Ketumat to repair unto Yama's abode. Then the\r\nKshatriyas of the Kalinga country, excited with rage and supported by\r\nmany thousands of combatants, encountered the wrathful Bhimasena in\r\nbattle. And armed with darts and maces and scimitars and lances and\r\nswords and battle-axes, the Kalingas, O king, hundreds upon hundreds\r\nsurrounded Bhimasena. Baffling that risen shower of arrows, that mighty\r\nwarrior then took up his mace and jumped down (from his car) with great\r\nspeed.[364] And Bhima then despatched seven hundred heroes to Yama's\r\nabode. And that grinder of foes despatched, in addition, two thousand\r\nKalingas to the region of death. And that feat seemed highly wonderful.\r\nAnd it was thus that the heroic Bhima of terrible prowess repeatedly\r\nfelled in battle large bands of the Kalingas. And elephants deprived by\r\nPandu's son, in that battle, of their riders, and afflicted with arrows\r\nwandered on the field, treading down their own ranks and uttering loud\r\nroars like masses of clouds driven by the wind. Then the mighty-armed\r\nBhima, scimitar in hand, and filled with delight, blew his conch of\r\nterrible loudness. And with that blare he caused the hearts of all the\r\nKalinga troops to quake with fear. And, O chastiser of foes, all the\r\nKalingas seemed at the same time to be deprived of their senses. And all\r\nthe combatants and all the animals shook with terror. And in consequence\r\nof Bhimasena wandering in that battle through many paths or rushing on\r\nall sides like a prince of elephants, or frequently jumping up, a trance\r\nseemed to be engendered there that deprived his foes of their senses. And\r\nthe whole (Kalinga) army shook with terror of Bhimasena, like a large\r\nlake agitated by an alligator. And struck with panic in consequence of\r\nBhima of wonderful achievements, all the Kalinga combatants fled away in\r\nall directions. When, however, they were rallied again, the commander of\r\nthe Pandava army (Dhrishtadyumna), O Bharata, ordered his own troops,\r\nsaying,--'Fight'. Hearing the words of their commander, many leaders (of\r\nthe Pandava army) headed by Sikhandin approached Bhima, supported by many\r\ncar-divisions accomplished in smiting. And Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, followed all of them with a large elephant force of the colour\r\nof the clouds. And thus urging all his divisions, the son of Prishata,\r\nsurrounded by many excellent warriors, took upon himself the protection\r\nof one of the wings of Bhimasena.[365] There exists nobody on earth, save\r\nBhima and Satyaki, who to the prince of the Panchalas is dearer than his\r\nvery life. That slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Prishata, beheld the\r\nmighty-armed Bhimasena, that slayer of foes, wandering among the\r\nKalingas. He set up many shouts, O king, and was filled with delight, O\r\nchastiser of foes. Indeed, he blew his conch in battle and uttered a\r\nleonine roar. And Bhimasena also, beholding the red standard of\r\nDhrishtadyumna on his car decked with gold and unto which were yoked\r\nsteeds white as pigeons, became comforted.[366] And Dhrishtadyumna of\r\nimmeasurable soul, beholding Bhimasena encountered by the Kalingas rushed\r\nto the battle for his rescue. And both those heroes. Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nVrikodara, endued with great energy, beholding Satyaki at a distance,\r\nfuriously encountered the Kalingas in battle. And that bull among men,\r\nthe grand son of Sini, that foremost of victorious warriors, quickly\r\nadvancing to the spot took up the wing of both Bhima and Prishata's son.\r\nBow in hand creating a great havoc there and making himself fierce in the\r\nextreme, he began to slay the enemy in battle. And Bhima caused a river\r\nto flow there of bloody current, mingled with the blood and flesh of the\r\nwarriors born in Kalinga. And beholding Bhimasena then, the troops cried\r\naloud, O king, saying. 'This is Death himself that is fighting in Bhima's\r\nshape with the Kalingas.' Then Santanu's son Bhishma, hearing those cries\r\nin battle, quickly proceeded towards Bhima, himself surrounded on all\r\nsides with combatants in army. Thereupon, Satyaki and Bhimasena and\r\nDhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, rushed towards that car of Bhima\r\ndecked with gold. And all of them quickly surrounding Ganga's son in\r\nbattle, pierced Bhishma, each with three terrible shafts, without losing\r\na moment. Thy sire Devavrata, however, in return pierced each of those\r\nmighty bowmen striving (in battle) with three straight shafts. And\r\nchecking those mighty car-warriors, with thousands of arrows he Slew with\r\nhis shafts the steeds of Bhima decked with golden armour. Bhima, however,\r\nendued with great energy, staying on that car whose steeds had been\r\nslain, with great impetuosity hurled a dart at Bhishma's car. Thy sire\r\nDevavrata then, in that battle, cut off that dart in twain before it\r\ncould reach him, and thereupon it fell down on the earth. Then that bull\r\namong men, Bhimasena, taking up a heavy and mighty mace made of Saikya\r\niron speedily jumped down from his car. And Dhrishtadyumna quickly taking\r\nup that foremost of car-warriors on his own car, took away, in the very\r\nsight of all the combatants, that renowned warrior. And Satyaki then from\r\ndesire of doing what was agreeable to Bhima, felled with his shaft the\r\ncharioteer of the reverend Kuru grand-sire. Upon his charioteer being\r\nslain, that foremost of car-warriors, Bhishma, was borne away from the\r\nfield of battle by his steeds with the speed of the wind. And when that\r\nmighty car-warrior was (thus) taken away from the field, Bhimasena then,\r\nO monarch, blazed up like a mighty fire while consuming dry grass. And\r\nslaying all the Kalingas, he stayed in the midst of the troops, and none,\r\nO bull of Bharata's race, of thy side ventured to withstand him. And\r\nworshipped by the Panchalas and the Matsyas, O bull of Bharata's race, he\r\nembraced Dhrishtadyumna and then approached Satyaki. And Satyaki, the\r\ntiger among the Yadus, of prowess incapable of being baffled, then\r\ngladdening Bhimasena, said unto him, in the presence of Dhrishtadyumna,\r\n(these words). 'By good luck the king of the Kalingas, and Ketumat, the\r\nprince of the Kalingas, and Sakradeva also of that country and all the\r\nKalingas, have been slain in battle. With the might and prowess of thy\r\narms, by thee alone, hath been crushed the very large division of the\r\nKalingas that abounded with elephants and steeds and cars, and with noble\r\nwarriors, and heroic combatants.' Having said this, the long-armed\r\ngrandson of Sini, that chastiser of foes, quickly getting upon his car,\r\nembraced the son of Pandu. And then that mighty car-warrior, coming back\r\nto his own car, began to slay thy troops excited with rage and\r\nstrengthening (the hands of) Bhima."

And the mighty heir of Panchala's king with\r\nmany sharp shafts, slew the steeds of Drona's son that were celebrated\r\nover all the world. Deprived then of his animals, Drona's son quickly\r\ngetting up on Salya's car, showered his shafts on the hair of the\r\nPanchala king. And beholding Dhrishtadyumna engaged in battle with\r\nDrona's son, the son of Subhadra, O Bharata, quickly came up scattering\r\nhis sharp arrows. And, O bull of Bharata's race, he pierced Salya with\r\nfive and twenty, and Kripa with nine arrows, and Aswatthaman with eight.\r\nDrona's son, however, quickly pierced Arjuna's son with many winged\r\narrows, and Salya pierced him with twelve, and Kripa with three sharp\r\narrows. Thy grandson Lakshmana then, beholding Subhadra's son engaged in\r\nbattle, rushed at him, excited with rage. And the battle commenced\r\nbetween them. And the son of Duryodhana, excited with rage, pierced\r\nSubhadra's son with sharp shafts in that combat. And that (feat), O king,\r\nseemed highly wonderful. The light-handed Abhimanyu then, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, excited with rage, quickly pierced his cousin with five\r\nhundred arrows. Lakshmana also, with his shafts, then cut off his\r\n(cousin's) bow-staff at the middle, at which, O monarch, all the people\r\nsent forth a loud shout. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of\r\nSubhadra, leaving aside that broken bow, took up another that was\r\nbeautiful and tougher.[367] And thereupon those two bulls among men, thus\r\nengaged in combat and desirous of counteracting each other's feats,\r\npierced each other with sharp shafts. King Duryodhana then, O monarch,\r\nbeholding his mighty son thus afflicted by thy grandson (Abhimanyu),\r\nproceeded to that spot. And when thy son turned (towards that spot), all\r\nthe kings surrounded the son of Arjuna on every side with crowds of cars.\r\nIncapable of being defeated in battle and equal in prowess unto Krishna\r\nhimself, that hero, O king, thus surrounded by those heroes, was not\r\nagitated in the least. Then Dhananjaya, beholding Subhadra's son engaged\r\nin battle, rushed to that spot, excited with wrath, desirous of rescuing\r\nhis own son. Thereupon the kings (on the Kuru side), headed by Bhishma\r\nand Drona and with cars, elephants and steeds, rushed impetuously at\r\nSavyasachin. Then a thick earthly dust, suddenly raised by foot-soldiers\r\nand steeds and cars and cavalry troopers, covering the sky appeared on\r\nthe view. And those thousands of elephants and hundreds of kings, when\r\nthey came within reach of Arjuna's arrows, were all unable to make any\r\nfurther advance. And all creatures there set up loud wails, and the\r\npoints of the compass became dark. And then the transgression of the\r\nKurus assumed a fierce and dreadful aspect as regards its consequences.\r\nNeither the welkin, nor the cardinal points of the compass nor the earth,\r\nnor the sun, could be distinguished, O best of men, in consequence of the\r\narrows shot by Kiritin.[368] And many were the elephants there deprived\r\nof the standards (on their backs), and many car-warriors also, deprived\r\nof their steeds. And some leaders of car divisions were seen wandering,\r\nhaving abandoned their cars. And other car-warriors, deprived of their\r\ncars, were seen to wander hither and thither, weapon in hand and their\r\narms graced with Angadas. And riders of steeds abandoning their steeds\r\nand of elephants abandoning their elephants from fear of Arjuna, O king,\r\nfled away in all directions. And kings were seen felled or falling from\r\ncars and elephants and steeds in consequence of Arjuna's shafts. And\r\nArjuna, assuming a fierce countenance, cut off with his terrible shafts,\r\nthe upraised arms of warriors, mace in grasp, and arms bearing swords, O\r\nking, or darts, or quivers, or shafts, or bows, or hooks, or standards,\r\nall over the field. And spiked maces broken in fragments, and mallets, O\r\nsire, and bearded darts, and short arrows, and swords also, in that\r\nbattle, and sharp-edged battle-axes, and lances, O Bharata, and shields\r\nbroken into pieces, and coats of mail also, O king,[369] and standards,\r\nand weapons of all kinds thrown away and umbrellas furnished with golden\r\nstaves, and iron hooks also, O Bharata, and goads and whips, and traces\r\nalso, O sire, were seen strewn over the field of battle in heaps. There\r\nwas no man in thy army, O sire, who could advance against the heroic\r\nArjuna in battle. Whoever, O king, advanced against Pritha's son in\r\nbattle, pierced by sharp shafts was despatched to the other world. When\r\nall these combatants of thine broke had fled away, Arjuna and Vasudeva\r\nblew their excellent conches. Thy sire Devavrata then, beholding the\r\n(Kuru) host routed, smilingly addressed the heroic son of Bharadwaja in\r\nthe battle and said, \"This mighty and heroic son of Pandu, viz.,\r\nDhananjaya, accompanied by Krishna, is dealing with (our) troops as he\r\nalone is competent to deal with them. He is incapable of being vanquished\r\nin battle today by any means, judging by his form that we see now so like\r\nunto that of the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga. This vast host\r\nagain (of ours) is incapable of being rallied. Behold, looking at one\r\nanother, our troops are flying away. Yon Sun, robbing in every way the\r\nvision of the whole world, is about to reach that best of mountains\r\ncalled Asta.[370] For this, O bull among men, I think that the hour is\r\ncome for the withdrawal (of the army). The warriors, who have all been\r\ntired and struck with panic, will never fight. Having said this unto\r\nDrona that best of preceptors, Bhishma, that mighty car-warrior, caused\r\nthy army to be withdrawn. And then when the sun set, the withdrawal of\r\nboth thy army and theirs took place, O sire, and twilight set in.\""

And the son of Santanu, the old Kuru\r\ngrandsire, desirous of victory to thy sons, formed that mighty array\r\nknown after the name of Garuda. And on the beak of that Garuda was thy\r\nsire Devavrata himself. And its two eyes were Bharadwaja's son and\r\nKritavarman of Satwata's race. And those renowned warriors, Aswatthaman\r\nand Kripa, supported by the Trigartas, the Matsyas, the Kekayas, and the\r\nVatadhanas, were in its head. And Bhurisravas and Sala, and Salya and\r\nBhagadatta, O sire, and the Madrakas, the Sindhu-Souviras, and they that\r\nwere called the Pancha-nodas, together with Jayadratha, were placed on\r\nits neck. And on its back was king Duryodhana with all his followers. And\r\nVinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and the Kamvojas with the Sakas, and the\r\nSurasenas, O sire, formed its tail, O great king. And the Magadhas and\r\nthe Kalingas, with all the tribes of the Daserakas, accoutred in mail,\r\nformed the right wing of that array. And the Karushas, the Vikunjas, the\r\nMundas, and the Kaundivrishas, with Vrithadvala, were stationed on the\r\nleft wing. Then that chastiser of foes, Savyasachin, beholding the host\r\ndisposed in battle-array, aided by Dhrishtadyumna, disposed his troops in\r\ncounter-array. And in opposition to that array of thine, the son of Pandu\r\nformed fierce array after the form of the half-moon. And stationed on the\r\nright horn, Bhimasena shone surrounded by kings of diverse countries\r\nabundantly armed with various weapons. Next to him were those mighty\r\ncar-warriors Virata and Drupada; and next to them was Nila armed with\r\nenvenomed weapons. And next to Nila was the mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtaketu, surrounded by the Chedis, the Kasis, the Karushas, and the\r\nPauravas. And Dhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin, with the Panchalas and the\r\nPrabhadrakas, and supported by other troops, were stationed in the\r\nmiddle, O Bharata, for battle. And thither also was king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, surrounded by his elephant division. And next to him were Satyaki,\r\nO king, and the five sons of Draupadi. And immediately next to them was\r\nIravan. And next to him were Bhimasena's son (Ghatotkacha) and those\r\nmighty car-warriors, the Kekayas. And next, on the left horn (of that\r\narray), was that best of men, viz., he who had for his protector,\r\nJanardana--that protector of the whole Universe. It was thus that the\r\nPandavas formed their mighty counter-array for the destruction of thy\r\nsons and of those who had sided with them. Then commenced the battle\r\nbetween thy troops and those of the foe striking one another, and in\r\nwhich cars and elephants mingled in the clash of combat. Large numbers of\r\nelephants and crowds of cars were seen everywhere, O king, to rush\r\ntowards one another for purposes of slaughter. And the rattle of\r\ninnumerable cars rushing (to join the fray), or engaged separately raised\r\na loud uproar, mingling with the beat of drums. And the shouts of the\r\nheroic combatants belonging to thy army and theirs, O Bharata, slaying\r\none another in that fierce encounter, reached the very heavens.\""

The Dhartarashtras, (thus)\r\nslaughtered in battle by Pritha's son, like the Destroyer himself at the\r\nend of the Yuga, still fought perseveringly with the Pandavas. Desirous.\r\nof (winning) blazing glory and (bent upon) making death (the only ground\r\nfor) a cessation of the fight, with minds undirected to anything else,\r\nthey broke the Pandava ranks in many places and were also themselves\r\nbroken. Then both the Pandava and the Kaurava troops broke, changed\r\npositions, and fled away. Nothing could be distinguished. An earthly dust\r\narose, shrouding the very sun. And nobody there could distinguish, either\r\nthe cardinal or the subsidiary directions. And everywhere the battle\r\nraged, O king, the combatants being guided by the indications afforded by\r\ncolours, by watch-words, names and tribal distinctions. And the array of\r\nthe Kauravas, O king, could not be broken, duly protected as it was by\r\nBharadwaja's son, O sire.[371] And so the formidable array of the Pandava\r\nalso, protected by Savyasachin, and well-guarded by Bhima, could not be\r\nbroken. And the cars and elephants in close ranks, O king, of both the\r\narmies, and other combatants, coming out of their respective arrays,\r\nengaged in conflict. And in that fierce battle cavalry soldiers felled\r\ncavalry soldiers, with polished swords of sharp edges and long lances.\r\nAnd car-warriors, getting car-warriors (within reach) in that fierce\r\nconflict, felled them with shafts decked with golden wings. And\r\nelephant-riders, of thy side and theirs, felled large numbers of\r\nelephant-riders in close ranks, with broad-headed shafts and arrows and\r\nlances. And large bodies of infantry, inspired with wrath towards one\r\nanother, cheerfully felled combatants of their own class with short\r\narrows and battle-axes. And car-warriors, O king, getting elephant-riders\r\n(within reach) in that conflict, felled them along with their elephants.\r\nAnd elephant-riders similarly felled car-warriors. And, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, the cavalry soldier with his lance felled the car-warrior\r\nin that conflict, and the car-warrior also felled the cavalry soldier.\r\nAnd both the armies the foot-soldier, felled the car-warrior in the\r\ncombat, and the car-warrior felled the foot-soldiers, with sharp weapons.\r\nAnd elephant-riders felled horse-riders, and horse-riders felled warriors\r\non the backs of elephants. And all this appeared exceedingly wonderful.\r\nAnd here and there foot-soldiers, were felled by foremost of\r\nelephant-riders, and elephant-riders were seen to be felled by the\r\nformer. And bands of foot-soldiers, by hundreds and thousands, were seen\r\nto be felled by horse-riders and horse-riders by foot-soldiers. And\r\nstrewn with broken standards and bows and lances and housings of\r\nelephants, and costly blankets and bearded darts, and maces, and clubs\r\nfurnished with spikes, and Kampanas, and darts, and variegated coats of\r\nmail and Kunapas, and iron hooks, and polished scimitars, and shafts\r\nfurnished with golden wings, the field, O best of Bharata's race, shone\r\nas if with floral wreaths. And the earth, miry with flesh and blood,\r\nbecame impassable with the bodies of men and steeds and elephants slain\r\nin that dreadful battle. And drenched with human blood, the earthy dust\r\ndisappeared. And the cardinal points, all around, became perfectly clear,\r\nO Bharata. And innumerable headless trunks rose up all around indicating,\r\nO Bharata, of the destruction of the world. And in that terrible and\r\nawful battle, car-warriors were seen to run away in all directions. Then\r\nBhishma and Drona, and Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus and\r\nPurumitra, and Vikarna, and Sakuni the son of Suvala-these warriors\r\ninvincible in battle and possessed of leonine prowess-staying in battle\r\nbroke the ranks of the Pandavas. And so Bhimasena and the Rakshasa\r\nGhatotkacha, and Satyaki, and Chekitana, and the sons of Draupadi, O\r\nBharata, supported by all the kings (on their side), began to grind thy\r\ntroops and thy sons stationed in battle, like the gods grinding the\r\nDanavas.

And\r\nbright lances of sharp points, and maces, and clubs endued with spikes,\r\nand bearded darts and battle-axes, and mallets and bludgeons they hurled\r\nat Phalguni's car, excited with rage.

And beholding there on that\r\noccasion the superhuman lightness of hand that Vibhatsu possessed, the\r\ngods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Uragas and the\r\nRakshasas eulogised Phalguni, O king, saying,--'Excellent, Excellent.'\r\nAnd the heroic Gandharvas along with Suvala's son with a large force\r\nsurrounded Satyaki and Abhimanyu. Then the brave warriors led by Suvala's\r\nson from anger, cut into pieces the excellent car of the Vrishni hero,\r\nwith weapons of diverse kinds. And in course of that fierce conflict,\r\nSatyaki, abandoning that car of his, speedily mounted on Abhimanyu's car,\r\nO chastiser of foes. And those two, mounted on the same car, then began\r\nto speedily slaughter the army of Suvala's son with straight arrows of\r\nsharp points. And Drona and Bhishma, steadily struggling in battle, began\r\nto slaughter the division of king Yudhishthira the just, with sharp\r\nshafts furnished with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Then the son of\r\nDharma and two other sons of Pandu by Madri, in the very sight of the\r\nwhole army, began to grind the division of Drona. And the battle that\r\ntook place there was fierce and awful, making the hair stand on end, like\r\nthe terrible battle that took place between the gods and the Asuras in\r\ndays of yore. And Bhimasena and Ghatotkacha, both achieved mighty feats.\r\nThen Duryodhana, approaching, checked them both. And the prowess we then\r\nbeheld of Hidimva's son was exceedingly wonderful, insomuch that he\r\nfought in battle, O Bharata, transcending his very father. And Bhimasena,\r\nthe son of Pandu, excited with wrath, pierced the vindictive Duryodhana\r\nin the breast, with an arrow, smiling the while. Then king Duryodhana,\r\nafflicted by the violence of that blow, sat down on the terrace of his\r\ncar and swooned away. And his charioteer then, beholding him senseless,\r\nspeedily bore him away, O king, from battle. And then the troops that\r\nsupported Duryodhana broke and fled. And thereupon Bhima, smiting that\r\nKuru army thus flying away in all directions, with sharp-pointed shafts,\r\npursued it behind. And Prishata's son (Dhrishtadyumna), that foremost of\r\nwarriors, and Pandu's son king Yudhishthira, the just, in the very sight,\r\nO Bharata, of both Drona and Ganga's son, slew their army with sharp\r\nshafts capable of slaying hostile forces. That host of thy son, thus\r\nflying away in battle, those mighty car-warriors. Bhishma and Drona were\r\nincapable of checking. For though attempted to be checked by Bhishma and\r\nthe high-souled Drona, that host fled away in the very sight of Drona and\r\nBhishma. And then when (those) thousand of car-warriors fled away in all\r\ndirections, Subhadra's son and that bull of Sini's race, both stationed\r\non the same car, began, O chastiser of foes, to slaughter the army of\r\nSuvala's son of battle. And Sini's grandson and that bull of Kuru's race\r\nlooked resplendent like the sun and the moon when together in the\r\nfirmament after the last lunation of the dark fortnight has passed away.\r\nAnd then Arjuna also, O king, excited with rage, showered arrows on thy\r\narmy like the clouds pouring rain in torrents. And the Kaurava army, thus\r\nslaughtered in battle with the shafts of Partha, fled away, trembling in\r\ngrief and fear. And beholding the army flying away, the mighty Bhishma\r\nand Drona, excited with rage and both desirous of Duryodhana's welfare\r\nsought to cheek it. Then king Duryodhana himself, comforting the\r\ncombatants, checked that army, then flying away in all directions. And\r\nthereupon all the mighty Kshatriya car-warriors stopped, each at the spot\r\nwhere he saw thy son. And then others among the common soldiers,\r\nbeholding them stop, stopped of their own accord, O king, from shame and\r\ndesire of displaying their courage unto one another. And the impetuosity,\r\nO king, of that army thus rallied to the fight resembled that of the\r\nsurging sea at the moment of the moon's rise. And king Duryodhana,\r\nbeholding that army of his rallied for the fight, quickly repaired to\r\nSantanu's son Bhishma and said these words. 'O grandsire, listen to what\r\nI say, O Bharata. When, O son of Kuru, thou art alive, and Drona, that\r\nforemost of persons conversant with weapons, along with his son and with\r\nall our other friends (is alive), and then that mighty bowman Kripa also\r\nis alive, I do not regard it as at all creditable that my army should\r\nthus fly away. I do not regard the Pandavas to be, by any means, a match\r\nfor thee or for Drona, in battle, or for Drona's son, or for Kripa.\r\nWithout doubt, O grandsire, the sons of Pandu are being favoured by thee,\r\ninasmuch as thou forgivest, O hero, this slaughter of my army. Thou\r\nshouldst have told me, O king, before this battle took place, that thou\r\nwouldst not fight with the Pandavas. Hearing such words from thee, as\r\nalso from the preceptor, O Bharata, I would then have, with Karna,\r\nreflected upon what course I should pursue. If I do not deserve to be\r\nabandoned by you two in battle, then, O bulls among men, do ye fight\r\naccording to the measure of your prowess. Hearing these words, Bhishma,\r\nlaughing repeatedly, and turning up his eyes in wrath, said to thy son,\r\n'Many a time, O king, have I said unto thee words worthy of thy\r\nacceptance and fraught with thy good. The Pandavas are incapable of being\r\nvanquished in battle by the very gods with Vasava amongst them. That,\r\nhowever, which my aged self is capable of doing, I will do to the extent\r\nof my power, O best of kings, in this battle. Witness it now with thy\r\nkinsmen. Today, in the very sight of all, alone I shall check the sons of\r\nPandu at the head of their troops and with all their kinsfolk.' Thus\r\naddressed by Bhishma, thy son, O king, filled with delight, caused\r\nconches to be blown and drums to be beaten. And the Pandavas also, O\r\nking, hearing that loud uproar, blew their conches, and caused their\r\ndrums and cymbals to be played upon.\""

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said, \"After that dreadful vow had been made in battle by\r\nBhishma enraged by the words of my son, what, O Sanjaya, did Bhishma do\r\nunto the sons of Pandu or what did the Panchalas do unto the grandsire?\r\nTell it all unto me, O Sanjaya.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"After the forenoon of that day, O Bharata, had passed\r\naway, and the sun in his westward course had passed a portion of his\r\npath, and after the high-souled Pandavas had won the victory, thy sire\r\nDevavrata, conversant with the distinction of all codes of morality,\r\nrushed carried by the fleetest steeds, towards the army of the Pandavas,\r\nprotected by a large force and by all thy sons. Then, O Bharata, in\r\nconsequence of thy sinful policy, commenced a dreadful battle, making the\r\nhair stand on end, between ourselves and the Pandavas. And the twang of\r\nbows, the flapping of bowstrings against the leathern fences (casing the\r\nhands of the bowman), mingling together, made a loud uproar resembling\r\nthat of splitting hills. Stay--Here I stand,--Know this one,--Turn\r\nback,--Stand,--I wait for thee--Strike,--these were the words heard\r\neverywhere. And the sound of falling coats of mail made of gold, of\r\ncrowns and diadems, and of standards resembled the sound of falling\r\nstones on a stony ground. And heads, and arms decked with ornaments,\r\nfalling by hundreds and thousands upon the ground moved in convulsions.\r\nAnd some brave combatants, with heads severed from their trunks,\r\ncontinued to stand weapons in grasp or armed with drawn bow. And a\r\ndreadful river of blood began to flow there, of impetuous current, miry\r\nwith flesh and blood, and with the bodies of (dead) elephants for its\r\n(sub-aqueous) rocks. Flowing from the bodies of steeds, men, and\r\nelephants, and delightful to vultures and jackals, it ran towards the\r\nocean represented by the next world. A battle such as that, O king, which\r\n(then) took place between thy sons, O Bharata, and the Pandavas, was\r\nnever seen or heard before. And in consequence of the bodies of\r\ncombatants slain in that conflict, cars could not make their way. And the\r\nfield of battle in consequence of the bodies of slain elephants seemed to\r\nbe strewn over with blue crests of hills. And the field of battle, strewn\r\nwith variegated coats of mail and turbans, O sire, looked beautiful like\r\nthe firmament autumn. And some combatants were seen who, though severely\r\nwounded, yet rushed cheerfully and proudly upon the foe in battle. And\r\nmany, fallen on the field of battle, cried aloud, saying--'O father, O\r\nbrother, O friend, O kinsman, O companion, O maternal uncle, do not\r\nabandon me.'--And others cried aloud, saying,--'Come! Come thou here! Why\r\nart thou frightened? Where dost thou go? I stand in battle, do not be\r\nafraid.' And in that combat Bhishma, the son of Santanu, with bow\r\nincessantly drawn to a circle, shot shafts of blazing points, resembling\r\nsnakes of virulent poison. And shooting continuous line of arrows in all\r\ndirections, that hero of rigid vows smote the Pandava car-warriors naming\r\neach beforehand, O Bharata. And displaying his extreme lightness of\r\nhands, and dancing (as it were) along the track of his car, he seemed, O\r\nking, to be present everywhere like a circle of fire. And in consequence\r\nof the lightness of his movements, the Pandavas in that battle, along\r\nwith the Srinjayas, beheld that hero, though really alone, as multiplied\r\na thousand-fold. And every one there regarded Bhishma as having\r\nmultiplied his self by illusion. Having seen him now on the east, the\r\nnext moment they saw him on the west. And so having seen him on the\r\nnorth, the next moment they saw him on the south. And the son of Ganga\r\nwas thus seen fighting in that battle. And there was no one amongst the\r\nPandavas capable of even looking at him. What they all saw were only the\r\ninnumerable shafts shot from his bow. And heroic warriors, beholding him\r\nachieve such feats in battle, and (thus) slaughtering their ranks,\r\nuttered many lamentations. And, kings in thousands came in contact with\r\nthy sire, thus coursing over the field in a superhuman way, and fell upon\r\nthat fire represented by the enraged Bhishma like flights of senseless\r\ninsects (upon a blazing fire) for their own destruction. Not a single\r\nshaft of that light-handed warrior was futile, falling upon the bodies of\r\nmen, elephants, and steeds, in consequence of the numbers (opposed to\r\nhim). With a single straight shaft shot in that battle, he despatched a\r\nsingle elephant like hill riven by the thunderbolt. Two or three\r\nelephant-riders at a time, cased in mail and standing together, thy sire\r\npierced with one shaft of sharp point. Whoever approached Bhishma, that\r\ntiger among men, in battle, seen for a moment was, next beheld to fall\r\ndown on the ground. And that vast host of king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nthus slaughtered by Bhishma of incomparable prowess, gave way in a\r\nthousand directions. And afflicted with that arrowy shower, the vast army\r\nbegan to tremble in the very presence of Vasudeva and the high-souled\r\nPartha. And although the heroic leaders of the Pandava army made great\r\nefforts, yet they could not check the flight of (even) the great\r\ncar-warriors of their side afflicted with the shafts of Bhishma. The\r\nprowess, in consequence of which that vast army was routed, was equal to\r\nthat of the chief of the gods himself. And that army was so completely\r\nrouted, O great king, that no two persons could be seen together. And\r\ncars and elephants and steeds were pierced all over, and standards and\r\nshafts of cars were strewn over the field. And the army of the sons of\r\nPandu uttered cries of oh and alas, and became deprived of senses. And\r\nthe sire struck the son and the son struck the sire; and friend\r\nchallenged the dearest of friends to battle as if under the influence of\r\nfate. And others amongst the combatants of Pandu's son were seen, O\r\nBharata, to run away, throwing aside their coats of mail, and with\r\ndishevelled hair. And the army of the sons of Pandu, indulging in loud\r\nwails, including the very leaders of their best of car-warriors, was seen\r\nto be as confounded as a very herd of kine. The delighter of the Yadavas\r\nthen, beholding that army thus routed, said unto Partha, stopping that\r\nbest of cars (which he guided), these words, 'The hour is now come, O\r\nPartha, which was desired by thee. Strike Bhishma, O tiger among men,\r\nelse, thou wilt lose the senses. O hero, formerly, in the conclave of\r\nkings, thou hadst said,--'I will slay all the warriors of Dhritarashtra's\r\nsons, headed by Bhishma and Drona--all in fact, who will fight with me in\r\nbattle'. O son of Kunti, O chastiser of foes, make those words of thine\r\ntrue. Behold, O Vibhatsu, this army of thine is being routed on all\r\nsides. Behold, the kings in Yudhishthira's host are all flying away,\r\nseeing Bhishma in battle, who looketh like the Destroyer himself with\r\nwide-open mouth. Afflicted with fear, they are making themselves scarce\r\nlike the weaker animals at sight of the lion. Thus addressed, Dhananjaya\r\nreplied unto Vasudeva, saying, 'Plunging through this sea of the hostile\r\nhost, urge on the steeds to where Bhishma is. I will throw down that\r\ninvincible warrior, the reverend Kuru grandsire'. Then Madhava urged\r\nthose steeds of silvery hue to where, O king, the car of Bhishma was,\r\nthat car which, like the very sun, was incapable of being gazed at. And\r\nbeholding the mighty-armed Partha thus rushing to an encounter with\r\nBhishma, the mighty army of Yudhisthira rallied for battle. Then Bhishma,\r\nthat foremost of warriors amongst the Kurus, repeatedly roaring like a\r\nlion, quickly covered Dhananjaya's car with an arrowy shower. In a moment\r\nthat car of his, with standard and charioteer, became invisible, shrouded\r\nwith that arrowy downpour. Vasudeva, however, endued with great might\r\nfearlessly and summoning all his patience, began to guide those steeds\r\nmangled by Bhishma's shafts. Then Partha, taking up his celestial bow\r\nwhose twang resembled the roar of the clouds, caused Bhishma's bow to\r\ndrop down, cutting it off with his keen shafts. The Kuru warrior, thy\r\nsire, seeing his bow cut off, took up another and stringed it within the\r\ntwinkling of the eye. And he stretched that bow whose twang resembled the\r\nroar of the clouds, with his two hands. But Arjuna, excited with wrath,\r\ncut off that bow also of his. Then the son of Santanu applauded that\r\nlightness of hand (displayed by Arjuna), saying--Excellent, O Partha, O\r\nthou of mighty arms, excellent, O son of Pandu. O Dhananjaya, such a\r\nmighty feat is, indeed, worthy of thee. I have been pleased with thee.\r\nFight hard with  me, O son. And having applauded Partha thus, and taking\r\nup another large bow, that hero shot his shafts at Partha's car. And\r\nVasudeva then displayed his great skill in the guiding of chariot, for he\r\nbaffled those shafts of his, by guiding the car in quick circles. Then, O\r\nsire, Bhishma with great strength pierced both Vasudeva and Dhananjaya\r\nwith keen shafts all over their bodies. And mangled by those shafts of\r\nBhishma, those two tigers among men looked like two roaring bulls with\r\nthe scratches of horns on their bodies. And once again, excited with\r\nrage, Bhishma covered the two Krishnas on all sides with shafts in\r\nhundreds and thousands. And with those keen shafts of his, the enraged\r\nBhishma caused him of Vrishni's race to shiver. And laughing loudly he\r\nalso made Krishna to wonder. Then the mighty-armed Krishna, beholding the\r\nprowess of Bhishma in battle as also the mildness with which Arjuna\r\nfought, and seeing that Bhishma was creating incessant showers of arrows\r\nin that conflict and looked like the all-consuming Sun himself in the\r\nmidst of the two armies, and marking besides, that that hero was slaying\r\nthe foremost of combatants in Yudhishthira's host and causing a havoc in\r\nthat army as if the hour of dissolution had come,--the adorable Kesava,\r\nthat slayer of hosts, endued with immeasurable soul--unable to bear what\r\nhe saw, thought that Yudhishthira's army could not survive that\r\nslaughter.--In a single day Bhishma can slaughter all the Daityas and the\r\nDanavas. With how much ease then can he slay in battle the sons of Pandu\r\nwith all their troops and followers. The vast army of the illustrious son\r\nof Pandu is again flying away. And the Kauravas also beholding the\r\nSomakas routed, are rushing to battle cheerfully, gladdening the\r\ngrandsire. Accoutred in mail, even I will stay Bhishma to-day for the\r\nsake of the Pandavas. This burthen of the high-souled Pandavas even I\r\nwill lighten. As regards Arjuna, though struck in battle with keen\r\nshafts, he knoweth not what he should do, from respect for Bhishma,--And\r\nwhile Krishna was reflecting thus the grandsire, excited with wrath, once\r\nagain shot his shafts at Partha's car. And in consequence of very great\r\nnumber of those arrows all the points of the compass became entirely\r\nshrouded. And neither the welkin nor the quarters nor the earth nor the\r\nsun himself of brilliant rays, could be seen. And the winds that blew\r\nseemed to be mixed with smoke, and all the points of the compass seemed\r\nto be agitated. And Drona, and Vikarna, and Jayadratha, and Bhurisrava,\r\nand Kritavarman, and Kripa, and Srutayush and the ruler of the Amvashtas\r\nand Vinda and Anuvinda, Sudakshina and the westerners, and the diverse\r\ntribes of the Sauviras, the Vasatis, and the Kshudrakas, and the Malavas,\r\nall these, at the command of the royal son of Santanu, quickly approached\r\nKiritin for battle. And the grandson of Sini saw that Kiritin was\r\nsurrounded by many hundreds of horse, and infantry, and cars, and mighty\r\nelephants. And beholding both Vasudeva and Arjuna thus encompassed by\r\ninfantry and elephants and horses and cars, on all sides, that foremost\r\nof all bearers of arms, viz., the chief of the Sinis, quickly proceeded\r\nto that spot. And that foremost of bowmen, the chief of the Sinis,\r\nquickly rushing at those troops, came to Arjuna's side like Vishnu coming\r\nto the aid of the slayer of Vritra. And that foremost warrior of Sini's\r\nrace cheerfully said unto Yudhishthira's host all the combatants of which\r\nhad been frightened by Bhishma and whose elephants, steeds, cars, and\r\nnumberless standards had been mangled and broken into pieces, and which\r\nwas flying away from the field, these words, 'Ye Kshatriyas, where do ye\r\ngo? This is not the duty of the righteous as hath been declared by the\r\nancients. Ye foremost of heroes, do not violate your pledges. Observe\r\nyour own duties as heroes'. Beholding that those foremost of kings were\r\nflying together from the field of battle, and marking the mildness with\r\nwhich Partha fought, and beholding also that Bhishma was exerting himself\r\nvery powerfully in battle, and that the Kurus were rushing from all\r\nsides, the younger brother of Vasava, the high-souled protector of all\r\nthe Dasarhas, unable to bear it all, addressed the renowned grandson of\r\nSini, and applauding him, said,--'O hero of Sini's race, they that are\r\nretreating, are, indeed, retreating. They that are yet staying, O thou of\r\nthe Satwata race, let them also go away. Behold, I will soon throw\r\nBhishma down from his car, and Drona also in battle, with all their\r\nfollowers. There is none in the Kuru host, O thou of the Satwata race,\r\nwho is able to escape my angry self. Therefore, taking up my fierce\r\ndiscus, I will slay Bhishma of high vows. And slaying in battle those two\r\nforemost of car-warriors, viz., Bhishma along with his followers and\r\nDrona also, O grandson of Sini, I will gladden Dhananjaya, and the king,\r\nand Bhima, and the twin Aswins. And slaying all the sons of Dhritarashtra\r\nand all those foremost of kings who have embraced their side, I will\r\njoyfully furnish king Ajatasatru with a kingdom today.' Saying this,\r\nVasudeva's son, abandoning (the reins of) the steeds, jumped down from\r\nthe car, whirling with his (right) arm his discus of beautiful nave with\r\nedge sharp as a razor, effulgent as the sun and possessed of force equal\r\nto that of a thousand bolts of heaven. And making the earth tremble under\r\nhis tread, the high-souled Krishna rushed impetuously towards Bhishma.\r\nAnd that grinder of foes, the younger brother of the chief of the gods,\r\nexcited with wrath, rushed towards Bhishma staying in the midst of his\r\ntroops, like a lion from desire of slaying upon a prince of elephants\r\nblinded with fury and staying proudly for the attack. And the end of his\r\nyellow garments waving in the air looked like a cloud charged with\r\nlightning in the sky. And that lotus of a discus called Sudarsana, having\r\nfor its stalk the beautiful arm of Saurin, looked as beautiful as the\r\nprimeval lotus, bright as the morning sun, which sprung from the navel of\r\nNarayana. And Krishna's wrath was the morning sun that caused that lotus\r\nto blow. And the beautiful leaves of that lotus were as sharp as the edge\r\nof a razor. And Krishna's body was the beautiful lake, and his (right)\r\narm the stalk springing therefrom, upon which that lotus shone. And\r\nbeholding the younger brother of Mahendra, excited with wrath and roaring\r\nloudly and armed with that discus, all creatures set out a loud wail,\r\nthinking that the destruction of the Kurus was at hand. And armed with\r\nhis discus Vasudeva looked like the Samvarta fire that appears at the end\r\nof the Yuga for consuming the world. And the preceptor of the universe\r\nblazed up like a fierce comet risen for consuming all creatures. And\r\nbeholding that foremost of bipeds, that divine personage, advancing armed\r\nwith the discus, Santanu's son stationed on his car, bow and arrow in\r\nhand, fearlessly said, 'Come, Come, O Lord of the gods, O thou that hast\r\nthe universe for thy abode. I bow to thee, O thou that art armed with\r\nmace, sword and Saranga. O lord of the universe, forcibly throw me down\r\nfrom this excellent car, O thou that art the refuge of all creatures in\r\nthis battle. Slain here by thee, O Krishna, great will be my good fortune\r\nboth in this world and the next. Great is the respect thou payest me, O\r\nLord of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. My dignity will be celebrated in\r\nthe three worlds.' Hearing these words of Santanu's son, Krishna rushing\r\nimpetuously towards him said, 'Thou art the root of this great slaughter\r\non earth. Thou wilt behold Duryodhana slain to-day. A wise minister who\r\ntreadeth in the path of righteousness should restrain a king that is\r\naddicted to the evil of gambling. That wretch again of his race who\r\ntransgresseth duty should be abandoned as one whose intelligence hath\r\nbeen misdirected by destiny.--The royal Bhishma, hearing these words,\r\nreplied unto the chief of the Yadus, saying,--Destiny is all powerful.\r\nThe Yadus, for their benefit, had abandoned Kansa. I said this to the\r\nking (Dhritarashtra) but he minded it not. The listener that hath no\r\nbenefit to receive becometh, for (his own) misery, of perverted\r\nunderstanding through (the influence of destiny).' Meanwhile, jumping\r\ndown from his car, Partha, himself of massive and long arms, quickly ran\r\non foot after that chief of Yadu's race possessed of massive and long\r\narms, and seized him by his two hands. That first of all gods devoted in\r\nself, Krishna, was excited with rage. And therefore, though thus seized,\r\nVishnu forcibly dragged Jishnu after him, like a tempest bearing away a\r\nsingle tree. The high-souled Partha, however, seizing them with great\r\nforce his legs as he was proceeding at a quick pace towards Bhishma,\r\nsucceeded, O king, in stopping him with difficulty at the tenth step. And\r\nwhen Krishna stopped, decked as he was with a beautiful garland of gold,\r\ncheerfully bowed down to him and said, 'Quell this wrath of thine. Thou\r\nart the refuge of the Pandavas, O Kesava. I swear, O Kesava, by my sons\r\nand uterine brothers that I will not withdraw from the acts to which I\r\nhave pledged myself. O younger brother of Indra, at thy command I will\r\ncertainly annihilate the Kurus.' Hearing that promise and oath of his,\r\nJanardana became gratified. And ever engaged as he was in doing what was\r\nagreeable to Arjuna--that best of the Kurus.--he once more, discus on\r\narm, mounted on his car. And that slayer of foes once more took up those\r\nreins (that he had abandoned), and taking up his conch called\r\nPanchajanya, Saurin filled all the points of the compass and the welkin\r\nwith its blare. And thereupon beholding Krishna decked with necklace and\r\nAngada and ear-rings, with curved eye-lashes smeared with dust, and with\r\nteeth of perfect whiteness, once more take up his conch the Kuru heroes\r\nuttered a loud cry. And the sound of cymbals and drums and kettle-drums,\r\nand the rattle of car-wheels and the noise of smaller drums, mingling\r\nwith those leonine shouts, set forth from all the ranks of the Kurus,\r\nbecame a fierce uproar. And the twang of Partha's Gandiva, resembling the\r\nroll of the thunder, filled the welkin and all the quarters. And shot\r\nfrom the bow of Pandu's son, bright and blazing shafts proceeded in all\r\ndirections. Then the Kuru king, with a large force, and with Bhishma and\r\nBhurisravas also, arrow in hand, and resembling a comet risen for\r\nconsuming a constellation, rushed against him. And Bhurisravas hurled at\r\nArjuna seven javelins furnished with wings of gold, and Duryodhana a\r\nlance of fierce impetuosity, and Salya a mace, and Santanu's son a dart.\r\nThereupon, Arjuna, baffling with seven shafts the seven javelins, fleet\r\nas arrows, shot by Bhurisravas, cut off with another keen-edged shaft the\r\nlance hurled from Duryodhana's arm. And the blazing dart coming towards\r\nhim--effulgent as lightning--hurled by Santanu's son, and the mace hurled\r\nfrom the arm of the ruler of the Madras, that hero cut off with two\r\n(other) shafts. Then drawing with his two hands and with great force his\r\nbeautiful bow Gandiva of immeasurable energy, he invoked with proper\r\nmantras the highly wonderful and terrible Mahendra weapon and caused it\r\nto appear in the welkin. And with that mighty weapon producing profuse\r\nshowers of arrows endued with the effulgence of the blazing fire, that\r\nhigh-souled and mighty bowman, decked with diadem and garland of gold,\r\nchecked the entire Kaurava host. And those shafts from Partha's bow,\r\ncutting off the arms, bows, standard-tops, and cars, penetrated into the\r\nbodies of the kings and of the huge elephants and steeds of the foe. And\r\nfilling the cardinal and the subsidiary directions with those sharp and\r\nterrible shafts of his, Pritha's son decked with diadem and garland of\r\ngold, agitated the hearts of his foes by means of the twang of Gandiva.\r\nAnd in that awful passage at arms, the blare of conches and beat of drums\r\nand the deep rattle of cars were all silenced by the twang of Gandiva.\r\nAnd ascertaining that twang to be of Gandiva, king Virata and other\r\nheroes among men, and the brave Drupada, the king of the Panchalas, all\r\nproceeded to that spot with undepressed hearts. And all thy combatants\r\nstood, struck with fear, each at the spot where he heard that twang of\r\nGandiva. And none amongst them ventured to proceed to that place whence\r\nthat sound was heard. And in that awful slaughter of kings, heroic\r\ncombatants were slain and car-warriors with those that guided their cars.\r\nAnd elephants with resplendent housings of gold and gorgeous standards\r\n(on their backs), afflicted with broad-headed shafts failing upon them,\r\nsuddenly fell down, deprived of life and their bodies mangled by Kiritin.\r\nAnd forcibly struck by Partha with his winged arrows of great impetuosity\r\nand broad-headed shafts of keen-edge and points, the standards of\r\ninnumerable kings stationed at the heads of their yantras and Indrajalas\r\nwere cut off.[372] And bands of infantry and car-warriors, in that\r\nbattle, and steeds and elephants, fell fast on the field, their limbs\r\nparalysed, or themselves speedily deprived of life, affected by\r\nDhananjaya with those shafts. And, O king, many were the warriors who in\r\nthat terrible conflict had their coats of mail and bodies cut through by\r\nthat mighty weapon called after the name of Indra. And with those\r\nterrible and sharp shafts of his, Kiritin caused an awful river to run on\r\nthe field of battle, having for its waters the blood flowing from the\r\nmangled bodies of the combatants and having for its froth their fat. And\r\nits current was broad and ran fiercely. And the bodies of elephants and\r\nsteeds despatched to the other world formed its banks. And its mire\r\nconsisted of the entrails, the marrow, and the flesh of human beings, and\r\nprodigious Rakshasas formed the (tall) trees (standing on its banks). And\r\nthe crowns of human heads in profusion, covered with hair, formed its\r\n(floating) mess, and heaps of human bodies, forming its sandbanks, caused\r\nthe current to flow in a thousand directions. And the coats of mail\r\nstrewn all over formed its hard pebbles. And its banks were infested by\r\nlarge number of jackals and wolves and cranes and vultures and crowds of\r\nRakshasas, and packs of hyenas. And they that were alive beheld that\r\nterrible river of current consisting of fat, marrow, and blood, caused by\r\nthe arrowy showers of Arjuna--that embodiment of (man's) cruelty--to look\r\nlike the great Vaitarani.[373] And beholding the foremost warriors of\r\nthat army of the Kurus thus slain by Phalguni, the Chedis, the Panchalas,\r\nthe Kurushas, the Matsyas, and all the combatants of the Pandava side,\r\nthose foremost of men, elated with victory, together set up a loud shout\r\nfor frightening the Kaurava warriors. And they uttered that cry\r\nindicative of victory, beholding the foremost combatants of the (Kuru)\r\narmy, the very troops protected by mighty leaders of divisions, thus\r\nslain by Kiritin, that terror of foes, who frightened them like a lion\r\nfrightening herds of smaller animals. And then the bearer of Gandiva\r\nhimself, and Janardana both filled with delight, uttered loud roars. And\r\nthe Kurus, with Bhishma, and Drona and Duryodhana and Valhika,\r\nexceedingly mangled by the weapons (of Arjuna), beholding the sun\r\nwithdraw his rays, and seeing also that awful and irresistible weapon\r\ncalled after the name of Indra spread out and causing (as it were) the\r\nend of the Yuga to appear, withdraw their forces for the nightly rest.\r\nAnd that foremost of men, Dhananjaya also, having achieved a great feat\r\nand won great renown by crushing his foes, and beholding the sun assume a\r\nred hue and the evening twilight to set in, and having completed his\r\nwork, retired with his uterine brothers to the camp for nightly rest.\r\nThen when darkness was about to set in, there arose among the Kuru troops\r\na great and terrible uproar. And all said, 'In today's battle Arjuna hath\r\nslain ten thousand car-warriors, and full seven hundred elephants. And\r\nall the westerners, and the diverse tribes of the Sauviras, and the\r\nKshudrakas and the Malavas, have all been slain. The feat achieved by\r\nDhananjaya is a mighty one. None else is competent to achieve it.\r\nSrutayush, the ruler of the Amvashtas, and Durmarshana, and Chitrasena,\r\nand Drona, and Kripa, and the ruler of the Sindhus, and Valhika, and\r\nBhurisravas, and Salya, and Sala, O king, and other warriors by hundreds\r\nunited together, along with Bhishma himself, have on battle, by the\r\nprowess of his own arms, been vanquished today by the angry son of\r\nPritha, viz., Kiritin, that one mighty car-warrior in the world.' Talking\r\nthus, O Bharata, all the warriors of thy side went to their tents from\r\nthe field of battle. And all the combatants of the Kuru army frightened\r\nby Kiritin, then entered their tents illumined by thousands of torches,\r\nand beautified by innumerable lamps."

And Drona and\r\nDuryodhana and Valhika, and also Durmarshana and Chitrasena, the mighty\r\nJayadratha, and other royal warriors, supported by large divisions\r\naccompanied, surrounding him all sides. And surrounded by those great and\r\nmighty car-warriors endued with great prowess and energy, O king, he\r\nshone, O best of monarchs, in the midst of those foremost of royal\r\nwarriors, like the chief of the celestials in the midst of the gods. And\r\nthe magnificent standards on the backs of the elephants stationed in\r\nfront of those ranks, of diverse colours, viz., red, yellow, black and\r\nbrown, waving in the air, looked exceedingly beautiful. And that army\r\nwith the royal son of Santanu and other mighty car-warriors and with\r\nelephants and steeds, looked resplendent like a mass of clouds charged\r\nwith lightning, or like the firmament, in the season of rains, with\r\ngathering clouds.[374] And then the fierce army of the Kurus, bent on\r\nbattle and protected by Santanu's son, rushed impetuously towards Arjuna\r\nlike the fierce current of the ocean-going Ganga.[375] Pervaded by\r\ndiverse kinds of forces possessed of great strength, and having in its\r\nwings elephants, steeds, infantry, and cars in profusion, that array the\r\nhigh-souled (Arjuna) having the prince of apes on his banner beheld from\r\na distance to resemble a mighty mass of clouds.[376] That high-souled\r\nhero, that bull among men, upon his car furnished with tall standard and\r\nunto which were yoked white steeds, at the head of his (own) division and\r\nsurrounded by a mighty force, proceeded against the whole hostile army.\r\nAnd all the Kauravas with thy sons, beholding that ape-bannered (warrior)\r\nwith his excellent standard and handsome car-shaft wrapped (in costly\r\ncover), accompanied by that bull of Yadu's race, his charioteer in\r\nbattle, were filled with dismay. And thy army beheld that best of arrays,\r\nwhich was protected by that mighty car-warrior of the world, viz.,\r\nKiritin, with weapons upraised to have at each of its corners four\r\nthousand elephants. Like the array which was formed on the day before by\r\nthat best of Kurus viz., king Yudhishthira the just, and like of which\r\nhad never been seen or heard before by human beings, was this one of\r\ntoday (that the Pandavas formed). Then on the field of battle thousand of\r\ndrums were loudly beaten, and there arose from all the divisions the loud\r\nblare of conches and the notes of trumpets and many leonine shouts. Then\r\n(innumerable) bows of loud twang, stretched by heroic warriors with shaft\r\nfixed on the bowstrings, and the blare of conches, silenced that uproar\r\nof drums and cymbals. And the entire welkin filled with that blare of\r\nconches was diffused with an earthly dust that made it wonderful to\r\nbehold. And with that dust the sky looked as if a vast canopy were spread\r\noverhead. And beholding that canopy the brave warriors all rushed\r\nimpetuously (to battle). And car-warriors, struck by car-warriors, were\r\noverthrown with charioteers, steeds, cars, and standards. And elephants,\r\nstruck by elephants, fell down, and foot-soldiers struck by\r\nfoot-soldiers. And rushing horsemen, struck down by rushing horsemen with\r\nlances and swords, fell down with frightful countenances. And all this\r\nseemed exceedingly wonderful. And excellent shields decked with golden\r\nstars and possessed of solar effulgence, broken by (strokes of)\r\nbattle-axes, lances and swords dropped on the field.[377] And many\r\ncar-warriors mangled and bruised by the tusks and the strong trunks of\r\nelephants, fell down with their charioteers. And many bulls among\r\ncar-warriors struck by bulls among car-warriors with their shafts, fell\r\ndown on the ground. And many persons hearing the wails of horsemen and\r\nfoot-soldiers struck with the tusks and other limbs of elephants or\r\ncrushed by the impetus of those huge creatures rushing in close ranks,\r\nfell down on the field of battle.[378]\r\n\r\n\"Then when cavalry and foot-soldiers were falling fast, and elephants and\r\nsteeds and cars were flying away in fear, Bhishma, surrounded by many\r\nmighty car-warriors, obtained sight of him who had the prince of apes on\r\nhis standard. And the palmyra-bannered warrior, viz. the son of Santanu,\r\nhaving five palmyras on his standard, then rushed against the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna) whose car, in consequence of the fleetness of the\r\nexcellent steeds attached to it was endued with wonderful energy and\r\nwhich blazed like the very lightning in consequence of the energy of his\r\nmighty weapons. And so against that son of Indra who was like unto Indra\r\nhimself, rushed many (other) warriors headed by Drona and Kripa and Salya\r\nand Vivinsati and Duryodhana and also Somadatta's son, O king. Then the\r\nheroic Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, conversant with all weapons and\r\ncased in a handsome and golden coat of mail, rushing out of the ranks,\r\nquickly proceeded against all those warriors. And that son of Krishna of\r\nfeats incapable of being borne, baffling the mighty weapons of all those\r\nwarriors of great strength, looked resplendent like the adorable Agni\r\nhimself, on the sacrificial altar, of blazing flames, invoked with high\r\nmantras. Then Bhishma of mighty energy, creating in that battle a very\r\nriver whose waters were the blood of foes, and quickly avoiding\r\nSubhadra's son, encountered that mighty car-warrior, viz., Partha\r\nhimself. Then Arjuna decked with diadem and garlands with his Gandiva of\r\nwonderful mien and twang loud as the roar of the thunder, shooting\r\nshowers of arrows, baffled that shower of mighty weapons (shot by\r\nBhishma). And that high-souled warrior having the prince of apes on his\r\nbanner, of feats incapable of being borne, then poured in return upon\r\nBhishma, that best of all wielders of bows a shower of sharp-edged arrows\r\nand polished shafts of broad heads. And so thy troops also beheld that\r\nshower of mighty weapons shot by him who had the prince of apes on his\r\nbanner, opposed and dispersed by Bhishma like the maker of day dispelling\r\n(the gloom of night). And the Kurus and the Srinjayas, and all the people\r\nthere, beheld that single combat between those two foremost of men, viz.,\r\nBhishma and Dhananjaya, proceeding thus steadily and thus distinguished\r\nby the terrible twang of the bows of both.\""

And while\r\nfighting alone with five tigers among men, people beheld him possessed of\r\nexceeding energy, like a young lion fighting with five elephants. And no\r\none among them equalled Krishna's son in sureness of aim, in bravery, in\r\nprowess, in lightness of hand or in knowledge of weapons. And beholding\r\nhis son, that chastiser of foes thus struggling and displaying his\r\nprowess in battle, Partha set up a leonine roar. And seeing thy grandson,\r\nO king, thus afflicting thy host, thy warriors, O monarch, surrounded him\r\non all sides. Then that smiter of foes, the son of Subhadra, depending\r\nupon his prowess and might, advanced with undepressed heart against the\r\nDhartarashtra host. And while battling with the foe in that conflict, his\r\nmighty bow endued with the effulgence of the sun, was seen by all to be\r\nincessantly stretched for striking. And piercing the son of Drona with\r\none shaft, and Salya with five, he overthrew the standard of Samyamani's\r\nson with eight shafts. And with another sharp-edged arrow he cut off the\r\nmighty dart of golden staff, resembling a snake, that was hurled at him\r\nby Somadatta's son. And the heir of Arjuna, baffling in the very sight of\r\nSalya, his hundreds of terrible shafts, slew his four steeds. Thereupon\r\nBhurisravas, and Salya, and Drona's son and Samyamani, and Sala struck\r\nwith the fear at the strength of arms displayed by Krishna's son could\r\nnot stay before him. Then, O great king, the Trigartas and the Madras,\r\nwith the Kekayas, numbering five and twenty thousand urged by thy son,\r\nall of whom were foremost of men accomplished in the science of arms and\r\nwho were incapable of defeat by foes in battle, surrounded Kiritin with\r\nhis son for slaying them both. Then, O king, that vanquisher of foes, the\r\ncommander of the Pandava army, the prince of the Panchalas, beheld the\r\ncars of the father and the son (thus) surrounded (by the foe). Supported\r\nby many thousands of elephants and cars, and by hundred thousands of\r\ncavalry and infantry, and stretching his bow in great wrath he advanced\r\nagainst that division of the Madras and the Kekayas, O chastiser of foes,\r\nleading his troops with him. And that division (of the Pandava army),\r\nprotected by that renowned and firm bowman, and consisting of cars,\r\nelephants, and cavalry, looked resplendent as it advanced for the\r\nencounter. And while proceeding towards Arjuna, that perpetuator of\r\nPanchala's race struck Saradwat's son on his shoulder-joint with three\r\narrows. And piercing the Madrakas then with ten sharp shafts, he speedily\r\nslew the protector of Kritavarman's rear. And that chastiser of foes\r\nthen, with a shaft of broad head, slew Damana, the heir of the\r\nhigh-souled Paurava. Then the son of Samyamani pierced the Panchala\r\nprince incapable of defeat in the battle with ten shafts, and his\r\ncharioteer also with ten shafts. Then that mighty bowman, (thus) severely\r\npierced, licked with his tongue the corners of his mouth, and cut off his\r\nenemy's bow with a broad-headed shaft of excessive sharpness. And soon\r\nthe prince of Panchala afflicted his foe with five and twenty arrows, and\r\nthen slew his steeds, O king, and then both the protectors of his wings.\r\nThen, O bull of Bharata's race, Samyamani's son, standing on that car\r\nwhose steeds were slain, looked at the son of the renowned king of the\r\nPanchalas. Then taking up a terrible scimitar of the best kind, made of\r\nsteel, Samyamani's son walking on foot, approached Drupada's son staying\r\non his car. And the Pandavas, soldiers and Dhrishtadyumna also of\r\nPrishata's race beheld him coming like a wave and resembling a snake\r\nfallen from the skies. And he whirled his sword and looked like the sun\r\nand advanced with the tread of an infuriate elephant. The prince of\r\nPanchala then, excited with rage, quickly taking up a mace, smashed the\r\nhead of Samyamani's son thus advancing towards him, sharp-edged scimitar\r\nin grasp and shield in hand, as soon as the latter, having crossed the\r\nshooting distance, was near enough to his adversary's car. And then, O\r\nking, while falling down deprived of life, his blazing scimitar and\r\nshield, loosened from his grasp, fell down with his body on the ground.\r\nAnd the high-souled son of the Panchala king, of terrible prowess, having\r\nslain his foe with his mace, won great renown. And when that prince, that\r\nmighty car-warrior and great bowman, was (thus) slain, loud cries of oh\r\nand alas arose among thy troops, O sire. Then Samyamani, excited with\r\nrage upon beholding his own son slain, impetuously rushed towards the\r\nprince of Panchala who was incapable of defeat in battle. And all the\r\nkings of both the Kuru and the Pandava armies beheld those two princes\r\nand foremost of car-warriors engaged in battle. Then that slayer of\r\nhostile heroes Samyamani, excited with wrath, struck Prishata's son with\r\nthree shafts like (the conductor of an elephant striking) a mighty\r\nelephant with hooks. And so Salya also, that ornament of assemblies,\r\nexcited with wrath, struck the heroic son of Prishata on his breast. And\r\nthen commenced (another) battle (there).\""

Thou always speakest, O suta, of my troops as being\r\nslaughtered, and thou always speakest of the Pandavas as both unslain and\r\ncheerful. Indeed, O Sanjaya, thou speakest of mine as deprived of\r\nmanliness, felled and falling, and slaughtered, although they are\r\nbattling to the best of their powers and striving hard for victory. Thou\r\nalways speakest to me of the Pandavas as obtaining victory and mine as\r\nbecoming weaker and weaker. O child, I am incessantly hearing of\r\ncountless cause of unbearable and poignant grief on account of\r\nDuryodhana's doing. I do not see, O Sanjaya, the means by which the\r\nPandavas, may be weakened and sons of mine may obtain the victory in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"This mighty evil hath proceeded from thee, O king. Listen\r\nnow with patience to the great slaughter of men, elephants, steeds and\r\ncar-warriors. Dhrishtadyumna, afflicted by Salya with nine shafts,\r\nafflicted in return the ruler of Madras with many shafts made of steel.\r\nAnd then we beheld the prowess of Prishata's son to be highly wonderful\r\ninasmuch as he speedily checked Salya that ornament of assemblies. The\r\nbattle between them lasted for only a short space of time. While angrily\r\nengaged in combat, none beheld even a moment's rest taken by any of them.\r\nThen, O king, Salya in that battle cut off Dhrishtadyumna's bow with a\r\nbroad-headed shaft of sharp edge and excellent temper. And he also\r\ncovered him, O Bharata, with a shower of arrows like rain charged clouds\r\npouring their drops on the mountain breast during the season of rains.\r\nAnd while Dhrishtadyumna was being thus afflicted, Abhimanyu, excited\r\nwith wrath, rushed impetuously towards the car of the ruler of the\r\nMadras. Then the wrathful son of Krishna, of immeasurable soul, obtaining\r\nthe car of the ruler of the Madras (within shooting distance), pierced\r\nArtayani with three sharp shafts.[379] Then the warriors of thy army, O\r\nking, desirous of opposing the son of Arjuna in battle, speedily\r\nsurrounded the car of the ruler of Madras. And Duryodhana, and Vikarna,\r\nand Dussasana, and Vivinsati and Durmarshana, and Dussala, and\r\nChitrasena, and Durmukha, and Satyabrata, blessed be thou, and Purumitra,\r\nO Bharata,--these, protecting the car of the ruler of the Madras,\r\nstationed themselves there. Then Bhimasena, excited with wrath, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna. of Prishata's race, and the five sons of Draupadi, and\r\nAbhimanyu, and the twin sons of Madri and Pandu,--these ten opposed those\r\nten warriors of the Dhritarashtra army shooting, O king, diverse kinds of\r\nweapons. And they approached and encountered one another in battle\r\ndesirous of slaying one another, in consequence, O king, of thy wicked\r\npolicy. And when those ten car-warriors, excited with wrath, engaged with\r\nthe ten others in that awful battle, the other car-warriors of both thy\r\narmy and of the foe all stood as spectators. And those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, shooting diverse kinds of weapons and roaring at one\r\nanother, smote one another fiercely. With wrath engendered in their\r\nbreasts, desirous of slaying one another, they uttered fierce shouts,\r\nchallenging one another. And jealous of one another, O king, those\r\nkinsfolk united together, encountered one another wrathfully, shooting\r\nmighty weapons. And wonderful to say, Duryodhana, excited with rage,\r\npierced Dhrishtadyumna in that battle with four sharp shafts. And\r\nDurmarshana pierced him with twenty, and Chitrasena with five, and\r\nDurmukha with nine, and Dussaha with seven, and Vivinsati with five, and\r\nDussasana with three shafts. Then, O great king, that scorcher of foes,\r\nviz., Prishata's son, pierced each of them in return with five and twenty\r\nshafts, displaying his lightness of hand. And Abhimanyu, O Bharata,\r\npierced Satyavrata and Purumitra each with ten shafts. Then the son of\r\nMadri, those delighters of their mother, covered their uncle with showers\r\nof sharp arrows. And all this seemed wonderful. Then, O monarch, Salya\r\ncovered his nephews, those two foremost of car-warriors desirous of\r\ncounteracting their uncle's feats, with arrows, but the sons of Madri\r\nwavered not. Then the mighty Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, beholding\r\nDuryodhana and desirous of ending the strife, took up his mace. And\r\nbeholding the mighty-armed Bhimasena with upraised mace and looking like\r\nthe crested Kailasa mount, thy sons fled away in terror. Duryodhana,\r\nhowever, excited with wrath, urged the Magadha division consisting of ten\r\nthousand elephants of great activity. Accompanied by that elephant\r\ndivision and placing the ruler of Magadha before him, king Duryodhana\r\nadvanced towards Bhimasena. Beholding that elephant division advancing\r\ntowards him, Vrikodara, mace in hand, jumped down from his car, uttering\r\na loud roar like that of a lion. And armed with that mighty mace which\r\nwas endued with great weight and strength of adamant, he rushed towards\r\nthat elephant division, like the Destroyer himself with wide open mouth.\r\nAnd the mighty-armed Bhimasena endued with great strength, slaying\r\nelephants with his mace, wandered over the field, like the slayer of\r\nVritra among the Danava host. And with the loud shouts of the roaring\r\nBhima, shouts that made the mind and the heart to tremble with fear, the\r\nelephants, crouching close, lost all power of motion. Then the sons of\r\nDraupadi, and that mighty car-warrior, the son of Subhadra, and Nakula\r\nand Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, protecting Bhima's\r\nrear, rushed behind him, checking all by scattering their arrowy showers\r\nlike the very clouds pouring rain on the mountain breast. And those\r\nPandava warriors struck off the heads of their foes battling from the\r\nbacks of elephants, with well-tempered and keen-edged shafts of diverse\r\nforms.[380] And the heads (of elephant-riders), and arms decked with\r\nornaments, and hands with iron-hooks in grasp, falling fast, resembled a\r\nstony shower. And the headless trunk of elephant-riders on the necks of\r\nthe beasts they rode, looked like headless trees on mountain summits. And\r\nwe beheld mighty elephants felled and falling, slain by Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nthe high-souled son of Prishata. Then the ruler of the Magadhas, in that\r\nbattle, urged his elephant resembling Airavata himself, towards the car\r\nof Subhadra's son. Beholding that mighty elephant advancing towards him,\r\nthat slayer of hostile heroes, the brave son of Subhadra, slew it with a\r\nsingle shaft. And when the ruler of the Magadhas was thus deprived of his\r\nelephant, that conqueror of hostile cities viz., the son of Krishna, then\r\nstruck off that king's head with a broad-headed shaft with silver wings.\r\nAnd Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, having penetrated that elephant\r\ndivision, began to wander over the field, crushing those beasts around\r\nhim like Indra himself crushing the mountains. And we beheld elephants\r\nslain in that battle by Bhimasena, each with only one stroke (of his\r\nmace), like hills riven by thunder. And many elephants, huge as hills,\r\nwere slain there, having their tusks broken or temples, or bones, or\r\nbacks, or frontal globes. And others, O king, deprived of life, lay there\r\nwith foaming mouths. And many mighty elephants, with frontal globes\r\ncompletely smashed, vomited large quantities of blood. And some, from\r\nfear, laid themselves down on the ground like (so many) hillocks. And\r\nsmeared with the fat and blood (of elephants) and almost bathed in their\r\nmarrow, Bhima wandered over the field like the Destroyer himself, club in\r\nhand. And Vrikodara, whirling that mace of his which was wet with the\r\nblood of elephants, became terrible and awful to behold, like the wielder\r\nof Pinaka armed with Pinaka.[381] And those huge tuskers, while (thus)\r\ncrushed by the angry Bhima, suddenly fled away, afflicted, crushing thy\r\nown ranks. And these mighty bowmen and car-warriors, headed by Subhadra's\r\nson (all the while) protected that battling hero whirling his gory\r\nmace[382] wet with the blood of elephants, like the celestials protecting\r\nthe wielder of the thunder-bolt. Of terrible soul, Bhimasena then looked\r\nlike the Destroyer. himself. Indeed, O Bharata, putting forth his\r\nstrength on all sides, mace in arms, we beheld Bhimasena then to resemble\r\nSankara himself dancing (at the end of the Yuga), and his fierce, heavy,\r\nand sounding mace to resemble the club of Yama and possessed of the sound\r\nof Indra's bolt. And that gory mace of his, smeared with marrow and hair,\r\nresembled (also) the angry Rudra's Pinaka while he is engaged in\r\ndestroying all creatures. As a herdsman chastises his herd of cattle with\r\na goad, so did Bhima smite that elephant division with that mace of his.\r\nAnd while thus slaughtered by Bhima with his mace and with shafts (by\r\nthose that protected his rear), the elephants ran on all sides, crushing\r\nthe cars of thy own army. Then driving away those elephants from the\r\nfield like a mighty wind driving away masses of clouds, Bhima stood there\r\nlike wielder of the trident on a crematorium.\""

That vast and unlimited host\r\ndifficult of being borne by the very gods, incapable of being crossed\r\nlike the surging sea on the day of full moon or new moon, abounding with\r\ncars, elephants, and steeds, resounding with the blare of conches and the\r\nbeat of drums, numbering untold foot-soldiers and car-warriors, and\r\nshrouded by the dust (raised), that very sea of hostile troops incapable\r\nof being agitated, thus coming towards him, Bhimasena checked in battle,\r\nO king, like the bank resisting the ocean. That feat, O king, which we\r\nbeheld, of Bhimasena the high-souled son of Pandu, was exceedingly\r\nwonderful and superhuman. With his mace, he fearlessly checked all those\r\nkings angrily rushing towards him, with their steeds and cars, and\r\nelephants. Checking that vast force with mace, that foremost of mighty\r\nmen, Bhima, stood in that fierce melee, immovable as the mountain Meru.\r\nAnd in that dreadful, fierce, and terrific encounter his brother and sons\r\nand Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and the sons of Draupadi and\r\nAbhimanyu, and the unvanquished Sikhandin--these mighty warriors,--did\r\nnot abandon him from fear. Taking up his massive and weighty mace made of\r\nSaika iron, he rushed towards the warriors of thy army like the Destroyer\r\nhimself, armed with his club. And pressing crowds of cars and crowds of\r\nhorsemen down into the earth, Bhima wandered over the field like the fire\r\nat the end of the Yuga. And Pandu's son of infinite prowess crushing\r\ncrowds of cars with the impetus of his thighs and slaying thy warriors in\r\nbattle, wandered like the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga.

And dragging car-warriors down from their\r\ncars, and warriors fighting from the backs of heroes, and foot soldiers\r\nas they stood on the ground, in the army of thy son, the mighty-armed\r\nBhimasena slew them all with his mace like the wind crushing trees by its\r\nforce. And that mace of his, slaying elephants and steeds, became smeared\r\nwith fat, marrow, flesh, and blood, and looked exceedingly terrible. And\r\nwith the bodies of slain men and cavalry lying scattered about, the field\r\nof battle wore the appearance of the abode of Yama. And the terrible and\r\nslaughtering mace of Bhimasena, resembling the fierce bludgeon of Death\r\nand endued with the effulgence of Indra's bolt, looked like Pinaka of the\r\nangry Rudra while destroying living creatures. Indeed, that mace of the\r\nhigh-souled son of Kunti, who was slaying all around, looked fiercely\r\nresplendent like the bludgeon of the Destroyer himself at the time of the\r\nuniversal dissolution. And beholding him thus routing that large army\r\nrepeatedly and advancing like Death's self, all the warriors became\r\ncheerless. Withersoever the son of Pandu, raising his mace, cast his\r\neyes, in consequence of his look alone, O Bharata, all the troops there\r\nseemed to melt away. Beholding Vrikodara of terrible deeds, thus routing\r\nthe army and unvanquished by even so large a force and devouring the\r\n(hostile) division like the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth,\r\nBhimasena speedily came towards him, on his car of solar effulgence and\r\nrattle loud as that of the clouds, (shrouding the welkin) with his arrowy\r\nshowers like a vapoury canopy charged with rain. Then the mighty-armed\r\nBhimasena, beholding Bhishma thus advancing like the Destroyer himself\r\nwith wide-open mouth, rushed towards him, excited with wrath. At that\r\nmoment, that foremost hero of Sini's race viz., Satyaki of sure aim, fell\r\nupon the grandsire, slaying his enemies (along the way) with his firm bow\r\nand causing thy son's army to tremble. And all the combatants who\r\nbelonged to thy army were then, O Bharata, unable to impede the progress\r\nof that hero thus advancing with his steeds of silvery hue and scattering\r\nhis sharp shafts furnished with handsome wings. At that time the Rakshasa\r\nAlamvusha (only) succeeded in piercing him with ten shafts. But piercing\r\nAlamvusha in return with four shafts, the grandson of Sini proceeded on\r\nhis car.

Bhima then, that bull among men,\r\nbeholding his charioteer Visoka afflicted, in that conflict, with sharp\r\nshafts by thy son armed with the bow, and unable to bear it, drew another\r\nexcellent bow, excited with wrath, for the destruction of thy son, O\r\nmonarch. And excited with great wrath, he also took up an arrow with\r\nhorse-shoe head and furnished with excellent wings. And with that (arrow)\r\nBhima cut off the excellent bow of the king. Then thy son, excited to the\r\nhighest pitch of fury, leaving that broken bow aside, speedily took up\r\nanother that was tougher. And aiming a terrible shaft blazing as Death's\r\nrod, the Kuru king, excited with rage struck Bhimasena between his two\r\nbreasts. Deeply pierced therewith, and greatly pained, he sat down on the\r\nterrace of his car. And while seated on the terrace of his car, he\r\nswooned away. Beholding Bhima thus unmanned, the illustrious and mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Pandava army, headed by Abhimanyu could not bear it.\r\nAnd those warriors then, with great steadiness, showered on thy sons'\r\nhead a thick down-pour of fierce shafts. Then the mighty Bhimasena,\r\nregaining consciousness, pierced Duryodhana at first with those shafts\r\nand then with five. And that mighty bowman the son of Pandu then pierced\r\nSalya with five and twenty shafts furnished with golden wings. And\r\npierced therewith, Salya was borne away from the battle. Then thy\r\nfourteen sons, viz., Senapati, Sushena, Jalasandha, Sulochana, Ugra,\r\nBhimaratha, Bhima, Viravahu, Aolupa, Durmukha, Dushpradarsha, Vivitsu,\r\nVikata, and Sama, then encountered Bhimasena in battle. United together\r\nthey rushed against Bhimasena, and with eyes red in wrath, showering\r\ncountless arrows, they pierced him deeply. Then the heroic and mighty\r\nBhimasena of strong arms, beholding thy sons, licking the corners of his\r\nmouth like a wolf in the midst of smaller creatures, fell upon them with\r\nthe impetuosity of Garuda. And the son of Pandu then cut off the head of\r\nSenapati with a shaft having a horse-shoe head. And with delighted soul\r\nand laughing the while, that mighty-armed warrior, piercing Jalasandha\r\nwith three arrows, despatched him to Yama's abode. And next, smiting\r\nSushena, he sent him to the presence of Death's self. And with a single\r\nbroad-headed shaft he felled on the ground the head, handsome as the\r\nmoon, of Ugra, decked with turban and adorned with ear-rings. And in that\r\nbattle, Pandu's son Bhima, with seventy shafts, despatched Viravahu to\r\nthe other world with his steeds and standard and charioteer. And smiling\r\nthe while, O king, Bhimasena quickly despatched both the brothers Bhima\r\nand Bhimaratha also to Yama's abode. And then in that great battle in the\r\nvery sight of all the troops, with an arrow of horse-shoe head Bhima\r\ndespatched Sulochana also to Death's domain. Then the rest of thy sons\r\nthat were there, O king, beholding the prowess of Bhimasena and while\r\nthus being struck by that illustrious warrior, all fled from battle from\r\nfear of Bhima. Then Santanu's son, addressing all the mighty car-warriors\r\n(of his army) said, 'That fierce bowman, Bhima, excited with wrath in\r\nbattle, is slaying the mighty sons of Dhritarashtra and other heroic\r\ncar-warriors united together, whatever their knowledge of weapons, and\r\nwhatever their bravery. Therefore, seize ye all that son of Pandu'. Thus\r\naddressed, all the troops of the Dhritarashtra army, excited with rage,\r\nrushed towards Bhimasena endued with great might, And Bhagadatta, O king,\r\non his elephant of rent temples, suddenly rushed thither where Bhimasena\r\nwas stationed. And thither to the combat, he shrouded Bhima with his\r\nshafts whetted on stone so as to make him completely invisible, like the\r\nclouds covering the sun. Those mighty car-warriors, however, (of the\r\nPandava army), relying on the prowess of their own arms, could not bear\r\nthat shrouding of Bhima (with the arrowy showers of Bhagadatta). They,\r\ntherefore, surrounding Bhagadatta on all sides, poured on him their\r\narrowy down-pours. And they pierced his elephant also with showers of\r\nshafts. And struck by all those mighty car-warriors with showers of\r\nfierce shafts of diverse kinds that elephant, O king, of the ruler of the\r\nPragjyotishas with blood trickling down his body, became beautiful to\r\nbehold on the field of battle like a mass of clouds tinged with the rays\r\nof the sun. And that elephant with temporal juice trickling down urged by\r\nBhagadatta, like the Destroyer, ran with double his former speed, shaking\r\nthe very earth with his tread. Then all those mighty car-warriors,\r\nbeholding that terrible mien of the animal, and regarding it\r\nirresistible, became cheerless. Then king Bhagadatta, that tiger among\r\nmen, excited with rage, struck Bhimasena between his two breasts with a\r\nstraight shaft. Deeply pierced by the king with that shaft, that great\r\nbowman and mighty car-warrior, with limbs deprived of sensation in\r\nconsequence of a swoon, sat down on his car, holding his flagstaff. And\r\nbeholding those mighty car-warriors terrified and Bhimasena in a swoon,\r\nBhagadatta of great prowess uttered a loud roar. Then, O king, that\r\nterrible Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, beholding Bhima in that state, became\r\nexcited with rage and there and then disappeared from the view. And\r\ncreating a terrible illusion enhancing the fears of the timid, he\r\nreappeared in a moment assuming a fierce form. Himself riding on an\r\nAiravata created by his powers of illusion, the other Dik-elephants,\r\nviz., Anjana, Vamana, and Mahapadma of blazing glory, followed him. And\r\nthose three mighty elephants, ridden by Rakshasas, were of huge form,\r\nwith juice profusely trickling down in three lines, and endued with great\r\nspeed and prowess. Then Ghatotkacha urged his own elephant to battle,\r\ndesirous, O chastiser of foes, of slaying Bhagadatta with his elephant.\r\nAnd those other elephants, excited with fury and each endued with four\r\ntusks, urged by Rakshasas of great strength, fell from all sides upon\r\nBhagadatta's elephant and afflicted him with their tusks. And the\r\nelephant of Bhagadatta, thus afflicted by those elephants, (already)\r\nstruck with arrows and feeling great pain, uttered loud cries that\r\nresembled the thunder of Indra. And hearing those terrible and loud cries\r\nof that roaring elephant, Bhishma, addressing Drona, Suyodhana and all\r\nthe kings, said, 'The mighty bowman Bhagadatta is battling with the\r\nwicked-souled son of Hidimva, and hath fallen into great distress. That\r\nRakshasa is of huge form, and the king also is very wrathful. Engaged in\r\nbattle, they would certainly prove each other's death. Loud shouts were\r\nalso heard of the rejoicing Pandavas, and the cries of agony of (king\r\nBhagadatta's) terrified elephant. Blessed be ye, let us all go there for\r\nrescuing the king, for, if left unprotected, in battle, he will soon give\r\nup his life. Ye warriors of great energy, do, as I bid, even now. Ye\r\nsinless ones, make no delay. The combat deepens and becometh fierce,\r\nmaking the hair to stand on end. That commander of a division is\r\nhigh-born, endued with great bravery, and devoted to us. Ye warriors of\r\nunfading glory, it is meet that his rescue should be effected by us.'\r\nHearing these words of Bhishma, all the kings (of the Kuru army), headed\r\nby Bharadwaja's son, desirous of rescuing Bhagadatta, proceeded with\r\ngreat speed to where the ruler of the Pragjyotishas was. And beholding\r\nthe enemy advancing, the Panchalas with the Pandavas, headed by\r\nYudhishthira, pursued them behind. Then that prince of Rakshasas, endued\r\nwith great prowess, beholding that division (of the enemy) advance,\r\nuttered a fierce roar, deep as that of thunder. Hearing that roar of his\r\nand beholding those battling elephants, Santanu's son Bhishma once again\r\naddressed Bharadwaja's son and said, 'I do not like to fight (to-day)\r\nwith the wicked-souled son of Hidimva. Endued with great might and\r\nenergy, he is at present well-supported. He is incapable of being\r\nvanquished now by the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. Of sureness of\r\naim, he is a great smiter. As regards ourselves, our animals are tired\r\n(today). We have also been greatly mangled by Panchalas and the Pandavas.\r\nI do not like fresh encounter with the victorious Pandavas. Let the\r\nwithdrawal of our army, therefore, be proclaimed today. Tomorrow we will\r\nfight with the foe.' Hearing these words of the grandsire, the Kauravas,\r\nafflicted with the fear of Ghatotkacha, and availing of the advent of\r\nnight as a pretext, gladly did what the grandsire said. And after the\r\nKauravas had withdrawn, the Pandavas, crowned with victory uttered\r\nleonine roars, mingling them with the blare of conches and the notes of\r\npipes. Thus did the battle take place that day, O Bharata, between the\r\nKurus and the Pandavas headed by Ghatotkacha. And the Kauravas also,\r\nvanquished by the Pandavas and overcome with shame, retired to their own\r\ntents when night came. And those mighty car-warriors, the sons of Pandu,\r\ntheir bodies mangled with shafts and themselves filled with (the result\r\nof) the battle, proceeded, O king, towards their encampment, with\r\nBhimasena and Ghatotkacha, O monarch, at their head. And filled with\r\ngreat joy, O king, they worshipped those heroes. And they uttered diverse\r\nkinds of shouts which were mingled with the notes of trumpets. And those\r\nhigh-souled warriors shouted making the very earth tremble therewith, and\r\ngrinding as it were, O sire, the hearts of thy sons. And it was thus that\r\nthose chastisers of foes, when night came, proceeded towards their tents.\r\nAnd king Duryodhana, cheerless at the death of his brothers, passed some\r\ntime in thoughtfulness, overcome with grief and tears. Then making all\r\nthe arrangements for his camp according to the rules (of military\r\nscience), he began to pass the hours in meditation, scorched with grief\r\nand afflicted with sorrow on account of his (slain) brothers.\""

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing of those feats of the sons of Pandu which\r\nare incapable of being achieved by the gods themselves, my heart, O\r\nSanjaya, is filled with fear and wonder. Hearing also of the humiliation\r\nof my sons in every way, great hath been my anxiety as to the consequence\r\nthat will ensue. The words uttered by Vidura will, no doubt, consume my\r\nheart. Everything that hath happened seemeth to be due to Destiny, O\r\nSanjaya. The combatants of the Pandava army are encountering and smiting\r\nthose best of warriors having Bhishma for their head, those heroes\r\nconversant with every weapon. What ascetic penances have been performed\r\nby the high-souled and mighty sons of Pandu, what boon hath they\r\nobtained, O son, or what science is known to them, in consequence of\r\nwhich, like the stars in the firmament, they are undergoing no\r\ndiminution? I cannot bear it that my army should be repeatedly\r\nslaughtered by the Pandavas. The divine chastisement, highly severe, both\r\nfallen on me alone. Tell me everything truly, O Sanjaya, about that for\r\nwhich the sons of Pandu have become unslayable and mine slayable. I do\r\nnot see the other shore of this (sea of) distress.[383] I am like a man\r\ndesirous of crossing the vastly deep ocean with my two arms alone. I\r\ncertainly think that a great calamity hath overtaken my sons. Without\r\ndoubt, Bhima will slay all my sons. I do not see that hero who is able to\r\nprotect my sons in battle. The death of my sons in this battle, O\r\nSanjaya, is certain. It behoveth thee, therefore, O Suta, to tell me, who\r\nasketh thee, everything about the true cause of all these. Beholding his\r\nown troops retreating from battle, what did Duryodhana do? And what old\r\nBhishma and Drona, and Kripa, and Suvala's son, and Jayadratha, and that\r\nmighty bowman, viz., Drona's son and Vikarna of great strength do? When\r\nalso, O thou of great wisdom, my sons turned back from the fight, what O\r\nSanjaya, became the resolve of those high-souled warriors?\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Listen, O king, with attention, and having listened, let\r\nit go to thy heart. Nothing (in this) is the result of incantation,\r\nnothing the result of illusion of any king. Nor have the sons of Pandu\r\ncreated any new terrors. They are endued with might; and they are\r\nfighting by fair means in this battle. Desirous of high fame, the sons of\r\nPritha always do every act, including even the support of their lives,\r\nagreeably to the way of morality. Endued with every kind of prosperity,\r\nand possessed of great strength, they never desist from battle, keeping\r\ntheir eyes on righteousness. And victory is there where righteousness is.\r\nIt is for this, O king, that the sons of Pritha are unslayable in battle\r\nand always victorious. Thy sons are of wicked souls and are addicted to\r\nsinfulness. They are cruel and wedded to mean acts. It is for this that\r\nthey are being weakened in battle. Thy sons, O king, like despicable men,\r\ndid many cruel and deceitful acts to the sons of Pandu. Disregarding,\r\nhowever, all those offences of thy sons, the sons of Pandu always\r\nconcealed those acts, O elder brother of Pandu. Thy sons also, O king, on\r\nnumerous occasions humiliated the Pandavas. Let them now reap the\r\nterrible fruit, like poison, of that persistent course of\r\nsinfulness.[384] That fruit should be enjoyed by thee also, O king, with\r\nthy sons and kinsmen, since thou, O king, could not be awakened even\r\nthough counselled by thy well-wishers. Repeatedly forbidden by Vidura, by\r\nBhishma, by the high-souled Drona, and by myself also thou didst not\r\nunderstand, rejecting our words intended for thy good and worthy of thy\r\nacceptance, like a sick man rejecting the medicine prescribed. Accepting\r\nthe views of thy sons thou hadst regarded the Pandavas as already\r\nvanquished. Listen again, O king, to what thou hast asked me, viz., the\r\ntrue cause, O chief of the Bharatas, of the victory of the Pandavas. I\r\nwill tell thee whit I have heard, O chastiser of foes. Duryodhana had\r\nasked the grandsire this very question. Beholding his brothers, all\r\nmighty car-warriors, vanquished in battle, thy son Duryodhana, O Kaurava,\r\nwith heart confounded with grief, repairing with humility during the\r\nnight to the grandsire possessed of great wisdom, asked him this\r\nquestion. Listen to me, O monarch, about it all.\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'Drona and thou, and Salya, and Kripa, and Drona's son,\r\nand Kritavarman the son of Hridika, and Sudakshina the ruler of the\r\nKamvojas, and Bhurisravas, and Vikarna, and Bhagadatta of exceeding\r\nprowess, are all regarded as mighty car-warriors. All of these, again,\r\nare high-born, and prepared to throw away their lives in battle. It is my\r\nopinion that these are a match for even the three worlds (united\r\ntogether). Even all the warriors of the Pandava army (united together)\r\ncannot bear your prowess. A doubt has arisen in my mind. Explain it to me\r\nwho enquireth of thee. Who it is, relying on whom the Pandavas are\r\nvanquishing us repeatedly.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O king, to the words that I will speak unto thee,\r\nO thou of Kuru's race. Frequently wert thou addressed by me to the same\r\neffect but thou didst not do what I said. Let peace be made with the\r\nPandavas, O best of the Bharatas. I regard this to be beneficial both to\r\nthe world and thee, O lord. Enjoy this earth, O king, with thy brothers\r\nand be happy, gratifying all thy well-wishers and delighting thy\r\nkinsfolk. Although I cried myself hoarse before this, thou didst not yet\r\nlisten to me, O sire. Thou hadst always disregarded the sons of Pandu.\r\nThe effect of all that hath now overtaken thee. Listen also, O king, from\r\nme as I speak of it, O Lord, to the reason why the Pandavas, whose\r\nachievements tire them not, are unslayable.[385] There is not, was not,\r\nwill not be, the being in all the worlds who would or will be able to\r\nvanquish the sons of Pandu who are all protected by the wielder of\r\nSaranga. Listen truly, O thou that art conversant with morality, to that\r\nancient history which was recited to me by sages of souls under control.\r\nIn days of yore, all the celestials and the Rishis, united together,\r\nwaited reverentially on the Grandsire upon the mountains of Gandhamadana.\r\nAnd the Lord of all creatures, seated at his case in their midst, beheld\r\nan excellent car stationed in the firmament, blazing with effulgence.\r\nHaving ascertained (everything about it) by meditation, joining his hands\r\nwith restrained heart, Brahman, with delighted soul, made his salutations\r\nto the highest Divine Being. And the Rishis and the celestials, beholding\r\nin the firmament (the form thus) displayed, all stood up with joined\r\nhands, their eyes fixed on that wonder of wonders. Worshipping him duly,\r\nBrahma, the foremost of all conversant with Brahman, the Creator of the\r\nuniverse, acquainted with the highest morality, uttered these high words:\r\nThou art the Glory of the Universe for thy form. Thou art the Lord of the\r\nUniverse. O thou whose protection extendeth through the whole Universe, O\r\nthou that hath the Universe for thy work, O thou that hath thy soul under\r\ncontrol, Thou art the Supreme Master of the Universe. Thou art Vasudeva.\r\nTherefore, I seek refuge in Thee that art the soul of Yoga and the\r\nhighest Divinity. Victory to Thee that art the Supreme God of the\r\nUniverse. Victory to Thee that art ever employed in the good of the\r\nworlds. Victory to Thee that art the Lord of Yoga. Thee that art\r\nall-powerful. Victory to Thee that art prior, and subsequent to Yoga.\r\nHaving the lotus springing from thy navel, and having large expansive\r\neyes, victory to Thee that art Lord of Lords of the Universe. O Lord of\r\nthe Past, the Present, and the Future, victory to Thee that art the\r\nembodiment of gentleness. Thee that art the sun of suns. O thou that art\r\nthe receptacle of untold attributes, victory to Thee that art the refuge\r\nof all things. Thou art Narayana, thou art incapable of being understood,\r\nvictory to Thee that art the wielder of the bow called Saranga. Victory\r\nto Thee that art endued with every attribute, O thou that hast the\r\nUniverse for thy form, O thou that art ever hale. O Lord of the Universe,\r\nO thou of mighty arms, victory to Thee that art always ready for\r\nbenefitting the worlds. O great Snake, O huge Boar, O first Cause, O thou\r\nof tawny locks, victory to Thee that art Almighty. O thou of yellow\r\nrobes, O Lord of the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass, O\r\nthou that hast the Universe for thy abode, O thou that art Infinite, O\r\nthou that hast no decay, O thou that art the Manifest, O thou that art\r\nthe Unmanifest, O thou that art the immeasurable Space, O thou that hast\r\nall thy senses under control, O thou that always achievest what is good,\r\nO thou that art immeasurable, O thou that alone knowest thy own nature,\r\nvictory to Thee that art deep, O thou that art the giver of all wishes, O\r\nthou that art without end, O thou that art known as Brahma, O thou that\r\nart Eternal, O thou that art the Creator of all creatures, O thou that\r\nart ever successful, O thou whose acts always display wisdom, O thou that\r\nart conversant with morality, O thou that givest victory, O thou of\r\nmysterious Self, O thou that art the Soul of all Yoga, O thou that art\r\nthe Cause of everything that hath sprung into existence, O thou that art\r\nthe knowledge of the selves of all beings, O Lord of the worlds, victory\r\nto thee that art the Creator of all beings. O thou that hath thyself for\r\nthy origin, O thou that art highly blessed, O thou that art the Destroyer\r\nof everything, O thou that art the inspirer of all mental thoughts,\r\nvictory to Thee that art dear to all conversant with Brahma. O thou that\r\nart busy in creation and destruction, O controller of all wishes, O\r\nSupreme Lord, O thou that art the Cause of Amrita, O thou that art\r\nAll-existent, O thou that art the first that appears at the end of the\r\nYuga, O thou that art the giver of victory, O Divine Lord of the Lord of\r\nall creatures, O thou that hast the lotus springing from thy navel, O\r\nthou of mighty strength, O thou that art sprung from Thyself, O thou that\r\nart the great elements in their primeval state, O thou that art the soul\r\nof all (religious) rites, victory to Thee that givest all. The goddess\r\nEarth represents thy two feet, the cardinal and the subsidiary directions\r\nthy arms, and the heavens thy head. I am thy form, the celestials\r\nconstitute thy limbs, and the Sun, the moon are thy two eyes. Ascetic\r\nausterities and Truth born of morality and (religious) rites, constitute\r\nthy strength. Fire is thy energy, the wind is thy breath, and the waters\r\nhave sprung from thy sweat. The twins Aswins constitute thy ears, and the\r\ngoddess Saraswati is thy tongue. The Vedas are thy Knowledge, and upon\r\nthee resteth this Universe. O Lord of Yoga and Yogins, we do not know thy\r\nextent, thy measure, thy energy, thy prowess, thy might, thy origin. O\r\nGod, O Vishnu, filled with devotion in thee, and depending upon thee with\r\nvows and observances, we ever worship Thee as the highest Lord, the God\r\nof gods. The Rishis, the gods, Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas,\r\nthe Pannagas, the Pisachas, human beings, beasts, birds, reptiles,--all\r\nthese were created by me on Earth through Thy grace. O thou having the\r\nlotus springing from thy navel, O thou of large expansive eyes, O\r\nKrishna, O Dispeller of all woe, Thou art the Refuge of all creatures,\r\nand Thou art their Guide. Thou hast the Universe for thy mouth. Through\r\nthy grace, O Lord of the gods, the gods are ever happy. Through thy grace\r\nthe Earth hath always been freed from terrors. Therefore, O thou of large\r\neyes, take birth in the race of Yadu.[386] For the sake of establishing\r\nrighteousness, for slaying the sons of Diti, and for upholding the\r\nUniverse, do what I have said, O Lord. O Vasudeva, that which is thy\r\nsupreme mystery, that, O Lord hath been sung by me through Thy grace.\r\nHaving created the divine Sankarshana out of thy own Self by Thyself,\r\nthou didst then, O Krishna, create Thyself as Pradyumna born of thyself.\r\nFrom Pradyumna thou didst then create Aniruddha who is known as the\r\neternal Vishnu. And it was Aniruddha who created me as Brahma, the\r\nupholder of the Universe. Created out of Vasudeva's essence I have,\r\ntherefore, been created by thee. Dividing Thyself into portions, take\r\nbirth, O Lord, among human beings. And slaughtering the Asuras there for\r\nhappiness of all the worlds, and establishing righteousness, and winning\r\nrenown, Thou wilt again truly attain to Yoga. The regenerate Rishis on\r\nEarth and the gods, O thou of infinite prowess, devoted to thee, sing of\r\nthy wonderous Self under those names that belong to thee. O thou of\r\nexcellent arms, all classes of creatures rest on thee, having taken\r\nrefuge in Thee, thou giver of boons. The regenerate ones sing Thee as the\r\nworld's bridge, having no beginning, middle and end, and as possessed of\r\nunlimited Yoga.'\""

      "content": "\"Bhishma said, 'Then that illustrious Deity, the Lord of the worlds,\r\nreplied unto Brahma in a soft deep voice, saying,--'Through Yoga, O sire,\r\nall that is wished by thee is known to me. It will be even as thou\r\nwishest,--And saying this, he disappeared then and there. Then the gods,\r\nRishis, and Gandharvas, filled with great wonder and curiosity all asked\r\nthe Grandsire, saying,--'Who is that one, O Lord, that was worshipped by\r\nthy illustrious self with such humility and praised in such high words?\r\nWe desire to hear,--Thus addressed, the illustrious Grandsire replied\r\nunto all the Gods, the regenerate Rishis, and the Gandharvas, in sweet\r\nwords saying,--He who is called TAT, He who is Supreme, He who is\r\nexistent at present and who will be for all time, He who is the highest\r\nSelf, He who is the Soul of beings, and who is the great Lord, I was\r\ntalking even with His ever-cheerful self, ye bulls among gods. The Lord\r\nof the Universe was solicited by me, for the good of the Universe, to\r\ntake his birth among mankind in the family of Vasudeva. I said unto\r\nhim,--For the slaughter of the Asuras take thy birth in the world of\r\nmen!--Those Daityas and Rakshasas, of fierce form and great strength,\r\nthat were slain in battle, have been born among men. Indeed, the\r\nillustrious and mighty Lord, taking birth in the human womb, will live on\r\nthe Earth, accompanied by Nara. Those ancient and best of Rishis, viz.,\r\nNara and Narayana, are incapable of defeat in battle by even all the\r\ncelestials united together. Of immeasurable effulgence, those Rishis\r\nviz., Nara and Narayana, when born together in the world of men, will not\r\nbe known (as such) by fools. He, from whose Self, I, Brahman, the Lord of\r\nthe whole Universe, have sprung that Vasudeva, that Supreme God of all\r\nthe worlds, is worthy of your adoration. Endued with great energy, and\r\nbearing the conch, the discus, and the mace, he should never be\r\ndisregarded as a man, ye best of deities. He is the Supreme Mystery, the\r\nSupreme refuge, the Supreme Brahma, and the Supreme glory. He is without\r\ndecay, Unmanifest, and Eternal. He it is who hath been sung as Purusha,\r\nthough none can comprehend him. The divine Artificer hath sung of him as\r\nthe Supreme Energy, the Supreme Felicity, and the Supreme Truth.\r\nTherefore, the Lord Vasudeva of immeasurable prowess should never be\r\ndisregarded as a man by all the Asuras and the gods with Indra at their\r\nhead. That person of foolish understanding is called a wretch, who, from\r\ndisregard, speaketh of Hrishikesa as only a man. People speak of him as\r\none labouring under darkness who disregardeth Vasudeva, that Yogin of\r\nillustrious soul, for his entering into a human form. People speak of him\r\nas one labouring under darkness who knoweth not that Divine personage,\r\nthat Soul of the mobile and the immobile creation, that one bearing the\r\nauspicious wheel (on his breast), that one of dazzling effulgence, that\r\none from whose navel hath sprung the (primeval) lotus. He who\r\ndisregardeth that wearer of the diadem and the Kaustuva gem, that\r\ndispeller of fears of his friends, that high-souled one, sinketh in thick\r\ndarkness. Having known all these truths duly, that Lord of the worlds,\r\nviz., Vasudeva, should be adored by every one, ye best of gods.'--\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued,--Having said these words unto those gods and Rishis\r\nin days of yore, the illustrious Grandsire, dismissing them all, repaired\r\nto his own abode. And the gods and the Gandharvas, and the Munis and the\r\nApsaras also, having listened to those words spoken by Brahman, were\r\nfilled with delight and repaired to heaven. Even this was heard by me, O\r\nsire, from Rishis of cultured soul talking in their assembly, of\r\nVasudeva, that ancient one. And O thou that art well-versed in\r\nscriptures, I heard this from Rama, the son of Jamadagni, and Markandeya\r\nof great wisdom, and Vyasa and Narada also. Having learnt all this and\r\nheard of the illustrious Vasudeva as the Eternal Lord, the Supreme God of\r\nall the worlds, and the great Master, from whom hath sprung Brahman\r\nhimself, the Father of the Universe, why should not that Vasudeva be\r\nadored and worshipped by men? Forbidden wert thou before, O sire, by\r\nsages of cultured souls, (who said unto thee)--Never go to war with that\r\nVasudeva armed with bow as also with the Pandavas,--This, from folly,\r\nthou couldst not apprehend. I regard thee therefore, as a wicked Rakshsa.\r\nThou art, besides, enveloped in darkness. It is for this that thou hatest\r\nGovinda and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, for who else among men would\r\nhate the divine Nara and Narayana? It is for this, O king, that I say\r\nunto thee that this one is Eternal and Unfading, pervading the whole\r\nUniverse, Unchanging, the Ruler, Creator and Upholder of all, and the\r\ntruly Existent. He it is who upholdeth the three worlds. He is the\r\nSupreme Lord of all mobile and immobile creatures, and He is the great\r\nMaster, He is warrior, He is Victory, He is Victor, and He is the Lord of\r\nall nature. O king, He is full of goodness and divested of all the\r\nqualities of Darkness and Passion. There, where Krishna is, there\r\nrighteousness is; and there is victory where righteousness is. It is by\r\nthe Yoga of his Supreme Excellence, and the Yoga of his Self, that the\r\nsons of Pandu, O king, are supported. Victory, therefore, will surely be\r\ntheirs. He it is that always imparteth to the Pandavas and understanding\r\nendued with righteousness, and strength in battle; and He it is that\r\nalways protecteth them from danger. He is the Eternal God, pervading all\r\nbeings, and ever blessed. He, of whom thou hadst asked me, is known by\r\nthe name of Vasudeva. He it is whom Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas\r\nand Sudras, having distinctive features of their own, humbly serve and\r\nworship with restrained hearts and performing their own duties. He it is\r\nwho, towards the close of the Dwapara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali\r\nYuga, is sung of with Sankarshana, by believers with devotion. It is that\r\nVasudeva that createth, Yuga after Yuga, the worlds of the gods and the\r\nmortals, all cities girt by the sea, and the region of human\r\nhabitation.--\""

I desire, O Grandsire, to know his origin and glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'Vasudeva is the Supreme Being. He is the God of all Gods.\r\nNone superior to him of eyes like lotus-petals is to be seen, O bull of\r\nBharata's race. Markandeya speaketh of Govinda as the Most Wonderful and\r\nthe Most high, as the All-being, as the All-soul, as the Highest soul,\r\nand as the Supreme male Being. Water, Air, and Fire,--these three were\r\ncreated by Him. That Divine Master and Lord of all the worlds created\r\nthis Earth. That Supreme Being of illustrious soul laid himself down on\r\nthe waters. And that Divine Being made up of all kinds of energy slept\r\nthereon in Yoga. From his mouth He created Fire, and from his breath, the\r\nWind. Of unfading glory, He created from his mouth Speech and the Vedas.\r\nIt was thus that he created first the Worlds and also the gods along with\r\nthe diverse classes of Rishis. And he created decay and death also of all\r\ncreatures, as well as birth and growth. He is Righteousness and of\r\nrighteous soul. He is the giver of boons and the giver of all (our)\r\nwishes. He is the Actor and Action, and He is himself the Divine\r\nMaster.[387] He first made the Past, the Present, and the Future; He is\r\nthe Creator of the Universe. He is of illustrious soul; He is the Master\r\npossessed of unfading glory. He created Sankarshana, the First-born of\r\nall creatures. He created the divine Sesha who is known as Ananta and who\r\nupholdeth all creatures and the Earth with her mountains. Of Supreme\r\nEnergy, He it is whom the regenerate ones know by Yoga meditation. Sprung\r\nfrom the secretions of his ear, the great Asura known by the name of\r\nMadhu, fierce and of fierce deeds and entertaining a fierce intent and\r\nabout to destroy Brahman, was slain by that Supreme Being. And O sire, in\r\nconsequence of Madhu's slaughter, the gods, the Danavas, and human\r\nbeings, and Rishis, call Janardana the slayer of Madhu. He is the great\r\nBoar. He is the great Lion, and He is the Three-stepped Lord.[388] He is\r\nthe Mother and the Father of all living creatures. There never was, nor\r\nwill be, any superior to Him of eyes like lotus-petals. From His mouth He\r\ncreated the Brahmanas: and from His two arms the Kshatriyas, and from His\r\nthighs, O king, He created the Vaisyas, and from His feet He created the\r\nSudras. One waiting dutifully on Him, observant of vows with ascetic\r\nausterities on days of the full-moon and the new-moon, is sure to obtain\r\nthe Divine Kesava, that refuge of all embodied creatures that essence of\r\nBrahma and of Yoga. Kesava is the higher Energy, the Grandsire of all the\r\nworlds. Him, O king, the sages call Hrishikesa (the lord of the senses).\r\nHim also should all know as the Preceptor, the Father, and the Master.\r\nInexhaustible regions (of blessedness) are won by him with whom Krishna\r\nis gratified. He also who, in a place of fear, seeketh the protection of\r\nKesava, and he who frequently readeth this description, becometh happy\r\nand endued with every prosperity. Those men who attain to Krishna are\r\nnever beguiled, Janardana always saveth those that are sunk in great\r\nterrors. Knowing this truly, O Bharata, Yudhishthira, with his whole\r\nsoul, O king, hath sought the shelter of the highly blessed Kesava, the\r\nLord of Yoga, and the Lord of the Earth.\""

This hymn was in days of old communicated by regenerate\r\nRishis and the gods (to men) on Earth-Narada described thee as the Master\r\nand the Lord of the god of gods and all the Sadhyas and the celestials,\r\nand as one acquainted with the nature of the Creator of the worlds.\r\nMarkandeya spoke of thee as the Past, the Present, and the Future, and\r\nthe sacrifice of sacrifices, and the austerity of austerities. The\r\nillustrious Bhrigu said of thee that thou art the God of the gods, that\r\nthine is the ancient form of Vishnu. Dwaipayana said of thee that thou\r\nart Vasudeva of the Vasus, the establisher of Sakra, and the God of gods\r\nand all creatures. In days of old on the occasion of procreating\r\ncreatures, the sages spoke of thee as Daksha, the Father of creation.\r\nAngiras said that thou art the creator of all beings. Devala said of thee\r\nthat the unmanifest all is thy body, and the manifest is in thy mind, and\r\nthat the gods are all the result of thy breath.[389] With thy heads is\r\npervaded the heavens, and thy two arms support the Earth. In thy stomach\r\nare three worlds and thou art the Eternal Being. Even thus do men exalted\r\nby asceticism know thee. Thou art the Sat of Sat, with Rishis gratified\r\nwith sight of Self.[390] With royal sages of liberal minds, never\r\nretreating from battle and having morality for their highest end, thou, O\r\nslayer of Madhu, art, the sole refuse. Even thus is that illustrious and\r\nSupreme Being, viz., Hari, adored and worshipped by Sanatkumar and other\r\nascetics endued with Yoga. The truth about Kesava, O sire, is now\r\nnarrated to thee, both in brief and detail. Turn thy heart in love to\r\nKesava.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Hearing this sacred story, thy son, O great king,\r\nbegan to regard highly both Kesava and these mighty car-warriors, viz.,\r\nthe sons of Pandu. Then, O monarch, Bhishma the son of Santanu once more\r\naddressed thy son, saying, 'Thou hast now heard truly, O king, about the\r\nglory of the high-souled Kesava and of Nara about which thou hadst asked\r\nme. Thou hast also heard about the object for which both Nara and\r\nNarayana have taken their births among men. Thou hast also been told the\r\nreason why those heroes are invincible and have never been vanquished in\r\nbattle, and why also, O king, the sons of Pandu are incapable of being\r\nslain in battle, by anybody. Krishna beareth great love for the\r\nillustrious sons of Pandu. It is for this, O king of kings, that I say,\r\n'Let peace be made with the Pandavas.' Restraining thy passions enjoy\r\nthou the Earth with thy mighty brothers (around thee). By disregarding\r\nthe divine Nara and Narayana, thou shalt certainly be destroyed. Having\r\nsaid these words, thy sire, became silent, O monarch, and dismissing the\r\nking, entered his tent. And the king also came back to his (own) tent,\r\nhaving worshipped the illustrious grandsire.

Beholding each\r\nother, each rushed in united ranks towards the other excited with rage\r\nand desirous of vanquishing the other. And in consequence of thy evil\r\npolicy, O king, the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras thus rushed, cased in\r\nmail and forming battle-array, for striking each other. And the array\r\nthat Bhishma protected from all sides, O king, was of the shape of a\r\nMakara.[391] And so the Pandavas also, O king, protected the array they\r\nhad formed (of their troops). Then thy sire Devavrata, O great king, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, proceeded in advance, supported by a large\r\ndivision of cars. And others, viz., car-warriors, infantry, elephants,\r\nand cavalry, all followed him, each stationed in the place allotted. And\r\nbeholding them prepared for battle, the illustrious sons of Pandu arrayed\r\ntheir troops in that invincible and prince of arrays called the\r\nSyena.[392] And in the beak of that array shone Bhimasena of great\r\nstrength. And in its two eyes were the invincible Sikhandin and\r\nDhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race. And in the head was the heroic Satyaki\r\nof prowess incapable of being baffled. And in its neck was Arjuna shaking\r\nhis Gandiva. And in its left wing was the high-souled and blessed Drupada\r\nwith his son and supported by an akshauhini of all forces. And the king\r\nof the Kekayas, owning an akshauhini, formed the right wing (of that\r\narray). And in its back were the sons of Draupadi, and Subhadra's son of\r\ngreat prowess. And in its tail was the heroic king Yudhishthira himself,\r\nof excellent prowess, supported by his twin brothers. Then in the battle\r\n(that ensued). Bhima, penetrating the Makara array (of the Kauravas)\r\nthrough its mouth, and approaching Bhishma, covered him with his shafts.\r\nThen in that great battle, Bhishma possessed of great prowess shot his\r\nmighty weapons, confounding the combatants of the Pandavas disposed in\r\nbattle-array. And when the combatants (of the Pandava army) were thus\r\nconfounded, Dhananjaya, speedily proceeding, pierced Bhishma at the van\r\nof battle with a thousand arrows. And counteracting, in that conflict,\r\nthe weapons shot by Bhishma, Arjuna stood ready for the combat, supported\r\nby his own division filled with cheerfulness.[393] Then king Duryodhana,\r\nthat foremost of mighty men, that great car-warrior, beholding that\r\nterrible carnage of his troops and remembering the slaughter of his\r\nbrothers (on the previous day), came quickly towards Bharadwaja's son,\r\nand addressing him, said, 'O preceptor, O sinless one, thou art ever my\r\nwell-wisher,--Relying on thee as also on the grandsire Bhishma,\r\nourselves, hope to vanquish without doubt the very gods in battle, let\r\nalone the sons of Pandu that are destitute of energy and prowess. Blessed\r\nbe thou, act in such away that the Pandavas may be slain. Thus addressed\r\nin battle by thy son, Drona penetrated into the Pandava array in the very\r\nsight of Satyaki. Then O Bharata, Satyaki checked the son of Bharadwaja,\r\n(and thereupon) ensued a battle that was fierce in its incidents and\r\nawful to behold. Then Bharadwaja's son excited with rage and endued with\r\ngreat prowess, as if smiling the while, pierced the grandson of Sini with\r\nten shafts at his shoulder-joint. And Bhimasena also, excited with rage,\r\npierced Bharadwaja's son (with many shafts), desirous of protecting\r\nSatyaki, O king, from Drona that foremost of all warriors. Then Drona and\r\nBhishma, and Salya also, O sire, excited with rage, covered Bhimasena, in\r\nthat battle, with their shafts. Thereupon Abhimanyu excited with wrath,\r\nand the sons of Draupadi, O sire, pierced with their sharp-pointed shafts\r\nall those warriors with upraised weapons. Then in that fierce battle, the\r\ngreat bowman Sikhandin rushed against those two mighty warriors, viz.,\r\nBhishma and Drona who, excited with rage, had (thus) fallen upon the\r\nPandavas. Firmly grasping his bow whose twang resembled the roar of the\r\nclouds, that hero, shrouding the very Sun with his arrows, quickly\r\ncovered his antagonists therewith. The grandsire of the Bharatas,\r\nhowever, getting Sikhandin before him, avoided him, remembering the\r\nfemininity of his sex. Then, O king, urged by thy son, Drona rushed to\r\nbattle, desirous of protecting Bhishma in that stress. Sikhandin,\r\nhowever, approaching Drona that foremost of all wielders of weapons,\r\navoided, from fear, that warrior resembling the blazing fire that appears\r\nat the end of the Yuga. Then, O king, thy son with a large force,\r\ndesirous of winning great glory, proceeded to protect Bhishma. And the\r\nPandavas also proceeded, O king, firmly setting their hearts upon\r\nvictory, and the battle then that took place between the combatants of\r\nboth armies desirous of victory and fame, was fierce and highly\r\nwonderful, resembling that (in days of yore) between the gods and Danavas."

And in consequence of the\r\nshrieks of huge elephants and the neigh of steeds and the blare of\r\nconches and beat of drums, the uproar was deafening. Fighting for the\r\nsake of victory, the mighty combatants endued with great prowess roared\r\nat one another like bulls in a cow-pen. And heads cut off in that battle\r\nwith keen-edged shafts, incessantly falling, created, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, the appearance of a stony shower in the welkin. Indeed, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, innumerable were the heads lying on the field of battle,\r\ndecked with ear-rings and turbans and resplendent with ornaments of gold.\r\nAnd the earth was covered with limbs cut off with broad-headed shafts,\r\nwith heads decked with ear-rings, and with arms adorned with ornaments.\r\nAnd in a moment the whole field was strewn over with bodies cased in\r\nmail, with arms decked with ornaments, with faces beautiful as the moon\r\nand having eyes with reddish corners, and with every limb, O king, of\r\nelephants, steeds and men. And the dust (raised by the warriors) looked\r\nlike a thick cloud, and the bright implements of destruction, like\r\nflashes of lightning.

And that fierce and awful passage-at-arms, O Bharata,\r\nbetween the Kurus and the Pandavas caused a very river of blood to flow\r\nthere.

And the elephants of both thy army and the enemy's,\r\nafflicted with those arrowy showers, shrieked aloud and ran hither and\r\nthither in fury. And in consequence of (the twang of) bows, endued with\r\ngreat energy, of fierce and heroic warriors excited with fury, and of\r\nflapping of their bow-strings against their leathern fences, nothing\r\ncould be distinguished.[395] And all over the field which looked like a\r\nlake of blood, headless trunks stood up, and the kings bent upon slaying\r\ntheir foes, rushed to battle. And brave warriors of immeasurable energy\r\nand possessed of arms resembling stout bludgeons, slew one another with\r\narrows and darts and maces and scimitars. And elephants, pierced with\r\narrows and deprived of riders to guide them with hooks, and steeds\r\ndestitute of riders, wildly ran in all directions. And many warriors, O\r\nbest of the Bharatas, belonging to both thy army and that of the foe,\r\ndeeply pierced with shafts jumped up and fell down. And in that encounter\r\nbetween Bhima and Bhishma, heaps of arms and heads, as also of bows and\r\nmaces and spiked clubs and hands and thighs, of legs and ornaments and\r\nbracelets, were seen lying over the field. And here and there over the\r\nfield, O king, were seen large bodies of unretreating elephants and\r\nsteeds and cars. And the Kshatriya warriors, urged on by fate, slew one\r\nanother with maces, swords, lances, and straight shafts. And others\r\nendued with great heroism and accomplished in fight, encountered one\r\nanother with their bare arms that resembled spiked clubs made of iron.\r\nAnd other heroic warriors of thy army, engaged with the combatants of the\r\nPandava host, fought on slaying one another with clenched fists and\r\nknees, and slaps and blows, O king. And with the fallen and falling\r\nwarriors and those weltering in agony on the ground, the field of battle\r\neverywhere became, O king, terrible to behold, and car-warriors, deprived\r\nof the cars and grasping excellent swords, rushed at one another,\r\ndesirous of slaughter.

Hearing the blare of Panchajanya and the twang of the\r\nbow Gandiva, and seeing also the standard of Pritha's son, a great fear\r\nentered our hearts. And the standard that we behold, O king, of the\r\nwielder of Gandiva bore the device of lion's tail and looked like a\r\nblazing mountain in the welkin. Beautiful and of celestial workmanship,\r\nit was variegated with diverse hues, and looking like a risen comet it\r\ncould not be obstructed by trees. And in that great battle, the warriors\r\nbeheld Gandiva, the back of whose staff was decked with pure gold, and\r\nwhich looked beautiful like a flash of lightning in the midst of a mass\r\nof clouds in the firmament. And while slaying the combatants of thy army,\r\nthe shouts we heard uttered by Arjuna seemed to resemble the loud roars\r\nof Indra himself, and the slaps also of his palms were frightfully loud.\r\nLike a roaring mass of clouds charged with lightning and aided by a\r\nraging tempest, Arjuna incessantly poured his arrowy showers on all\r\nsides, completely shrouding the ten points of the compass. Dhananjaya\r\nthen possessed of terrible weapons, quickly proceeded towards the son of\r\nGanga. Deprived of four senses in consequence of his weapons, we could\r\nnot then distinguish the East from the West. And thy warriors, then, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race,--their animals tired, steeds slain, and hearts\r\ndepressed,--thoroughly confounded[396] and huddling close to one another,\r\nsought Bhishma's protection along with all thy sons. And in that battle\r\nBhishma the son of Santanu became their protector. Struck with fear,\r\ncar-warriors jumping down from their cars, cavalry soldiers jumping down\r\nfrom the backs of their steeds, and the foot-soldiers where they stood,\r\nall began to fall down on the earth. Hearing the twang of Gandiva that\r\nresembled the roar of the thunder, all thy warriors were struck with fear\r\nand seemed, O Bharata, to melt away. Then, O king, with many huge and\r\nfleet steeds of the Kamvoja breed, and surrounded by many thousand of\r\nGopas with a large Gopayana force and supported by the Madras, the\r\nSauviras, the Gandharas and the Trigartas, and surrounded by all the\r\nprincipal Kalingas, the king of the Kalingas, and king Jayadratha\r\naccompanied by all the kings and supported by a large force of diverse\r\nraces with Dussasana at their head, and fourteen thousand principal\r\nhorsemen, urged by thy son, surrounded the son of Suvala (for supporting\r\nhim). Then in that battle, all the Pandavas, united together, and riding\r\non separate cars and animals, began, O bull of Bharata's race, to\r\nslaughter thy troops.[397] And the dust raised by car-warriors and steeds\r\nand foot-soldiers, looking like a mass of clouds, made the field of\r\nbattle exceedingly awful. And with a large force consisting of elephants,\r\nsteeds and cars, and armed with lances and bearded darts and broad-headed\r\nshafts, Bhishma engaged in battle with the diadem decked (Arjuna). And\r\nthe king of Avanti engaged with the ruler of Kasi, and the ruler of the\r\nSindhus engaged with Bhimasena. And king Yudhishthira with his sons and\r\ncounsellors engaged with Salya, the famous chief of the Madras. And\r\nVikarna engaged with Sahadeva, and Chitrasena with Sikhandin. And the\r\nMatsyas, O king, engaged with Duryodhana, and Sakuni; and Drupada and\r\nChekitana, and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki engaged in battle with the\r\nhigh-souled Drona aided by his son. And Kripa and Kritavarman both rushed\r\nagainst Dhrishtadyumna. And thus, all over the field, rushing bodies of\r\nhorses, of elephants and cars, engaged with one another in battle. And\r\nalthough there were no clouds in the sky, yet flashes of lightning were\r\nseen. And all the points of the compass were covered with dust. And, O\r\nking, fierce meteors were seen failing with thundering noise. And violent\r\nwinds blew and a shower of dust fell from above. And the sun, covered by\r\nthe dust raised by the troops, disappeared in the firmament. And all the\r\nwarriors, covered by that dust and battling with weapons, were deprived\r\nof their senses. And the sound made by weapons, all capable of\r\npenetrating through every armour and hurled from heroic arms, became a\r\ntremendous uproar. And, O bull of Bharata's race, weapons hurled from\r\nexcellent arms and possessed of stellar brightness, illumined the whole\r\nwelkin. And variegated shields made of bull's hides and embossed with\r\ngold were strewn, O bull of Bharata's race, all over the field. And heads\r\nand limbs were seen falling on all sides, cut off with swords and\r\nscimitars possessed of solar effulgence. And great car-warriors, the\r\nwheels, axles, and boxes of whose cars were broken, fell down on the\r\nground, their steeds slain and their tall standards tumbling down.[398]\r\nAnd many car-warriors having been slain, their steeds, mangled with\r\nweapons, fell down as they ran dragging the cars (to which they were\r\nyoked). And, in many places over the field, excellent steeds, afflicted\r\nwith arrows, with limbs mangled, and with their traces on, ran, dragging\r\nthe car-yokes after them. And many car-warriors, with their charioteers\r\nand steeds, were seen, O king, to be crushed by single elephants endued\r\nwith great strength.[399] And in that battle, in the midst of large\r\nforces, many elephants, scenting the odour of the temporal juice of their\r\ncompeers, began to snuff the breeze repeatedly. And the whole field was\r\nstrewn with slain elephants, deprived of life by means of broad-headed\r\nshafts and falling down with the wooden edifices and the guides on their\r\nbacks. And many elephants, in, the midst of large forces crushed, with\r\nthe standards and warriors on their backs, by huge compeers urged by\r\ntheir guides, fell down on the field. And many car-shafts, O king, were\r\nseen to be broken in that battle by huge elephants using their trunks,\r\neach of which resembled the trunk of the prince of elephants (called\r\nAiravata). And many car-warriors also, in that conflict, the Jalas of\r\nwhose cars had been broken, were like branches of trees dragged down by\r\ntuskers, seized by the hair of their heads and, thrashed violently on the\r\nground, were crushed into shapeless masses. And other huge elephants,\r\ndragging cars that were entangled with other cars, ran in all directions\r\nshrieking loudly. And those elephants, thus dragging those cars, looked\r\nlike others of their species dragging lotus-stalks growing in lakes.

And that encounter which we\r\nbeheld between the heroic Srinjayas and the Kurus, was fierce in the\r\nextreme and highly wonderful. And in consequence of the arrows shot all\r\naround, we could not, O king, distinguish, O chastiser of foes, the\r\nfirmament, the sun and the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the\r\ncompass. And the splendour, like that of the blue lotus, of darts with\r\npolished points, of bearded lances hurled (at the foe), of well-tempered\r\nsabres and scimitars, of variegated coats of mail and of the ornaments\r\n(on the persons of the warriors), illumined the welkin and the cardinal\r\nand the subsidiary points with its effulgence. And the field of battle in\r\nmany places, O king, shone in consequence of the bodies of monarchs whose\r\neffulgence resembled that of the moon and the sun. And brave\r\ncar-warriors, tigers among men shone in that battle, O king, like the\r\nplanets in the firmament. And Bhishma, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nexcited with rage, checked the mighty Bhimasena in the very sight of the\r\ntroops. And the impetuous shafts shot by Bhishma, furnished with golden\r\nwings, and whetted on stone, and rubbed with oil pierced Bhima in that\r\nbattle. Then Bhimasena endued with great strength hurled at him, O\r\nBharata, a dart of fierce impetuosity that resembled a wrathful snake.\r\nBut Bhishma in that combat cut off with straight shafts that dart with\r\nstaff made of gold and difficult of being borne, as it coursed\r\nimpetuously towards him. And with another broad-headed shaft, sharp and\r\nwell-tempered, he cut off Bhimasena's bow, O Bharata, into two parts.\r\nThen, O king, in that battle, Satyaki, coming quickly towards Bhishma,\r\npierced thy sire with innumerable keen-edged and sharp-pointed shafts of\r\nfierce impetuosity shot from his bowstring drawn to the ear. Then\r\nBhishma, aiming an exceedingly fierce shaft, felled the charioteer of the\r\nVrishni hero from his box in the car. And when the charioteer of\r\nSatyaki's car was thus slain, his steeds, O king, bolted away. Endued\r\nwith the speed of the tempest or the mind, they ran wild over the field.\r\nThen cries were uttered by the whole army which became a loud uproar. And\r\nexclamation of oh and alas arose from the high-souled warriors of the\r\nPandava army. And those cries-said--Run, seize, check the horses, go in\r\nhaste. And this uproar followed Yuyudhana's car. Meanwhile, Bhishma the\r\nson of Santanu began to slay the Pandava forces like Indra slaying the\r\nDanavas. But the Panchalas and the Somakas, though slain by Bhishma thus,\r\nforming yet a laudable resolution, rushed towards Bhishma. And other\r\nwarriors of the Pandava army, headed by Dhrishtadyumna, and desirous of\r\nslaughtering the ranks of thy son, rushed towards Santanu's son in that\r\nbattle. And so also, O king, the warriors of thy army, headed by Bhishma\r\nand Drona, impetuously rushed towards their foes. And thereupon another\r\nbattle took place.\""

And that great car-warrior pierced his\r\n(antagonist's) steeds also with three shafts furnished with golden wings.\r\nAnd that terrible bowman and mighty car-warrior of firm hand, viz.,\r\nDrona's son, pierced with six shafts the wielder of Gandiva between his\r\ntwo breasts. Thereupon that grinder of foes, viz., Phalguni, that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, cut off Aswatthaman's bow and deeply pierced him in\r\nreturn with five shafts. Deprived of his senses by anger, and unable to\r\nbear the cutting off of his bow in that battle, Drona's son, taking up\r\nanother bow that was tougher, pierced Phalguni, O king, with ninety\r\nsharp-shafts, and Vasudeva also with seventy fierce arrows. Then, with\r\neyes red in wrath, Phalguni, with Krishna, breathing long and hot\r\nbreaths, reflected for a moment. Firmly grasping the bow with his left\r\nhand, that grinder of foes, viz., the wielder of gandiva excited with\r\nrage, fixed on his bowstring a number of fierce shafts, sharp and\r\nperfectly straight, and capable of taking (the foe's) life. And that\r\nforemost of mighty men speedily pierced Drona's son, in that battle, with\r\nthose arrows. And those arrows, penetrating through his armour, drank his\r\nlife-blood. But though thus pierced by the wielder of Gandiva, Drona's\r\nson wavered not. Shooting in return similar arrows at Partha, he stayed\r\nunperturbed, in that battle, desirous, O king, of protecting Bhishma of\r\nhigh vows. And that feat of his was applauded by the foremost warriors of\r\nthe Kuru army, consisting, as it did, of his having encountered the two\r\nKrishnas united together. Indeed, Aswatthaman daily battled fearlessly\r\namid the forces, having obtained from Drona all weapons with the methods\r\nalso of their withdrawal. This one is the son of my preceptor. He is\r\nagain the dear son of Drona. He is especially a Brahmana, and, therefore,\r\nworthy of my regard. Thinking so, that scorcher of foes, the heroic\r\nVibhatsu, that foremost of car-warriors, showed mercy to the son of\r\nBharadwaja. Avoiding the son of Drona, Kunti's son endued with great\r\nprowess and having white steeds (yoked unto his car), began to fight,\r\ndisplaying great quickness of arms and causing a great carnage of thy\r\ntroops. Duryodhana then pierced that great bowman Bhima with ten shafts\r\nwinged with vulturine feathers, adorned with gold, and whetted on stone.\r\nThereupon Bhimasena, excited with wrath, took up a tough and well-adorned\r\nbow capable of taking the life of the foe, and also ten sharp shafts. And\r\nsteadily aiming those sharp-pointed shafts of fierce energy and impetuous\r\nvelocity, and drawing the bow-string to his ear, he deeply pierced the\r\nking of the Kurus in his wide chest. Thereupon the gem hanging on his\r\nbreast on threads of gold, surrounded by those shafts, looked beautiful\r\nlike the Sun in the firmament surrounded by the planets. Thy son,\r\nhowever, endued with great energy, thus struck by Bhimasena, could not\r\nbear it (coolly), like a snake unable to bear the sounds of a man's slap.\r\nExcited with wrath and desirous of protecting his army, he then pierced\r\nBhima in return, O king, with many shafts whetted on stone and endued\r\nwith golden wings. Thus struggling in battle and mangling each other\r\nfiercely, those two mighty sons of thine looked like a pair of celestials.\r\n\r\n\"That tiger among men and slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of\r\nSubhadra, pierced Chitrasena with many sharp shafts and Purumitra also\r\nwith seven shafts. And piercing Satyavrata too with seventy shafts, that\r\nhero resembling Indra himself in battle, began as it were to dance on the\r\nfield, and caused us much pain. Chitrasena then pierced him in return\r\nwith ten shafts, and Satyavrata with nine, and Purumitra with seven. Then\r\nthe son of Arjuna, thus pierced, while yet covered with blood, cut off\r\nthe large and beautiful bow of Chitrasena that was capable of checking\r\nfoes. And cutting through his coat of mail he pierced his antagonist's\r\nbreast with a shaft. Then the princes of thy army, all heroic and mighty\r\ncar-warriors, excited with wrath and united together in that conflict,\r\npierced him with sharp arrows. And Abhimanyu, acquainted with the\r\nmightiest weapons, smote them all with keen shafts. Beholding that feat\r\nof his, thy sons then surrounded the son of Arjuna, who was consuming thy\r\narmy in that conflict like a swelling fire of blazing flames consuming a\r\nheap of dry grass in summer. And the son of Subhadra, while smiting thy\r\ntroops (thus), seemed to glow in splendour. Seeing that conduct of his,\r\nthy grandson Lakshmana then, O monarch, quickly fell upon the son of\r\nSubhadra. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu, excited with\r\nwrath, pierced Lakshmana graced with auspicious marks, as also his\r\ncharioteer, with six sharp arrows. But Lakshmana also, O king, pierced\r\nSubhadra's son with many keen shafts. And that feat, O king, seemed to be\r\nhighly wonderful. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., Abhimanyu, slaying\r\nthe four steeds as also the charioteer of Lakshmana with sharp shafts,\r\nrushed towards the latter. Thereupon Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes, staying on that car of his whose steeds had been slain, and\r\nexcited with wrath, hurled a dart towards the car of Subhadra's son.\r\nAbhimanyu, however, with his sharp arrows, cut off that irresistible dart\r\nof fierce mien, resembling a snake, and coming impetuously towards him.\r\nThen Kripa, taking Lakshmana up on his own car, bore him away from the\r\nconflict, in the very sight of all the troops. Then when that awful\r\nconflict became general, the combatants rushed against one another,\r\ndesirous of taking another's life. And the mighty bowmen of thy army and\r\nthe great car-warriors of the Pandava host, prepared to lay down their\r\nlives in battle, slew one another. With hair dishevelled, divested of\r\ntheir coats of mail, deprived of their cars, and their bows broken, the\r\nSrinjayas fought with the Kurus with their bare arms. Then the\r\nmighty-armed Bhishma, endued with great strength, and excited with wrath,\r\nslew with his celestial weapons the troops of the high-souled Pandavas.\r\nAnd the earth became covered with the fallen bodies of elephants deprived\r\nof their guides of men and steeds and car-warriors and cavalry-soldiers.\""

And while slaying his\r\nfoes in battle, so quickly did he draw the bow, take out his arrows, fix\r\nthem on the bowstring, and letting them off throw them among the foe,\r\nthat he then seemed to be a mass of clouds pouring a thick shower of\r\nrain. Beholding him then thus blazing up (like a swelling fire), king\r\nDuryodhana, O Bharata, despatched ten thousand cars against him. But that\r\ngreat bowman, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled and\r\npossessed of great energy, slew with his celestial weapons all those\r\nmighty car-warriors. Having achieved, bow in hand, that fierce feat, that\r\nhero then approached Bhurisravas in battle. And Bhurisravas also, that\r\nenhancer of the fame of the Kurus, beholding the Dhartarashtra ranks thus\r\nfelled by Yuyudhana, rushed in wrath against the latter.[400] Drawing his\r\ngreat bow which resembled that of Indra himself in hue, he shot thousands\r\nof shafts, O monarch, looking like snakes of virulent poison and\r\npossessed of the strength of the thunder, displaying his extreme\r\nlightness of hand. Thereupon the combatants that followed Satyaki, unable\r\nto bear those shafts of fatal touch, fled away, O king, in all\r\ndirections, abandoning, O monarch, the invincible Satyaki in that\r\nconflict. Beholding this, the mighty sons of Yuyudhana, all mighty\r\ncar-warriors of great renown, cased in excellent mail, bearing diverse\r\narms, and possessing excellent standards, approaching that great bowman,\r\nviz., Bhurisravas, in battle, wrathfully addressed that warrior bearing\r\non his standard the device of a sacrificial stake, and said these words,\r\n'Listen, O kinsman of the Kauravas, O thou that art possessed of great\r\nstrength, come, fight in battle with us, i.e., with either all of us\r\njointly or with each of us separately. Vanquishing us in battle thou\r\nmayst win great renown, or ourselves, vanquishing thee, will have great\r\ngratification.' Thus addressed by them, that mighty hero endued with\r\ngreat strength and proud of his prowess, that foremost of men, beholding\r\nthem before him, replied unto them, saying, 'Ye heroes, ye have said\r\nwell. If such be now your wish, fight ye then all together with care. I\r\nshall slay all of you in battle.' Thus addressed by him, those heroic and\r\nmighty bowmen endued with great activity covered that chastiser of foes\r\nwith a thick shower of arrows. And it was towards the afternoon, O king,\r\nthat that dreadful battle took place between Bhurisravas alone on one\r\nside and the many united together on the other. And those ten heroes\r\ncovered that single mighty car-warrior with showers of arrows like the\r\nclouds showering rain on a mountain cliff in the season of rains. That\r\nmighty car-warrior, however, cut off, those clouds of shafts shot by them\r\nresembling the fatal darts of Death or the very thunder in effulgence,\r\nbefore they could reach him.[401] They then, surrounding that\r\nmighty-armed warrior, endeavoured to slay him. But the son of Somadatta,\r\nexcited with rage, cut off their bows, O Bharata, and then their heads,\r\nwith sharp shafts. Thus slain, they fell down, O monarch, like mighty\r\ntrees felled by the thunder.[402] Beholding then his mighty sons thus\r\nslain in battle, the Vrishni hero (Satyaki), O king, uttering a loud\r\nroar, rushed against Bhurisravas. And those mighty warriors then each\r\npressed his car against the other. And each of them in that combat slew\r\nthe other's car-steeds. And both deprived of their cars, those mighty\r\nwarriors jumped down on the ground. And both taking up large scimitars\r\nand excellent shields encountered each other. And those tigers among men,\r\nstationed for the encounter, shone brightly. Then Bhimasena, O king,\r\nquickly coming up to Satyaki thus armed with an excellent scimitar, took\r\nhim up on his own car. And thy son also, O monarch, speedily took up\r\nBhurisravas on his car, in that battle, at the very sight of all the\r\nbowmen.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, during the continuance of that battle, the Pandavas, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race, excited with wrath, fought with that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Bhishma. And when the sun assumed a red hue, Dhananjaya\r\nexerting himself actively, slew five and twenty thousand great\r\ncar-warriors. These, urged on by Duryodhana for slaying Partha, were thus\r\ncompletely destroyed before they could even come up to him, like insects\r\non a blazing fire. Then the Matsyas and the Kekayas, all accomplished in\r\nthe science of arms, surrounded that mighty car-warrior Partha as also\r\nhis son (for supporting them). Just at that time the sun disappeared, and\r\nall the combatants seemed to be deprived of their senses. Then at\r\ntwilight, O king, thy sire Devavrata, his animals having been tired,\r\ncaused the troops to be withdrawn. And the troops of both the Pandavas\r\nand the Kurus, filled with fear and anxiety in course of that dreadful\r\nencounter, proceeded to their respective camps, the Pandavas with the\r\nSrinjayas and the Kauravas also rested for the night agreeably to the\r\nrules (of military science).\""

Thus addressed\r\nby Pritha's son, that mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, that foremost of\r\ncombatants on cars, issued the order, O great king, to the car-warriors,\r\n(for forming the Makara array). Drupada, and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu,\r\nformed the head of that array, and Sahadeva and that mighty car-warrior\r\nNakula formed its two eyes. And the mighty Bhimasena formed its beak. And\r\nSubhadra's son, and the sons of Draupadi and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha,\r\nand Satyaki, and king Yudhishthira the just, were stationed in its neck.\r\nAnd king Virata that commander of a large division, formed its back,\r\nsupported by Dhrishtadyumna and a large force.

And its two feet, O monarch, were\r\nconstituted by that mighty car-warrior the blessed Kuntibhoja, and\r\nSatanika, supported by a large force. And that great bowman, the mighty\r\nSikhandin, surrounded by the Somakas, and Iravat, were stationed in the\r\ntail of that Makara array. And having, O Bharata, formed their great\r\narray, the Pandavas, O monarch, equipped in mail at dawn, again stood for\r\nbattle.

And that foremost, of all bowmen,\r\nviz., Kritavarman, united with the ruler of the Kamvojas and with the\r\nValhikas was stationed, O king, in its head. And in its neck. O Bharata,\r\nwere Surasena, and thy son Duryodhana, O king, surrounded by many kings.\r\nAnd the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, united with the Madras, the Sauviras,\r\nand the Kekayas, and surrounded by a large force, was stationed, O king,\r\nin its breasts. And Susarman the king of Prasthala, accompanied by his\r\nown troops, stood, accoutred in mail, in the left wing.

The\r\nsun, O Bharata, had risen when the battle commenced. And elephants\r\nproceeded against elephants. And horsemen rushed against horsemen,\r\ncar-warriors against car-warriors, O king, and against elephants also, in\r\nthat dreadful conflict. And car-men rushed against riders of elephants,\r\nand riders of elephants against horsemen. And car-warriors engaged with\r\nfoot-soldiers, and cavalry with infantry.

Thereupon the son of\r\nBharadwaja, endued with great prowess, himself restraining his steeds,\r\nbegan to consume the Pandava army like fire consuming a heap of cotton.\r\nAnd while thus slaughtered, O king, by Drona and Bhishma, the Srinjayas\r\nalong with the Kekayas took to flight.

It is again\r\narrayed according to the rules of science and, therefore, ought to be\r\nirresistible. It is attached to us exceedingly, and always devoted to us.\r\nIt is submissive, and free from the faults of drunkenness and\r\nlicentiousness. Its prowess had before been tested. The soldiers are\r\nneither very old nor very young. They are neither lean nor corpulent. Of\r\nactive habits, of well-developed and strong frames, they are free from\r\ndisease. They are cased in mail and well-equipped with arms. They are\r\nexercised in every kind of weapons. They are skilled in encounters with\r\nswords, with bare arms, and with maces. They are well-exercised in\r\nlances, sabres, and darts, as also in iron clubs, short arrows, javelins\r\nand mallets. They are devoted to all kinds of armed exercises, and are\r\nadepts in mounting upon and descending from the backs of elephants, in\r\nmoving forward and stepping back, in smiting effectually, in marching and\r\nretreating. Many a time have they been tested in the management of\r\nelephants and steeds and cars. Having been examined duly they have been\r\nentertained on pay, and not for the sake of lineage, nor from favour nor\r\nfrom relationship, nor from strength of attachments, nor from connections\r\nof birth and blood. They are all respectable and honest, and their\r\nkinsmen have been well-treated and gratified by us. We have done them\r\nmany good offices. They are, besides, all renowned men and endued with\r\ngreat mental vigour. O son, they are again protected by many foremost of\r\nmen endued with great activity, and of famous achievements, resembling\r\nthe very Regents of the world and renowned over the whole earth.\r\nInnumerable Kshatriyas, respected throughout the world, and who have of\r\ntheir own will sided us with their forces and followers also protect\r\nthem. Indeed, our army is like the vast ocean filled with the water of\r\ninnumerable rivers running from all directions. It abounds with\r\nelephants, and with cars which though destitute of wings, yet resemble\r\nthe winged tenants of the air. Vast numbers of combatants constitute the\r\nwaters of that ocean, and the steeds and other animals constitute its\r\nterrible waves. Innumerable swords and maces and darts and arrows and\r\nlances constitute the oars (piled on that ocean). Abounding with\r\nstandards and ornaments and adorned with cloth inlaid with gold and gems,\r\nthe rushing steeds and elephants constitute the winds agitating it into\r\nfury. Our host, therefore, really resembles the vast, shoreless ocean\r\nroaring in rage. And that host is protected by Drona and Bhishma and by\r\nKritavarman and Kripa and Dussasana, and others headed by Jayadratha. It\r\nis also protected by Bhagadatta and Vikarna by Drona's son, and Suvala's\r\nson, and Valhika and by many other mighty and high-souled heroes of the\r\nworld. That our army should yet be slaughtered in battle is due only to\r\npredestined fate, O Sanjaya. Neither men nor highly blessed Rishis of old\r\never beheld such preparations (for battle) on earth before. That so large\r\nan army, mustered according to science, and attached (to us) by wealth,\r\nshould yet be slaughtered in battle, alas, what can it be but the result\r\nof Destiny?

Therefore, O monarch, though overtaken by this calamity, be\r\ncalm still, and listen, O sire, to the (account of the) battle as I\r\nrecite it.\r\n\r\n\"The heroic Bhimasena, having with his sharp shafts broken thy mighty\r\narray, then came upon all the younger brothers of Duryodhana.

Then, beholding him in their midst, all those warriors\r\nsaid, 'Ye kings, let us take this one's life'!--Thereupon that son of\r\nPritha was surrounded by those cousins of his who were firmly resolved\r\n(to take his life). And Bhima then resembled Surya himself of fierce\r\nsplendour surrounded by the mighty planets of evil nature, at the time of\r\nthe universal destruction.

Then thousands of\r\ncar-warriors armed with all weapons and fully prepared for battle\r\noverwhelmed his single self with terrible shafts. Thereupon the heroic\r\nBhima, disregarding the sons of Dhritarashtra, slew in that conflict many\r\nforemost warriors (of the Kaurava army) fighting from cars or upon the\r\nback of elephants and steeds. And ascertaining the purpose harboured by\r\nthose cousins of his who were bent upon his destruction, the mighty Bhima\r\nset his heart upon slaying them all. Then leaving his car and taking up\r\nhis mace, the son of Pandu began to smite that very sea of Dhartarashtra\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n\"Then when Bhimasena thus penetrated the Dhartarashtra host,\r\nDhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata, forsaking Drona (with whom he had\r\nbeen engaged), quickly proceeded to the spot where Suvala's son was\r\nstationed. That bull among men, baffling countless warriors of thy army,\r\ncame upon the empty car of Bhimasena in that battle. And beholding in\r\nthat conflict Visoka, the charioteer of Bhimasena, Dhrishtadyumna, O\r\nking, became exceedingly cheerless and almost deprived of his senses.\r\nWith voice choked in tears, and sighing as he spoke, he asked Visoka, in\r\ngrief, saying, 'Where is Bhima who is dear to me as my life itself?'\r\nVisoka then, joining his hands, replied unto Dhrishtadyumna saying, 'The\r\nmighty son of Pandu, endued with great strength, ordering me to wait for\r\nhim here, hath alone penetrated into the Dhartarashtra host that\r\nresembleth the very ocean. That tiger among men very cheerfully said unto\r\nme these words--'Wait for me, O charioteer, restraining the steeds for a\r\nshort space of time, that is, till I slay those that are bent upon my\r\ndestruction.--Beholding then the mighty Bhima rushing mace in hand, all\r\nour troops (that supported him) became filled with delight. Then in this\r\nfierce and terrible battle, O prince, thy friend, breaking the mighty\r\narray (of the foe), hath penetrated into it. Hearing these words of\r\nVisoka, Prishata's son Dhrishtadyumna, endued with great strength, said\r\nunto the charioteer these words on the field of battle. 'What need have I\r\ntoday of life itself, if forgetting my affection for the Pandavas, I\r\nforsake Bhima in battle? If I return today without Bhima, what will the\r\nKshatriyas say of me? What will they say of me when they will learn that\r\nwhile I was on the field Bhima penetrated alone into the hostile array\r\nmaking a single opening in it? The gods with Indra at their head visit\r\nhim with evil who, forsaking his comrades in battle, returneth home\r\nunhurt! The mighty Bhima again is my friend and kinsman. He is devoted to\r\nme, and I also am devoted to that slayer of foes. Therefore, I will go\r\nthither, whither Bhima hath gone. Behold me slaying the foe like Vasava\r\nslaying the Danavas.' Having said this, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, O\r\nBharata, proceeded through the midst of the foe, along the tracks opened\r\nby Bhimasena and marked by elephants crushed with his mace. He then\r\nobtained sight of Bhimasena consuming the hostile ranks or felling\r\nKshatriya warriors like the tempest devastating rows of trees. And\r\ncar-warriors and horsemen and foot-soldiers and tuskers, while thus\r\nslaughtered by him, uttered loud cries of woe. And cries of ah and alas\r\narose from thy troops, O sire, while they were slaughtered by the\r\nvictorious Bhima accomplished in all moods of warfare. Then the Kaurava\r\nwarriors all accomplished in arms, surrounding Vrikodara on all sides,\r\nfearlessly poured upon him their arrowy showers at the same time. Then\r\nthe mighty son of Prishata, beholding that foremost of all wielders of\r\nweapons, that celebrated hero, viz., the son of Pandu, thus attacked on\r\nall sides by fierce ranks of foes in close array, mangled with shafts,\r\ntreading the field on foot, and vomiting the poison of his wrath, mace in\r\nhand and looking like the Destroyer himself at the hour of the universal\r\ndissolution, quickly approached him and comforted him by his presence.\r\nAnd taking him upon his car, and plucking the arrows off from all his\r\nlimbs, and embracing him warmly, the high-souled son of Prishata\r\ncomforted Bhimasena in the very midst of the foe. Then thy son, in that\r\nterrible conflict, quickly coming up to his brothers, said unto them,\r\n'This son of Drupada of wicked soul, is now united with Bhimasena. Let us\r\nall approach him together for slaying him. Let not the foe seek our ranks\r\n(for battle).' Hearing these words, the Dhartarashtras, thus urged on by\r\nthe command of their eldest brother and unable to put up (with the foe),\r\nquickly rushed, with upraised weapons, for slaying Dhrishtadyumna like\r\nfierce comets at the hour of the universal dissolution. Taking up their\r\nbeautiful bows, those heroes, making the very earth shiver with the twang\r\nof their bowstring and the rattle of their car-wheels, showered shafts on\r\nDrupada's son, like the clouds covering the mountain-breast with torrents\r\nof rain. But that hero conversant with all modes of warfare, though thus\r\nstruck with sharp arrows in that battle, did not waver. On the other\r\nhand, that mighty car-warrior, the youthful son of Drupada, beholding\r\nthose heroic sons of thine staying before him in battle and exerting\r\nthemselves to their utmost being desirous of slaying them applied that\r\nfierce weapon called Pramohana and engaged with thy sons, O king, like\r\nIndra with the Danavas in battle. Then those heroic warriors were\r\ndeprived of their senses, their minds and strength afflicted by the\r\nPramohana weapon. And the Kauravas fled away in all directions, with\r\ntheir steeds and elephants and cars, beholding those sons of thine\r\ndeprived of their senses in a swoon like those whose hours had come. And\r\nat that time Drona, the foremost of all wielders of weapons, approaching\r\nDrupada, pierced him with three fierce shafts. And that monarch then, O\r\nking, viz., Drupada, deeply pierced by Drona, left the battle, O Bharata,\r\nremembering his former hostility (with Bharadwaja's son). Thereupon Drona\r\nendued with great prowess having thus vanquished Drupada, blew his conch.\r\nAnd hearing the blare of his conch, all the Somakas were struck with\r\nfear. Then Drona, possessed of great energy, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons, heard of thy sons being deprived of their senses in\r\nbattle with the Pramohana weapon. Then the son of Bharadwaja, desirous of\r\nrescuing the princes, speedily left that part of the field where he was\r\nand proceeded to the place where thy sons were. And that mighty bowman\r\nviz., Bharadwaja's son of great prowess, there beheld Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nBhima careering through the field in that dreadful conflict. And that\r\nmighty car-warrior beheld thy sons deprived of their senses. Taking up\r\nthen the weapon called Prajna, he neutralised the Pramohana weapon (that\r\nDhrishtadyumna had shot). Then thy sons those mighty car-warriors, when\r\ntheir senses returned, once more proceeded to battle with Bhima and\r\nPrishata's son. Then Yudhishthira, addressing his own troops said, 'Let\r\ntwelve brave car-warriors cased in mail and headed by Subhadra's son,\r\nfollow, to the utmost of their might, the track of Bhima and Prishata's\r\nson in battle. Let intelligence be had (of those two warriors). My heart\r\nis very uneasy.' Thus ordered by the king, those heroes possessed of\r\ngreat prowess in battle and proud of their manliness, saying 'Yes,' all\r\nproceeded forward when the sun had reached the meridian. And those\r\nchastisers of foes then, viz., the Kaikeyas and the sons of Draupadi, and\r\nDhrishtaketu of great prowess, supported by a large force and with\r\nAbhimanyu at their head, and disposing themselves in the array called\r\nSuchimukha,[405] penetrated into that car-division of the Dhartarashtras\r\nin battle. And thy troops, O king, struck with the fear of Bhimasena and\r\ndeprived of their senses by Dhrishtadyumna, were unable to resist (the\r\nrush of) those mighty bowmen headed by Abhimanyu. And they were quite\r\nhelpless, like a lady in the streets. And those mighty bowmen with\r\nstandards variegated with gold cutting through (the Kaurava ranks),\r\nproceeded with great speed for rescuing Dhrishtadyumna and Vrikodara. And\r\nthe latter, beholding those mighty bowmen headed by Abhimanyu, became\r\nfilled with delight and continued to smite down thy ranks. And the heroic\r\nprince of Panchala, viz., the son of Prishata, seeing meanwhile his\r\npreceptor advancing towards him with great speed, no longer wished to\r\ncompass the death of thy sons. Causing Vrikodara then to be taken up on\r\nthe car of the king of the Kaikeyas, he rushed in great wrath against\r\nDrona accomplished in arrow and all weapons. And that slayer of foes,\r\nviz., the valiant son of Bharadwaja, excited with rage, cut off with a\r\nbroad-headed shaft the bow of Prishata's son who was rushing towards him\r\nwith impetuosity. And remembering the bread he had eaten of his master\r\nand desirous of doing good to Duryodhana, he also sped hundreds of shafts\r\nafter Prishata's son. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son\r\nof Prishata, taking up another bow, pierced Drona with seventy shafts\r\nwhetted on stone and furnished with wings of gold. Then that grinder of\r\nfoes, viz., Drona, once more cut off his bow, and despatched his four\r\nsteeds to Yama's abode with four excellent arrows, and also slew his\r\ncharioteer, O Bharata, with a broad-headed shaft. Then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior of strong arms, viz., Dhrishtadyumna, quickly descending from\r\nthat car whose steeds had been slain, ascended the great car of\r\nAbhimanyu. Then Drona caused the Pandava army consisting of cars,\r\nelephants, and steeds, to tremble, in the very sight of Bhimasena and the\r\nintelligent son of Prishata. Beholding then that army thus broken by\r\nDrona of immeasurable energy, all those mighty car-warriors were\r\nincapable of checking its flight. And that army, thus slaughtered by\r\nDrona with his sharp shafts, began to move in eddies there, like the\r\nagitated sea. And beholding the (Pandava) army in that condition, thy\r\ntroops were filled with delight. And seeing the preceptor excited with\r\nrage and thus consuming the ranks of the foe, all thy warriors, O\r\nBharata, set up loud shouts and uttered exclamations in praise of Drona.\""

And Bhimasena also of mighty arms during that battle,\r\nhaving got his car, ascended it and proceeded to the spot where thy sons\r\nwere.

And on that afternoon, O king, a dreadful conflict took\r\nplace between the mighty combatants of thy army and those of the foe, O\r\nBharata.

Then\r\nthat mighty car-warrior, Vikarna, abandoning that car whose steeds had\r\nbeen slain, mounted on the resplendent car, O king, of Chitrasena. Then\r\nthus stationed on the same car, viz., those two brothers of Kuru's race,\r\nthe son of Arjuna covered, O Bharata, with showers of arrows. Then\r\nDurjaya and Vikarna pierced Abhimanyu with five shafts made wholly of\r\niron. Abhimanyu however, shook not in the least but stood firm like the\r\nmountain Meru. Dussasana in that battle, O sire, fought with the five\r\nKekaya brothers. All these, O great king, seemed exceedingly wonderful.\r\nThe sons of Draupadi, excited with rage, resisted Duryodhana in that\r\nbattle. And each of them, O king, pierced thy son with three shafts.

I\r\nwill slay thee to-day if thou dost not abandon the battle. Slaying thee I\r\nshall today dispel the sorrows of Kunti as also of Draupadi and the woes\r\nthat were ours during our exile in the woods. Filled with pride, thou\r\nhadst formerly humiliated the sons of Pandu. Behold, O son of Gandhari,\r\nthe dire fruit of that sinful behaviour. Following the counsels of Karna\r\nas also of Suvala's son, and recking the Pandavas little, thou hadst\r\nformerly behaved towards them as thou hadst hinted. Thou hadst also\r\ndisregarded Krishna who begged thee (for peace). With a joyous heart\r\ndidst thou despatch Uluka (to us) with thy messages. For all these, I\r\nshall slay thee to-day with all thy kinsmen, and thus avenge all those\r\noffences of thine of former days.' Having said these words, Bhima bending\r\nhis bow and stretching it repeatedly, and taking up a number of terrible\r\nshafts whose effulgence resembled that of the lightning itself, and\r\nfilled with wrath, quickly sped six and thirty of them at Duryodhana. And\r\nthose shafts resembled the flames of a blazing fire, and coursed straight\r\nwith the force of the thunder-bolt. And then he pierced Duryodhana's bow\r\nwith two shafts, and his charioteer with two. And with four shafts he\r\ndespatched Duryodhana's (four) steeds to the regions of Yama. And that\r\ngrinder of foes then, with two shafts shot with great force, cut off in\r\nthat battle the king's umbrella from his excellent car. And with three\r\nother shafts he cut off his handsome and blazing standard. And having cut\r\nit off, he uttered a loud shout in the very sight of thy son. And that\r\nbeautiful standard of the latter, decked with diverse gems, suddenly fell\r\ndown on the earth from his car like a flash of lightning from the clouds.\r\nAnd all the kings beheld that beautiful standard of the Kuru king,\r\nbearing the device of an elephant, decked with gems, and blazing like the\r\nsun, fell down cut off (by Bhimasena). And that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nBhima, then pierced Duryodhana in that battle, smiling the while, with\r\nten shafts like a guide piercing a mighty elephant with the hook. Then\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, viz., the mighty king of the Sindhus,\r\nsupported by many brave warriors, placed himself on the flank of\r\nDuryodhana. And then that great car-warrior, viz., Kripa, O king, caused\r\nthe vindictive Duryodhana, that son of Kuru's race, of immeasurable\r\nenergy, to mount on his own car. Then king Duryodhana, deeply pierced by\r\nBhimasena and feeling great pain, sat down on the terrace of that car.\r\nThen Jayadratha, desirous of slaying Bhima, surrounded him on all sides\r\nwith several thousands of cars. Then, O king, Dhrishtaketu and Abhimanyu\r\nof great energy, and the Kekayas, and the sons of Draupadi, all\r\nencountered thy sons. And the high-souled Abhimanyu smote them all,\r\npiercing each with five straight shafts, resembling the bolts of heaven\r\nor Death's selves, shot from his excellent bow. Thereupon, all of them,\r\nunable to bear it (coolly), showered on that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nviz., the son of Subhadra, a perfect down-pour of sharp shafts like\r\nrain-charged clouds pouring rain on the breast of the mountains of Meru.\r\nBut Abhimanyu, that invisible warrior accomplished in arms, thus\r\nafflicted by them in battle, caused all thy sons, O king, to tremble like\r\nthe wielder of the thunder-bolt causing the mighty Asuras to tremble in\r\nthe battle between the celestials and the latter. Then that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, O Bharata, shot fourteen broad-headed shafts, fierce and\r\nlooking like snakes of virulent poison, at Vikarna. Endued with great\r\nprowess and as if dancing in that battle, he felled with those shafts the\r\nstandard of Vikarna from his car and slew also his charioteer and steeds.\r\nThen that mighty car-warrior, the son of Subhadra, again sped at Vikarna\r\nmany other arrows that were well-tempered, straight-going, and capable of\r\npenetrating every armour. And those arrows furnished with feathers of the\r\nkanka bird, coming at Vikarna and passing through his body, entered the\r\nearth, like hissing snakes. And those arrows, with wings and points\r\ndecked with gold, bathed in Vikarna's blood, seemed to vomit blood on the\r\nearth. Beholding Vikarna thus pierced, his other uterine brothers rushed,\r\nin that battle, against those car-warriors headed by Subhadra's son. And\r\nwhen these invincible warriors upon their (own) cars came upon those\r\ncombatants (of the Pandava army) resplendent like so many suns and\r\nstaying on their cars both began to pierce one another.. And Durmukha,\r\nhaving pierced Srutakarman with five shafts, cut off the latter's\r\nstandard with a single shaft and then pierced his charioteer with seven.\r\nAnd advancing closer, he slew with half a dozen shafts his foe's steeds,\r\nfleet as the wind and cased in golden armour, and then felled his\r\ncharioteer. Srutakarman, however, staying on that car of his, the steeds\r\nof which had been slain, hurled in great wrath a dart blazing like a\r\nfierce meteor. That dart, blazing with effulgence, passing through the\r\nrenowned Durmukha's hard coat of mail, penetrated into the earth.\r\nMeanwhile the mighty Sutasoma beholding Srutakarman deprived of his car,\r\ncaused him to mount upon his own car in the very sight of all the troops.\r\nThe heroic Srutakirti rushed against thy son Jayatsena in that battle,\r\ndesirous, O king, of slaying that renowned warrior. Then thy son\r\nJayatsena, O king, with a sharp arrow having a horse-shoe head, smiling\r\nthe while, cut off the bow of the high-souled Srutakirti as the latter\r\ncame along stretching it in his hands. Then Satanika, beholding his\r\nuterine brother's bow cut off, endued as he was with great valour,\r\nquickly came at that spot repeatedly roaring like a lion. And Satanika,\r\ndrawing his bow in that battle with great force, speedily pierced\r\nJayatsena with ten shafts, and uttered a loud shout like an infuriate\r\nelephant. And with another arrow of sharp point and capable of\r\npenetrating every armour, Satanika deeply pierced Jayatsena in the chest.\r\nJust at that time, Dushkarna who was near his brother. (Jayatsena)\r\ninfuriate with anger, cut off Satanika's bow and arrow. Then the mighty\r\nSatanika taking up another excellent bow capable of bearing a great\r\nstrain, aimed many sharp shafts. And addressing Dushkarna in the presence\r\nof his brother (Jayatsena), saying--'Wait', 'Wait',--he sped at him those\r\nsharp and blazing shafts resembling so many snakes. And then he speedily\r\ncut off Dushkarna's bow with one arrow, and slew his charioteer, O sire,\r\nwith two, and then pierced Dushkarna himself with seven arrows. And that\r\nspotless warrior then with a dozen sharp shafts slew all the steeds of\r\nDushkarna that were fleet as the mind and of variegated hue. And then\r\nwith another broad-headed arrow, well-aimed and capable of coursing\r\nswiftly, Satanika, excited with great wrath deeply pierced Dushkarna in\r\nthe chest. And thereupon the latter fell down on the earth like a tree\r\nstruck with lightning. Beholding Dushkarna slain, five mighty\r\ncar-warriors, O king, surrounded Satanika on all sides, from desire of\r\nslaying him. And they struck the renowned Satanika with showers of\r\narrows. Then the five Kekaya brothers, excited with wrath, approached\r\n(Satanika for rescuing him). Beholding the latter coming upon them, thy\r\nsons--those mighty car-warriors,--rushed towards them like elephants\r\nrushing against mighty elephants. (These amongst thy sons, viz.,)\r\nDurmukha and Durjaya and the youthful Durmarshana and Satranjaya and\r\nSatrusha, all renowned warriors, excited with rage, proceeded, O king,\r\nagainst the (five) Kekaya brothers. On their cars that resembled\r\n(fortified) towns, unto which were yoked steeds decked with ornaments,\r\nand which were graced with beautiful standards of variegated hue, those\r\nheroes wielding excellent bows and cased in beautiful coats of mail and\r\nowning excellent standards, entered the hostile army like lions entering\r\none forest from another. Smiting one another, fierce and terrific was the\r\nbattle that ensued between them and the foe, in which cars and elephants\r\ngot entangled with one another. Cherishing feelings of hostility towards\r\none another, the terrible battle in which they took part lasted for a\r\nshort space of time about sunset, increasing the population of Yama's\r\nkingdom. And car-warriors and horsemen by thousands were strewn over the\r\nfield. And Bhishma the son of Santanu excited with wrath, began to\r\nslaughter the troops of the high-souled Pandavas with his straight\r\nshafts. And with his arrows he began to despatch the combatants of the\r\nPanchalas to the domains of Yama. And the grandsire, having thus broken\r\nthe ranks of the Pandavas at last withdrew his troops and retired, O\r\nking, to his encampment. And king Yudhishthira also, beholding both\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Vrikodara, smelt their heads, and filled with joy,\r\nretired to his tents.\""

For thy sake I do not at all\r\ndissemble. They that have become the allies of the Pandavas in this\r\nbattle are fierce and numerous. Mighty car-warriors of great renown, they\r\nare exceedingly brave and accomplished in arms. Incapable of being\r\nfatigued, they vomit forth their wrath. Cherishing feelings of animosity\r\ntowards thee, and swelling with prowess, they are not capable of being\r\ndefeated easily.

And at that command, O king,\r\nhis army consisting of cars, steeds, foot-soldiers, and elephants, began\r\nto advance. And that large force.

And the dust, red as the morning sun,\r\nraised by those cars and foot-soldiers and elephants and steeds in large\r\nbodies as they were duly moved over the field, looked beautiful,\r\nshrouding the rays of the sun. And the many-coloured banners stationed on\r\ncars and elephants, waving in the air and moving along the welkin, looked\r\nbeautiful like flashes of lightning amid the clouds. And loud and fierce\r\nwas the uproar made by the twang of the bows stretched by the kings,\r\nresembling the roar of the ocean while churned in the Krita age by the\r\ngods and the great Asuras. And that army of thy sons, looking so proud,\r\nconsisting of (combatants of) diverse hues and shapes, shouting so\r\nfiercely, and capable of slaying hostile warriors, then looked like those\r\nmasses of clouds that appear at the end of the Yuga.[409]'\""

I\r\nshould, however, always tell thee, O king, what is for thy good. The\r\nPandavas are incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava.\r\nThey have Vasudeva for their ally and are equal to Mahendra himself in\r\nprowess. As regards myself, I shall, however, always do thy bidding.\r\nEither I shall vanquish the Pandavas in battle or they will vanquish me.\r\nHaving said these words, the grandsire gave him an excellent herb of\r\ngreat efficacy for healing his wounds. And therewith thy son was cured of\r\nhis wounds. Then at dawn when the sky was clear, the valiant Bhishma,\r\nthat foremost of men well-versed in all kinds of array, himself disposed\r\nhis troops in that array called Mandala bristling with weapons. And it\r\nabounded with foremost of warriors and with tuskers and foot-soldiers.\r\nAnd it was surrounded on all sides with many thousands of cars, and with\r\nlarge bodies of horsemen armed with swords and lances. Near unto every\r\nelephant were placed seven cars, and near unto every car were placed\r\nseven horsemen. And behind every horseman were placed seven bowmen, and\r\nbehind every bowman were seven combatants with shields. And thus, O king,\r\nthy army, arrayed by mighty car-warriors, stood for fierce battle,\r\nprotected by Bhishma. And ten thousand horses, and as many elephants, and\r\nten thousand cars, and thy sons, all equipped in mail, viz., the heroic\r\nChitrasena and others, protected the grandsire. And it was seen that\r\nBhishma was protected by those brave warriors, and those princes\r\nthemselves of great strength, accoutred in mail, were (in their turn)\r\nprotected by him. And Duryodhana accoutred in mail sat upon his car on\r\nthe field, and possessed of every grace, looked resplendent like Sakra\r\nhimself in heaven. Then, O Bharata, loud were the shouts uttered by thy\r\nsons and deafening the clatter of cars and the uproar of musical\r\ninstruments. That mighty and impenetrable array of those slayer of foes,\r\nviz., the Dhartarashtras (in the form called) Mandala, (thus) arrayed by\r\nBhishma, began to proceed, facing the west. Incapable of being defeated\r\nby enemies, it looked beautiful in every point. Beholding then the array\r\ncalled Mandala that was exceedingly fierce, king Yudhishthira himself\r\ndisposed his troops in the array called Vajra. And when the divisions\r\nwere thus arrayed, car-warriors and horsemen, stationed in their proper\r\nplaces, uttered leonine shouts. Accompanied by their respective forces,\r\nthe brave warriors of both armies, well versed in smiting, and longing\r\nfor battle, proceeded, desirous of breaking each other's array. And\r\nBharadwaja's son proceeded against the king of the Matsyas, and his son\r\n(Aswatthaman) against Sikhandin. And king Duryodhana himself rushed\r\nagainst the son of Prishata. And Nakula and Sahadeva went forth against\r\nthe king of the Madras. And Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti proceeded\r\nagainst Iravat. And many kings together battled with Dhananjaya. And\r\nBhimasena, exerting himself well, opposed the son of Hridika in battle.\r\nAnd possessed of great prowess, (Abhimanyu) the son of Arjuna, fought in\r\nbattle, O king, against the sons Chitrasena and Vikarna, and Durmarshana.\r\nAnd Hidimva's son, that prince of the Rakshasas, rushed against that\r\nmighty bowman, the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, like one infuriate\r\nelephant against another. And the Rakshasa Alamvusha, O king, excited\r\nwith wrath, rushed in battle against the invincible Satyaki in the midst\r\nof his followers. And Bhurisravas, exerting himself greatly, fought\r\nagainst Dhrishtaketu. And Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, proceeded\r\nagainst king Srutayush. And Chekitana in that battle fought against\r\nKripa. And others (among the Kuru warriors), exerting themselves\r\npowerfully, proceeded against that mighty car-warrior Bhima. And\r\nthousands of (other) kings surrounded Dhananjaya, with darts, lances,\r\narrows, maces, and spiked clubs in their hands. Then Arjuna, excited with\r\ngreat wrath, addressing him of Vrishni's race, said, 'Behold, O Madhava,\r\nthe Dhartarashtra troops in battle, arrayed by the high-souled son of\r\nGanga, acquainted with every kind of array. Behold, O Madhava, those\r\nbrave warriors, countless in number, and desirous of battle (with me).\r\nBehold, O Kesava, the ruler of the Trigartas with his brothers.[412] This\r\nvery day I shall slay them all, O Janardana, before thy eyes,--them, that\r\nis, O foremost of the Yadus, who, longing for battle (with me), are on\r\nthe field.' Having said these words, the son of Kunti, rubbing his\r\nbowstring, showered his arrows on that multitude of kings. And those\r\ngreat bowmen also, poured on him thick showers of arrows, like clouds\r\nthat fill a lake with torrents of rain in the rainy season. And loud\r\nshouts were heard in thy army, O monarch, when in that great battle the\r\ntwo Krishnas were seen covered with thick showers of arrows. And the\r\ngods, the celestial Rishis, and the Gandharvas with the Uragas, beholding\r\nthe two Krishnas in that state, were filled with great wonder. Then\r\nArjuna, O king, excited with wrath, invoked the Aindra weapon. And then\r\nthe prowess we beheld of Vijaya seemed to be highly wonderful insomuch\r\nthat those showers of weapons shot by his foes were checked by his\r\nmyriads of arrows. And there among those thousands of kings and steeds\r\nand elephants, was none, O king, that was not wounded. And others, O\r\nsire, the son of Pritha pierced, each with two or three arrows. And while\r\nbeing thus struck by Pritha, they sought the protection of Bhishma, the\r\nson of Santanu. But Bhishma then became the rescuer of those warriors who\r\nwere like men sinking in the fathomless deep. And in consequence of those\r\nwarriors thus flying away and mixing with thy troops, thy broken ranks, O\r\nking, were agitated like the vast deep with a tempest.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"And when the battle was thus raging and after Susarman had\r\nceased fighting, and the (other) heroic warriors (of the Kuru army) had\r\nbeen routed by the high-souled son of Pandu; after, indeed, thy army,\r\nresembling the very ocean, had become quickly agitated and the son of\r\nGanga had speedily proceeded against the car of Vijaya, king Duryodhana,\r\nbeholding the prowess of Partha in battle, quickly proceeded towards\r\nthose kings, and addressing them as also the heroic and mighty Susarman\r\nstationed in their van, said in their midst these words, gladdening them\r\nall, 'This Bhishma, the son of Santanu, this foremost one among the\r\nKurus, reckless of his very life, is desirous of fighting with his whole\r\nsoul against Dhananjaya. Exerting your best, ye all, united together, and\r\naccompanied by your troops, protect in battle the grandsire, of Bharata's\r\nrace, who is proceeding against the hostile army.' Saying, 'Yes,' all\r\nthose divisions, belonging to those kings, O monarch, proceeded,\r\nfollowing the grandsire. Then the mighty Bhishma, the son of Santanu,\r\n(thus rushing to battle), speedily came upon Arjuna of Bharata's race who\r\nalso had been coming towards him, on his exceedingly resplendent and\r\nlarge car unto which were yoked white steeds and upon which was set up\r\nhis standard bearing the fierce ape, and whose rattle resembled the deep\r\nroll of the clouds. And thy entire army, beholding the diadem-decked\r\nDhananjaya, thus coming to battle, uttered, from fear, many loud\r\nexclamations. And beholding Krishna, reins in hand, and looking like the\r\nmid-day sun in splendour, thy troops could not gaze at him. And so also\r\nthe Pandavas were incapable of looking at Santanu's son Bhishma of white\r\nsteeds and white bow and resembling the planet Sukra risen in the\r\nfirmament. And the latter was surrounded on all sides by the high-souled\r\nwarriors of the Trigartas headed by their king with his brothers and\r\nsons, and by many other mighty car-warriors.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Bharadwaja's son pierced with his winged arrows the king of\r\nthe Matsyas in battle. And in that combat he cut off the latter's\r\nstandard with one shaft, and his bow also with another. Then Virata, the\r\ncommander of a large division, leaving aside that bow thus cut off,\r\nquickly took up another that was strong and capable of bearing a great\r\nstrain. And he also took up a number of blazing arrows that resembled\r\nsnakes of virulent poison. And he pierced Drona in return with three (of\r\nthese) and his (four) steeds with four. And then he pierced Drona's\r\nstandard with one arrow, and his charioteer with five. And he also\r\npierced Drona's bow with one arrow, and (at all this) that bull among\r\nBrahmanas became highly angry. Then Drona slew Virata's steeds with eight\r\nstraight shafts, and then his charioteer, O chief of the Bharatas, with\r\none shaft. His charioteer having been slain, Virata jumped down from his\r\ncar whose steeds also had been killed. And then that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors speedily mounted upon the car of (his son) Sankha. Then sire\r\nand son, staying on the same car, began with great might to resist the\r\nson of Bharadwaja with a thick shower of arrows. Then the mighty son of\r\nBharadwaja, excited with wrath, quickly shot at Sankha in that encounter,\r\nan arrow resembling a snake of virulent poison. And that arrow, piercing\r\nthrough Sankha's breast and drinking his blood, fell upon the earth, wet\r\nand smeared with gore. Struck with that arrow of Bharadwaja's son, Sankha\r\nspeedily fell down from his car, his bow and arrows loosened from his\r\ngrasp in the very presence of his sire. And beholding his son slain,\r\nVirata fled from fear, avoiding Drona in battle, who resembled Death's\r\nself with gasping mouth. The son of Bharadwaja then, without losing a\r\nmoment, checked the mighty host of the Pandavas resisting combatants by\r\nhundreds and thousands.\r\n\r\n\"Sikhandin also, O king, getting at Drona's son in that battle, struck\r\nthe latter between his brows with three swiftly coursing shafts. And that\r\ntiger among men, viz., Aswatthaman, pierced with those shafts looked\r\nbeautiful like the mountain Meru with its three tall golden crests. Then,\r\nO king, Aswatthaman excited with rage, and within half the time taken up\r\nby a wink of the eye, overthrew in that battle Sikhandin's charioteer and\r\nstandard and steeds and weapons, covering them with myriads of shafts.\r\nThen that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Sikhandin, that scorcher of\r\nfoes, jumping down from that car whose steeds had been slain, and taking\r\nup a sharp and polished scimitar and a shield, excited with rage, moved\r\non the field with great activity like a hawk. And while moving with great\r\nactivity, O king, on the field sword in hand, the son of Drona failed to\r\nfind an opportunity (for striking him). And all this seemed highly\r\nwonderful. And then, O bull of Bharata's race, the highly wrathful son of\r\nDrona sent after Sikhandin in that battle many thousands of shafts. But\r\nSikhandin, that foremost of mighty men, with his sharp sword cut that\r\nfierce shower of arrows coming towards him. Then the son of Drona cut\r\ninto pieces that resplendent and beautiful shield decked with a hundred\r\nmoons and then that sword also of Sikhandin. And he pierced the latter's\r\nperson also, O king, with a large number of winged arrows. Then\r\nSikhandin, whirling the fragment (in his hand) of that sword of his which\r\nhad been cut off by Aswatthaman with his arrows and which resembled a\r\nblazing snake, quickly hurled it at him. The son of Drona however,\r\ndisplaying in that battle the lightness of his arms, cut off that (broken\r\nblade) coming impetuously towards him and resembling in splendour the\r\nfire that blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga. And he pierced Sikhandin\r\nhimself with innumerable arrows made of iron. Then Sikhandin, O King,\r\nexceedingly afflicted with those whetted arrows, speedily mounted on the\r\ncar of (Satyaki) that high-souled scion of Madhu's race. Then Satyaki,\r\nexcited with rage, pierced in that battle, with his terrible shafts the\r\ncruel Rakshasa Alamvusha on all sides. That prince of Rakshasas then, O\r\nBharata, cut off in that combat Satyaki's bow with a crescent-shaped\r\narrow and pierced Satyaki also with many shafts. And creating by his\r\nRakshasa powers an illusion, he covered Satyaki with showers of arrows.\r\nBut wonderful was the prowess that we then beheld of the grandson of\r\nSini, inasmuch as struck with those whetted shafts he betrayed no fear.\r\nOn the other hand, O Bharata, that son of Vrishni's race applied (with\r\nMantras) the Aindra weapon, which that illustrious hero of Madhu's race\r\nhad obtained from Vijaya.[413] That weapon, consuming into ashes that\r\nDemoniac illusion, covered Alamvusha all over with terrible shafts, like\r\na mass of clouds covering the mountain-breast with torrents of rain in\r\nthe rainy season. Thereupon the Rakshasa, thus afflicted by that hero of\r\nMadhu's race, fled away in fear, avoiding Satyaki in battle. Then the\r\ngrandson of Sini, having vanquished that prince of Rakshasas who was\r\nincapable of being vanquished by Maghavat himself, uttered a loud roar in\r\nthe very sight of all thy troops. And Satyaki, of prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, then began to slay thy troops with innumerable shafts\r\nwhereupon the latter fled away in fear.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, O monarch, Dhrishtadyumna, the mighty son of Drupada, covered\r\nthy royal son in battle with innumerable straight shafts. While, however,\r\nO Bharata, Dhrishtadyumna was thus shrouding him with his shafts, thy\r\nroyal son was neither agitated nor struck with fear. On the other hand,\r\nhe speedily pierced Dhrishtadyumna in that battle (first) with sixty and\r\n(then) with thirty shafts. And all these seemed highly wonderful. Then\r\nthe commander of the Pandava army, O Bharata, excited with wrath cut off\r\nhis bow. And that mighty car-warrior then slew in that combat the four\r\nsteeds of thy son, and also pierced him with seven shafts of the keenest\r\npoints. Thereupon (thy son), that mighty-armed warrior endued with great\r\nstrength, jumping down from that car whose steeds had been slain, ran on\r\nfoot, with an upraised sabre, towards the son of Prishata. Then the\r\nmighty Sakuni, devoted to the king, quickly coming to that spot, caused\r\nthy royal son to mount on his own car in the very sight of all. Then that\r\nslayer of foes, the son of Prishata, having vanquished the king, began to\r\nslaughter thy troops like the wielder of the thunder-bolt slaughtering\r\nthe Asuras.\r\n\r\n\"Kritavarman, in that battle, covered with his arrows that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Bhima. Indeed, he overwhelmed the latter entirely, like a\r\nmighty mass of clouds shrouding the sun. Then that chastiser of foes\r\nviz., Bhimasena, excited with wrath, and laughing the while, sped some\r\nshafts at Kritavarman. Struck therewith, that Atiratha of the Satwata\r\nrace, excelling all in might, trembled not, O king, but (instead) pierced\r\nBhima (in return) with many sharp arrows. Then the mighty Bhimasena,\r\nslaying the four steeds of Kritavarman, felled the latter's charioteer,\r\nand then his beautiful standard. And that slayer of hostile heroes (viz.,\r\nBhima) then pierced Kritavarman himself with many shafts of diverse\r\nkinds. And Kritavarman, pierced all over, seemed to be excessively\r\nmangled in every limb. Then from that car whose steeds had been slain,\r\nKritavarman quickly went to the car of Vrishaka, in the very sight, O\r\nking, of both Salya and thy son. And Bhimasena. excited with rage, began\r\nto afflict thy troops. Goaded to fury, he began to slay them, like the\r\ndestroyer himself armed with his club.\""

Thou\r\nspeakest not, however, O Sanjaya, of any one of my side having been\r\ncheerful (on such occasions). Thou always speakest of the sons of Pandu\r\nas cheerful and never routed, O Suta and thou speakest of mine as\r\ncheerless, deprived of energy, and constantly vanquished in battle. All\r\nthis, without doubt, is Destiny.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Thy men, O bull of Bharata's race, exert themselves\r\naccording to the measure of their might and courage, and display their\r\nvalour to the utmost extent of their strength. As contact with the\r\nproperties of the ocean make the sweet waters of the celestial stream\r\nGanga brakish, so the valour, O king, of the illustrious warriors of thy\r\narmy coming in contact with the heroic sons of Pandu in battle, becometh\r\nfutile. Exerting themselves according to their might, and achieving the\r\nmost difficult feats, thou shouldst not, O chief of the Kurus, find fault\r\nwith thy troops. O monarch, this great and awful destruction of the\r\nworld, swelling the (population of the) domains of Yama, hath arisen from\r\nthy misconduct and that of thy sons. It behoveth thee not, O king, to\r\ngrieve for what hath arisen from thy own fault. Kings do not always in\r\nthis world protect their lives. These rulers of Earth, desirous of\r\nwinning by battle the regions of the righteous, daily fight, penetrating\r\ninto (hostile) divisions, with heaven only for their aim.\r\n\r\n\"On the forenoon of that day, O king, great was the carnage that ensued,\r\nresembling what occurred in the battle between the gods and the Asuras\r\n(of old). Listen to it, O monarch, with undivided attention. The two\r\nprinces of Avanti, those great bowmen endued with exceeding might, those\r\nexcellent warriors fierce in battle, beholding Iravat, advanced against\r\nhim. The battle that took place between them was fierce, making the hair\r\nstand on end. Then Iravat, excited with rage, quickly pierced those two\r\nbrothers of celestial forms with many sharp and straight shafts. Those\r\ntwo, however, conversant with all modes of warfare, pierced him in return\r\nin that battle. Struggling their best to slaughter the foe, and desirous\r\nof counteracting each other's feats, no distinction, O king, could be\r\nobserved between them as they fought. Iravat then, O monarch, with four\r\nshafts, despatched the four steeds of Anuvinda to the abode of Yama. And\r\nwith a couple of sharp, broad-headed shafts, O sire, he cut off the bow\r\nand standard also of Anuvinda. And this feat, O king, seemed highly\r\nwonderful. Then Anuvinda, leaving his own car, mounted on the car of\r\nVinda. Taking up an excellent and strong bow capable of bearing a great\r\nstrain, Anuvinda, as also his brother Vinda, those foremost of\r\ncar-warriors hailing from Avanti, both stationed on the same car, quickly\r\nshot many shafts at the high-souled Iravat. Shot by them, those shafts of\r\ngreat impetuosity decked with gold, while coursing through the air,\r\ncovered the welkin.[414] Then Iravat, excited with rage, showered on\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, those two brothers (of Avanti) his arrowy\r\ndown-pours, and felled their charioteer. When the charioteer, deprived of\r\nlife, fell down on the ground, the horses, no longer restrained, ran away\r\nwith car. Having vanquished those two warriors, that daughter's son of\r\nthe king of the Nagas, displaying his prowess, then began to consume with\r\ngreat activity thy ranks. Then that mighty Dhartarashtra host, while thus\r\nslaughtered in battle, began to reel in many directions like a person who\r\nhath drunk poison.\r\n\r\n\"That prince of Rakshasa, the mighty son of Hidimva, on his car of solar\r\neffulgence furnished with a standard, rushed against Bhagadatta. The\r\nruler of the Pragjyotishas was stationed on his prince of elephants like\r\nthe wielder of the thunder-bolt in days of old in the battle occasioned\r\nby the ravishment of Taraka. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the Rishis had\r\nall come there. They could not, however, notice any distinction between\r\nHidimva's son and Bhagadatta. As the chief of the celestials, excited\r\nwith wrath, had inspired the Danavas with fear, so did Bhagadatta, O\r\nking, frightened the Pandava warriors. And the warriors of the Pandava\r\narmy, frightened by him on all sides, failed, O Bharata, to find among\r\ntheir ranks any protector. We beheld however, O Bharata, the son of\r\nBhimasena there, on his car. The other mighty car-warriors fled away with\r\ncheerless hearts. When, however, O Bharata, he troops of the Pandavas\r\nrallied, in the battle that then ensued an awful uproar arose among thy\r\ntroops. Then Ghatotkatcha, O king, in that dreadful battle, covered\r\nBhagadatta with his arrows like the clouds pouring rain on the breast of\r\nMeru. Baffling all those arrows shot from the Rakshasa's bow, the king\r\nquickly struck the son of Bhimasena in all his vital limbs. That prince\r\nof the Rakshasa, however, though struck with innumerable straight shafts,\r\nwavered not at all (but stood still) like a mountain pierced (with\r\nshafts). Then the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, excited with wrath, hurled\r\nin that combat fourteen lances, all of which, however, were cut off by\r\nthe Rakshasa. Cutting off by means of his sharp shafts those lances, the\r\nmighty-armed Rakshasa pierced Bhagadatta with seventy shafts, each\r\nresembling the thunder-bolt in force. Then the ruler of the\r\nPragjyotishas, laughing the while, O Bharata, despatched in that combat\r\nthe four steeds of the Rakshasa to Death's domain. The prince of the\r\nRakshasas, however, of great valour, staying on that car whose steeds had\r\nbeen slain, hurled with great force a dart at the elephant of the ruler\r\nof the Pragjyotishas. King Bhagadatta then cut off that swift dart\r\nfurnished with a staff of gold and coursing impetuously towards him into\r\nthree fragments, and thereupon it fell down on the ground. Beholding his\r\ndart cut off, the son of Hidimva fled from fear like Namuchi, that\r\nforemost of the Daityas, in days of old, from battle with Indra. Having\r\nvanquished in battle that hero of great valour and renowned prowess, who,\r\nO king, cannot be vanquished in battle by Yama himself or Varuna, king\r\nBhagadatta with his elephant began to crush down the troops of the\r\nPandavas like a wild elephant. O king, crushing as he treads the\r\nlotus-stalks (in a lake).\r\n\r\n\"The ruler of the Madras engaged in battle with his sister's sons, the\r\ntwins. And the overwhelmed those sons of Pandu with clouds of arrows.\r\nThen Sahadeva, beholding his maternal uncle, engaged in battle (with\r\nhim), covered him with arrows like the clouds covering the maker of day.\r\nCovered with those clouds of arrows, the ruler of the Madras wore a\r\ndelighted expression, and the twins also felt great delight for the sake\r\nof their mother.[415] Then Salya, that mighty car-warrior, smiting\r\neffectively in that battle, despatched with four excellent shafts, O\r\nking, the four steeds of Nakula to the abode of Yama. Nakula then, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, quickly jumping down from that car whose steeds had\r\nbeen slain, mounted upon the vehicle of his renowned brother. Stationed\r\nthen on the same car, those two heroes, both fierce in battle, and both\r\nexcited with rage, began to shroud the car of the ruler of Madras, (with\r\nheir arrows), drawing their bows with great strength. But that tiger\r\namong men, though thus covered by his sister's sons with innumerable\r\nstraight arrows shook not in the least (but stood immovable) like a hill.\r\nLaughing the while, he smote them (in return) with showers of arrows.\r\nThen Sahadeva of great prowess, O Bharata, excited with wrath, took up a\r\n(powerful) shaft, and rushing at the ruler of the Madras, shot it at\r\nhim[416]. That shaft endued with the impetuosity of Garuda himself, shot\r\nby him, pierced the ruler of the Madras through, and fell on the earth.\r\nThereupon that mighty car-warrior, deeply pierced and greatly pained, sat\r\ndown. O king, on the terrace of his car, and went into a swoon. Beholding\r\nhim (thus) afflicted by the twins, deprived of consciousness, and\r\nprostrated (on his car), his charioteer bore him away on his vehicle over\r\nthe field. Seeing the car of the ruler of the Madras retreating (from\r\nbattle) the Dhartarashtras all became cheerless and thought it was all\r\nover with him.[417] Then those mighty car-warriors, viz., the two sons of\r\nMadri, having vanquished in battle their maternal uncle, cheerfully blew\r\ntheir conches and uttered leonine roars. And then they rushed joyfully, O\r\nking, towards thy forces like the gods Indra and Upendra, O monarch,\r\ntowards the Daitya host.\""

And that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the son of Pritha,\r\nwith another broad-headed arrow, quickly felled on the earth the standard\r\nof the high-souled Srutayush from his car. Beholding his standard\r\noverthrown, king Srutayush then, O monarch, pierced the son of Pandu with\r\nseven sharp shafts. Thereupon Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, blazed up\r\nwith wrath, like the fire that blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga for\r\nconsuming creatures. Beholding the son of Pandu excited with rage, the\r\ngods, the Gandharvas, and the Rakshasas, trembled, O king, and the\r\nuniverse became agitated. And even this was the thought that arose in the\r\nminds of all creatures, viz., that that king, excited with rage, would\r\nthat day consume the three worlds. Indeed, when the son of Pandu was thus\r\nexcited with wrath, the Rishis and the celestials prayed for the peace of\r\nthe world. Filled with wrath and frequently licking the corners of his\r\nmouth, Yudhishthira assumed a terrible expression looking like the sun\r\nthat riseth at the end of the Yuga. Then all thy warriors, O king, became\r\nhopeless of their lives, O Bharata. Checking, however, that wrath with\r\npatience, that great bowman endued with high renown then cut off\r\nSrutayush's bow at the grasp. And then, in the very sight of all the\r\ntroops, the king in that battle pierced Srutayush whose bow had been cut\r\noff, with a long arrow in the centre of the chest. And the mighty\r\nYudhishthira then, O king, speedily slew with his arrows the steeds of\r\nSrutayush and then, without losing a moment, his charioteer. Beholding\r\nthe prowess of the king, Srutayush leaving that car whose steeds had been\r\nslain, quickly fled away from battle. After that great bowman had been\r\nvanquished in combat by the son of Dharma, all the troops of Duryodhana,\r\nO king, turned their faces. Having, O monarch, achieved this feat,\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma, began to slay thy troops like Death\r\nhimself with wide-open mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Chekitana of the Vrishni race, in the very sight of all the troops,\r\ncovered with his shafts Gautama, that foremost of car-warriors. Baffling\r\nall those arrows, Kripa the son of Saradwat, pierced Chekitana in return\r\nwho was fighting with great care, O king, with arrows in that battle.\r\nThen, O Bharata, with another broad-headed arrow he cut off Chekitana's\r\nbow, and endued with great lightness of hand, he also felled with another\r\nbroad-headed arrow the former's charioteer. Kripa then, O monarch, slew\r\nChekitana's steeds, as also both the warriors that protected the latter's\r\nwings. Then Chekitana of the Satwata race, quickly jumped down from his\r\ncar, and took up a mace. The foremost of all wielders of the mace,\r\nChekitana, with that hero-slaying mace of his, slew the steeds of Gautama\r\nand then felled his charioteer. Then Gautama, standing on the ground,\r\nshot sixteen arrows at Chekitana. Those arrows, piercing through that\r\nhero of the Satwata race, entered the earth. Thereat, Chekitana excited\r\nwith rage, once more hurled his mace, desirous of slaying Gautama, like\r\nPurandara desirous of slaying Vritra. Then Gautama with many thousands of\r\narrows checked that huge mace, endued with the strength of adamant, that\r\nwas coursing towards him. Then Chekitana, O Bharata, drawing his sabre\r\nfrom the sheath, rushed with great speed towards Gautama. Thereupon\r\nGautama also, throwing away his bow, and taking up a polished sabre,\r\nrushed with great speed towards Chekitana. Both of them possessed of\r\ngreat strength, and both armed with excellent sabres, began to strike\r\neach other with those sharp-edged weapons of theirs. Then those bulls\r\namong men, struck with the force of each other's sabres, fell down on the\r\nearth, that (common) element of all creatures. Exhausted by the efforts\r\nthey had made, the limbs of both were motionless in a swoon. Then\r\nKarakarsha impelled by friendship, quickly rushed to that spot. And that\r\ninvincible warrior, beholding Chekitana in that plight, took him up on\r\nhis car in the very sight of all troops. And so also the brave Sakuni,\r\nthy brother-in-law, O monarch, speedily caused Gautama, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, to mount on his car.\r\n\r\n\"The mighty Dhrishtaketu, excited with wrath, speedily pierced the son of\r\nSomadatta, O king, with ninety shafts in the chest. And the son of\r\nSomadatta looked highly resplendent with those shafts on his chest, like\r\nthe sun, O king, with his rays at mid-day. Bhurisravas, however, in that\r\nbattle, with his excellent shafts, deprived Dhrishtaketu, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, of his car, slaying his charioteer and steeds. And beholding\r\nhim deprived of his car, and his steeds and charioteer slain, Bhurisravas\r\ncovered Dhrishtaketu in that combat with a thick shower of arrows. The\r\nhigh-souled Dhrishtaketu then. O sire, abandoning that car of his,\r\nmounted upon the vehicle of Satanika. Chitrasena, and Vikarna, O king,\r\nand also Durmarshana,--these car-warriors cased in golden mail,--all\r\nrushed against the son of Subhadra. Then a fierce battle took place\r\nbetween Abhimanyu and those warriors, like the battle of the body, O\r\nking, with wind, bile, and phlegm.[419] That tiger among men, however,\r\n(viz., Abhimanyu), having, O king, deprived thy sons of their cars, slew\r\nthem not, remembering Bhima's words.[420] Then during the progress of the\r\nfight, Kunti's son (Arjuna), of white steeds, beholding Bhishma, who was\r\nincapable of being vanquished by very gods, proceeding to rescue thy sons\r\nin view of Abhimanyu--a boy and alone though a mighty car-warrior,\r\naddressed Vasudeva and said these words, 'Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesa,\r\nto that spot where are those numerous car-warriors. They are many in\r\nnumber, brave, accomplished in arms, invincible in battle. Guide the\r\nhorses so, O Madhava, that the foe may not be able to slay our troops.'\r\nThus urged by Kunti's son of immeasurable energy, he of Vrishni's race\r\nthen drove that car, unto which were yoked white steeds, to battle. When\r\nArjuna, excited with rage, thus proceeded towards thy army, a loud\r\nuproar, O sire, arose among thy troops.[421] The son of Kunti then,\r\nhaving come up to those kings that were protecting Bhishma, (first)\r\naddressed Susarman, O king, and said these words, 'I know thee to be\r\nforemost in battle, and a dire enemy (of ours) of old. Behold to-day the\r\nterrible fruit of that evil behaviour (of thine).[422] I will today cause\r\nthee to visit the manes of thy ancestors.' That leader of car-divisions,\r\nSusarman, however, hearing these harsh words uttered by that slayer of\r\nfoes viz., Vibhatsu, told him nothing (in reply), well or ill. (But)\r\napproaching the heroic Arjuna, with a large number of kings in his train,\r\nand surrounding him in that battle, he covered him aided by thy sons, O\r\nsinless one, with arrows from all sides, viz., front, rear, and flanks,\r\nlike the clouds covering the maker of day. Then, O Bharata, a dreadful\r\nbattle took place between thy army and the Pandavas, in which blood ran\r\nlike water.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Then the mighty Dhananjaya, struck with those shafts and\r\ndrawing long breaths like a trodden snake, cut off, with great force, by\r\nmeans of his successive shafts, the bows of those mighty car-warriors.\r\nCutting off in a moment, O king, the bows of those powerful monarchs in\r\nthat battle, the high-souled Arjuna, desiring to exterminate them pierced\r\nall of them simultaneously with his shafts. Struck (thus) by Indra's son,\r\nO king, some of them fell down on the field, covered with blood. And some\r\nhad their limbs mangled, and some had their heads struck off. And some\r\nperished with bodies mangled and coats of mail cut through. And afflicted\r\nby the arrows of Partha, many of them, falling down on the earth,\r\nperished together. Beholding then those princes slain in battle, the\r\nruler of the Trigartas advanced on his car. And two and thirty others\r\namongst those car-warriors, they who had been protecting the rear of the\r\nslain combatants also fell upon Partha. These all, surrounding Partha,\r\nand drawing their bows of loud twang, poured on him a thick shower of\r\narrows like the clouds pouring torrents of water on the mountain breast.\r\nThen Dhananjaya afflicted with that arrowy down-pour in that battle,\r\nbecame excited with wrath, and with sixty arrows steeped in oil he\r\ndespatched all those protectors of the rear. Having vanquished in battle\r\nthose sixty car-warriors, the illustrious Dhananjaya became cheerful at\r\nheart. And having slain also the forces of those kings, Jishnu sped for\r\nBhishma's slaughter. Then the ruler of the Trigartas, beholding his\r\nfriends those mighty car-warriors slain, speedily advanced upon Partha,\r\nwith a number of (other) kings in his van, for slaying him. Then the\r\nPandava warrior headed by Sikhandin, beholding those combatants advancing\r\nupon Dhananjaya that foremost of all conversant with arms, proceeded with\r\nwhetted weapons in hand, desirous of protecting the car of Arjuna. Partha\r\nalso beholding those brave men advanced towards him with the ruler of the\r\nTrigartas, mangled them in battle with arrows shot from Gandiva. Then\r\nthat distinguished bowman, desirous of approaching Bhishma beheld\r\nDuryodhana and other kings headed by the ruler of the Sindhus. Fighting\r\nwith great energy for a moment and checking those warriors that were\r\ndesirous of protecting Bhishma, the heroic Arjuna of great valour and\r\ninfinite prowess avoiding Duryodhana and Jayadratha and others,--that\r\nwarrior of mighty strength and great mental vigour,--at last proceeded,\r\nbow and arrow in hand, towards the son of Ganga in battle. The\r\nhigh-souled Yudhishthira also, of fierce prowess and infinite renown,\r\navoiding in battle the ruler of the Madras who had been assigned to his\r\nshare, quickly proceeded, with excited wrath and accompanied by Bhima and\r\nthe sons of Madri towards Bhishma, the son of Santanu, for battle.\r\nConversant with all modes of warfare the high-souled son of Ganga and\r\nSantanu, though attacked in battle by all the sons of Pandu united\r\ntogether, wavered not at all. Of fierce might and great energy king\r\nJayadratha of sure aim, advancing in battle, forcibly cut off with his\r\nown excellent bow the bows of all those mighty car-warriors. And the\r\nillustrious Duryodhana also with excited wrath and having wrath for his\r\nposition, struck Yudhishthira and Bhimasena and the twins and Partha,\r\nwith arrows resembling flames of fire. Pierced with arrows by Kripa and\r\nSala and Chitrasena, O lord, the Pandavas, inflamed with rage, resembled\r\nthe gods pierced with arrows by the united Daityas (in days of old). King\r\nYudhishthira then, beholding Sikhandin flying away, having had his weapon\r\ncut off by Santanu's son became filled with anger. The high-souled\r\nAjatasatru, angrily addressing Sikhandin in that battle, said these\r\nwords, 'Thou saidst at that time, in the presence of thy sire, unto\r\nme--Even I shall slay Bhishma of high vows with my shafts of the hue of\r\nthe effulgent sun. Truly do I say this.--Even this was thy oath. That\r\noath of thine thou dost not fulfil inasmuch as thou dost not slay\r\nDevavrata in battle. O hero, be not a person of unfulfilled vow. Take\r\ncare of thy virtue, race, and fame. Behold Bhishma of terrible\r\nimpetuosity scorching all my troops with his innumerable arrows of fierce\r\nenergy and destroying everything in a moment like Death himself. With thy\r\nbow cut off avoiding the battle, and vanquished by the royal son of\r\nSantanu, whither dost thou go, forsaking thy kinsmen and brothers? This\r\ndoth not become thee. Beholding Bhishma of infinite prowess, and our army\r\nrouted and flying away, thou art assuredly, O son of Drupada, frightened,\r\nsince the colour of thy face is pale. Unknown to thee, O hero, Dhananjaya\r\nhath engaged in the dreadful battle. Celebrated over the whole world, why\r\nO hero, art thou afraid today of Bhishma.[423]'--Hearing these words of\r\nking, Yudhishthira the just, that were harsh, though fraught with sound\r\nreason, the high-souled Sikhandin, regarding them as good counsel,\r\nspeedily set himself about slaying Bhishma.[424] And while Sikhandin was\r\nproceeding to battle with great impetuosity for falling upon Bhishma,\r\nSalya began to resist him with terrible weapons that were difficult of\r\nbeing baffled. The son of Drupada, however, O king, of prowess equal to\r\nthat of Indra himself, beholding those weapons effulgent as the fire that\r\nblazeth forth at the hour of universal dissolution (thus) displayed, was\r\nnot confounded in the least. Checking those weapons by means of his own\r\nshafts, that mighty bowman, viz., Sikhandin, stayed there without moving.\r\nAnd then he took up another weapon, viz., the fierce Varuna weapon for\r\nbaffling (those fiery weapons of Salya). Then the celestials staying in\r\nthe firmament, and the kings of the earth also, all beheld Salya's\r\nweapons baffled by that Varuna weapon of Sikhandin. Meanwhile, the\r\nhigh-souled and heroic Bhishma, O king, in that battle, cut off the bow\r\nand the variegated standard also of Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira of the\r\nAjamida race. Thereupon casting aside his bow and arrows upon beholding\r\nYudhishthira overwhelmed with fear, and taking up a mace in that battle,\r\nBhimasena rushed, on foot, at Jayadratha. Then Jayadratha, with five\r\nhundred terrible arrows of keen points and each resembling the rod of\r\nDeath, pierced Bhimasena from every side who was thus rushing impetuously\r\nat him, mace in hand. Disregarding those arrows, the impetuous Vrikodara,\r\nwith heart filled with rage, slew in that battle all the steeds, born in\r\nAratta, of the king of the Sindhus. Then beholding Bhimasena on foot, thy\r\nson (Chitrasena) of unrivalled prowess and resembling the chief of the\r\ncelestials himself, quickly rushed at him on his car, with upraised\r\nweapons, for giving him his quietus. Bhima also, roaring and uttering a\r\nloud shout, rushed at him impetuously, mace in hand. Thereupon the\r\nKauravas all around beholding that upraised mace resembling the rod of\r\nDeath, forsaking thy brave son, fled away, desirous of avoiding its fall\r\n(amongst them). In that fierce and awful crush (of men), O Bharata,\r\nconfounding the senses, Chitrasena, however, beholding that mace coursing\r\ntowards him, was not deprived of his senses. Taking up a bright scimitar\r\nand a shield, he forsook his car and became a warrior on foot in the\r\nfield, for jumping down (from his vehicle) like a lion from the top of a\r\ncliff he came down upon the level ground. Meanwhile that mace, failing\r\nupon that beautiful car and destroying the vehicle itself with its steeds\r\nand charioteer in that battle, dropped on the ground like a blazing\r\nmeteor, loosened from the firmament, failing upon the earth. Then thy\r\ntroops, O Bharata, beholding that highly wonderful feat became filled\r\nwith joy, and all of them together set up a loud shout over the field of\r\nbattle. And the warriors all applauded thy son (for what they witnessed).\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said,--\"Approaching then thy son Chitrasena of great energy who\r\nhad thus been deprived of his car, thy son Vikarna caused him to mount on\r\nhis car. And during the progress of that general engagement, so fierce\r\nand dreadful, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, impetuously rushed at\r\nYudhishthira. Then the Srinjayas with their cars, elephants, and horses,\r\ntrembled. And they regarded Yudhishthira to be already within the jaws of\r\nDeath. The lord Yudhishthira, however, of Kuru's race, accompanied by the\r\ntwins, proceeded towards that mighty bowman, that tiger among men viz.,\r\nBhishma. Then the son of Pandu, shooting in that battle thousands of\r\narrows, shrouded Bhishma like the clouds shrouding the sun. And those\r\nnumberless arrows, well shot by Yudhishthira, were received by the son of\r\nGanga in distinct sets by hundreds and thousands.[425] And so also, O\r\nsire, innumerable were the arrows shot by Bhishma (in return), which\r\nlooked like flights of insects coursing through the air. In half the time\r\ntaken up by a wink of the eye, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, in that\r\nbattle, made Kunti's son invisible by means of his numberless shafts shot\r\nin sets. Then king Yudhishthira, excited with rage, sped at the\r\nhigh-souled Kaurava a long arrow resembling a snake of virulent poison.\r\nThat mighty car-warrior, Bhishma, however, O king, cut off in that\r\ncombat, with a horse-shoe (headed) arrow, that shaft shot from\r\nYudhishthira's bow before it could reach him. Having cut off that long\r\narrow resembling Death himself, Bhishma then slew in that battle the\r\nsteeds, decked with gold, of that prince of Kuru's line. Then\r\nYudhishthira the son of Pandu, abandoning that car whose steeds had been\r\nslain, quickly mounted upon the car of the high-souled Nakula. Then\r\nBhishma that subjugator of hostile cities, excited with rage, and coming\r\nupon the twins in that battle, covered them with arrows. Beholding those\r\ntwo (brothers), O king, thus afflicted, with the arrows of Bhishma,\r\nYudhishthira began to reflect earnestly desirous, O monarch, of\r\n(compassing) Bhishma's destruction. Then Yudhishthira, O king, urged his\r\nfriends and the rulers (on his side), saying,--'Slay Bhishma the son of\r\nSantanu, uniting together.' Then all those rulers, hearing these words of\r\nPritha's son, surrounded the grandsire with a large number of cars. Thy\r\nsire Devavrata then, thus surrounded on all sides, began to sport, O\r\nking, with his bow, felling (all the while) many mighty car-warriors. Him\r\nof Kuru's race, thus careering over the field of battle, the Pandavas\r\nbeheld resembling a young lion in the forest amid a herd of deer.\r\nUttering a loud roar in that battle and striking fear into the hearts of\r\nbrave warriors by means of his shafts, the Kshatriyas beholding him, O\r\nking, were all struck with fear, like inferior animals upon seeing a\r\nlion. Indeed the Kshatriyas beheld the movements of that lion of\r\nBharata's race in battle to resemble those of a conflagration aided by\r\nthe wind while consuming a heap of dry grass. And Bhishma in that battle\r\nfelled the heads of car-warriors like a skilful man felling (with stones)\r\nripe (palmyra) fruits from trees that bear them. And the heads of\r\nwarriors, O king, falling upon the surface of the earth produced a loud\r\nnoise resembling that of a stony shower. During the progress of that\r\nfierce and dreadful battle a great confusion set in among all the troops.\r\nAnd in consequence of that confusion the arrays (of both armies) were\r\nbroken. And the Kshatriyas summoning one another individually, approached\r\none another for fight. Then Sikhandin, sighting the grandsire of the\r\nBharatas, rushed at him impetuously, saying,--Wait, Wait--Remembering,\r\nhowever, the femininity of Sikhandin, and disregarding him on that\r\naccount, Bhishma proceeded against the Srinjayas. Thereupon the\r\nSrinjayas, beholding Bhishma in that great battle, were filled with joy.\r\nAnd they set forth diverse kinds of loud shouts, mingled with the blare\r\nof their conches. Then commenced a fierce battle in course of which cars\r\nand elephants got entangled with one another. And it was that hour of the\r\nday, O lord, when the sun was on the other side (of the meridian). Then\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas, and that mighty car-warrior\r\nSatyaki, greatly afflicted the (Bharata) host with showers of arrows and\r\nlances. And with innumerable shafts, O king, these two began to smite\r\ndown thy warriors in that battle. Thy combatants, however, O bull among\r\nmen, though slaughtered in battle (thus) retreated not from the fight,\r\nhaving formed an honourable resolution in that engagement. Indeed, thy\r\ntroops began to smite according to the measure of their courage. While,\r\nhowever, O king, thy high-souled combatants were being slaughtered by the\r\nillustrious son of Prishata, loud cries of woe were heard among them.\r\nHearing those loud cries, that couple of mighty car-warriors of thy army,\r\nviz., Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, quickly proceeded against Prishata's\r\nson. And those mighty car-warriors, speedily slaying his steeds, together\r\ncovered Prishata's son with showers of arrows. Thereupon that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the prince of the Panchalas, quickly jumping down from\r\nthat car of his, mounted without loss of time the car of the high-souled\r\nSatyaki. Then king Yudhishthira, supported by a large force, proceeded\r\nagainst those chastisers of foes, viz., the two princes of Avanti excited\r\nwith rage. Similarly thy son, O sire, with every preparation, stood,\r\nsurrounding Vinda and Anuvinda in that battle (for supporting them).\r\nArjuna also in that battle, excited with rage, fought against many bulls\r\nof the Kshatriya race, like the wielder of the thunder-bolt against the\r\nAsuras. Drona also, who always does what is agreeable to thy son,\r\ninflamed with wrath in that battle, began to consume the Panchalas like\r\nfire consuming a heap of cotton. Thy other sons, O king, owning\r\nDuryodhana as their chief, surrounding Bhishma in that battle, fought\r\nagainst the Pandavas. Then when the sun assumed a red hue,[426] king\r\nDuryodhana, O Bharata, addressing thy troops, said,--Lose no time--And\r\nwhile they were thus battling and achieving feats difficult of\r\naccomplishment, the sun having become invisible in consequence of his\r\nretirement behind the western hill, there soon flowed, towards dusk, an\r\nawful river whose current and billows were of blood, and which was\r\ninfested by innumerable jackals. And the field of battle became dreadful,\r\nabounding as it did with spirits and with those jackals howling\r\nhideously, forboding evil. Rakshasas and Pisachas and other cannibals\r\nwere seen all round, in hundreds and thousands. Then Arjuna, having\r\nvanquished those kings headed by Susarman along with all their followers,\r\nin the midst of their division, proceeded towards his tent. And the lord\r\nYudhishthira also of Kuru's race, accompanied by his brothers, and\r\nfollowed by his troops, proceeded, O king, when night set in, towards his\r\ntent. And Bhimasena, too, having vanquished those kings, viz., those\r\nwarriors headed by Duryodhana, proceeded towards his tent. And king\r\nDuryodhana (with his troops), surrounding Bhishma, the son of Santanu, in\r\nthat great battle proceeded towards his tent. And Drona, and Drona's son,\r\nand Kripa, and Salya, and Kritavarman of the Satwata race, surrounding\r\nthe whole (Dhartarashtra) army, proceeded towards their tents. And\r\nsimilarly Satyaki also, O king, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata,\r\nsurrounding their army, proceeded towards their tents. It was thus, O\r\nking, that those chastisers of foes, viz., thy troops and the Pandavas,\r\nceased to fight when darkness came. Then the Pandavas, and the Kauravas,\r\nretiring to their tents, entered the same, applauding one another. And\r\nmaking arrangements for the protection of their brave warriors and\r\ndisposing outposts according to rule, they plucked out the arrows (from\r\ntheir bodies) and bathed in diverse kinds of water. And Brahmanas\r\nperformed propitiatory rites for them, and bards sang their praises. And\r\nthose renowned men sported for a while in accompaniment with music both\r\nvocal and instrumental. And for a while the whole scene resembled heaven\r\nitself. And those bulls among men for a while spoke not of battle. And\r\nwhen both armies abounding with tired men and elephants and steeds slept\r\nthere, they became, O monarch, beautiful to behold.\""

And\r\nwhen the troops of both armies were about to proceed to the field, great\r\nwas the uproar heard there, resembling the loud uproar of the ocean\r\nitself. Then king Duryodhana, and Chitrasena, and Vivinsati, and that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, viz., Bhishma and Bharadwaja's son possessed of\r\ngreat prowess,--those mighty car-warriors, clad in mail and uniting\r\ntogether, O King, formed with great care the array of the Kauravas\r\nagainst the Pandavas. Having formed that mighty array fierce as the ocean\r\nand having for its billows and current its steeds and elephants, thy sire\r\nBhishma, the son of Santanu, then, O king, proceeded in the van of the\r\nwhole army, supported by the Malavas, and the inhabitants of the southern\r\ncountries, and the Avantis. Next to him was the valiant son of\r\nBharadwaja, accompanied by the Pulindas, the Paradas, and the\r\nKshudraka-Malavas. Next to Drona was the valiant Bhagadatta. O king,\r\nfirmly resolved on fight, accompanied by the Magadhas, the Kalingas, and\r\nthe Pisachas. Behind Bhagadatta was Vrihadvala the king of the Kosalas\r\naccompanied by the Melakas, the Tripuras, and the Chichilas. Next to\r\nVrihadvala was the brave Trigarta, the ruler of the Prasthala,\r\naccompanied by a large number of the Kamvojas, and by Yavanas in\r\nthousands. Next to the ruler of the Trigartas, O Bharata, proceeded that\r\nmighty hero, viz., the son of Drona, uttering leonine roars and filling\r\nthe earth with those shouts. Next to Drona's son proceeded king\r\nDuryodhana with the whole army, surrounded by his uterine brothers.\r\nBehind Duryodhana proceeded Kripa the son of Saradwat. It was thus that\r\nthat mighty array, resembling the very ocean, advanced (to battle). And\r\nstandards and white umbrellas, O lord, and beautiful bracelets and costly\r\nbows shed their effulgence there. And beholding that mighty array of thy\r\nforces, that great car-warrior Yudhishthira, speedily addressed the\r\ngeneralissimo (of his forces), viz., Prishata's son saying, 'Behold, O\r\ngreat bowman, that array, already formed, resembling the ocean. Do thou\r\nalso, O son of Prishata, form without delay thy counter-array. (Thus\r\naddressed), the heroic son of Prishata, O great king, formed that\r\nterrible array called Sringataka that is destructive of all hostile\r\narrays. At the horns were Bhimasena and that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nSatyaki, with many thousands of cars as also of horse and infantry. Next\r\nto them was that foremost of men, (viz., Arjuna) of white steeds and\r\nhaving Krishna for his charioteer.[427] In the centre were king\r\nYudhishthira and the twin sons of Pandu by Madri. Other royal bowmen,\r\nconversant with the science of arrays, with their troops, filled up that\r\narray. In the rear were ordered Abhimanyu, and that mighty car-warrior,\r\nVirata, and the sons of Draupadi and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha. Thus, O\r\nBharata, having formed their mighty array, the heroic Pandavas waited on\r\nthe field, longing for battle and desirous of victory. And the loud noise\r\nof drums mingling with the blare of conches and leonine roars and shouts\r\n(of the combatants) and the slapping of their armpits, became terrible\r\nand filled all the points of the compass. Then those brave warriors,\r\napproaching one another for battle, looked at one another, O king, with\r\nwinkless eyes. Then O ruler of men, the warriors, first challenging each\r\nother by name, engaged with each other.[428] Then commenced a fierce and\r\nterrible battle between thy troops and those of the foe striking one\r\nanother. And in that battle, O Bharata, whetted shafts fell in showers\r\nlike terrible snakes with mouths wide open. And polished darts of\r\nimpetuous force, washed with oil, O king, shone like the effulgent\r\nflashes of lightning from the clouds. And maces decked with gold and\r\nattached to bright slings were seen to fall all over the field,\r\nresembling beautiful crests of hills. And sabres of the colour of the\r\nclear (blue) sky, O Bharata, and shields of bull's hides and decked with\r\na hundred moons, as they fell everywhere over the field, O king, looked\r\nbeautiful. And as the two armies, O king, were engaged in battle with\r\neach other, they looked resplendent like the celestial and the demoniac\r\nhosts battling with each other. All around they rushed against one\r\nanother in battle. Foremost of royal car-warriors, impetuously dashing\r\nagainst car-warriors in that dreadful battle, fought on, with the yokes\r\nof their cars entangled with those of their adversaries. And, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, all over the field flashes of fire mixed with smoke were\r\ngenerated, in consequence of friction, in the tusks of battling\r\nelephants. And combatants on the backs of elephants, struck with lances,\r\nwere seen all around to fall down like blocks (loosened) from crests of\r\nhills.[429] And brave foot-soldiers, battling with their bare arms or\r\nwith lances, and striking one another, looked exceedingly beautiful. And\r\nthe warriors of the Kaurava and the Pandava hosts, coming upon one\r\nanother in that conflict, despatched one another with diverse kinds of\r\nshafts to the abode of Yama. Then Bhishma, the son of Santanu, filling\r\n(the air) with the rattle of his car, and depriving the foe of his senses\r\nby the twang of his bow, rushed against the Pandavas in battle. The\r\ncar-warriors of the Pandavas, too, headed by Dhrishtadyumna, uttering\r\nfierce shouts, rushed at him, firmly resolved on fight. Then commenced, O\r\nBharata, a battle between the infantry, car-warriors, and elephants, of\r\ntheirs and thine, in which the combatants became all entangled with one\r\nanother.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"The Pandavas were incapable of even looking at Bhishma\r\nexcited with rage in battle and scorching every side like the Sun himself\r\nshedding scorching heat. Then all the (Pandava) troops, at the command of\r\nDharma's son, rushed at the son of Ganga who was grinding (everything)\r\nwith his whetted arrows, Bhishma, however, who delighted in battle felled\r\nthe mightiest of bowmen amongst the Srinjayas and the Panchalas, with his\r\nshafts. Though thus slaughtered by Bhishma, the Panchalas along with the\r\nSomakas still rushed impetuously at him, forsaking the fear of death. The\r\nheroic Bhishma, the son of Santanu, however, in that battle, cut off, O\r\nking, the arms and heads of their car-warriors. Thy sire, Devavrata\r\ndeprived their car-warriors of cars. And the heads of cavalry soldiers on\r\ntheir chargers fell fast. And we beheld, O king, huge elephants looking\r\nlike hills, deprived of their riders, and paralysed with Bhishma's\r\nweapons, lying all around. Amongst the Pandavas, O king, there was no\r\nother man save that foremost of car-warriors, the mighty Bhimasena, (who\r\ncould resist Bhishma). Indeed, Bhima alone, approaching Bhishma,\r\nencountered him in battle. Then in that encounter between Bhima and\r\nBhishma, a fierce and terrible uproar arose among all the troops (of the\r\nKauravas). The Pandavas then, filled with joy, uttered leonine shouts.\r\nDuring that destructive carnage, king Duryodhana, surrounded by his\r\nuterine brothers, protected Bhishma in that battle. Then that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Bhima, slew Bhishma's charioteer. Thereupon the\r\nsteeds no longer controlled, ran away from the field with car. Then that\r\nslayer of foes, viz., Bhima with a sharp arrow having a horse-shoe head,\r\ncut off the head of Sunabha. (Thus) slain, the latter fell down on the\r\nearth. When that son of thine, that mighty car-warrior and great bowman\r\nwas slain, seven of his heroic brothers, O sire, could not (quietly) bear\r\n(that act). These, viz., Adityaketu and Vahvasin, and Kundadhara and\r\nMahodara, and Aparajita, and Panditaka and the invincible Visalaksha,\r\nclad in variegated armour and with their beautiful coats of mail and\r\nweapons,--these grinders of foes desirous of battle,--rushed against the\r\nson of Pandu. And Mahodara, in that battle, pierced Bhimasena with nine\r\nwinged arrows, each resembling the thunder-bolt in force, like the slayer\r\nof Vritra striking (the great Asura) Namuchi. And Adityaketu struck him\r\nwith seventy shafts, and Vishnu with five. And Kundadhara struck him with\r\nninety shafts, and Visalaksha with seven. And that conqueror of foes, the\r\nmighty car-warrior Aparajita, O king, struck Bhimasena of great strength\r\nwith many arrows. And Panditaka also, in battle, pierced him with three\r\narrows. Bhima, however, did not (quietly) bear these attacks of his foes\r\nin battle. Forcibly grasping the bow with his left hand, that grinder of\r\nfoes cut off, in that battle, the head, with a straight shaft, of thy son\r\nAparajita, graced with a fine nose. Thus vanquished by Bhima, his head\r\nthen dropped on the ground. Then, in the very sight of all the troops,\r\nBhima despatched, with another broad-headed arrow, the mighty car-warrior\r\nKundadhara to the domain of Death. Then that hero of immeasurable soul,\r\nonce more aiming an arrow, sped it, O Bharata, at Panditaka in that\r\nbattle. And the arrow killing Panditaka, entered the earth, like a snake\r\nimpelled by Death quickly entering the earth after despatching the person\r\n(whose hour had come). Of undepressed soul, that hero then, O king,\r\nrecollecting his former woes, felled Visalaksha's head, cutting it off\r\nwith three arrows. Then Bhima, in that battle, struck the mighty bowman\r\nMahodara in the centre of the chest with a long shaft. Slain (therewith),\r\nO king, the latter fell down on the earth. Then, O Bharata, cutting off\r\nwith an arrow the umbrella of Adityaketu in that battle, he severed his\r\nhead with another broad-headed shaft of exceeding sharpness. Then, O\r\nmonarch, excited with rage, Bhima, with another straight shaft,\r\ndespatched Vahvasin towards the abode of Yama. Then thy other sons, O\r\nking, all fled away regarding the words to be true which Bhima had\r\nuttered in the (midst of the Kaurava) assembly.[430] Then king Duryodhana\r\nafflicted with sorrow on account of his brothers, addressed all his\r\ntroops, saying, 'There is Bhima. Let him be slain.' Thus, O king, thy\r\nsons, those mighty bowmen, beholding their brothers slain, recollected\r\nthose words beneficial and peaceful, that Vidura of great wisdom had\r\nspoken. Indeed, those words of the truthful Vidura are now being\r\nrealised,--those beneficial words, O king, which, influenced by\r\ncovetousness and folly as also by affection for thy sons, thou couldst\r\nnot then understand. From the way in which that mighty armed hero is\r\nslaying the Kauravas, it seemeth that that mighty son of Pandu hath\r\nassuredly taken his birth for the destruction of thy sons. Meanwhile,\r\nking Duryodhana, O sire, overwhelmed with great grief, went to Bhishma,\r\nand there, overcome with sorrow, he began to lament, saying, 'My heroic\r\nbrothers have been slain in battle by Bhimasena. Although, again, all our\r\ntroops are fighting bravely, yet they also are failing. Thou seemest to\r\ndisregard us, behaving (as thou dost) like an indifferent spectator,\r\nAlas, what course have I taken. Behold my evil destiny.'\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued. \"Hearing these cruel words of Duryodhana, thy sire\r\nDevavrata with eyes filled with tears, said this unto him.[431] 'Even\r\nthis was said by me before, as also by Drona, and Vidura, and the\r\nrenowned Gandhari. O son, thou didst not then comprehend it. O grinder of\r\nfoes, it hath also been before settled by me that neither myself, nor\r\nDrona, will ever escape with life from this battle. I tell thee truly\r\nthat those upon whom Bhima will cast his eyes in battle, he will surely\r\nslay. Therefore, O king, summoning all thy patience, and firmly resolved\r\non battle, fight with the sons of Pritha, making heaven thy goal. As\r\nregards the Pandavas, they are incapable of being vanquished by the very\r\ngods with Vasava (at their head). Therefore, setting thy heart firmly on\r\nbattle, fight, O Bharata.--'\""

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said, \"Beholding my sons, so many in number, O Sanjaya,\r\nslain by a single person, what did Bhishma and Drona and Kripa do in\r\nbattle?[432] Day after day, O Sanjaya, my sons are being slain. I think,\r\nO Suta, that they are completely overtaken by evil destiny, inasmuch as\r\nmy sons never conquer but are always vanquished. When my sons staying in\r\nthe midst of those unretreating heroes, viz., Drona and Bhishma, and the\r\nhigh-souled Kripa, and Somadatta's heroic son and Bhagadatta, and\r\nAswatthaman also, O son, and other brave warriors, are being still slain\r\nin battle, what can it be said save the result of fate?[433] The wicked\r\nDuryodhana did not comprehend (our) words before, though admonished by\r\nme, O son, and by Bhishma and Vidura. (Though forbidden) always by\r\nGandhari, too, from motives of doing him good, Duryodhana of wicked\r\nunderstanding awoke not before from folly.[434] That (conduct) hath now\r\nborne fruit, inasmuch as Bhimasena, excited with wrath, despatcheth, day\r\nafter day in battle, my insensate sons to the abode of Yama.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Those excellent words of Vidura, uttered for thy good, but\r\nwhich thou didst not then understand, have now come to be realised.\r\nVidura had said, 'Restrain thy sons from the dice.' Like a man whose hour\r\nis come refusing the proper medicine, thou didst not then listen to the\r\nwords of well-wishing friends counselling thee (for thy good). Those\r\nwords uttered by the righteous have now been realised before thee.\r\nIndeed, the Kauravas are now being destroyed for having rejected those\r\nwords, deserving of acceptance, of Vidura and Drona and Bhishma and thy\r\nother well-wishers. These very consequences happened even then when thou\r\ndeclinedst to listen to those counsels. Hear now, however, to my\r\nnarration of the battle exactly as it has happened.[435] At midday the\r\nbattle became exceedingly awful and fraught with great carnage. Listen to\r\nme, O king, as I describe it. Then all the troops (of the Pandava army),\r\nexcited with rage, rushed, at the command of Dharma's son, against\r\nBhishma alone from desire of slaying him. Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin,\r\nand the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, accompanied, O king, by their forces,\r\nproceeded against Bhishma alone. And those mighty car-warriors, viz.,\r\nVirata and Drupada, with all the Somakas, rushed in battle against\r\nBhishma alone. And the Kaikeyas, and Dhrishtaketu, and Kuntibhoja,\r\nequipped in mail and supported by their forces, rushed, O king, against\r\nBhishma alone. And Arjuna, and the sons of Draupadi, and Chekitana of\r\ngreat prowess, proceeded against all the kings under the command of\r\nDuryodhana. And the heroic Abhimanyu, and that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nthe son of Hidimva, and Bhimasena excited with wrath, rushed against the\r\n(other) Kauravas. (Thus) the Pandavas, divided into three bodies began to\r\nslaughter the Kauravas. And similarly the Kauravas also, O king, began to\r\nslaughter their foes.[436] That foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona\r\nexcited with wrath, rushed against the Somakas and the Srinjayas,\r\ndesirous of sending them to the abode of Yama. Thereupon loud cries of\r\nwoe arose among the brave Srinjayas while they were being slaughtered. O\r\nking, by Bharadwaja's son bow in hand. Large numbers of Kshatriyas,\r\nstruck down by Drona, were seen to all convulsing like persons writhing\r\nin the agony of disease. All over the field were continuously heard moans\r\nand shrieks and groans resembling those of persons afflicted with hunger.\r\nAnd so the mighty Bhimasena, excited with wrath, and like unto a second\r\nYama, caused a terrible carnage amongst the Kaurava troops. There in that\r\ndreadful battle, in consequence of the warriors slaying one another, a\r\nterrible river began to flow whose billowy current consisted of\r\nblood.[437] And that battle, O king, between the Kurus and the Pandavas,\r\nbecoming fierce and awful, began to swell the population of Yama's\r\nkingdom. Then in that battle Bhima excited with wrath, fell with great\r\nimpetuosity upon the elephant division (of the Kauravas) and began to\r\nsend many to the regions of Death. Then, O Bharata, struck with Bhima's\r\nshafts, some of those beasts fell down, some were paralysed, some\r\nshrieked (in pain), and some ran away in all directions. Huge elephants,\r\ntheir trunks cut off and limbs mangled, screaming like cranes, began, O\r\nking, to fall down on the earth. Nakula and Sahadeva fell upon the\r\n(Kaurava) cavalry. Many steeds with garlands of gold on their heads and\r\nwith their necks and breasts adorned with ornaments of gold, were seen to\r\nbe slain in hundreds and thousands. The earth, O king, was strewn with\r\nfallen steeds. And some were deprived of their tongues; and some breathed\r\nhard; and some uttered low moans, and some were void of life. The earth\r\nlooked beautiful, O chief of men, with those steeds of such diverse\r\nkinds. At the same time, O Bharata, she looked fiercely resplendent, O\r\nmonarch, with a large number of kings slain by Arjuna in that battle. And\r\nstrewn with broken cars and rent banners and brilliant umbrellas, with\r\ntorn chamaras and fans, and mighty weapons broken into fragments, with\r\ngarlands and necklaces of gold, with bracelets, with heads decked with\r\near-rings, with head-gears loosened (from off heads), with standards,\r\nwith beautiful bottoms of cars, O king, and with traces and reins, the\r\nearth shone as brightly as she does in spring when strewn with flowers.\r\nAnd it was thus, O Bharata, that the Pandava host suffered destruction\r\nwhen Bhishma the son of Santanu, and Drona that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nand Aswatthaman, and Kripa, and Kritavarman, were inflamed with wrath.\r\nAnd similarly thy army also suffered the same kind of destruction when\r\nthe other side, viz., the Pandava heroes were excited with rage.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"During the progress, O king, of that fierce battle fraught\r\nwith the slaughter of great heroes, Sakuni the glorious son of Suvala,\r\nrushed against the Pandavas. And so also, O monarch, Hridika's son of the\r\nSatwata race, that slayer of hostile heroes, rushed in that battle\r\nagainst the Pandava ranks. And smiling the while, (several warriors on\r\nthy side), with a large number of steeds consisting of the best of the\r\nKamvoja breed as also of those born in the country of the Rivers, and of\r\nthose belonging to Aratta and Mahi and Sindhu, and of those of Vanayu\r\nalso that were white in hue, and lastly those of hilly countries,\r\nsurrounded (the Pandava army).[438] And so also with horses, exceedingly\r\nswift, fleet as the very winds, and belonging to the Tittri breed,\r\n(others encompassed that army). And with many horses, clad in mail and\r\ndecked with gold, the foremost of their class and fleet as the winds the\r\nmighty son of Arjuna (viz., Iravat), that slayer of foes, approached the\r\n(Kaurava) force. This handsome and valiant son of Arjuna, named Iravat,\r\nwas begotten upon the daughter of the king of the Nagas by the\r\nintelligent Partha. Her husband having been slain by Garuda, she became\r\nhelpless, and of cheerless soul. Childless as she was, she was bestowed\r\n(upon Arjuna) by the high-souled Airavat. Partha accepted her for wife,\r\ncoming to him as she did under the influence of desire. It was thus that\r\nthat son of Arjuna was begotten upon the wife of another.[439] Abandoned\r\nby his wicked uncle from hatred of Partha, he grew up in the region of\r\nthe Nagas, protected by his mother. And he was handsome and endued with\r\ngreat strength, possessed of diverse accomplishments, and of prowess\r\nincapable of being baffled. Hearing that Arjuna had gone to the region of\r\nIndra, he speedily went thither. And the mighty-armed Iravat, possessed\r\nof prowess incapable of being baffled, approaching his sire, saluted him\r\nduly, standing before him with joined hands. And he introduced himself to\r\nthe high-souled Arjuna, saying, 'I am Iravat. blessed be thou, and I am\r\nthy son, O lord'. And he reminded Arjuna of all the circumstances\r\nconnected with the latter's meeting with his mother. And thereupon the\r\nson of Pandu recollected all those circumstances exactly as they\r\nhappened. Embracing his son then who resembled himself in\r\naccomplishments, Partha, in Indra's abode, was filled with joy. The\r\nmighty-armed Iravat then, O king, in the celestial regions was, O\r\nBharata, joyfully commanded by Arjuna, with regard to his own business,\r\n(in these words), 'When the battle takes place, assistance should be\r\nrendered by thee'. Saying 'Yes', O lord, he went away. And now at the\r\ntime of battle he presented himself. O king, accompanied with a large\r\nnumber of steeds of great fleetness and beautiful colour. And those\r\nsteeds, decked with ornaments of gold, of various colours and exceeding\r\nfleetness, suddenly coursed over the field, O king, like swans on the\r\nbosom of the vast deep. And those steeds failing upon thine of exceeding\r\nswiftness, struck their chests and noses against those of thine.\r\nAfflicted by their own impetuous clash (against thine), they suddenly\r\nfell down, O king, on the earth. And in consequence of those steeds as\r\nalso of thine occasioned by that clash, loud sounds were heard resembling\r\nwhat occurs at Garuda's swoop. And the rider of those steeds, O king,\r\nthus dashing against one another in that battle, began to slay one\r\nanother fiercely. And during that general engagement which was fierce and\r\nterrible, the chargers of both sides (escaping from press of battle) ran\r\nwildly away over the field. Weakened by one another's shafts, brave\r\nwarriors, with their horses killed under them, and themselves worn out\r\nwith exertion, perished fast sabring one another. Then when those cavalry\r\ndivisions were thinned and a remnant only survived, the Younger brothers\r\nof Suvala's son, Possessed of great wisdom, rode out, O Bharata (from the\r\nKaurava array) to the van of battle, mounted On excellent charges that\r\nresembled the tempest itself in both fleetness and the violence of their\r\ndash and that were well-trained and neither old nor young.[440] Those six\r\nbrothers endued with great strength, viz., Gaya, Gavaksha, Vrishava,\r\nCharmavat, Arjava, and Suka dashed out of the mighty (Kaurava) array,\r\nsupported by Sakuni and by their respective forces of great valour,\r\nthemselves clad in mail, skilled in battle, fierce in mien, and possessed\r\nof exceeding might. Breaking through that invincible cavalry division (of\r\nthe Pandavas), O thou of mighty arms, those Gandhara warriors who could\r\nwith difficulty be vanquished, supported by a large force, desirous of\r\nheaven, longing for victory, and filled with delight, penetrated into it.\r\nBeholding them filled with joy, the valiant Iravat, addressing his own\r\nwarriors decked with diverse ornaments and weapons, said unto them,\r\n'Adopt such contrivances in consequence of which these Dhritarashtra\r\nwarriors with their weapons and animals may all be destroyed.' Saying\r\n'Yes', all those warriors of Iravat began to slay those mighty and\r\ninvincible Dhartarashtra soldiers. Beholding that their own warriors were\r\nthus overthrown by Iravat's division, those sons of Suvala being unable\r\nto beat it coolly, all rushed at Iravat and surrounded him on all sides.\r\nAnd commanding (all their followers) to attack those of Iravat with\r\nlances, those heroes swept over the field, creating a great confusion.\r\nAnd Iravat, pierced with lances by those high-souled warriors, and bathed\r\nin blood that trickled down (his wounds), looked like an elephant pierced\r\nwith the hook. Wounded deeply on the chest, back, and flanks, singly\r\nencountering the many, he did not yet, O king, swerve from his (natural)\r\nfirmness. Indeed, Iravat, excited with rage, deprived all those\r\nadversaries of their senses, piercing them, in that battle, with sharp\r\nshafts. And that chastiser of foes, tearing those lances from off his\r\nbody, struck with them the sons of Suvala in battle. Then unsheathing his\r\npolished sword and taking a shield, he rushed on foot, desirous of\r\nslaying Suvala's sons in that combat. The sons of Suvala, however,\r\nrecovering their senses, once more rushed at Iravat, excited with wrath.\r\nIravat, however, proud of his might, and displaying his lightness of\r\nhand, proceeded towards all of them, armed with his sword. Moving as he\r\ndid with great activity, the sons of Suvala, although they moved about on\r\ntheir fleet steeds, could not find an opportunity for striking that hero\r\n(on foot). Beholding him then on foot, his foes surrounded him closely\r\nand wished to take him captive. Then that crusher of foes, seeing them\r\ncontiguous to himself, struck off, with his sword, both their right and\r\nleft arms, and mangled their other limbs. Then those arms of theirs\r\nadorned with gold, and their weapons, fell down on the earth, and they\r\nthemselves, with limbs mangled, fell down on the field, deprived of life.\r\nOnly Vrishava, O king, with many wounds on his person, escaped (with\r\nlife) from that dreadful battle destructive of heroes. Beholding them\r\nlying on the field of battle, thy son Duryodhana, excited with wrath said\r\nunto that Rakshasa of terrible mien, viz., Rishyasringa's son\r\n(Alamvusha), that great bowman versed in illusion, that chastiser of\r\nfoes, who bore feelings of animosity against Bhimasena in consequence of\r\nthe slaughter of Vaka, these words: \"Behold, O hero, how the mighty son\r\nof Phalguni, versed in illusion, hath done me a severe injury by\r\ndestroying my forces. Thou also, O sire, art capable of going everywhere\r\nat will and accomplished in all weapons of illusion. Thou cherishest\r\nanimosity also for Partha. Therefore, do thou slay this one in battle.'\r\nSaying 'Yes', that Rakshasa of terrible mien proceeded with a leonine\r\nroar to that spot where the mighty and youthful son of Arjuna was. And he\r\nwas supported by the heroic warriors of his own division, accomplished in\r\nsmiting, well-mounted, skilled in battle and fighting with bright lances.\r\nAccompanied by the remnant of that excellent cavalry division (of the\r\nKauravas), he proceeded, desirous of slaying in battle the mighty Iravat.\r\nThat slayer of foes, viz., the valiant Iravat, excited with rage, and\r\nadvancing speedily from desire of slaying the Rakshasa, began to resist\r\nhim. Beholding him advance, the mighty Rakshasa speedily set himself\r\nabout for displaying his powers of illusion. The Rakshasa then created a\r\nnumber of illusive chargers which were riden by terrible Rakshasas armed\r\nwith spears and axes. Those two thousand accomplished smiters advancing\r\nwith rage, were however, soon sent to the regions of Yama, (falling in\r\nthe encounter with Iravat's forces). And when the forces of both\r\nperished, both of them, invincible in battle, encountered each other like\r\nVritra and Vasava. Beholding the Rakshasa, who was difficult of being\r\nvanquished in battle, advancing towards him, the mighty Iravat, excited\r\nwith rage, began to check his onset. And when the Rakshasa approached him\r\nnearer, Iravat with his sword quickly cut off his bow, as also each of\r\nhis shafts into five fragments. Seeing his bow cut off, the Rakshasa\r\nspeedily rose up into the welkin, confounding with his illusion the\r\nenraged Iravat. Then Iravat also, difficult of approach, capable of\r\nassuming any form at will, and having a knowledge of what are the vital\r\nlimbs of the body, rising up into the welkin, and confounding with his\r\nillusion the Rakshasa began to cut off the latter's limbs in that battle\r\nand thus were the limbs of the Rakshasa repeatedly cut into several\r\npieces.[441] [(Rakshasa ceases to be italicized at this point for a\r\ncouple of pages.--JBH)] Then the Rakshasa, however, O king, was re-born,\r\nassuming a youthful appearance. Illusion is natural with them, and their\r\nage and form are both dependent on their will. And the limbs of that\r\nRakshasa, O king, cut into pieces, presented a beautiful sight. Iravat,\r\nexcited with rage, repeatedly cut that mighty Rakshasa with his sharp\r\naxe. 'The brave Rakshasa, thus cut into pieces like a tree by the mighty\r\nIravat, roared fiercely'. And those roars of his became deafening.\r\nMangled with the axe, the Rakshasa began to pour forth blood in torrents.\r\nThen (Alamvusha), the mighty son of Rishyasringa, beholding his foe\r\nblazing forth with energy, became infuriate with rage and himself put\r\nforth his prowess in that combat. Assuming a prodigious and fierce form,\r\nhe endeavoured to seize the heroic son of Arjuna, viz., the renowned\r\nIravat. In the sight of all the combatants there present, beholding that\r\nillusion of the wicked Rakshasa in the van of battle, Iravat became\r\ninflamed with rage and adopted steps for himself having recourse to\r\nillusion. And when that hero, never retreating from battle, became\r\ninflamed with wrath, a Naga related to him by his mother's side, came to\r\nhim. Surrounded on all sides, in that battle by Nagas, that Naga, O king,\r\nassumed a huge form mighty as Ananta himself. With diverse kinds of Nagas\r\nthen he covered the Rakshasa. While being covered by those Nagas, that\r\nbull among Rakshasas reflected for a moment, and assuming the form of\r\nGaruda, he devoured those snakes. When that Naga of his mother's line was\r\ndevoured through illusion, Iravat became confounded. And while in that\r\nstate, the Rakshasa slew him with his sword, Alamvusha felled on the\r\nearth Iravat's head decked with ear-rings and graced with a diadem and\r\nlooking beautiful like a lotus or the moon.\r\n\r\n\"When the heroic son of Arjuna was thus slain by the Rakshasa, the\r\nDhartarashtra host with all the kings (in it) were freed from grief. In\r\nthat great battle that was so fierce, awful was the carnage that occurred\r\namong both the divisions. Horses and elephants and foot-soldiers\r\nentangled with one another, were slain by tuskers. And many steeds and\r\ntuskers were slain by foot-soldiers. And in that general engagement\r\nbodies of foot-soldiers and cars, and large numbers of horses belonging\r\nboth to thy army and theirs, were slain. O king, by car-warriors.\r\nMeanwhile, Arjuna, not knowing that the son of his loins had been\r\nslaughtered, slew in that battle many kings who had been protecting\r\nBhishma. And the warriors, O king, of thy army and the Srinjayas, by\r\nthousands, poured out their lives as libations (on the fire of battle),\r\nstriking one another. And many car-warriors, with dishevelled hair, and\r\nwith swords and bows fallen from their grasp fought with their bare arms,\r\nencountering one another. The mighty Bhishma also, with shafts capable of\r\npenetrating into the very vitals, slew many mighty car-warriors and\r\ncaused the Pandava army to tremble (the while). By him were slain many\r\ncombatants in Yudhishthira's host, and many tuskers and cavalry-soldiers\r\nand car-warriors and steeds. Beholding, O Bharata, the prowess of Bhishma\r\nin that battle, it seemed to us that it was equal to that of Sakra\r\nhimself. And the prowess of Bhimasena, as also that of Parshata, was\r\nhardly less, O Bharata, (than that of Bhishma). And so also the battle\r\nfought by that great bowman (viz., Satyaki) of Satwata's race, was\r\nequally fierce. Beholding, however, the prowess of Drona, the Pandavas\r\nwere struck with fear. Indeed they thought, 'Alone, Drona can slay us\r\nwith all our troops. What then should be said of him when he is\r\nsurrounded by a large body of warriors who for their bravery are renowned\r\nover the world? Even this, O king, was what the Partha said, afflicted by\r\nDrona. During the progress of that fierce battle, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, the brave combatants of neither army forgave their adversaries of\r\nthe other. O sire, the mighty bowmen of both thy army and that of the\r\nPandavas, inflamed with wrath, fought furiously with one another, as if\r\nthey were possessed of by the Rakshasas and demons. Indeed, he did not\r\nsee any one in the battle which was so destructive of lives and which was\r\nconsidered as a battle of the demons, to take of life.\""

And in\r\nconsequence of the loudness of those roars, the earth having the ocean\r\nfor her robes, along with her mountains and forests, began to tremble\r\nviolently. And the welkin also and the quarters both cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, all trembled. And hearing those loud roars of his, O Bharata,\r\nthe thighs and other limbs of the troops began to tremble, and sweat also\r\nappeared on their persons. And all thy combatants, O king, became\r\ncheerless of heart. And all over the field the warriors stood still, like\r\nan elephant afraid of the lion. And the Rakshasa, uttering those loud\r\nroars resembling the rattle of thunder, assuming a terrible form, and\r\nwith a blazing spear upraised in hand, and surrounded by many bulls among\r\nRakshasas of fierce forms armed with diverse weapons, advanced, excited\r\nwith rage and resembling the Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga.\r\nBeholding him advance in wrath and with a terrible countenance, and\r\nseeing also his own troops almost all running away from fear of that\r\nRakshasa, king Duryodhana rushed against Ghatotkacha, taking up his bow\r\nwith arrow fixed on the string, and repeatedly roaring like a lion.\r\nBehind him proceeded the ruler of the Vangas, with ten thousand\r\nelephants, huge as hills, and each with juice trickling down. Beholding\r\nthy son, O king, (thus) advancing surrounded by that elephant division,\r\nthat ranger of the night (viz., Ghatotkacha) was highly inflamed with\r\nrage. Then commenced a battle with utmost vehemences that made the hair\r\nstand on end, between the formidable Rakshasa and the troops of\r\nDuryodhana. And beholding also that elephant division risen (on the\r\nhorizon) like a cloud, the Rakshasas, inflamed with rage, rushed towards\r\nit, weapons in hand, and uttering diverse roars like clouds charged with\r\nlightning. With arrows and darts and swords and long shafts, as also with\r\nspears and mallets and battle-axes and short arrows, they began to smite\r\ndown that elephant host. And they slew huge elephants with\r\nmountain-summits and large trees. While the Rakshasas slew those\r\nelephants, O king, we saw that some of them had their frontal globes\r\nsmashed, some were bathed in blood, and some had their limbs broken or\r\ncut through. At last when that elephant host was broken and thinned,\r\nDuryodhana, O king, rushed upon the Rakshasas, under the influence of\r\nrage and becoming reckless of his very life. And that mighty warrior sped\r\nclouds of sharp shafts at the Rakshasas. And that great bowman slew many\r\nof their foremost warriors. Inflamed with rage, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior, viz., thy son Duryodhana, then slew with four\r\nshafts four of the principal Rakshasas, viz., Vegavat, Maharudra,\r\nVidyujihva, and Pramathin. And once again, O chief of the Bharatas, that\r\nwarrior of immeasurable soul, sped at the Rakshasa host showers of arrows\r\nthat could with difficulty be resisted. Beholding that great feat of thy\r\nson, O sire, the mighty son of Bhimasena blazed up with wrath. Drawing\r\nhis large bow effulgent as the lightning, he rushed impetuously at the\r\nwrathful Duryodhana. Beholding him (thus) rushing like Death himself\r\ncommissioned by the Destroyer, thy son Duryodhana, O king, shook not at\r\nall. With eyes red in anger, and excited with rage, Ghatotkacha, then,\r\naddressing thy son, said, 'I shall today be freed from the debt I owe to\r\nmy sires, as also to my mother, they that had so long been exiled by thy\r\ncruel self. The sons of Pandu, O king, were vanquished by thee in that\r\nmatch at dice. Drupada's daughter Krishna also, while ill and, therefore,\r\nclad in a single raiment, was brought into the assembly and great trouble\r\nwas given by thee in diverse ways, O thou most wicked, unto her. While\r\ndwelling also in her sylvan retreat, thy well-wisher, that wicked wight,\r\nviz., the ruler of the Sindhus, persecuted her further, disregarding my\r\nsires. For these and other wrongs, O wretch of thy race, I shall today\r\ntake vengeance if thou dost not quit the field.' Having said these words,\r\nHidimva's son, drawing his gigantic bow, biting his (nether) lip with his\r\nteeth, and licking the corners of his mouth, covered Duryodhana with a\r\nprofuse shower, like a mass of clouds covering the mountain-breast with\r\ntorrents of rain in the rainy season.\""

He then shot five and twenty sharp\r\narrows of keen points. These, O king, fell with great force on that bull\r\namong Rakshasas, like angry snakes of virulent poison on the breast of\r\nGandhamadana. Pierced with those shafts, blood trickled down the\r\nRakshasa's body and he looked like an elephant with rent temples.[443]\r\nThereupon that cannibal set his heart upon the destruction of the (Kuru)\r\nking. And he took up a huge dart that was capable of piercing even a\r\nmountain. Blazing with light, effulgent as a large meteor, it flamed with\r\nradiance like the lightning itself. And the mighty-armed Ghatotkacha,\r\ndesirous of slaying thy son, raised that dart. Beholding that dart\r\nupraised, the ruler of the Vangas mounting upon an elephant huge as a\r\nhill, drove towards the Rakshasa. On the field of battle, with the mighty\r\nelephant of great speed, Bhagadatta placed himself in the very front of\r\nDuryodhana's car. And with that elephant he completely shrouded the car\r\nof thy son. Beholding then the way (to Duryodhana's car) thus covered by\r\nthe intelligent king of the Vangas, the eyes of Ghatotkacha, O king,\r\nbecame red in anger. And he ruled that huge dart, before upraised, at\r\nthat elephant. Struck, O king, with that dart hurled from the arms of\r\nGhatotkacha, that elephant, covered with blood and in great agony, fell\r\ndown and died. The mighty king of the Vangas, however, quickly jumping\r\ndown from that elephant, alighted on the ground. Duryodhana then\r\nbeholding the prince of elephants slain, and seeing also his troops\r\nbroken and giving way, was filled with anguish. From regard, however, for\r\na Kshatriya's duty[444] as also his own pride, the king, though defeated,\r\nstood firm like a hill. Filled with wrath and aiming a sharp arrow that\r\nresembled the Yuga fire in energy, he sped it at that fierce wanderer of\r\nthe night. Beholding that arrow, blazing as Indra's bolt, thus coursing\r\ntowards him, the high-souled Ghatotkacha baffled it by the celerity of\r\nhis movements. With eyes red in wrath, he once more shouted fiercely,\r\nfrightening all thy troops, like the clouds that appear at the end of the\r\nYuga. Hearing those fierce roars of the terrible Rakshasa, Bhishma the\r\nson of Santanu, approaching the preceptor, said these words, 'These\r\nfierce roars that are heard, uttered by Rakshasas, without doubt indicate\r\nthat Hidimva's son is battling with king Duryodhana. That Rakshasa is\r\nincapable of being vanquished in battle by any creature. Therefore,\r\nblessed be ye, go thither and protect the king. The blessed Duryodhana\r\nhath been attacked by the high-souled Rakshasa. Therefore, ye chastisers\r\nof foes, even this is our highest duty.[445]' Hearing those words of the\r\ngrandsire, those mighty car-warriors without loss of time and with the\r\nutmost speed, proceeded to the spot when the king of the Kurus was. They\r\nmet Duryodhana and Somadatta and Valhika and Jayadratha; and Kripa and\r\nBhurisravas and Salya, and the two princes of Avanti along with\r\nVrihadvala, and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and Chitrasena and Vivinsati.\r\nAnd many thousands of other car-warriors, including all those that\r\nfollowed them, proceeded, desirous of rescuing thy son Duryodhana who had\r\nbeen hotly pressed. Beholding that invincible division protected by those\r\nmighty car-warriors, coming towards him with hostile intentions, that\r\nbest of Rakshasas, viz., the mighty-armed Ghatotkacha, stood firm like\r\nthe Mainaka mountain, with a huge bow in hand, and surrounded by his\r\nkinsmen armed with clubs and mallets and diverse other kinds of weapons.\r\nThen commenced a fierce battle, making the hair stand on end, between\r\nthose Rakshasas on the one side and that foremost of Duryodhana's\r\ndivisions on the other. And the loud noise of twanging bows in that\r\nbattle was heard, O king, on all sides resembling the noise made by\r\nburning bamboos. And the din produced by the weapons falling upon the\r\ncoats of mail of the combatants resembled, O king, the noise of splitting\r\nhills. And the lances, O monarch, hurled by heroic arms, while coursing\r\nthrough the welkin, looked like darting snakes. Then, excited with great\r\nwrath and drawing his gigantic bow, the mighty-armed prince of the\r\nRakshasas, uttering a loud roar, cut off, with a crescent-shaped arrow,\r\nthe preceptor's bow in a rage. And overthrowing, with another\r\nbroad-headed arrow, the standard of Somadatta, he uttered a loud yell.\r\nAnd he pierced Valhika with three shafts in the centre of the chest. And\r\nhe pierced Kripa with one arrow, and Chitrasena with three. And with\r\nanother arrow, well-armed and well-sped from his bow drawn to its fullest\r\nstretch, he struck Vikarna at the shoulder-joint. Thereupon the latter,\r\ncovered with gore, sat down on the terrace of his car. Then that Rakshasa\r\nof immeasurable soul, excited With rage, O bull of Bharata's race, sped\r\nat Bhurisravas five and ten shafts. These, penetrating through the\r\nlatter's armour, entered the earth. He then struck the chariot of\r\nVivingsati and Aswatthaman. These fell down on the front of their cars,\r\nrelinquishing the reins of the steeds. With another crescent-shaped shaft\r\nhe overthrew the standard of Jayadratha bearing the device of a boar and\r\ndecked with gold. And with a second arrow he cut off the latter's bow.\r\nAnd with eyes red in wrath, he slew with four shafts the four steeds of\r\nthe high-souled king of Avanti. And with another arrow, O king,\r\nwell-tempered and sharp, and shot from his bow drawn to its fullest\r\nstretch, he pierced king Vrihadvala. Deeply pierced and exceedingly\r\npained, the latter sat down on the terrace of his car. Filled with great\r\nwrath and seated on his car, the prince of the Rakshasas then shot many\r\nbright arrows of keen points that resembled snakes of virulent poison.\r\nThese, O king, succeeded in piercing Salya accomplished in battle.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Having in that battle made all those warriors (of thy\r\narmy) turn their faces from the field, the Rakshasa then, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, rushed at Duryodhana, desirous of slaying him. Beholding him\r\nrushing with great impetuosity towards the king, many warriors of thy\r\narmy, incapable of defeat in battle, rushed towards him (in return) from\r\ndesire of slaying him. Those mighty car-warriors, drawing their bows that\r\nmeasured full six cubits long, and uttering loud roars like a herd of\r\nlions, all rushed together against that single warrior. And surrounding\r\nhim on all sides, they covered him with their arrowy showers like the\r\nclouds covering the mountain-breast with torrents of rain in autumn.\r\nDeeply pierced with those arrows and much pained, he resembled then an\r\nelephant pierced with the hook. Quickly then he soared up into the\r\nfirmament like Garuda. And (while there) he uttered many loud roars like\r\nthe autumnal clouds, making the welkin and all the points of the compass,\r\ncardinal and subsidiary, resounded with those fierce cries. Hearing those\r\nroars of the Rakshasa, O chief of the Bharatas, king Yudhishthira then,\r\naddressing Bhima, said unto that chastiser of foes these words, 'The\r\nnoise that we hear uttered by the fiercely-roaring Rakshasa, without\r\ndoubt, indicates that he is battling with the mighty car-warriors of the\r\nDhartarashtra army. I see also that the burden has proved heavier than\r\nwhat that bull among Rakshasas is able to bear. The grandsire, too,\r\nexcited with rage, is ready to slaughter the Panchalas. For protecting\r\nthem Phalguni is battling with the foe. O thou of mighty arms hearing now\r\nof these two tasks, both of which demand prompt attention, go and give\r\nsuccour to Hidimva's son who is placed in a position of very great\r\ndanger.' Listening to these words of his brother, Vrikodara, with great\r\nspeed, proceeded, frightening all the kings with his leonine roars, with\r\ngreat impetuosity, O king, like the ocean itself during the period of the\r\nnew full moon. Him followed Satyadhriti and Sauchiti difficult of being\r\nvanquished in battle, and Srenimat, and Vasudana and the powerful son of\r\nthe ruler of Kasi, and many car-warriors headed by Abhimanyu, as also\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, viz., the sons of Draupadi, and the valiant\r\nKshatradeva, and Kshatradharman, and Nila, the ruler of the low\r\ncountries, at the head of his own forces. And these surrounded the son of\r\nHidimva with a large division of cars (for aiding him).[446] And they\r\nadvanced to the rescue of Ghatotkacha, that prince of the Rakshasas, with\r\nthe six thousand elephants, always infuriate and accomplished in smiting.\r\nAnd with their loud leonine roars, and the clatter of their car-wheels,\r\nand with the tread of their horse's hoofs, they made the very earth to\r\ntremble. Hearing the din of those advancing warriors the faces of thy\r\ntroops who were filled with anxiety in consequence of their fear of\r\nBhimasena became pale. Leaving Ghatotkacha then they all fled away. Then\r\ncommenced in that part of the field a dreadful battle between those\r\nhigh-souled warriors and thine, both of whom were unretreating. Mighty\r\ncar-warriors, hurling diverse kinds of the weapons, chased and smote one\r\nanother. That fierce battle striking terror into the hearts of the timid,\r\nwas such that the different classes of combatants became entangled with\r\none another. Horses engaged with elephants and foot-soldiers with\r\ncar-warriors. And challenging one another, O king, they engaged in the\r\nfight.[447] And in consequence of that clash of cars, steeds, elephants,\r\nand foot-soldiers, a thick dust appeared, raised by the car-wheels and\r\nthe tread (of those combatants and animals). And that dust, thick and of\r\nthe colour of reddish smoke, shrouded the field of battle. And the\r\ncombatants were unable to distinguish their own from the foe. Sire\r\nrecognised not the son, and son recognised not the sire, in that dreadful\r\nengagement which made the hair stand on end and in which no consideration\r\nwas shown (by any one for any body). And the noise made by the hissing\r\nweapons and the shouting combatants resembled, O chief of Bharata's race,\r\nthat made by departed spirits (in the infernal regions). And there flowed\r\na river whose current consisted of the blood of elephants and steeds and\r\nmen. And the hair (of the combatants) formed its weeds and moss. And in\r\nthat battle heads falling from the trunks of men made a loud noise like\r\nthat of a falling shower of stones. And the earth was strewn with the\r\nheadless trunks of human beings, with mangled bodies of elephants and\r\nwith the hacked limbs of steeds. And mighty car-warriors chased one\r\nanother for smiting one another down, and hurled diverse kinds of\r\nweapons. Steeds, urged by their riders and falling upon steeds, dashed\r\nagainst one another and fell down deprived of life. And men, with eyes\r\nred in wrath, rushing against men and striking one another with their\r\nchests, smote one another down. And elephants, urged by their guides\r\nagainst hostile elephants, slew their compeers in that battle, with the\r\npoints of their tusks. Covered with blood in consequence of their wounds\r\nand decked with standards (on their backs), elephants were entangled with\r\nelephants and looked like masses of clouds charged with lightning. And\r\nsome amongst them mounted (by others) with the points of their tusks, and\r\nsome with their frontal globes split with lances, ran hither and thither\r\nwith loud shrieks like masses of roaring clouds. And some amongst them\r\nwith their trunks lopped off,[448] and others with mangled limbs, dropped\r\ndown in that dreadful battle like mountains shorn of their wings.[449]\r\nOther huge elephants, copiously shedding blood from their flanks, ripped\r\nopen by compeers, looked like mountains with (liquified) red chalk\r\nrunning down their sides (after a shower).[450] Others, slain with shafts\r\nor pierced with lances and deprived of their riders, looked like\r\nmountains deprived of their crests.[451]Some amongst them, possessed by\r\nwrath and blinded (with fury) in consequence of the juice (trickling down\r\ntheir temples and cheeks).[452] and no longer restrained with the hook,\r\ncrushed cars and steeds and foot-soldiers in that battle by hundreds. And\r\nso steeds, attacked by horsemen with bearded darts and lances, rushed\r\nagainst their assailants, as if agitating the points of the compass.\r\nCar-warriors of noble parentage and prepared to lay down their lives,\r\nencountering car-warriors, fought fearlessly, relying upon their utmost\r\nmight. The combatants, O king, seeking glory or heaven, struck one\r\nanother in that awful press, as if in a marriage by self-choice. During\r\nhowever, that dreadful battle making the hair stand on end, the\r\nDhartarashtra troops generally were made to run their backs on the field.\""

And filled with\r\nrage, and aiming a sharp crescent-shaped shaft winged with feathers, he\r\ncut off Bhimasena's bow. And that mighty car-warrior, noticing an\r\nopportunity, quickly aimed at his adversary a whetted shaft capable of\r\nriving the very hills. With that (shaft), that mighty-armed (warrior)\r\nstruck Bhimasena in the chest. Deeply pierced with that arrow, and\r\nexceedingly pained, and licking the corners of his mouth, Bhimasena of\r\ngreat energy caught hold of his flag-staff decked with gold. Beholding\r\nBhimasena in that cheerless state, Ghatotkacha blazed up with wrath like\r\nan all-consuming conflagration. Then many mighty car-warriors of the\r\nPandava army, headed by Abhimanyu and with wrath generated (in their\r\nbosoms), rushed at the king shouting loudly. Beholding them (thus)\r\nadvancing (to the fight) filled with wrath and in great fury,\r\nBharadwaja's son addressing the mighty car-warriors (of thy side), said\r\nthese words,--'Go quickly, blessed be ye, and protect the king. Sinking\r\nin an ocean of distress, he is placed in a situation of great danger.\r\nThese mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, these great bowmen,\r\nplacing Bhimasena at their head, are rushing towards Duryodhana, shooting\r\nand hurling diverse kinds of weapons, resolved upon winning success,\r\nuttering terrible shouts, and frightening the kings (on your side)'.\r\nHearing these words of the preceptor, many warriors of thy side headed by\r\nSomadatta rushed upon the Pandava ranks. Kripa and Bhurisravas and Salya,\r\nand Drona's son and Vivingsati, and Chitrasena and Vikarna, and the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, and Vrihadvala, and those two mighty bowmen, viz., the\r\ntwo princes of Avanti, surrounded the Kuru king. Advancing only twenty\r\nsteps, the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras began to strike, desirous of\r\nslaughtering each other. The mighty-armed son of Bharadwaja also, having\r\nsaid those words (unto the Dhartarashtra warriors), stretched his own\r\nlarge bow and pierced Bhima with six and twenty arrows. And once again\r\nthat mighty car-warrior speedily covered Bhimasena with a shower of\r\narrows like a mass of clouds dropping torrents of rain on the\r\nmountain-breasts in the rainy season. That mighty bowman Bhimasena,\r\nhowever, of great strength, speedily pierced him in return with ten\r\nshafts on the left side. Deeply pierced with those arrows and exceedingly\r\npained, O Bharata, the preceptor, enfeebled as he is with age, suddenly\r\nsat down on the terrace of his car, deprived of consciousness. Beholding\r\nhim thus pained, king Duryodhana himself, and Aswatthaman also, excited\r\nwith wrath, both rushed towards Bhimasena. Beholding those two warriors\r\nadvance, each like Yama as he shows himself at the end of the Yuga, the\r\nmighty-armed Bhimasena, quickly taking up a mace, and jumping down from\r\nhis car without loss of time, stood immovable like a hill, with that\r\nheavy mace resembling the very club of Yama, upraised in battle.\r\nBeholding him with mace (thus) upraised and looking (on that account)\r\nlike the crested Kailasa, both the Kuru king and Drona's son rushed\r\ntowards him. Then the mighty Bhimasena himself rushed impetuously at\r\nthose two foremost of men thus rushing together towards him with great\r\nspeed. Beholding him thus rushing in fury and with terrible expression of\r\nface, many mighty car-warriors of the Kaurava army speedily proceeded\r\ntowards him. Those car-warriors headed by Bharadwaja's son, impelled by\r\nthe desire of slaughtering Bhimasena, hurled at his breast diverse kinds\r\nof weapons, and thus all of them together afflicted Bhima from all sides.\r\nBeholding that mighty car-warrior thus afflicted and placed in a\r\nsituation of great peril, many mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army,\r\nheaded by Abhimanyu, and prepared to lay down dear life itself, rushed to\r\nthe spot, desirous of rescuing him. The heroic ruler of the low country,\r\nthe dear friend of Bhima, viz., Nila, looking like a mass of blue clouds,\r\nrushed at Drona's son, filled with wrath. A great bowman, Nila always\r\ndesired an encounter with Drona's son. Drawing his large bow, he pierced\r\nthe son of Drona with many winged arrows, like Sakra in days of old, O\r\nking, piercing the invincible Danava Viprachitti, that terror of the\r\ncelestials, who, moved by anger frightened the three worlds by his\r\nenergy. Pierced after the same way by Nila with his well-shot arrows\r\nwinged with feathers, Drona's son, covered with blood and exceedingly\r\npained, was filled with wrath. Drawing then his large bow, of twang loud\r\nas the roar of Indra's thunder, that foremost of intelligent persons set\r\nhis heart upon the destruction of Nila. Aiming then a few bright shafts\r\nof broad heads and sharpened by the hands of their forger, he slew the\r\nfour steeds of his adversary and overthrew also his standard. And with\r\nthe seventh shaft he pierced Nila himself in the chest. Deeply pierced\r\nand exceedingly pained, he sat down on the terrace of his car. Beholding\r\nking Nila, who looked like a mass of blue clouds, in a swoon,\r\nGhatotkacha, filled with wrath and surrounded by his kinsmen, rushed\r\nimpetuously towards Drona's son, that ornament of battle. Similarly many\r\nother Rakshasas, incapable of being easily defeated in battle, rushed at\r\nAswatthaman. Beholding then that Rakshasa of terrible mien coming towards\r\nhim, the valiant son of Bharadwaja impetuously rushed towards him. Filled\r\nwith wrath he slew many Rakshasas of formidable visage, that is, those\r\nwrathful ones amongst them who were in Ghatotkacha's van. Beholding them\r\nrepulsed from the encounter by means of the shafts shot from the bow of\r\nDrona's son, Bhimasena's son Ghatotkacha of gigantic size was filled with\r\nrage. He then exhibited a fierce and awful illusion. Therewith that\r\nprince of the Rakshasas, endued with extraordinary powers of illusion,\r\nconfounded the son of Drona in that battle. Then all thy troops, in\r\nconsequence of that illusion, turned their backs upon the field. They\r\nbeheld one another cut down and lying prostrate on the surface of the\r\nearth, writhing convulsively, perfectly helpless, and bathed in blood.\r\nDrona and Duryodhana and Salya and Aswatthaman, and other great bowmen\r\nthat were regarded as foremost among the Kauravas, also seemed to fly\r\naway. All the car-warriors seemed to be crushed, and all the kings seemed\r\nto be slain. And horses and horse-riders seemed to be cut down in\r\nthousands. Beholding all this, thy troops fled away towards their tents.\r\nAnd although, O king, both myself and Devavrata cried out at the top of\r\nour voices, saying, 'Fight, do not fly away, all this is Rakshasa\r\nillusion in battle, applied by Ghatotkacha.' Yet they stopped not, their\r\nsenses having been confounded. Although both of us said so, still struck\r\nwith panic, they gave no credit to our words. Beholding them fly away the\r\nPandavas regarded the victory to be theirs. With Ghatotkacha (among them)\r\nthey uttered many leonine shouts. And all around they filled the air with\r\ntheir shouts mingled with the blare of their conches and the beat of\r\ntheir drums. It was thus that thy whole army, routed by the wicked\r\nGhatotkacha, towards the hour of sunset, fled away in all directions.'\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"After that great battle, king Duryodhana, approaching\r\nGanga's son and saluting him with humility, began to narrate to him all\r\nthat had happened about the victory won by Ghatotkacha and his own\r\ndefeat. That invincible warrior, O king, sighing repeatedly, said these\r\nwords unto Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kurus, 'O lord, relying upon\r\nthee, as Vasudeva hath been (relied upon) by the foe, a fierce war hath\r\nbeen commenced by me with the Pandavas. These eleven Akshauhinis of\r\ncelebrated troops that I have, are, with myself, obedient to thy command,\r\nO chastiser of foes. O tiger among the Bharatas, though thus situated,\r\nyet have I been defeated into battle by the Pandava warriors headed by\r\nBhimasena relying upon Ghatotkacha. It is this that consumeth my limbs\r\nlike fire consuming dry tree. O blessed one, O chastiser of foes, I\r\ntherefore, desire, through thy grace, O grandsire, to slay Ghatotkacha\r\nmyself, that worst of Rakshasas, relying upon thy invincible self. It\r\nbehoveth thee to see that wish of mine may be fulfilled.' Hearing these\r\nwords of the king, that foremost one among the Bharatas, viz., Bhishma,\r\nthe son of Santanu, said these words unto Duryodhana, 'Listen, O king, to\r\nthese words of mine that I say unto thee, O thou of Kuru's race, about\r\nthe way in which thou, O chastiser of foes, shouldst always behave. One's\r\nown self, under all circumstances, should be protected in battle, O\r\nrepressor of foes. Thou shouldst always, O sinless one, battle with king\r\nYudhishthira--the Just, or with Arjuna, or with the twins, or with\r\nBhimasena. Keeping the duty of a king before himself, a king striketh a\r\nking. Myself, and Drona, and Kripa, and Drona's son, and Kritavarman of\r\nthe Satwata race, and Salya, and Somadatta's son, and that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Vikarna, and thy heroic brothers headed by Dussasana, will\r\nall, for thy sake, battle against that mighty Rakshasas. Or if thy grief\r\non account of that fierce prince of the Rakshasas be too great, let this\r\none proceed in battle against that wicked warrior, that is to say, king\r\nBhagadatta who is equal unto Purandara himself in fight'. Having said\r\nthis much unto the king, the grandsire skilled in speech then addressed\r\nBhagadatta in the presence of the (Kuru) king, saying, 'Proceed quickly,\r\nO great monarch, against that invincible warrior, viz., the son of\r\nHidimva. Resist in battle, with care, and in view of all the bowmen, that\r\nRakshasa of cruel deeds, like Indra in days of old resisting Taraka. Thy\r\nweapons are celestial. Thy prowess also is great, O chastiser of foes. In\r\ndays of old many have been the encounters that thou hadst with Asura, O\r\ntiger among kings, thou art that Rakshasa's match in great battle.\r\nStrongly supported by thy own troops, slay, O king, that bull among\r\nRakshasas'. Hearing these words of Bhishma the generalissimo (of the\r\nKaurava army), Bhagadatta specially set out with a leonine roar facing\r\nthe ranks of the foe. Beholding him advance towards them like a mass of\r\nroaring clouds, many mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army proceeded\r\nagainst him, inflamed with wrath. They were Bhimasena, and Abhimanyu and\r\nthe Rakshasa Ghatotkacha; and the sons of Draupadi, and Satyadhriti, and\r\nKshatradeva, O sire, and the rulers of the Chedis, and Vasudana, and the\r\nking of the Dasarnas. Bhagadatta then, on his elephant named Supratika,\r\nrushed against them. Then commenced a fierce and awful battle between the\r\nPandavas and Bhagadatta, that increased the population of Yama's kingdom.\r\nShafts of terrible energy and great impetuosity, shot by car-warriors,\r\nfell, O king, on elephants and cars. Huge elephants with rent temples and\r\ntrained (to the fight) by their guides, approaching fell upon one another\r\nfearlessly. Blind (with fury) in consequence of the temporal juice\r\ntrickling down their bodies, and excited with rage, attacking one another\r\nwith their tusks resembling stout bludgeons, they pierced one another\r\nwith the points of those weapons.[453] Graced with excellent tails, and\r\nridden by warriors armed with lances, steeds, urged by those riders fell\r\nfearlessly and with great impetuosity upon one another. And\r\nfoot-soldiers, attacked by bodies of foot-soldiers with darts and lances,\r\nfell down on the earth by hundreds and thousands. And car-warriors upon\r\ntheir cars, slaughtering heroic adversaries in that battle by means of\r\nbarbed arrows and muskets and shafts, uttered leonine shouts.[454] And\r\nduring the progress of the battle making the hair stand on end, that\r\ngreat bowman, viz., Bhagadatta, rushed towards Bhimasena, on his elephant\r\nof rent temples and with juice trickling down in seven currents and\r\nresembling (on that account) a mountain with (as many) rillets flowing\r\ndown its breast after a shower. And he came, O sinless one, scattering\r\nthousands of arrows from the head of Supratika (whereon he stood) like\r\nthe illustrious Purandara himself on his Airavata. King Bhagadatta\r\nafflicted Bhimasena with that arrowy shower like the clouds afflicting\r\nthe mountain breast with torrents of rain on the expiry of summer. That\r\nmighty bowman Bhimasena, however, excited with rage, slew by his arrowy\r\nshowers the combatants numbering more than a hundred, that protected the\r\nflanks and rear of Bhagadatta.[455] Beholding them slain, the valiant\r\nBhagadatta, filled with rage, urged his prince of elephants towards\r\nBhimasena's car. That elephant, thus urged by him, rushed impetuously\r\nlike an arrow propelled from the bowstring towards Bhimasena, that\r\nchastiser of foes. Beholding that elephant advancing, the mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Pandava army, placing Bhimasena at their head,\r\nthemselves rushed towards it. Those warriors were the (five) Kekaya\r\nprinces, and Abhimanyu, and the (five) sons of Draupadi and the heroic\r\nruler of the Dasarnas, and Kshatradeva also, O sire, and the ruler of the\r\nChedis, and Chitraketu. And all these mighty warriors came, inflamed with\r\nanger, and exhibiting their excellent celestial weapons. And they all\r\nsurrounded in anger that single elephant (on which their adversary rode).\r\nPierced with many shafts, that huge elephant, covered with gore flowing\r\nfrom his wounds, looked resplendent like a prince of mountain variegated\r\nwith (liquified) red chalk (after a shower). The ruler of the Dasarnas\r\nthen, on an elephant that resembled a mountain, rushed towards\r\nBhagadatta's elephant. That prince of elephants, however, viz.,\r\nSupratika, bore (the rush of) that advancing compeer like the continent\r\nbearing (the rush of) the surging sea. Beholding that elephant of the\r\nhigh souled king of the Dasarnas thus resisted, even the Pandava troops,\r\napplauding, cried out 'Excellent, excellent!' Then that best of kings,\r\nviz., the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, excited with rage, sped four and\r\nten lances at that elephant. These, speedily penetrating through the\r\nexcellent armour, decked with gold, that covered the animal's body,\r\nentered into it, like snakes entering anthills. Deeply pierced and\r\nexceedingly pained, that elephant, O chief of the Bharatas, its fury\r\nquelled, speedily turned back with great force. And it fled away with\r\ngreat swiftness, uttering frightful shrieks, and crushing the Pandava\r\nranks like the tempest crushing trees with its violence. After that\r\nelephant was (thus) vanquished, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava\r\narmy, uttering loud leonine shouts, approached for battle. Placing Bhima\r\nat their head, they rushed at Bhagadatta scattering diverse kinds of\r\narrows and diverse kinds of weapons. Hearing the fierce shouts, O king,\r\nof those advancing warriors swelling with rage and vengeance, that great\r\nbowman Bhagadatta, filled with rage and perfectly fearless, urged his own\r\nelephant. That prince of elephants then, thus urged with the hook and the\r\ntoe, soon assumed the form of the (all-destructive) Samvarta fire (that\r\nappears at the end of the Yuga). Crushing crowds of cars and (hostile)\r\ncompeers and steeds with riders, in that battle, it began, O king, to\r\nturn hither and thither. Filled with rage it also crushed foot-soldiers\r\nby hundreds and thousands. Attacked and agitated by that elephant, that\r\nlarge force of the Pandavas shrank in dimensions, O king, like a piece of\r\nleather exposed to the heat of fire. Beholding, then the Pandava array\r\nbroken by the intelligent Bhagadatta, Ghatotkacha, of fierce mien, O\r\nking, with blazing face and eyes red as fire, filled with rage, rushed\r\ntowards him. Assuming a terrible form and burning with wrath, he took up\r\na bright dart capable of riving the very hills. Endued with great\r\nstrength, he forcibly hurled that dart that emitted blazing flames from\r\nevery part desirous of slaying that elephant. Beholding it coursing\r\ntowards him with great impetuosity, the ruler of the Pragjyotishas sped\r\nat it a beautiful but fierce and sharp arrow with a crescent head.\r\nPossessed of great energy he cut off that dart with that arrow of his.\r\nThereupon that dart, decked with gold, thus divided in twain, dropped\r\ndown on the ground, like the bolt of heaven, hurled by Indra, flashing\r\nthrough the welkin. Beholding that dart (of his adversary), O king,\r\ndivided in twain and fallen on the ground, Bhagadatta took up a large\r\njavelin furnished with a golden staff and resembling a flame of fire in\r\neffulgence, and hurled it at the Rakshasa, saying, 'Wait, Wait'. Seeing\r\nit coursing towards him like the bolt of heaven through the welkin, the\r\nRakshasa jumped up and speedily seizing it uttered a loud shout. And\r\nquickly placing it against his knee, O Bharata, he broke it in the very\r\nsight of all the kings. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Beholding\r\nthat feat achieved by the mighty Rakshasa, the celestials in the\r\nfirmament, with the Gandharvas  and the Munis, were filled with wonder.\r\nAnd the Pandava warriors also, headed by Bhimasena, filled the earth with\r\ncries of 'Excellent, Excellent'. Hearing, however, those loud shouts of\r\nthe rejoicing Pandavas, that great bowman, viz., the valiant Bhagadatta,\r\ncould not bear it (coolly). Drawing his large bow whose effulgence\r\nresembled that of Indra's bolt, he roared with great energy at the mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Pandava army, shooting at the same time many bright\r\narrows of great sharpness and possessed of the effulgence of fire. And he\r\npierced Bhima with one arrow, and the Rakshasa with nine. And he pierced\r\nAbhimanyu with three, and the Kekaya brothers with five. And with another\r\nstraight arrow shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, he\r\npierced, in that battle, the right arm of Kshatradeva. Thereupon the\r\nlatter's bow with arrow fixed on the bowstring dropped down from his\r\nhand. And he struck the five sons of Draupadi with five arrows. And from\r\nwrath, he slew the steeds of Bhimasena. And with three shafts winged with\r\nfeathers, he cut down Bhimasena's standard bearing the device of a lion.\r\nAnd with three other shafts he pierced Bhima's charioteer. Deeply pierced\r\nby Bhagadatta in that battle, and exceedingly pained, Visoka thereupon, O\r\nchief of the Bharatas, sat down on the terrace of the car. Then, O king,\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, viz., Bhima, thus deprived of his car,\r\nquickly jumped down from his large vehicle taking up his mace. Beholding\r\nhim with mace upraised and looking like a crested hill, all thy troops, O\r\nBharata, became filled with great fear. Just at this time that son of\r\nPandu who had Krishna for his charioteer, O king, slaughtering the foe on\r\nall sides as he came, appeared at that spot where those tigers among men,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhimasena and Ghatotkacha, sire and son,\r\nwere engaged with the ruler of the Pragjyotishas. Beholding his brothers,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, engaged in battle, that son of Pandu quickly\r\ncommenced to fight, profusely scattering his shafts, O chief of the\r\nBharatas. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., king Duryodhana, speedily\r\nurged on a division of his troops abounding with cars and elephants.\r\nTowards that mighty division of the Kauravas thus advancing with\r\nimpetuosity, Arjuna of white steeds rushed with great impetuosity.\r\nBhagadatta also, upon that elephant of his, O Bharata, crushing the\r\nPandava ranks, rushed towards Yudhishthira. Then commenced a fierce\r\nbattle between Bhagadatta, O sire, and the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, and\r\nthe Kekayas, with upraised weapons. Then Bhimasena, in that battle told\r\nboth Kesava and Arjuna in detail about the slaughter of Iravat as it had\r\noccurred.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Hearing that his son Iravat had been slain, Dhananjaya was\r\nfilled with great grief and sighed like a snake. And addressing Vasava in\r\nthe midst of battle, he said these words, 'Without doubt, the high-souled\r\nVidura of great wisdom had before seen (with his mind's eye) this awful\r\ndestruction of the Kurus and the Pandavas. It was for this that he\r\nforbade king Dhritarashtra.[456] In this battle, O slayer of Madhu, many\r\nother heroes have been slain by the Kaurava and many amongst the Kauravas\r\nhave similarly been slain by ourselves. O best of men, for the sake of\r\nwealth vile acts are being done. Fie upon that wealth for the sake of\r\nwhich such slaughter of kinsmen is being perpetrated. For him that hath\r\nno wealth, even death would be better than the acquisition of wealth by\r\nthe slaughter of kinsmen. What, O Krishna, shall we gain by slaying our\r\nassembled kinsmen? Alas, for Duryodhana's, fault, and also of Sakuni the\r\nson of Suvala, as also through the evil counsels of Karna, the Kshatriya\r\nrace is being exterminated, O slayer of Madhu, I now understand, O\r\nmighty-armed one, that the king acted wisely by begging of Suyodhana[457]\r\nonly half the kingdom, or, instead, only five villages. Alas, even that\r\nwas not granted by that wicked-souled wight. Beholding so many brave\r\nKshatriyas lying (dead) on the field of battle, I censure myself,\r\n(saying) fie upon the profession of a Kshatriya. The Kshatriyas will\r\nregard me powerless in battle. For this alone, I am battling. Else, O\r\nslayer of Madhu, this battle with kinsmen is distasteful to me. Urge the\r\nsteeds on with speed towards the Dhartarashtra army, I will, with my two\r\narms, reach the other shore of this ocean of battle that is so difficult\r\nto cross. There is no time, O Madhava, to lose in action'. Thus addressed\r\nby Partha, Kesava, that slayer of hostile heroes, urged those steeds of\r\nwhite hue endued with the speed of the wind. Then, O Bharata, loud was\r\nthe noise that was heard among thy troops, resembling that of the ocean\r\nitself at full tide when agitated by the tempest.[458] In the afternoon,\r\nO king, the battle that ensued between Bhishma and the Pandavas was\r\nmarked by noise that resembled the roar of the clouds. Then, O king, thy\r\nsons, surrounding Drona like the Vasus surrounding Vasava, rushed in the\r\nbattle against Bhimasena. Then Santanu's son, Bhishma, and that foremost\r\nof car-warriors, viz., Kripa, and Bhagadatta, and Susarman, all went\r\ntowards Dhananjaya. And Hridika's son (Kritavarman) and Valhika rushed\r\ntowards Satyaki. And king Amvashta placed himself before Abhimanyu. And\r\nother great car-warriors, O king, encountered other great car-warriors.\r\nThen commenced a fierce battle that was terrible to behold. Bhimasena\r\nthen, I O king, beholding thy sons, blazed up with wrath in that battle,\r\nlike fire with (a libation of) clarified butter. Thy sons, however, O\r\nmonarch, covered that son of Kunti with their arrows like the clouds\r\ndrenching the mountain-breast in the season of rains. While being (thus)\r\ncovered in diverse ways by thy sons, O king, that hero, possessed of the\r\nactivity of the tiger, licked the corners of his mouth.[459] Then, O\r\nBharata, Bhima felled Vyudoroska with a sharp horse-shoe-headed arrow.\r\nThereupon that son of thine was deprived of life. With another\r\nbroad-headed arrow, well-tempered and sharp, he then felled Kundalin like\r\na lion overthrowing a smaller animal. Then, O sire, getting thy (other)\r\nsons (within reach of his arrows), he took up a number of shafts, sharp\r\nand well-tempered, and with careful aim speedily shot these at them.\r\nThose shafts, sped by that strong bowman, viz., Bhimasena, felled thy\r\nsons, those mighty car-warriors, from their vehicles. (These sons of\r\nthine that were thus slain were) Anadhriti, and Kundabhedin, and Virata,\r\nand Dirghalochana, and Dirghavahu, and Suvahu, and Kanykadhyaja. While\r\nfalling down (from their cars), O bull of Bharata's race, those heroes\r\nlooked resplendent like falling mango trees variegated with blossoms in\r\nthe spring. Then thy other sons, O monarch, fled away, regarding the\r\nmighty Bhimasena as Death himself. Then like the clouds pouring torrents\r\nof rain on the mountain breast, Drona in that battle covered with arrows\r\nfrom every side that hero who was thus consuming thy sons. The prowess\r\nthat we then beheld of Kunti's son was exceedingly wonderful, for though\r\nheld in check by Drona, he still slew thy sons. Indeed, as a bull beareth\r\na shower of rain falling from above. Bhima cheerfully bore that shower of\r\narrows shot by Drona. Wonderful, O monarch, was the feat that Vrikodara\r\nachieved there, for he slew thy sons in that battle and resisted Drona\r\nthe while. Indeed, the elder brother of Arjuna sported amongst those\r\nheroic sons o thine, like a mighty tiger, O king, among a herd of deer.\r\nAs a wolf, staying in the midst of a herd of deer, would chase and\r\nfrighten those animals, so did Vrikodara, in that battle chase and\r\nfrighten thy sons.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Ganga's son, and Bhagadatta, and that mighty car-warrior,\r\nviz., Gautama, began to resist Arjuna, that impetuous son of Pandu. That\r\nAtiratha, baffling with his weapons the weapons of those adversaries of\r\nhis in that battle, despatched many prominent heroes of thy army to the\r\nabode of Death. Abhimanyu also, with his shafts, deprived that renowned\r\nand foremost of car-warriors, viz., king Amvashta, of his car. Deprived\r\nof his car and about to be slain by the celebrated son of Subhadra, that\r\nking quickly jumped down from his car in shame, and hurled his sword in\r\nthat battle at the high-souled Abhimanyu. Then, that mighty monarch got\r\nup on the car of Hridika's son, conversant with all movements in battle,\r\nSubhadra's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, beholding that sword\r\ncoursing towards him, baffled it by the celerity of his movements. Seeing\r\nthat sword thus baffled in that battle by Subhadra's son, loud cries of\r\n'well done' 'well done' were, O king, heard among the troops. Other\r\nwarriors headed by Dhrishtadyumna battled with thy troops, while thy\r\ntroops, also, all battled with those of the Pandavas. Then, O Bharata,\r\nfierce was the engagement that took place between thine and theirs, that\r\ncombatants smiting one another with great force and achieving the most\r\ndifficult feats. Brave combatants, O sire, seizing one another by the\r\nhair, fought using their nails and teeth, and fists and knees, and palms\r\nand swords, and their well-proportioned arms. And seizing one another's\r\nlaches, they despatched one another to the abode of Yama. Sire slew son,\r\nand son slew sire. Indeed, the combatants fought with one another, using\r\nevery limb of theirs. Beautiful bows with golden staves, O Bharata,\r\nloosened from the grasp of slain warriors, and costly ornaments, and\r\nsharp shafts furnished with wings of pure gold or silver and washed with\r\noil, looked resplendent (as they lay scattered on the field), the latter\r\nresembling, in particular, snakes that had cast off their slough. And\r\nswords furnished with ivory handles decked with gold, and the shield also\r\nof bowmen, variegated with gold, lay on the field, loosened from their\r\ngrasp. Bearded darts and axes and swords and javelins, all decked with\r\ngold, beautiful coats of mail, and heavy and short bludgeons, and spiked\r\nclubs, and battle-axes, and short arrows, O sire, and elephants' housings\r\nof diverse shapes, and yak tails, and fans, lay scattered on the field.\r\nAnd mighty car-warriors lay on the field with diverse kinds of weapons in\r\ntheir hands or beside them, and looking alive, though the breath of life\r\nhad gone.[460] And men lay on the field with limbs shattered with maces\r\nand heads smashed with clubs, or crushed by elephants, steeds, and cars.\r\nAnd the earth, strewn in many places with the bodies of slain steeds,\r\nmen, and elephants, looked beautiful, O king, as if strewn with hills.\r\nAnd the field of battle lay covered with fallen darts and swords and\r\narrows and lances and scimitars and axes and bearded darts and iron crows\r\nand battle-axes, and spiked clubs and short arrows and Sataghnis[461] and\r\nbodies mangled with weapons. And, O slayer of foes, covered with blood,\r\nwarriors lay prostrate on the field, some deprived of life and therefore,\r\nin the silence of death, and others uttering low moans. And the earth,\r\nstrewn with those bodies, presented a variegated sight. And strewn with\r\nthe arms of strong warriors smeared with sandal paste and decked with\r\nleathern fences and bracelets, with tapering thighs resembling the trunks\r\nof elephants, and with fallen heads, graced with gems attached to turbans\r\nand with earrings of large-eyed combatants, O Bharata, the earth assumed\r\na beautiful sight. And the field of battle, overspread with blood, dyed\r\ncoats of mail and golden ornaments of many kinds, looked exceedingly\r\nbeautiful as if with (scattered) fires of mild flames. And with ornaments\r\nof diverse kinds fallen off from their places, with bows lying about,\r\nwith arrows of golden wings scattered around, with many broken cars\r\nadorned with rows of bells, with many slain steeds scattered about\r\ncovered with blood and with their tongues protruding, with bottoms of\r\ncars, standards, quivers, and banners, with gigantic conches, belonging\r\nto great heroes, of milky whiteness lying about, and with trunkless\r\nelephants lying prostrate, the earth looked beautiful like a damsel\r\nadorned with diverse kinds of ornaments. And there, with other elephants\r\npierced with lances and in great agony, and frequently uttering low moans\r\nwith their trunks, the field of battle looked beautiful as if with moving\r\nhills. With blankets of diverse hue, and housings of elephants, with\r\nbeautiful hooks falling about having handles decked with stones of lapis\r\nlazuli, with bells lying about that had adorned gigantic elephants, with\r\nclean and variegated cloths as also skins of the Ranku deer, with\r\nbeautiful neck-chains of elephants, with gold-decked girths, with broken\r\nengines of diverse kinds, with bearded darts decked with gold, with\r\nembroidered housings of steeds, embrowned with dust, with the lopped off\r\narms of cavalry soldiers, decked with bracelets and lying about, with\r\npolished and sharp lances and bright swords, with variegated head-gears\r\nfallen off (from heads) and scattered about, with beautiful\r\ncrescent-shaped arrows decked with gold, with housings of steeds, with\r\nskins of the Ranku deer, torn and crushed, with beautiful and costly gems\r\nthat decked the head-gears of kings, with their umbrellas lying about and\r\nyak tails and fans, with faces, bright as the lotus or the moon, of\r\nheroic warriors, decked with beautiful ear-rings and graced with well-cut\r\nbeards, lying about and radiant with other ornaments of gold, the earth\r\nlooked like the firmament besmangled with planets and stars. Thus, O\r\nBharata, the two armies, viz., thine and theirs, encountering each other\r\nin battle, crushed each other. And after the combatants had been\r\nfatigued, routed, and crushed, O Bharata, dark night set in and the\r\nbattle could no longer be seen. Thereupon both the Kurus and the Pandavas\r\nwithdrew their armies, when that awful night of pitchy darkness came. And\r\nhaving withdrawn their troops, both the Kurus and the Pandavas took rest\r\nfor the night, retiring to their respective tents."

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Then king Duryodhana, and Sakuni the son of Suvala, and\r\nthy son Dussasana, and the invincible Suta's son (Karna) meeting\r\ntogether, consulted in the following way. How could the sons of Pandu,\r\nwith their followers, be vanquished in battle? Even this was the subject\r\nof their consultation. Then king Duryodhana, addressing the Suta's son\r\nand the mighty Sakuni, said unto all those counsellors of his, 'Drona,\r\nBhishma, and Kripa, and Salya and Somadatta's son do not resist the\r\nParthas. I do not know what the cause is of such conduct (of theirs).\r\nUnslain by any of these, the Pandavas are destroying my forces.\r\nTherefore, O Karna, I am becoming weaker in strength and my weapons also\r\nare being exhausted'. I am deceived by the heroic Pandavas--they that are\r\nincapable of being vanquished by the very gods. Doubt filleth my mind as\r\nto how, indeed, I shall succeed is smiting them in battle.' Unto the king\r\nwho said so, O great monarch, the Suta's son answered, 'Do not grieve, O\r\nchief of the Bharata. Even I will do what is agreeable to thee. Let\r\nSantanu's son Bhishma soon withdraw from the great battle. After Ganga's\r\nson will have withdrawn from the fight and laid aside his weapons, I will\r\nslay the Partha along with all the Somakas, in the very sight of Bhishma.\r\nI pledge my truth, O king. Indeed, Bhishma every day showeth mercy\r\ntowards the Pandavas. He is, besides incapable of vanquishing those\r\nmighty car-warriors. Bhishma is proud of showing his prowess in battle.\r\nHe is again, very fond of fight. Why, O sire, will he, therefore,\r\nvanquish the assembled Pandavas (for then the battle will be over)?\r\nTherefore, repairing without delay to the tent of Bhishma, solicit that\r\nold and reverend signior to lay aside his weapons. After he will have\r\nlaid aside his weapons, O Bharata, think the Pandavas as already slain,\r\nwith all their friends and kinsmen, O king, by myself alone.' Thus\r\naddressed by Karna, thy son Duryodhana then said unto his brother\r\nDussasana these words, 'See, O Dussasana, that without delay that all who\r\nwalk in my train be dressed.' Having said these words, O monarch, the\r\nking addressed Karna, saying, 'Having caused Bhishma, that foremost of\r\nmen, to consent to this, I will, without delay, come to thee, O chastiser\r\nof foes. After Bhishma will have retired from the fight, thou wilt smite\r\n(the foe) in battle'. Then thy son, O monarch, set out without delay,\r\naccompanied by his brothers like He of a hundred sacrifices (accompanied)\r\nby the gods. Then his brother Dussasana caused that tiger among king,\r\nendued, besides, with the prowess of a tiger, to mount on his horse.\r\nGraced with bracelets, with diadem on head, and adorned with other\r\nornaments on his arms. O king, thy son shone brightly as he proceeded\r\nalong the streets. Smeared with fragrant sandal-paste of the hue of the\r\nBhandi flower and bright as burnished gold, and clad in clean vestments,\r\nand proceeding with the sportive gait of the lion, Duryodhana looked\r\nbeautiful like the Sun of brilliant radiance in the firmament. And as\r\nthat tiger among men proceeded towards the tent of Bhishma, many mighty\r\nbowmen, celebrated over the world, followed him behind. And his brothers\r\nalso walked in his train, like the celestials walking behind Vasava. And\r\nothers, foremost of men, mounted upon steeds, and others again on\r\nelephants, O Bharata, and others on cars, surrounded him on all sides.\r\nAnd many amongst those that wished him well, taking up arms for the\r\nprotection on his royal self, appeared there in large bodies, like the\r\ncelestials surrounding Sakra in heaven. The mighty chief of the Kurus,\r\nadored by all the Kauravas, thus proceeded, O king, towards the quarters\r\nof the renowned son of Ganga. Ever followed and surrounded, by his\r\nuterine brothers, he proceeded, often raising his right arm, massive and\r\nresembling the trunk of an elephant and capable of resisting all foes.\r\nAnd with that arm of his, he accepted the regards that were paid to him\r\nfrom all sides by by-standers who stood raising towards him their joined\r\nhands. And he heard, as he journeyed, the sweet voices of the natives of\r\ndiverse realms. Of great fame, he was eulogised by bards and eulogists.\r\nAnd in return that great king paid his regards unto them all. And many\r\nhigh-souled persons stood around him with lighted lamps of gold fed with\r\nfragrant oil. And surrounded with golden lamps, the king looked radiant\r\nlike the Moon attended by the blazing planets around him. And\r\n(attendants) with head-gears decked with gold, having canes and\r\nJhariharas in hand, softly caused the crowd all around to make way. The\r\nking then, having reached the excellent quarters of Bhishma, alighted\r\nfrom his horse. And arrived at Bhishma's presence, that ruler of men\r\nsaluted Bhishma and then sat himself down on an excellent seat that was\r\nmade of gold, beautiful throughout and overlaid with a rich coverlet.\r\nWith hands joined, eyes bathed in tears, and voice chocked in grief, he\r\nthen addressed Bhishma, saying, 'Taking thy protection, this battle, O\r\nslayer of foes, we ventured to vanquish the very gods and the Asuras with\r\nIndra at their head. What shall I say, therefore, of the sons of Pandu,\r\nheroic though they be, with their kinsmen and friends? Therefore, O son\r\nof Ganga, it behoveth thee, O lord, to show me mercy. Slay the brave sons\r\nof Pandu like Mahendra slaying the Danavas.--I will slay, O king, all the\r\nSomakas and the Panchalas and the Karushas along with the Kekayas, O\r\nBharata-these were thy words to me. Let these words become true. Slay the\r\nassembled Parthas, and those mighty bowmen, viz., the Somakas. Make thy\r\nwords true, O Bharata. If from kindness (for the Pandavas), O king, or\r\nfrom thy hatred of my unfortunate self, thou sparest the Pandavas, then\r\npermit Karna, that ornament of battle, to fight. He will vanquish in\r\nbattle the Parthas with all their friends and kinsmen. The king, thy son\r\nDuryodhana having said this, shut his lips without saying anything more\r\nto Bhishma of terrible prowess.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"The high-souled Bhishma, deeply pierced with wordy daggers\r\nby thy son, became filled with great grief. But he said not a single\r\ndisagreeable word in reply. Indeed, mangled by those wordy daggers and\r\nfilled with grief and rage, he sighed like a snake and reflected (in\r\nsilence) for a long while. Raising his eyes then, and as if consuming,\r\nfrom wrath, the world with the celestials, the Asuras, and the\r\nGandharvas, that foremost of persons conversant with the world, then\r\naddressed thy son and said unto him these tranquil words, 'Why, O\r\nDuryodhana, dost thou pierce me thus with thy wordy daggers? I always\r\nendeavour to the utmost of my might to achieve, and do achieve, what is\r\nfor thy good. Indeed, from desire of doing what is agreeable to thee, I\r\nam prepared to cast away my life in battle. The Pandavas are really\r\ninvincible. When the brave son of Pandu gratified Agni in the forest of\r\nKhandava, having vanquished Sakra himself in battle, even that is a\r\nsufficient indication.[462] When, O mighty-armed one, the same son of\r\nPandu rescued thee while thou wert being led away a captive by the\r\nGandharvas, even that is a sufficient indication. On that occasion, O\r\nlord, thy brave uterine brothers had all fled, as also Radha's son of the\r\nSuta caste. That (rescue, therefore, by Arjuna) is a sufficient\r\nindication. In Virata's city, alone he fell upon all of us united\r\ntogether. That is a sufficient indication. Vanquishing in battle both\r\nDrona and myself excited with rage, he took away our robes. That is a\r\nsufficient indication. On that occasion, of old, of the seizure of kine,\r\nhe vanquished that mighty bowman the son of Drona, and Saradwat also.\r\nThat is a sufficient indication. Having vanquished Karna also who is very\r\nboastful of his manliness, he gave the latter's robes unto Uttara. That\r\nis a sufficient indication. The son of Pritha defeated in battle the\r\nNivatakavachas who were incapable of defeat by Vasava himself. That is a\r\nsufficient indication. Who, indeed, is capable of vanquishing in battle\r\nthe son of Pandu by force, him, viz., that hath for his protector the\r\nProtector of the Universe armed with conch, discus, and mace? Vasudeva is\r\npossessed of infinite power, and is the Destroyer of the Universe. He is\r\nthe highest Lord of all, the God of gods, the Supreme Soul and eternal.\r\nHe hath been variously described, O king, by Narada and other great\r\nRishis. In consequence of thy folly, however, O Suyodhana, thou knowest\r\nnot what should be said and what should not. The man on the point of\r\ndeath beholdeth all trees to be made of gold. So thou also, O son of\r\nGandhari, seest everything inverted. Having provoked fierce hostilities\r\nwith the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, fight now (thyself) with them in\r\nbattle. Let us see thee act like a man. As regards myself, I will, O\r\ntiger among men, slay all the Somakas and the Panchalas assembled\r\ntogether, avoiding Sikhandin alone. Slain by them in battle, I will go to\r\nYama's abode, or slaying them in battle, I will give thee joy. Sikhandin\r\nwas born in Drupada's palace as female at first. She became a male in\r\nconsequence of the grant of a boon. After all, however, she is\r\nSikhandini. Him I will not slay even if I have to lose my life, O\r\nBharata. She is the same Sikhandini that the Creator had first made her.\r\nPass the night in happy sleep, O son of Gandhari. Tomorrow I will fight a\r\nfierce battle about which men will speak as long as the world lasts.'\r\nThus addressed by him, thy son, O monarch, came away. And saluting his\r\nsignior with a bow of the head, he came back to his own tent. Coming\r\nback, the king dismissed his attendants. And soon then that destroyer of\r\nfoes entered his abode. And having entered (his tent) the monarch passed\r\nthe night (in. sleep). And when the night dawned, rising up, the king,\r\nordered all the royal warriors, saying, Draw up the forces. Today\r\nBhishma, excited with wrath, will slay all the Somakas.'\r\n\r\nHearing those copious lamentations of Duryodhana in the night, Bhishma\r\nregarded them, O king, as commands to himself. Filled with great grief\r\nand deprecating the status of servitude, Santanu's son reflected for a\r\nlong time, thinking of an encounter with Arjuna in battle. Understanding\r\nfrom signs that Ganga's son had been thinking of that, Duryodhana, O\r\nking, commanding Dussasana, saying, 'O Dussasana, let cars be quickly\r\nappointed for protecting Bhishma. Let all the two and twenty divisions\r\n(of our army) be urged on. That hath now come about which we had been\r\nthinking for a series of years, viz., the slaughter of the Pandavas with\r\nall their troops and the acquisition (by ourselves) of the kingdom. In\r\nthis matter, I think, the protection of Bhishma is our foremost duty.\r\nProtected by us, he will protect us and slay the Parthas in battle. Of\r\ncleansed soul, he said unto me,--I will not slay Sikhandini. He was a\r\nfemale before, O king, and, therefore, should be avoided by me in battle.\r\nThe world knoweth, O thou of mighty arms, that from desire of doing good\r\nto my father, I formerly gave up a swelling kingdom. I will not,\r\ntherefore, slay in battle, O foremost of men, any female or anybody that\r\nwas a female before. This that I tell thee is true. This Sikhandin, O\r\nking, was first born a female. Thou hast heard that story. She was born\r\nas Sikhandini after the manner I told thee before the battle began.\r\nTaking her birth as a daughter she hath become a man. Indeed, she will\r\nfight with me, but I will never shoot my arrows at her. As regards all\r\nother Kshatriyas desirous of victory to the Pandavas, O sire, whom I may\r\nget within my reach on the field of battle, I will slay them.--These were\r\nthe words that Ganga's son acquainted with the scriptures, that chief of\r\nBharata's race, said unto me. Therefore, with my whole soul I think that\r\nprotecting the son of Ganga is our foremost duty. The very wolf may slay\r\nthe lion left unprotected in the great forest. Let not Ganga's son be\r\nslain by Sikhandin like the lion slain by the wolf. Let our maternal\r\nuncle Sakuni, and Salya, and Kripa, and Drona, and Vivingsati, carefully\r\nprotect the son of Ganga. If he is protected, (our) victory is certain.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Duryodhana, all surrounded Ganga's son with a\r\nlarge division of cars. And thy sons also, taking up their position\r\naround Bhishma, proceeded to battle. And they all went, shaking the earth\r\nand the welkin, and causing fear in the hearts of the Pandavas. The\r\nmighty car-warriors (of the Kaurava army), supported by those cars and\r\nelephants, and clad in mail, stood in battle, surrounding Bhishma. And\r\nall of them took up their positions for protecting that mighty\r\ncar-warrior like the celestials in the battle between themselves and the\r\nAsuras for protecting the wielder of the thunder-bolt. Then king\r\nDuryodhana once more addressing his brother, said, 'Yudhamanyu protects\r\nthe left wheel of Arjuna's car, and Uttamaujas his right wheel. And (thus\r\nprotected) Arjuna protects Sikhandin. O Dussasana, adopt such steps that,\r\nprotected by Partha, Sikhandin may not be able to slay Bhishma left\r\nunprotected by us.' Hearing these words of his brother, thy son\r\nDussasana, accompanied by the troops, advanced for battle, placing\r\nBhishma in the van. Beholding Bhishma (thus surrounded by a large number\r\nof cars), Arjuna, that foremost of car-warriors, addressed Dhrishtadyumna\r\nand said, 'O prince, place that tiger among men, Sikhandin, today in\r\nfront of Bhishma, I myself will be his protector, O prince of Panchala.\""

Drona and Bhurisravas and Salya and\r\nBhagadatta, O sire, clad in mail, took up their position in the right\r\nwing of that array. And Aswatthaman, and Somadatta, and those great\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the two princes of Avanti, accompanied by a large\r\nforce, protected the left wing. Duryodhana, O monarch, surrounded on all\r\nsides by the Trigartas, took up, for encountering the Pandavas, a\r\nposition in the midst of that array. That foremost of car-warriors, viz.,\r\nAlamvusha, and that mighty car-warrior, viz., Srutayush, clad in mail,\r\ntook up their position in the rear of that array, and therefore, of the\r\nwhole army. Having, O Bharata, on that occasion formed their array thus,\r\nthy warriors, clad in mail, looked like scorching fires.\r\n\r\n\"Then king Yudhishthira, and that son of Pandu, viz., Bhimasena, and the\r\ntwin sons of Madri, viz., Nakula and Sahadeva, clad in mail, took up\r\ntheir position in the van of that array and therefore, at the very head\r\nof all their troops. And Dhrishtadyumna, and Virata, and that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Satyaki,--these destroyers of hostile ranks,--stood,\r\nsupported by a large force. And Sikhandin, and Vijaya (Arjuna), and the\r\nRakshasa Ghatotkacha, and Chekitana of mighty arms, and the valiant\r\nKuntibhoja, stood for battle, surrounded by a large force.

Similarly the Pandavas also, O\r\nking, headed by Bhimasena, and desirous of victory in battle proceeded,\r\nfor battling with Bhishma. With leonine roars and confused cries, blowing\r\ntheir conches Krakachas, and cow-horns, beating their drums and cymbals\r\nand Pandavas in thousands.[464] And uttering terrible shouts, the\r\nPandavas advanced to battle. With the din of our drums and cymbals and\r\nconches and smaller drums, with loud leonine roars, and other kinds of\r\nshouts, ourselves also, replying to the cries of the foe, rushed against\r\nhim with great impetuosity, inflamed with rage. Those sounds mingling\r\nwith one another, produced a tremendous uproar. The warriors then, of the\r\ntwo armies, rushing at one another, began to strike. And in consequence\r\nof the din produced by that encounter, the earth seemed to tremble. And\r\nbirds, uttering fierce cries, hovered in the air. The Sun, radiant as he\r\nwas when he had risen, became dimmed. And fierce winds blew, indicating\r\ngreat terrors. Frightful jackals wandered, yelling terribly, O king, and\r\nforeboding an awful carnage at hand. The quarters seemed, O king, to be\r\nablaze, and showers of dust fell from the blue. And a shower fell there,\r\nof pieces of bones mixed with blood. And tears fell from the eyes of the\r\nanimals which were all weeping. And filled with anxiety, O king, these\r\nbegan to urinate and eject the contents of their stomachs. And the loud\r\nshouts of battle, O bull of Bharata's race, were rendered inaudible by\r\nthe louder cries of Rakshasas and cannibals.

And blazing meteors, striking against the\r\nSun's disc, fell with great celerity on the earth, foreboding great\r\nterrors. Then those two vast hosts belonging to the Pandavas and the\r\nDhartarashtras, in course of that awful encounter, shook in consequence\r\nof that tremendous uproar of conches and drums like forests shaken by the\r\ntempest.

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Then the noble Abhimanyu of great energy, borne by his\r\nsteeds of a tawny hue, rushed at the mighty host of Duryodhana,\r\nscattering his arrowy showers like the clouds pouring torrents of rain. O\r\nson of Kuru's race, thy warriors, in that battle, were unable to resist\r\nthat slayer of foes, viz., Subhadra's son, who, excited with wrath and\r\npossessed of wealth of arms, was then immersed in that inexhaustible\r\nocean of (Kaurava) forces. Death-dealing shafts, O king, shot by him in\r\nthat battle, despatched many heroic Kshatriyas to the regions of the king\r\nof the departed spirits. Indeed, excited with wrath Subhadra's son in\r\nthat battle shot fierce and blazing arrows in profusion that resembled\r\nsnakes of virulent poison or rods of death himself. And Phalguni's son\r\nspeedily split into fragments car-warriors with their cars, steeds with\r\ntheir riders, and elephant-warriors along with the huge animals they\r\nrode. And the rulers of the earth, filled with joy, applauded those\r\nmighty feats in battle and praised him also that achieved them. And the\r\nson of Subhadra, O Bharata, tossed those divisions (of the Kaurava army)\r\nlike the tempest tossing a heap of cotton on all sides in the welkin.\r\nRouted by him, O Bharata, the troops failed to find a protector, like\r\nelephants sunk in a slough. Then, O best of men, having routed all\r\ntroops, Abhimanyu stood, O king, like a blazing fire without a curl of\r\nsmoke. Indeed, O king, thy warriors were incapable of bearing that slayer\r\nof foes, like insects impelled by fate unable to bear a blazing fire.\r\nThat mighty car-warrior and great bowman, having struck all the foes of\r\nthe Pandavas, looked at that moment like Vasava himself armed with the\r\nthunder. And his bow, the back of whose staff was decked with gold, as it\r\nmoved on every side, seemed, O king, like the lightning's flash as it\r\nspotted amid the clouds. And well-tempered and sharp shafts came from his\r\nbow-string in that battle like flights of bees, O king, from blossoming\r\ntrees in the forest. And as the high-souled son of Subhadra careered on\r\nthe field on his car whose limbs were decked with gold, people were\r\nincapable of finding an opportunity (for striking him). Confounding Kripa\r\nand Drona and mighty son of Drona, as also the ruler of the Sindhus, the\r\ngreat bowman moved on the field of battle with great activity and skill.\r\nAs he consumed thy troops, O Bharata, I beheld his bow incessantly drawn\r\nto a circle and resembling on that account the circular halo of light\r\nthat is sometimes seen around the Sun. Brave Kshatriyas, beholding him\r\nendued with such activity and scorching the foe thus, thought, in\r\nconsequence of those feats, that the world contained two Phalgunis.\r\nIndeed, O king, the vast host of the Bharatas, afflicted by him, reeled\r\nhither and thither like a woman drunk with wine. Routing that large army\r\nand causing many mighty car-warriors to tremble, he gladdened his friends\r\n(like Vasava gladdening the celestials) after vanquishing Maya. And while\r\nbeing routed by him in that battle, thy troops uttered loud exclamations\r\nof woe that resembled the roar of the clouds. Hearing that awful wail thy\r\ntroops, O Bharata, that resembled the roar of the very sea at full tide\r\nwhen agitated by the winds, Duryodhana then, O king, addressed the son of\r\nRishyasringa and said, 'This Abhimanyu singly, O thou of mighty arms,\r\nlike a second Phalguni, routeth from rage (my) army like Vritra routing\r\nthe celestial host. I do not see any other efficacious medicine for him\r\nin battle than thyself, O best of Rakshasas, that art well-skilled in\r\nevery science. Therefore, go speedily and slay the heroic son of Subhadra\r\nin battle. As regards ourselves, headed by Bhishma and Drona, we will\r\nslay Partha himself.' Thus addressed, the mighty and valiant Rakshasa\r\nspeedily went to battle at the command of thy son, uttering loud roars\r\nlike the clouds themselves in the season of rains. And in consequence of\r\nthat loud noise, O king, the vast host of the Pandavas trembled\r\nthroughout like the ocean when agitated by the wind. And many combatants,\r\nO king, terrified by those roars, giving up dear life, fell prostrate on\r\nthe earth. Filled with joy and taking up his bow with arrow fixed on the\r\nstring, and apparently dancing on the terrace of his car, that Rakshasa\r\nproceeded against Abhimanyu himself. Then the angry Rakshasa, having in\r\nthat battle got Arjuna's son within reach, began to rout his ranks,--even\r\nthose that stood not far from him. Indeed, the Rakshasa rushed in battle\r\nagainst that mighty Pandava host which he began to slaughter, like Vala\r\nrushing against the celestial host. Attacked in battle by that Rakshasa\r\nof terrible mien, the slaughter was very great, O sire, that took place\r\namongst those troops. Exhibiting his prowess, the Rakshasa began to rout\r\nthat vast force of the Pandavas, with thousands of arrows. Thus\r\nslaughtered by that Rakshasa of terrible visage, the Pandava army fled\r\naway from excess of fear. Grinding that army like an elephant grinding\r\nlotus-stalks, the mighty Rakshasa then rushed in battle against the sons\r\nof Draupadi. Then those great bowmen, accomplished in fighting, viz., the\r\nsons of Draupadi, rushed towards the Rakshasa in battle like five planets\r\nrushing against the Sun. That best of Rakshasa then was afflicted by\r\nthose brothers endued with great energy, like the Moon afflicted by the\r\nfive planets of the awful occasion of the dissolution of the world. Then\r\nthe mighty Prativindhya quickly pierced the Rakshasa with whetted shafts,\r\nsharp as battle-axes and furnished with points capable of penetrating\r\nevery armour. Thereupon that foremost of Rakshasas, with his armour\r\npierced through, looked like a mass of clouds penetrated by the rays of\r\nthe Sun. Pierced with these shafts furnished with golden wings,\r\nRishyasringa's son, O king, looked resplendent like a mountain with\r\nblazing crests. Then those five brothers in that great battle, pierced\r\nthat foremost of Rakshasas with many whetted shafts of golden wings.\r\nPierced with those terrible shafts resembling angry snakes, Alamvusha, O\r\nking, became inflamed with rage like the king of the serpents himself.\r\nDeeply pierced, O king, within only a few moments, O sire, by those great\r\ncar-warriors, the Rakshasa, much afflicted, remained senseless for a long\r\nwhile. Regaining his consciousness then, and swelling through rage to\r\ntwice his dimensions, he cut off their arrows and standards and bows. And\r\nas if smiling the while he struck each of them with five arrows. Then\r\nthat mighty Rakshasa and great car-warrior, Alamvusha, excited with\r\nwrath, and as if dancing on the terrace of his car, quickly slew the\r\nsteeds, and then the charioteers, of those five illustrious adversaries\r\nof his. And burning with rage he once more pierced them with sharp arrows\r\nof diverse shades by hundreds and thousands. Then that wanderer of the\r\nnight, viz., the Rakshasa Alamvusha, having deprived those great bowmen\r\nof their cars, rushed impetuously at them, wishing to despatch them to\r\nYama's abode. Beholding them (thus) afflicted in battle by that\r\nwicked-souled Rakshasa, the son of Arjuna rushed at him. Then the battle\r\nthat took place between him and the cannibal resembled that between\r\nVritra and Vasava. And the mighty car-warriors of thy army, as also of\r\nthe Pandavas, all became spectators of that engagement. Encountering each\r\nother in fierce battle, blazing with wrath, endued with great might, and\r\nwith eyes red in rage, each beheld the other in that battle to resemble\r\nthe Yuga fire. And that engagement between them became fierce and awful\r\nlike that between Sakra and Samvara in days of old in the battle between\r\nthe gods and Asuras.\""

Tell me all this in detail,\r\nexactly as it happened in that fight. What also did Bhima, that foremost\r\nof car-warriors, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and Nakula, and Sahadeva\r\nand the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, and Dhananjaya, do with my troops in\r\nbattle? Tell me all this truly, O Sanjaya, for thou art skilled (in\r\nnarration).\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"I will presently describe to thee, O sire, the awful\r\nbattle that took place between that foremost of the Rakshasas and the son\r\nof Subhadra. I will also describe to thee the prowess that Arjuna put\r\nforth in battle, and Bhimasena the son of Pandu and Nakula, and Sahadeva,\r\nas also the warriors of thy army headed by Bhishma and Drona, all of whom\r\nfearlessly achieved wonderful feats of diverse kinds, Alamvusha, uttering\r\nloud shouts and repeatedly roaring at Abhimanyu, rushed impetuously\r\nagainst that mighty car-warrior in battle, saying, 'Wait,\r\nWait'--Abhimanyu also, repeatedly roaring like a lion, rushed with at\r\ngreat force at that mighty bowman, viz., the son of Rishyasringa, who was\r\nan implacable foe of the former's sire. Soon then those two foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, man and Rakshasa, on their cars, encountered each other,\r\nlike a god and Danava. That best of Rakshasa were endued with powers of\r\nillusion, while Phalguni's son was acquainted with celestial weapons.\r\nThen Abhimanyu, O king, pierced Rishyasringa's son in that battle with\r\nthree sharp shafts and once more with five. Alamvusha, also, excited with\r\nwrath, speedily pierced Abhimanyu in the chest with nine shafts like a\r\nguide piercing an elephant with hooks. Then, O Bharata, that wanderer of\r\nthe night, endued with great activity, afflicted Arjuna's son in that\r\ncombat with a thousand arrows. Then Abhimanyu excited with rage, pierced\r\nthat prince of the Rakshasas in his wide chest with nine straight shafts\r\nof great sharpness. Piercing through his body these penetrated into his\r\nvery vitals. And that best of Rakshasas, his limbs mangled by them,\r\nlooked beautiful like a mountain overgrown with flowering Kinsukas.\r\nBearing those shafts of golden wings on his body, that mighty prince of\r\nRakshasas looked radiant like a mountain on fire. Then the vindictive son\r\nof Rishyasringa, inflamed with wrath, covered Abhimanyu, who was equal\r\nunto Mahendra himself, with clouds of winged arrows. Those sharp shafts\r\nresembling the rods of Yama himself, shot by him, pierced Abhimanyu\r\nthrough and entered the earth. And similarly the gold-decked arrows shot\r\nby Arjuna's son, piercing Alamvusha through, entered the earth. The son\r\nof Subhadra then, in that battle, with his straight shafts, obliged the\r\nRakshasa to turn his back upon the field, like Sakra repulsing Maya in\r\ndays of old. That scorcher of foes, the Rakshasa, then, thus repulsed and\r\nstruck repeatedly by his adversary, exhibited his great powers of\r\nillusion by causing a thick darkness to set in. Then all the combatants\r\nthere, O king, were covered by that darkness. Neither could Abhimanyu be\r\nseen, nor could friends be distinguished from foes in that battle.\r\nAbhimanyu, however, beholding that thick and awful gloom, invoked into\r\nexistence. O son of Kuru's race, the blazing solar weapon. Thereupon, O\r\nking, the universe once more became visible. And thus he neutralised the\r\nillusion of that wicked Rakshasa. Then that prince of men, excited with\r\nwrath and endued with great energy, covered that foremost of Rakshasa in\r\nthat battle with many straight shafts. Diverse other kinds of illusion\r\nwere conjured up there by that Rakshasa. Conversant with all weapons, the\r\nson of Phalguni however, neutralised them all. The Rakshasa then, his\r\nillusions all destroyed, and himself struck with shafts, abandoned his\r\ncar even there, and fled away in great fear. After that Rakshasa addicted\r\nto unfair fight had been thus vanquished, the son of Arjuna began to\r\ngrind thy troops in battle, like a juice-blind prince of wild elephants\r\nagitating a lake overgrown with lotus.[465] Then Bhishma the son of\r\nSantanu, beholding his troops routed, covered Subhadra's son with a thick\r\nshower of arrows. Then many mighty car-warriors of the Dhartarashtra\r\narmy, standing in a ring round that single hero, began to strike him\r\nforcibly with their shafts. That hero then, who resembled his sire in\r\nprowess and who was equal to Vasudeva in valour and might,--that foremost\r\nof all wielders of weapons,--achieved diverse feats in that battle that\r\nwere worthy of both his sire and maternal uncle. Then the heroic\r\nDhananjaya, excited with wrath and desirous of rescuing his son, arrived\r\nat the spot where the latter was slaughtering thy troops as he came\r\nalong. And similarly, O king, thy sire Devavrata in that battle\r\napproached Partha like Rahu approaching the sun.[466] Then thy sons, O\r\nmonarch, supported by cars, elephants, and steeds, surrounded Bhishma in\r\nthat battle and protected him from every side. And so also the Pandavas,\r\nO king, clad in mail and surrounding Dhananjaya, engaged in fierce\r\nbattle, O bull of Bharata's race. Then Saradwat's son (Kripa), O king,\r\npierced Arjuna who was staying in front of Bhishma, with five and twenty\r\nshafts. Thereupon, like a tiger attacking an elephant, Satyaki,\r\napproaching Kripa, pierced him with many whetted shafts from desire of\r\ndoing what was agreeable to the Pandavas. Gautama in return, excited with\r\nwrath, quickly pierced him of Madhu's race in the chest with nine arrows\r\nwinged with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Sini's grandson also, excited\r\nwith wrath, and forcibly drawing his bow, quickly sped at him an arrow\r\ncapable of taking his life. The fiery son of Drona, however, excited with\r\nwrath, cut in twain that arrow as it coursed impetuously towards Kripa,\r\nresembling Indra's bolt in effulgence. Thereupon that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Sini's grandson, abandoning Gautama, rushed in battle\r\ntowards Drona's son like Rahu in the firmament against the Moon. Drona's\r\nson, however, O Bharata, cut Satyaki's bow in twain. After his bow had\r\nthus been cut off, the former began to strike the latter with his shafts.\r\nSatyaki then, taking up another bow capable of bearing a great strain and\r\nslaughtering the foe, struck Drona's son, O king, in the chest and arms\r\nwith six shafts. Pierced therewith and feeling great pain, for a moment\r\nhe was deprived of his senses, and he sat down on the terrace of his car,\r\ncatching hold of his flag-staff. Regaining his consciousness then, the\r\nvaliant son of Drona, excited with rage afflicted him of Vrishni's race\r\nin that battle, with one long shaft. That shaft, piercing Sini's grandson\r\nthrough, entered the earth like a vigorous young snake entering its hole\r\nin the season of spring. And with another broad-headed arrow, Drona's son\r\nin that battle cut off the excellent standard of Satyaki. And having\r\nachieved this feat he uttered a leonine roar. And once more, O Bharata,\r\nhe covered his adversary with a shower of fierce shafts like the clouds,\r\nO king covering the Sun after summer is past, Satyaki also, O monarch,\r\nbaffling that arrowy shower, soon covered the son of Drona with diverse\r\nshowers of arrows That slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the grandson of\r\nSini, freed from that arrowy shower like the Sun from the clouds, began\r\nto scorch the son of Drona (with his energy). Swelling with rage the\r\nmighty Satyaki once more covered his foe with a thousand arrows and\r\nuttered a loud shout. Beholding his son then thus afflicted like the Moon\r\nby Rahu, the valiant son of Bharadwaja rushed towards the grandson of\r\nSini. Desirous, O king, of rescuing, his son who was afflicted by the\r\nVrishni hero, Drona, in that great battle, pierced the latter with a\r\nshaft of exceeding sharpness. Satyaki then, abandoning the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Aswatthaman, pierced Drona himself in that battle with twenty\r\narrows of exceeding sharpness. Soon after, that scorcher of foes and\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., Kunti's son of immeasurable soul, excited with\r\nwrath, rushed in that battle against Drona. Then Drona and Partha\r\nencountered each other in fierce combat like the planets Budha and Sukra,\r\nO king, in the firmament.[467]"

The son of Pandu is ever dear to the wise son of Bharadwaja. The\r\npreceptor also is ever dear to Pritha's son, O Sanjaya. Both of those\r\ncar-warriors delight in battle, and both of them are fierce like lions.\r\nHow therefore, did Bharadwaja's son and Dhananjaya, both fighting with\r\ncare encounter each other in battle?\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"In battle Drona never recognises Partha as dear to\r\nhimself. Partha also, keeping a Kshatriya's duty in view, recognises not\r\nin battle his preceptor. Kshatriyas, O king, never avoid one another in\r\nbattle. Without showing any regard for one another, they fight with sires\r\nand brothers. In that battle, O Bharata, Partha pierced Drona with three\r\nshafts. Drona, however, regarded not those shafts shot in battle from\r\nPartha's bow. Indeed, Partha once more covered the preceptor in the fight\r\nwith a shower of arrows. Thereupon the latter blazed up with wrath like a\r\nconflagration in a deep forest. Then, O king, Drona soon covered Arjuna\r\nin that combat with many straight shafts, O Bharata. Then king\r\nDuryodhana, O monarch, despatched Susarman for taking up the wing of\r\nDrona. Then the ruler of the Trigartas, excited with rage and forcibly\r\ndrawing his bow, covered Partha, O king, with a profusion of arrows\r\nfurnished with iron heads. Shot by those two warriors, O king, the shafts\r\nlooked beautiful in the welkin like cranes in the autumnal sky. Those\r\nshafts, O lord, reaching the son of Kunti, entered his body like birds\r\ndisappearing within a tree bending with a load of tasteful fruits. Arjuna\r\nthen, that foremost of car-warriors, uttering a loud roar in that battle\r\npierced the ruler of the Trigartas and his son with his shafts. Pierced\r\nby Partha like Death himself at the end of the Yuga, they were unwilling\r\nto avoid Partha, resolved as they were on laying down their lives. And\r\nthey shot showers on the car of Arjuna. Arjuna, however, received those\r\narrowy showers with showers of his own, like a mountain, O monarch,\r\nreceiving a downpour from the clouds. And the lightness of hand that we\r\nthen beheld of Vibhatsu was exceedingly wonderful. For alone he baffled\r\nthat unbearable shower of arrows shot by many warriors like the wind\r\nalone scattering myriads of clouds rushing upon clouds. And at that feat\r\nof Partha, the gods and the Danavas (assembled there for witnessing the\r\nfight) were highly gratified. Then, O Bharata, engaged with the Trigartas\r\nin that battle, Partha shot, O king, the Vayavya weapon against their\r\ndivision. Then arose a wind that agitated the welkin, felled many trees,\r\nand smote down the (hostile) troops. Then Drona, beholding the fierce\r\nVayavya weapon, himself shot an awful weapon called the Saila. And when\r\nthat weapon, O ruler of men, was shot by Drona in that battle, the wind\r\nabated and the ten quarters became calm. The heroic son of Pandu,\r\nhowever, made the car-warriors of the Trigarta division destitute of\r\nprowess and hope, and caused them to turn their backs on the field. Then\r\nDuryodhana and that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Kripa, and\r\nAswatthaman, and Salya, and Sudakshina, the ruler of the Kamvojas, and\r\nVinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Valhika supported by the Valhikas, with\r\na large number of cars surrounded Partha on all sides. And similarly\r\nBhagadatta also, and the mighty Srutayush, surrounded Bhima on all sides\r\nwith an elephant division. And Bhurisravas, and Sala, and Suvala's son, O\r\nmonarch, began to check the twin sons of Madri with showers of bright and\r\nsharp arrows. Bhishma, however, in that battle, supported by the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra with their troops, approaching Yudhishthira, surrounded him\r\non all sides. Beholding that elephant division coming towards him,\r\nPirtha's son Vrikodara, possessed of great courage, began to lick the\r\ncorners of his mouth like a lion in the forest. Then Bhima, that foremost\r\nof car-warriors, taking up his mace in that great battle, quickly jumped\r\ndown from his car and struck terror into the hearts of thy warriors.\r\nBeholding him mace in hand, those elephant-warriors in that battle\r\ncarefully surrounded Bhimasena on all sides. Stationed in the midst of\r\nthose elephants, the son of Pandu looked resplendent like the Sun in the\r\nmidst of a mighty mass of clouds. Then that bull among the sons of Pandu\r\nbegan with his mace to consume that elephant-division like the wind\r\ndispelling a huge mass of clouds covering the welkin. Those tuskers,\r\nwhile being slaughtered by the mighty Bhimasena, uttered loud cries of\r\nwoe like roaring masses of clouds. With diverse scratches (on his person)\r\ninflicted by those huge animals with their tusks, the son of Pritha\r\nlooked beautiful on the field of battle like a flowering Kinsuka. Seizing\r\nsome of the elephants by their tusks, he deprived them of those weapons.\r\nWrenching out the tusks of others, with those very tusks he struck them\r\non their frontal globes and felled them in battle like the Destroyer\r\nhimself armed with his rod. Wielding his mace bathed in gore, and himself\r\nbespattered with fat and marrow and smeared with blood, he looked like\r\nRudra himself. Thus slaughtered by him, the few gigantic elephants that\r\nremained, ran away on all sides, O king, crushing even friendly ranks.\r\nAnd in consequence of those huge elephants fleeing away on all sides,\r\nDuryodhana's troops once more, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away from\r\nthe field.\""

That foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Ganga's son began to consume the ranks of the\r\nPandavas with keen shafts by hundreds and thousands. Thy sire Devavrata\r\nbegan to grind those troops like a herd of bulls grinding (with their\r\ntread) a heap of paddy sheaves. Then Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and\r\nVirata and Drupada, falling upon Bhishma in that battle, struck that\r\nmighty car-warrior with numerous arrows. Bhishma then, having pierced\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Virata each with three arrows, sped a long shaft, O\r\nBharata, at Drupada. Thus pierced in battle by Bhishma, that grinder of\r\nfoes, those great bowmen became filled with wrath O king, like snakes\r\ntrod upon (by human feet). Then Sikhandin pierced the grandsire of the\r\nBharatas (with many shafts). Of unfading glory, Bhishma, however,\r\nregarding his foe as a female struck him not. Dhrishtadyumna then, in\r\nthat battle, blazing up with wrath like fire, struck the grandsire with\r\nthree shafts in his arms and chest. And Drupada pierced Bhishma with five\r\nand twenty shafts, and Virata pierced him with ten, and Sikhandin with\r\nfive and twenty. Deeply pierced (with those shafts) he became covered\r\nwith blood, and looked beautiful like a red Asoka variegated with\r\nflowers. Then the son of Ganga pierced, in return, each of them with\r\nthree straight shafts. And then, O sire, he cut off Drupada's bow with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow. The latter then, taking up another bow, pierced\r\nBhishma with five shafts. And he pierced Bhishma's charioteer also with\r\nthree sharp shafts on the field of battle. Then the five sons of\r\nDraupadi, and the five Kaikeya brothers and Satyaki also of the Satwata\r\nrace, headed by Yudhishthira, all rushed towards Ganga's son, desirous of\r\nprotecting the Panchalas headed by Dhrishtadyumna. And so all the\r\nwarriors of thy army also, O king, prepared to protect Bhishma, rushed at\r\nthe head of their troops against the Pandava host. And then happened\r\nthere a fierce general engagement between thy army of men and steeds and\r\ntheirs, that increased the population of Yama's kingdom. And car-warriors\r\nfalling upon car-warriors despatched one another to Yama's abode. And so\r\nmen and elephant-riders and horse-riders, falling upon others (of their\r\nclass), despatched them to the other world with straight shafts And here\r\nand there on the field, O monarch, cars, deprived of riders and\r\ncharioteers by means of diverse kinds of fierce shafts, were in that\r\nbattle dragged on all sides over the field. And those cars, O king,\r\ncrushing large numbers of men and steeds in battle, were seen to resemble\r\nthe wind itself (in speed) and vapoury edifices in the firmament (for\r\ntheir picturesque forms). And many car-warriors cased in mail and endued\r\nwith great energy, decked with ear-rings and head-gears and adorned with\r\ngarlands and bracelets, resembling the children of the celestials, equal\r\nto Sakra himself for prowess in battle, surpassing Vaisravana in wealth\r\nand Vrishaspati in intelligence, ruling over extensive territories, and\r\npossessed of great heroism, O monarch, deprived of their cars, were seen\r\nto run hither and thither like ordinary men. Huge tuskers also, O chief\r\nof men, deprived of their skilled riders, ran, crushing friendly ranks,\r\nand fell down with loud shrieks. Prodigious elephants looking like\r\nnewly-risen clouds and roaring also like the clouds, were seen to run in\r\nall directions, deprived of their coats of mail. And, O sire, their\r\nChamaras and variegated standards, their umbrellas with golden staves,\r\nand the bright lances (of their riders), lay scattered about.[468] And\r\nelephant-riders, O king, deprived of their elephants, belonging both of\r\nthy army and theirs, were seen to run (on foot) amid that awful press.\r\nAnd steeds from diverse countries, decked with ornaments of gold, were\r\nseen, by hundreds and thousands, to run with the speed of the wind. And\r\nhorse-riders, deprived of their horses, and armed with swords were in\r\nthat battle seen to run, or made to run (by others assailing them).\r\nElephant, meeting with a flying elephant in that dreadful battle,\r\nproceeded, quickly crushing foot-soldiers and steeds. And, similarly, O\r\nking those prodigious creatures crushed many cars in that battle, and\r\ncars also, coming upon fallen steeds crushed them (in their course). And\r\nsteeds too, in the press of battle, crushed many foot-soldiers, O king\r\n(with their hoofs). And thus, O monarch, they crushed one another in\r\ndiverse ways.[469] And in that fierce and awful battle there flowed a\r\nterrible river of bloody current. And heaps of bows obstructed its\r\nstraight course, and the hair (of slain warriors) formed its moss. And\r\n(broken) cars formed its lakes, and arrows its eddies. And steeds formed\r\nits fishes. And heads (severed from trunks) formed its blocks of stone.\r\nAnd it abounded with elephants that formed its crocodiles. And coats of\r\nmail and head-gears formed its froth. And bows (in the hands of the\r\nwarriors) constituted the speed of its current, and swords its tortoises.\r\nAnd banners and standards in profusion formed the trees on its banks. And\r\nmortals constituted its banks which that river continually ate away. And\r\nit abounded with cannibals that formed its swans. And that stream\r\n(instead of swelling the ocean with its discharge) swelled the population\r\nof Yama's kingdom. And brave Kshatriyas,--mighty car-warriors,--casting\r\noff all fear, O king, sought to cross that river with the aid of cars,\r\nelephants, and steeds that played the part of rafts and boats. And as the\r\nriver Vaitarani beareth all departed spirits towards the domains of the\r\nKing of the Dead, so that river of bloody current bore away all timid men\r\ndeprived of their senses in a swoon. And the Kshatriyas, beholding that\r\nawful carnage, all exclaimed, saying, 'Alas, through Duryodhana's fault\r\nthe Kshatriyas are being exterminated. Why, Oh, Dhritarashtra of sinful\r\nsoul, deluded by avarice, harboured envy for the sons of Pandu, who are\r\ngraced with numerous virtues.' Diverse exclamations of this kind were\r\nheard there, made by one another, fraught with the praises of the\r\nPandavas and censure of thy sons. Hearing then these words uttered by all\r\nthe combatants, thy son Duryodhana, that offender against all, addressed\r\nBhishma and Drona and Kripa and Salya, O Bharata, saying, 'Fight ye\r\nwithout boastfulness. Why tarry ye at all?' Then the battle was resumed\r\nbetween the Kurus and the Pandavas, that fierce battle, O king, caused by\r\nthe match at dice and marked by an awful slaughter. Thou beholdest now, O\r\nson of Vichitravirya, the dreadful fruit of that rejection by thee (of\r\nthe counsels of thy friends) though warned against it by many illustrious\r\npersons. Neither the sons of Pandu, O king, nor their troops, nor they\r\nthat follow them, nor the Kauravas, show the least regard for their lives\r\nin battle. For this reason, O tiger among men, a dreadful destruction of\r\nkinsmen is taking place, caused either by Destiny or by thy evil policy,\r\nO king.\""

Susarman however, in that battle, pierced Partha with his\r\nshafts. And he pierced Vasudeva with seventy, and Arjuna once more with\r\nnine shafts. Checking those shafts by means of his arrowy showers, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Indra, despatched Susarman's troops\r\nunto Yama's abode. Those mighty car-warriors, while being slaughtered by\r\nPartha in that battle as if by Death himself at the end of the Yuga, all\r\nfled away from the field, O king struck with panic, Some abandoning their\r\nsteeds, some abandoning, O sire, their cars, and others their elephants,\r\nfled away in all directions. Others taking with them their horses,\r\nelephants, and cars, fled away, O king, with great speed. Foot-soldiers\r\nin that dreadful battle, throwing aside their weapons, and without any\r\nregard for one another, fled away hither and thither. Though forbidden by\r\nSusarman the ruler of the Trigartas, and by other foremost of kings, they\r\nstayed not yet in battle. Beholding that host routed, thy son Duryodhana\r\nhimself at the head of the whole army and with Bhishma ahead, attacked\r\nDhananjaya with all his vigour, for the sake, O king, of (protecting) the\r\nlife of the ruler of the Trigartas. And he stayed in battle, scattering\r\ndiverse kinds of arrows, supported by all his brothers. The rest of the\r\nmen all fled away. Similarly, the Pandavas, O king, clad in mail and with\r\nall their vigour, proceeded, for the sake of Phalguni, to the spot where\r\nBhishma was. Although acquainted with the awful prowess, in battle of the\r\nwielder of Gandiva, these yet proceeded with loud cries and great bravery\r\nto the spot where Bhishma was and surrounded him on all sides. Then the\r\npalmyra-bannered hero covered the Pandava army, in that battle, with his\r\nstraight shafts. The sun having reached the meridian, the Kauravas, O\r\nking, fought with the Pandavas in one confused mass. The heroic Satyaki,\r\nhaving pierced Kritavarman with five arrows, stayed in battle scattering\r\nhis arrows by thousands. And so king Drupada also, having pierced Drona\r\nwith many whetted shafts, once more pierced him with seventy shafts and\r\nhis charioteer with nine. Bhimasena also, having pierced his great\r\ngrandsire king Valhika uttered a loud roar like a tiger in the forest.\r\nArjuna's son (Abhimanyu) pierced by Chitrasena with many shafts, deeply\r\npierced Chitrasena in the chest with three arrows. Engaged with each\r\nother in battle, those two foremost of men looked resplendent on the\r\nfield like the planets, Venus and Saturn, O king, in the firmament. Then\r\nthat slayer of foes, viz., the son of Subhadra, having slain his\r\nantagonist's steeds and charioteer with nine arrows, uttered a loud\r\nshout. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior, (viz., Chitrasena), quickly\r\njumping down from that car whose steed had been slain, mounted, O king,\r\nwithout delay, the car of Durmukha. The valiant Drona, pierced the\r\nlatter's charioteer also, Then, O king, Drupada, thus afflicted at the\r\nhead of his troops, retreated by the aid of his fleet steeds,\r\nrecollecting the hostility that existed from days of old (between himself\r\nand Drona). Bhimasena, within a moment, deprived king Valhika of his\r\nsteeds, car and charioteer, in the very sight of all the troops. Fallen\r\ninto a situation of great danger and with fear in his heart, O king,\r\nValhika, that best of men, jumping down from that vehicle, quickly\r\nmounted upon the car of Lakshmana in that battle. Satyaki, having checked\r\nKritavarman in that dreadful battle, fell upon the grandsire and rained\r\non him shafts of diverse kinds.[470] Piercing the grandsire with sixty\r\nwhetted shafts winged with feathers, he seemed to dance on his car,\r\nshaking his large bow. The grandsire then hurled at him a mighty dart\r\nmade of iron, decked with gold, endued with great velocity, and beautiful\r\nas a daughter of the Nagas. Beholding that irresistible dart, resembling\r\nDeath himself, coursing towards him, that illustrious warrior of the\r\nVrishni race baffled it by the celerity of movements. Thereupon that\r\nfierce dart, unable to reach him of the Vrishni race, fell down on the\r\nearth like a large meteor of blazing splendour. Then he of Vrishni's\r\nrace, O king, taking up with a firm hand his own dart of golden\r\neffulgence, hurled it at the car of the grandsire. That dart, hurled in\r\nthat dreadful battle with the strength of Satyaki's arms, coursed\r\nimpetuously like the fatal night, coursing speedily towards a (doomed)\r\nman. As it coursed, however, towards him with great force, Bhishma cut it\r\nin twain, O Bharata, with a couple of horse-shoe-headed arrows of keen\r\nedge, and thereupon it fell down on the earth. Having cut that dart, that\r\ngrinder of foes, viz., Ganga's son, excited with wrath and smiling the\r\nwhile struck Satyaki in the chest with nine arrows. Then the Pandava\r\nwarriors, O elder brother of Pandu, with their cars, elephants, and\r\nsteeds,[471] surrounded Bhishma in that battle, for the sake of rescuing\r\nhim of Madhu's race. Then commenced again a fierce battle, making the\r\nhair to stand on end, between the Pandavas and the Kurus both of whom\r\nwere desirous of victory.\""

O\r\nking, by the clouds at the end of summer, Duryodhana, O monarch,\r\naddressed Dussasana, saying, 'This heroic and great bowman Bhishma, this\r\nslayer of heroes, hath, O bull of Bharata's race, been surrounded on all\r\nsides by the brave Pandavas. It is thy duty, O hero, to protect that\r\nillustrious one. Protected by us in battle, our grandsire Bhishma will\r\nslay all the Panchalas along with the Pandavas. The protection of\r\nBhishma. therefore, I think, is our highest duty, for this great bowman\r\nof his vows, viz., Bhishma, is our protector in return. Therefore,\r\nsurrounding the grandsire with all our troops, do thou protect him, who\r\nalways achieveth the most difficult feats in battle. Thus addressed by\r\nDuryodhana, thy son Dussasana, surrounding Bhishma with a large force on\r\nall sides took up his position. Then Suvala's son Sakuni, with hundreds\r\nand thousands of horsemen having bright spears and swords and lances in\r\nhand, and who formed a proud, well-dressed, and strong body bearing\r\nstandards, and who were mingled with excellent foot-soldiers that were\r\nall well-trained and skilled in battle began to cheek Nakula, and\r\nSahadeva, and Yudhishthira the son of Pandu, surrounding those foremost\r\nof men on all sides. Then king Duryodhana despatched ten thousand (other)\r\nbrave horsemen for resisting the Pandavas. When these rushed like so many\r\nGarudas towards the enemy with great impetuosity, the earth, O king,\r\nstruck with their horse-hoofs, trembled and uttered a loud noise. And the\r\nloud clatter of their hoofs was heard resembling the noise made by a\r\nlarge forest of bamboos, in conflagration on a mountain. And as these\r\ndashed over the field, there rose a cloud of dust, which rising to the\r\nwelkin shrouded the very Sun. And in consequence of those impetuous\r\nsteeds, the Pandava army was agitated like a large lake with a flight of\r\nswans suddenly alighting on its bosom. And in consequence of their\r\nneighing, nothing else could be heard there. Then king Yudhishthira, and\r\nthe two sons of Pandu by Madri, quickly checked the charge of those\r\nhorsemen in battle, like the continent, O king, bearing the force, at\r\nfull tide, of the surging sea swollen with the waters of the rainy\r\nseason. Then those (three) car-warriors, O monarch, with their straight\r\nshafts, cut off the heads of those horse-riders. Slain by those strong\r\nbowmen, they fell down, O king, (on the earth), like mighty elephants\r\ntumbling into mountain caves, slain by huge compeers. Indeed, coursing\r\nall over the field, those warriors (of the Pandavas army) cut off the\r\nheads of those cavalry soldiers with sharp-bearded darts and straight\r\nshafts. Struck with swords, those horsemen, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nsuffered their heads to drop like tall trees, dropping their fruits. All\r\nover the field, O king, steeds along with their riders were seen fallen\r\nor falling, deprived of life. And while being (thus) slaughtered, the\r\nsteeds, affected with panic, fled away like smaller animals desirous of\r\nsaving their lives at sight of the lion. And the Pandavas, O king, having\r\nvanquished their foes in that great battle, blew their conches and beat\r\ntheir drums. Then Duryodhana, filled with grief on seeing his troops\r\nvanquished, addressed the ruler of the Madras, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\nand said, 'There, the eldest son of Pandu, accompanied by the twins in\r\nbattle, in thy very sight, O thou of mighty arms, routeth our troops, O\r\nlord. O mighty-armed one, resist him like the continent resisting the\r\nocean. Thou art exceedingly well-known as possessed of might and prowess\r\nthat are irresistible.' Hearing these words of thy son, the valiant Salya\r\nproceeded with a large body of cars to the spot where Yudhishthira was.\r\nThereupon, the son of Pandu began to resist in battle that large host of\r\nSalya rushing impetuously towards him with the force of a mighty wave.\r\nAnd that mighty car-warrior, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, in that\r\nbattle quickly pierced the ruler of the Madras in the centre of the chest\r\nwith ten shafts. And Nakula and Sahadeva struck him with seven straight\r\nshafts. The ruler of the Madras then struck each of them with three\r\narrows. And once more he pierced Yudhishthira with sixty sharp-pointed\r\narrows. And excited with wrath he struck each of the sons of Madri also\r\nwith two shafts. Then that vanquisher of foes, the mighty-armed Bhima,\r\nbeholding the king, in that great battle, staying within reach of Salya's\r\ncar as if within the very jaws of Death, quickly proceeded to\r\nYudhishthira's side. Then when the Sun, having passed the meridian, was\r\nsinking, there commenced a fierce and terrible battle (on that part of\r\nthe field)."

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Then thy sire, excited with wrath, began to strike the\r\nParthas and their troops all round, with excellent shafts of great\r\nsharpness. And he pierced Bhima with twelve shafts, and Satyaki with\r\nnine. And having pierced Nakula with three shafts, he pierced Sahadeva\r\nwith seven. And he pierced Yudhishthira in the arms and the chest with\r\ntwelve shafts. And piercing Dhrishtadyumna also, that mighty warrior\r\nuttered a loud roar. Him Nakula pierced (in return) with twelve shafts,\r\nand Satyaki with three. And Dhrishtadyumna pierced him with seventy\r\nshafts, and Bhimasena with seven. And Yudhishthira pierced the grandsire\r\nin return with twelve shafts. Drona (on the other hand), having pierced\r\nSatyaki, pierced Bhimasena next. And he pierced each of them with five\r\nsharp shafts, each of which resembled the rod of Death. Each of those\r\ntwo, however, pierced Drona, that bull among Brahmanas, in return, with\r\nthree straight shafts. The Sauviras, the Kitavas, the Easterners, the\r\nWesterners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the Abhishahas, the Surasenas,\r\nthe Sivis, and the Vasatis, did not avoid Bhishma in battle although they\r\nwere incessantly slaughtered by him with sharp shafts. And similarly\r\nkings coming from diverse countries and armed with diverse weapons,\r\napproached the Pandavas (without seeking to avoid them in battle). And\r\nthe Pandavas, O king, surrounded the grandsire on all sides. Surrounded\r\non all sides, yet unvanquished by that large body of cars, Bhishma blazed\r\nup like a fire in the midst of a forest, and consumed his foes. His car\r\nwas his fire-chamber; his bow constituted the (flames of that fire);\r\nswords, darts, and maces, constituted the fuel; his shafts were the\r\nsparks (of that fire); and Bhishma was himself the fire that consumed the\r\nforemost of Kshatriyas. Indeed, with shafts furnished with golden wings\r\nand vulturine feathers and endued with great energy, with barbed arrows,\r\nand nalikas, and long shafts, he covered the hostile host. And he felled\r\nelephants and car-warriors also with his sharp shafts. And he made that\r\nlarge body of cars resemble a forest of palmyras shorn of their leafy\r\nheads. And that mighty armed warrior, that foremost of all wielders of\r\nweapons, O king, deprived cars and elephants and steeds of their riders\r\nin that conflict. And hearing the twang of his bow-string and the noise\r\nof his palms, loud as the roar of the thunder, all the troops trembled, O\r\nBharata. The shafts of thy sire, O bull of Bharata's race, told on the\r\nfoe. Indeed, shot from Bhishma's bow they did not strike the coats of\r\nmail only (but pierced them through). And we beheld, O king, many cars\r\ndestitute of their brave riders dragged over the field of battle, O\r\nmonarch, by the fleet steeds yoked unto them. Fourteen thousand\r\ncar-warriors, belonging to the Chedis, the Kasis, and the Karushas, of\r\ngreat celebrity and noble parentage, prepared to lay down their lives,\r\nunretreating from the field, and owning excellent standards decked with\r\ngold, having met with Bhishma in battle who resembled the Destroyer\r\nhimself with wide-open mouth, all went to the other world along with\r\ntheir cars, steeds, and elephants. And we beheld there, O king, cars by\r\nhundreds and thousands, some with their axles and bottoms broken, and\r\nsome, O Bharata, with broken wheels. And the earth was strewn with cars\r\nbroken along with their wooden fences, with the prostrate forms of\r\ncar-warriors, with shafts, with beautiful but broken coats of mail, with\r\naxes. O monarch; with maces and short arrows and sharp shafts, with\r\nbottoms of cars, with quivers and broken wheels, O sire, with innumerable\r\nbows and scimitars and heads decked with ear-rings; with leathern fences\r\nand gloves and overthrown standards, and with bows broken in various\r\nparts. And elephants, O king, destitute of riders, and slain horsemen (of\r\nthe Pandava army), lay dead. The valiant Pandavas notwithstanding all\r\ntheir efforts, could not rally those car-warriors, who, afflicted by the\r\nshafts of Bhishma, were flying away from the field. Indeed, O king, that\r\nmighty host while being slaughtered by Bhishma endued with energy equal\r\nto that of Indra himself, broke so completely that no two persons fled\r\ntogether. With its cars, elephants, and steeds overthrown, and with its\r\nstandards laid low in profusion, the army of the sons of Pandu, deprived\r\nof senses, uttered loud exclamations of woe. And at that time, sire slew\r\nson, and son slew sire, and friend smote dear friend, impelled by fate.\r\nAnd many combatants of the Pandavas army, throwing aside their armour,\r\nwere seen flying in all directions with dishevelled hair. Indeed, the\r\nPandava troops looked like bulls running wild in fear, and no longer\r\nrestrained by the yoke. Indeed, loud were the exclamations, we heard of\r\nwoe that they uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Then that delighter of the Yadavas, beholding the Pandava army breaking,\r\nreined the excellent car (that he guided), and addressing Vibhatsu the\r\nson of Pritha, said,--That hour is come, O Partha, which thou hadst hoped\r\nfor. Strike now, O tiger among men, or thou wilt be deprived of thy\r\nsenses. Formerly, O hero, thou saidst, O Partha, in that conclave of\r\nkings in Virata's city, in the presence also of Sanjaya, these words:--'I\r\nwill slay all the warriors of Dhritarashtra's son, all of them with their\r\nfollowers, including, Bhishma and Drona, that would fight with me in\r\nbattle--O son of Kunti, O chastiser of foes, make those words of thine\r\ntrue. Remembering the duty of a Kshatriya, fight, without any anxiety.'\r\nThus addressed by Vasudeva, Arjuna hung down his head and looked askance\r\nat him. And Vibhatsu replied very unwillingly, saying, 'To acquire\r\nsovereignty with hell in the end, having slain those who should not be\r\nslain, or the woes of an exile in the woods,--(these are the\r\nalternatives). Which of these should I achieve? Urge the steeds, O\r\nHrishikesa, I will do thy bidding. I will overthrow the Kuru grandsire\r\nBhishma, that invincible warrior.'--Thus asked, Madhava urged those\r\nsteeds of a silvery hue, to the spot where Bhishma, incapable of being\r\nlooked at like the Sun himself, was staying. Then that large host of\r\nYudhishthira rallied and came again to the fight, beholding the\r\nmighty-armed Partha proceeding for an encounter with Bhishma. Then\r\nBhishma that foremost one among the Kurus, repeatedly roared like a lion.\r\nAnd he soon covered Dhananjaya's car with a shower of arrows. Within a\r\ntrice that car of his with its steeds and charioteer, became entirely\r\ninvisible in consequence of that thick shower of arrows. Vasudeva,\r\nhowever, without fear, mustering patience, and endued with great\r\nactivity, urged those steeds mangled with Bhishma's shafts. Then Partha,\r\ntaking up his celestial bow of twang loud as the roar of the clouds,\r\ncaused Bhishma's bow to drop from his hands, cutting it (into fragments)\r\nby means of his sharp shafts. Then thy sire, the Kuru hero, whose bow had\r\nthus been cut off, stringed another large bow within the twinkling of the\r\neye. Arjuna, however, excited with wrath, cut that bow also of his. The\r\nson of Santanu applauded that lightness of hand displayed by Arjuna,\r\nsaying, 'Well done, Well done, O mighty-armed one. Well done, O son of\r\nKunti.'--Having addressed him thus, Bhishma took up another beautiful bow\r\nin that battle, and shot many arrows at Partha's car. And Vasudeva showed\r\ngreat skill in the management of steeds, for, displaying the circling\r\nmotion he baffled all those arrows (of Bhishma). Mangled with the arrows\r\nof Bhishma, those two tigers among men looked beautiful like two angry\r\nbulls marked with scratches of horns. Then that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\nviz., the mighty-armed Vasudeva of Madhu's race beholding that Partha was\r\nfighting mildly and that Bhishma was incessantly scattering his arrowy\r\nshowers in battle, and that stationed between the two hosts, he latter\r\nwas scorching everything like the Sun himself, smiting down the foremost\r\nof Yudhishthira's combatants, and, in fact, achieving feat on\r\nYudhishthira's army like unto what happeneth at the end of the Yuga,\r\ncould not any longer bear it. Abandoning then, O sire, Partha's steeds\r\nthat looked like silver, and filled with wrath, that great lord of Yoga\r\npowers jumped down from that great car. Repeatedly roaring like a lion,\r\nthe mighty Krishna of great energy and immeasurable splendour, the Lord\r\nof Universe, with eyes red as copper from rage, and having his bare arms\r\nalone for his weapons, rushed towards Bhishma, whip in hand, desirous of\r\nslaying him and seeming to split the universe itself with his tread.\r\nBeholding Madhava in the vicinity of Bhishma and about to fall upon him\r\nin that furious battle, the hearts of all the combatants seemed to be in\r\na stupor. 'Bhishma is slain, Bhishma is slain.'--These loud exclamations\r\nwere heard there, O king, caused by the fear inspired by Vasudeva. Robed\r\nin yellow silk, and himself dark as the lapis lazuli, Janarddana, when he\r\npursued Bhishma, looked beautiful as a mass of clouds charged with\r\nlightning. Like a lion towards an elephant, or the leader of a bovine\r\nherd upon another of his species, that bull of Madhu's race, with a loud\r\nroar, impetuously rushed towards Bhishma. Beholding him of eyes like\r\nlotus petals (thus) rushing towards him in that battle, Bhishma began to\r\nfearlessly draw his large bow. And with a fearless heart he addressed\r\nGovinda, saying, 'Come, come, O thou of eyes like lotus petals. O God of\r\nthe gods, I bow to thee. O best of the Satwatas, throw me down today in\r\nthis great battle. O god, slain by thee in battle, O sinless one, great\r\nwill be the good done to me, O Krishna, in every respect in the world.\r\nAmongst all, in the three worlds, great is the honour done to me today in\r\nbattle, O Govinda. Strike me as thou pleasest, for I am thy slave, O\r\nsinless one.' Meanwhile, the mighty-armed Partha. quickly following\r\nKesava behind, seized him by encircling him with his two arms. That best\r\nof male beings, viz., Krishna, of eyes like lotus petals, seized by\r\nPartha, still proceeded with great speed, bearing the latter away with\r\nhim. The mighty Partha, that slayer of hostile heroes, however, forcibly\r\ncatching hold of his legs, stopped Hrishikesa with great difficulty at\r\nthe tenth step. Then Arjuna his dear friend, filled with sorrow,\r\naffectionately addressed Kesava, who was then sighing like a snake and\r\nwhose eyes were troubled in wrath, saying, 'O thou of mighty arms, stop,\r\nO Kesava, it behoveth thee not to make those words false which thou hadst\r\nspoken before, viz., I will not fight. O Madhava, people will say that\r\nthou art a liar. All this burden resteth upon me. I will slay the\r\ngrandsire. I swear, O Kesava, by my weapons, by truth, and my good deeds,\r\nthat, O slayer of foes, I will do all by which the destruction of my foes\r\nmay be achieved. Behold this very day that invincible and mighty\r\ncar-warrior in the act of being thrown down by me, with the greatest\r\nease, like the crescent moon at the end of the Yuga (when the destruction\r\nof the universe comes). Madhava, however, hearing these words of the\r\nhigh-souled Phalguni, spoke not a word, but in anger once more mounted\r\nupon the car. And then upon those two tigers among men, when stationed on\r\ntheir car, Bhishma the son of Santanu, once more poured his arrowy\r\nshowers like the clouds pouring rain upon the mountain-breast. Thy sire\r\nDevavrata took the lives of the (hostile) warriors like the Sun sucking\r\nwith his rays the energies of all things during summer. As the Pandavas\r\nhad been breaking the ranks of the Kurus in battle, so thy sire broke the\r\nPandava ranks in battle. And the routed soldiers, helpless and heartless,\r\nslaughtered in hundreds and thousands by Bhishma, were unable to even\r\nlook at him in that battle,--him who resembled the mid-day Sun blazing in\r\nhis own splendour. Indeed, the Pandavas afflicted with fear, timidly\r\ngazed at Bhishma who was then achieving super-human feats in that battle.\r\nAnd the Pandava troops, thus fleeing away, O Bharata, failed to find a\r\nprotector, like a herd of kine sunk in a shoal of ants while being trod\r\ndown by a strong person. Indeed, the Pandavas could not, O Bharata, look\r\nat that mighty car-warrior incapable of being shaken, who, furnished with\r\na profusion of shafts, was scorching the kings (in the Pandava army), and\r\nwho in consequence of those shafts looked like the blazing Sun shedding\r\nhis fiery rays. And while he was thus grinding the Pandava army, the\r\nthousand-rayed maker of day repaired to the setting hills, and the\r\ntroops, worn with fatigue, set their hearts on withdrawal (from the\r\nfield).\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"While they were battling, the Sun set, O Bharata, aid\r\nthere came the dreadful hour of twilight and the battle could no longer\r\nbe seen. Then king Yudhishthira, seeing that twilight had come and that\r\nhis own troops, slaughtered by Bhishma, had thrown aside their weapons,\r\nand that stricken with fear, and turned off the field, they were seeking\r\nto flee away, and beholding Bhishma also, that mighty car-warrior,\r\nexcited with wrath and afflicting everybody in fight, and noticing that\r\nthe mighty car-warriors of the Somakas, having been vanquished, had all\r\nbecome cheerless, reflected a little, and then ordered the troops to be\r\nwithdrawn. Then king Yudhishthira withdrew his forces. And similarly, the\r\nwithdrawal of thy forces also took place at the same time. Then those\r\nmighty car-warriors, O chief of the Kurus, having withdrawn their forces,\r\nentered their tents, themselves mangled in battle. Afflicted by the\r\nshafts of Bhishma and reflecting upon that hero's feats in battle, the\r\nPandavas obtained no peace of mind. Bhishma also, having vanquished the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas in battle, was worshipped by thy sons and\r\nglorified by them, O Bharata. Accompanied by the rejoicing Kurus, he then\r\nentered his tent. Night then set in, that deprives all creatures of their\r\nsenses. Then in that fierce hour of night, the Pandavas, the Vrishnis and\r\nthe invincible Srinjayas sat down for a consultation. All those mighty\r\npersons, skilled in arriving at conclusions in council, coolly\r\ndeliberated about that which was beneficial for them in view of their\r\nimmediate circumstances. Then king Yudhishthira, having reflected for a\r\nlong while, said these words, casting his eyes on Vasudeva, 'Behold, O\r\nKrishna, the high-souled Bhishma of fierce prowess. He crusheth my troops\r\nlike an elephant crushing a forest of reeds. We dare not even look at\r\nthat high-souled warrior. Like a raging conflagration he licketh up my\r\ntroops. The valiant Bhishma of keen weapons, when excited with wrath in\r\nbattle and bow in hand shooting his shafts, becometh as fierce as the\r\nmighty Naga Takshaka of virulent poison. Indeed, the angry Yama is\r\ncapable of being vanquished, or even the chief of the celestials armed\r\nwith the thunder, or Varuna himself, noose in hand, or the Lord of the\r\nYakshas armed with mace. But Bhishma, excited with wrath, is incapable of\r\nbeing vanquished in battle. When this is the case, O Krishna, I am,\r\nthrough the weakness of my understanding, plunged in an ocean of grief\r\nhaving got Bhishma (as a foe) in battle. I will retire into the woods, O\r\ninvincible one. My exile there would be for my benefit. Battle, O\r\nKrishna, I no longer desire. Bhishma slayeth us always. As an insect, by\r\nrushing into a blazing fire meeteth only with death, even so do I rush\r\nupon Bhishma. In putting forth prowess, O thou of Vrishni's race, for the\r\nsake of my kingdom, I am, alas, led to destruction. My brave brothers\r\nhave all been exceedingly afflicted with arrows. In consequence of the\r\naffection they bear to myself their (eldest) brother they had to go into\r\nthe woods, deprived of kingdom. For myself alone, O slayer of Madhu, hath\r\nKrishna been sunk into such distress. I regard life to be of high value.\r\nIndeed, even life now seemeth to be difficult of being saved. (If I can\r\nsave that life), its latter remnant will I pass in the practice of\r\nexcellent virtue. If, with my brothers, O Kesava, I am worthy of thy\r\nfavour, tell me, O Krishna, what is for my benefit, without contravening\r\nthe duties of my order. Hearing these words of his, and (describing the\r\nsituation) in detail, Krishna, from compassion, said these words in reply\r\nfor comforting Yudhishthira, 'O son of Dharma, O thou that art firm in\r\ntruth, do thou not indulge in sorrow, thou that hast these invincible\r\nheroes, these slayers of foes, for thy brothers. Arjuna and Bhimasena are\r\neach endued with the energy of the Wind and the Fire. The twin sons of\r\nMadri also are each as valiant as the Chief of the celestials himself.\r\nFrom the good understanding that exists between us, do thou set me also\r\nto this task. Even I, O son of Pandu, will fight with Bhishma. Directed\r\nby thee, O great king, what is there that I may not do in great battle.\r\nChallenging that bull among men, viz., Bhishma, I will slay him in\r\nbattle, in the very sight of the Dhartarashtras, if Phalguni doth not\r\nwish to slay him. If, O son of Pandu, thou seest victory to be certain on\r\nthe slaughter of the heroic Bhishma, even, I, on a single car, will slay\r\nthat aged grandsire of the Kurus. Behold, O king, my prowess, equal to\r\nthat of the great Indra in battle. I will overthrow from his car that\r\nwarrior who always shooteth mighty weapons. He that is an enemy of the\r\nsons of Pandu, without doubt, is my enemy also. They, that are yours, are\r\nmine, and so they, that are mine, are yours. Thy brother (Arjuna) is my\r\nfriend, relative, and disciple. I will, O king, cut off my own flesh and\r\ngive it away for the sake of Arjuna. And this tiger among men also can\r\nlay down his life for my sake. O sire, even this is our understanding,\r\nviz., that we will protect each other. Therefore, command me, O king, in\r\nwhat way I am to fight. Formerly, at Upaplavya, Partha had, in the\r\npresence of many persons, vowed, saying, 'I will slay the son of Ganga.'\r\nThese words of the intelligent Partha should be observed (in practice).\r\nIndeed, if Partha requests me without doubt I will fulfill that vow. Or,\r\nlet it be the task of Phalguni himself in battle. It is not heavy for\r\nhim. He will slay Bhishma, that subjugator of hostile cities. If excited\r\nin battle, Partha can achieve feats that are incapable of being achieved\r\nby others. Arjuna can slay in battle the very gods exerting themselves\r\nactively, along with the Daityas and the Danavas. What need be said of\r\nBhishma, therefore, O king? Endued with great energy, Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu, is now of perverted judgment, of intelligence decayed, and of\r\nlittle sense, without doubt, he knoweth not what he should do.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Krishna, Yudhishthira said, 'It is even so, O\r\nthou of mighty arms, even as thou sayest, O thou of Madhu's race. All\r\nthese together are not competent to bear thy force. I am sure of always\r\nhaving whatever I desire, when, O tiger among men, I have thyself staying\r\non my side. O foremost of victorious persons, I would conquer the very\r\ngods with Indra at their head, when, O Govinda, I have thee for my\r\nprotector. What need I say, therefore, of Bhishma, though he is a mighty\r\ncar-warrior? But, O Krishna, I dare not, for my own glorification,\r\nfalsify thy words. Therefore, O Madhava, as promised before by thee,\r\nrender me aid without fighting for me. In this battle an agreement was\r\nmade by me with Bhishma. He said,--I will give thee counsel, but fight I\r\nshall never for thee, since I shall have to fight for Duryodhana's sake.\r\nKnow this for truth. Therefore, O Lord, Bhishma may give me sovereignty\r\nby giving me good counsel, O Madhava. Therefore, O slayer of Madhu, all\r\nof us accompanied by thee, will once more repair unto Devavrata, for\r\nasking him about the means of his own death. All of us then, O best of\r\npersons, together going to Bhishma without delay, will speedily ask him\r\nof Kuru's race his advice. O Janardana, he will truly give us beneficial\r\ncounsel; and O Krishna, I will do in battle what he will say. Of austere\r\nvows, he will give us counsel, as also victory. We were children and\r\norphans. By him were we reared. O Madhava, him, our aged grandsire, I\r\nwish to day,--him, the sire of our sire. Oh, fie upon the profession of a\r\nKshatriyas.'\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Hearing these words, O king, he of Vrishni's race\r\nsaid unto Yudhishthira, 'O thou of great wisdom, these words of thine, O\r\nking, are to my taste. Bhishma, otherwise called Devavrata, is skilled in\r\nweapons. With only his glances he can consume the foe. Repair unto that\r\nson of the Ocean-going (Ganga), for asking him about the means of his\r\ndeath. Asked by thee, in particular, he will certainly say the truth. We\r\nwill, therefore, proceed for questioning the Kuru grandsire. Repairing\r\nunto the reverend son of Santanu, we will, O Bharata, ask him his advice\r\nand according to the advice that he will give us we will fight with the\r\nfoe.' Having thus deliberated, O elder brother of Pandu, the heroic sons\r\nof Pandu, and the valiant Vasudeva, all proceeded together towards the\r\nabode of Bhishma, casting aside their coats of mail and weapons and\r\nentering then his tent, they all bowed to him, bending their heads. And\r\nthe sons of Pandu, O king, worshipping that bull of Bharata's race, and\r\nbowing unto him with their heads, sought his protection. The Kuru\r\ngrandsire, the mighty-armed Bhishma, then addressed them, saying,\r\n'Welcome art thou, O thou of Vrishni's race. Welcome art thou, O\r\nDhananjaya. Welcome to thee, O king Yudhishthira the just, Ad to thee, O\r\nBhima. Welcome to you also, ye twins. What am I to do now for enhancing\r\nyour joy? Even if it be exceedingly difficult of achievement, I will yet\r\ndo it with all my soul. Unto the son of Ganga who thus repeatedly spoke\r\nunto them with such affection, king Yudhishthira, with a cheerful heart,\r\nlovingly said, these words, 'O thou that art conversant with everything,\r\nhow shall we obtain victory, and how shall we acquire sovereignty? How\r\nalso may this destruction of creatures be stopped? Say all these unto me,\r\nO lord. Tell us the means of thy own death. How, O hero, shall we be able\r\nto bear thee in battle? O grandsire of the Kurus, thou givest not thy\r\nfoes even a minute hole to pick in thee. Thou art seen in battle with thy\r\nbow ever drawn to a circle. When thou takest thy shafts, when aimest\r\nthem, and when drawest the bow (for letting them off), no one is able to\r\nmark. O slayer of hostile heroes, constantly smiting (as thou dost) cars\r\nand steeds and men and elephants, we behold thee on thy car, O\r\nmighty-armed one, to resemble a second Sun. What man is there, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, who can venture to vanquish thee, scattering showers of\r\narrows in battle, and causing a great destruction. Tell me, O grandsire,\r\nthe means by which we may vanquish thee in battle, by which sovereignty\r\nmay be ours, and lastly, by which my army may not have to undergo such\r\ndestruction. Hearing these words, Santanu's son, O elder brother of\r\nPandu, said unto the son of Pandu, 'As long as I am alive, O son of\r\nKunti, victory cannot be yours in battle, O thou of great wisdom. Truly\r\ndo I say this unto thee. After, however, I am vanquished in fight, ye may\r\nhave victory in battle, ye sons of Pandu. If, therefore, ye desire\r\nvictory in the battle, smite me down without delay. I give you\r\npermission, ye sons of Pritha, strike me as ye please. I am thus known to\r\nyou in what I regard to be a fortunate circumstance.[472] After I am\r\nslain, all the rest will be slain. Therefore, do as I bid'.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell us the means by which we may vanquish thee in\r\nbattle, thee that art, when excited with wrath in the fight, like unto\r\nthe Destroyer himself armed with mace. The wielder of the thunder-bolt\r\nmay be vanquished or Varuna, or Yama. Thou, however, art incapable of\r\nbeing defeated in battle by even the gods and Asuras united together,\r\nwith Indra at their head.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'That, O son of Pandu, is true, which thou sayest. O thou,\r\nof mighty arms. When with weapons and my large bow in hand I contend\r\ncarefully in battle, I am incapable of being defeated by the very gods\r\nand the Asuras with Indra at their head. If, however, I lay aside my\r\nweapons, even these car-warriors can slay me. One that hath thrown away\r\nhis weapons, one that hath fallen down, one whose armour hath slipped\r\noff, one whose standard is down, one who is flying away, one who is\r\nfrightened, one who says--I am thine--one who is a female, one who\r\nbeareth the name of a female, one no longer capable of taking care of\r\none's self, one who hath only a single son, or one who is a vulgar\r\nfellows,--with these I do not like to battle. Hear also, O king, about my\r\nresolve formed before. Beholding any inauspicious omen I would never\r\nfight. That mighty car-warrior, the son of Drupada, O king, whom thou\r\nhast in thy army, who is known by the name of Sikhandin, who is wrathful\r\nin battle, brave, and ever victorious, was a female before but\r\nsubsequently obtained manhood. How all this took place, ye all know it\r\ntruly. Brave in battle and clad in mail, let Arjuna, keeping Sikhandin\r\nbefore him, attack me with his sharp shafts. When that inauspicious omen\r\nwill be there, especially in the form of one that was a female before, I\r\nwill never seek, though armed with bow and arrow, to strike him.\r\nObtaining that opportunity, let Dhananjaya the son of Pandu quickly\r\npierce me on every side with his shafts, O bull of Bharata's race. Except\r\nthe highly blessed Krishna, and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, I do not\r\nbehold the person in the three worlds who is able to slay me while\r\nexerting myself in battle. Let Vibhatsu, therefore, armed with weapons,\r\nstruggling carefully in battle, with his excellent bow in hand, placing\r\n(Sikhandin or) something else before, throw, me down (from my car). Then\r\nthe victory will be certain. Do this, O great king, even this that I have\r\nsaid unto thee, O thou of excellent vows. Thou wilt then be able to slay\r\nall Dhartarashtras assembled together in battle.'\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"The Parthas then, having ascertained all this went\r\nback to their tents, saluting the Kuru grandsire, viz., the high-souled\r\nBhishma. After Ganga's son, prepared to go to the other world, had said\r\nthis, Arjuna. burning with grief and his face suffused in shame, said\r\nthese words, 'How, O Madhava, shall I fight in battle with the grandsire\r\nwho is my senior in years, who is possessed of wisdom and intelligence,\r\nand who is the oldest member of our race? While sporting in days of\r\nchildhood, O Vasudeva, I used to smear the body of this high-souled and\r\nillustrious one with dust by climbing on his lap with my own filthy body.\r\nO elder brother of Gada, he is the sire of my sire Pandu. While a child,\r\nclimbing on the lap of this high-souled one I once called him father, I\r\nam not thy father but thy father's father, O Bharata!--even this is what\r\nhe said to me (in reply) in my childhood. He who said so, Oh, how can he\r\nbe slain by me. O, let my army perish. Whether, it is victory or death\r\nthat I obtain I will never fight that high-souled person. (Even this is\r\nwhat I think). What dost thou think, O Krishna!'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'Having vowed the slaughter of Bhishma before, O Jishnu,\r\nhow canst thou abstain from slaying him, agreeably to the duties of a\r\nKshatriya? Throw down from his car, O Partha, that Kshatriya who is\r\ninvincible in battle. Victory can never be yours without slaying Ganga's\r\nson. Even thus shall he go to the abode of Yama. This hath been settled\r\nbefore by the gods. That which hath been destined before, O Partha, must\r\nhappen. It cannot be otherwise. None save thee, O invincible one, not\r\neven the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself, would be capable of\r\nfighting with Bhishma, who is like the Destroyer with wide-open mouth.\r\nSlay Bhishma, without any anxiety. Listen also to these words of mine\r\nthat are what Vrihaspati of great intelligence had said unto Sakra in\r\ndays of old. One should slay even an aged person endued with every merit\r\nand worthy of reverence if he cometh as a foe, or, indeed any other who\r\napproacheth for destroying one's self--O Dhananjaya, this is the eternal\r\nduty sanctioned for the Kshatriya, viz., that they should fight, protect\r\nsubjects, and perform sacrifices, all without malice.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Sikhandin, O Krishna, will certainly be the cause of\r\nBhishma's death, for Bhishma, as soon as he beholds the prince of the\r\nPanchalas, abstains from striking. Therefore, keeping Sikhandin before\r\nhim and at our head, we will, by that means, overthrow the son of Ganga.\r\nEven this is what I think. I will hold in check other great bowmen with\r\nmy shafts. As regards Sikhandin, he will fight with Bhishma alone, that\r\nforemost of all warriors. I have heard from that chief of the Kurus that\r\nhe would not strike Sikhandin, for having been born before as a woman he\r\nsubsequently became a male person.'\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Having settled this with Bhishma's permission, the\r\nPandavas, along with Madhava, went away with rejoicing hearts. And then\r\nthose bulls among men retired to their respective beds.\""

Say all\r\nthis unto me, O Sanjaya!\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"Then all those Pandavas, towards the hour of sun-rise,\r\nwith beat of drums and cymbals and smaller drums, and with the blare of\r\nconches of milky whiteness, all around, went out for battle, placing\r\nSikhandin in their van. And they marched out, O king, having formed an\r\narray that was destructive of all foes. And Sikhandin, O monarch, was\r\nstationed in the very van of all the troops. And Bhimasena and Dhananjaya\r\nbecame the protectors of his car-wheels. And in his rear were the sons of\r\nDraupadi and the valiant Abhimanyu. And those mighty car-warriors, viz.,\r\nSatyaki and Chekitana, became the protectors of the last. And behind them\r\nwas Dhrishtadyumna protected by the Panchalas. Next to Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nbehind, marched the royal lord Yudhishthira, accompanied by the twins,\r\nfilling the air with leonine shouts, O bull of Bharata's race. Next\r\nbehind him was Virata, surrounded by his own troops. Next to him marched\r\nDrupada, O mighty-armed one. And the five Kaikeya brothers and the\r\nvaliant Dhrishtaketu, O Bharata, protected the rear of the Pandava army.\r\nHaving disposed their vast army in such an array, the Pandavas rushed\r\nagainst thy host, prepared to cast away their lives. And similarly the\r\nKauravas, O king, placing that mighty car-warrior Bhishma at the head of\r\ntheir whole host, proceeded against the Pandavas. And that invincible\r\nwarrior was protected by thy mighty sons. Next behind them was the great\r\nbowman Drona, as also his mighty son (Aswatthaman). Next behind was\r\nBhagadatta surrounded by his elephant division. And behind Bhagadatta\r\nwere Kripa and Kritavarman. Behind them were Sudakshina the mighty ruler\r\nof the Kamvojas, and Jayatsena, the king of the Magadhas, and Suvala's\r\nson and Vrihadvala. And similarly, many other kings, that were all great\r\nbowmen, protected the rear of thy host, O Bharata. As each day came,\r\nBhishma the son of Santanu, formed arrays in battle, sometimes after the\r\nmanner of the Asuras, sometimes after that of the Pisachas, and sometimes\r\nafter that of the Rakshasas. Then commenced the battle between thy\r\ntroops, O Bharata, and theirs, both parties smiting one another and\r\nincreasing the population of Yama's kingdom. And the Parthas with Arjuna\r\nat their head, placing Sikhandin in the van, proceeded against Bhishma in\r\nthat battle, scattering diverse kinds of arrows. And then, O Bharata\r\nafflicted by Bhishma with his shafts, (many of) thy warriors, profusely\r\nbathed in blood, repaired to the other world. And Nakula and Sahadeva,\r\nand the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, approaching thy army, began to\r\nafflict it with great vigour. Thus slaughtered in battle, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, thy warriors were unable to resist that vast host of the\r\nPandavas. Then thy host, vigorously afflicted by great car-warriors and\r\nthus slaughtered by them everywhere, fled away on all sides. Slaughtered\r\nwith sharp shafts by the Pandavas and the Srinjayas they found not a\r\nprotector, O bull of Bharata's race.\"\r\n\r\nDhritarashtra said, \"Tell me, O Sanjaya, what the valiant Bhishma,\r\nexcited with rage, did in battle, upon beholding my host afflicted by the\r\nParthas. O sinless one, tell me how that hero, that chastiser of foes,\r\nrushed against the Pandavas in battle, and slaughtered the Somakas.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"I will tell thee, O king, what thy sire did when thy sons'\r\nhost was afflicted by the Pandavas and the Srinjayas. With cheerful\r\nhearts, the brave sons of Pandu, O elder brother of Pandu, encountered\r\nthy son's host, slaughtering (all whom they met). That carnage, O chief\r\nof men, of human beings, elephants and steeds, that destruction by the\r\nfoe of thy army in battle, Bhishma could not brook. That invincible and\r\ngreat bowman, then, reckless of his very life poured upon the Pandavas,\r\nthe Panchalas, and the Srinjayas, showers of long shafts and calf-toothed\r\nand crescent-shaped arrows. And with weapons, O monarch, he checked with\r\nhis shafts and with showers of other weapons, both offensive and\r\ndefensive, all sped with energy and wrath, the five foremost of mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Pandavas, who had been struggling vigorously in\r\nbattle. Excited with wrath, he slaughtered in that battle countless\r\nelephants and steeds. And that bull among men, O monarch, throwing down\r\nmany car-warriors from their cars,[473] and horsemen from their horses,\r\nand crowds of foot soldiers, and elephant-warriors from the backs of the\r\nbeasts they rode, struck terror into the foe. And the Pandava warriors\r\nall rushed together upon Bhishma singly, upon that mighty car-warrior\r\nstruggling in battle with great activity, like the Asuras rushing\r\ntogether upon him with the thunderbolt in hand. Shooting on all sides his\r\nwhetted arrows whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, he seemed\r\nto the enemy to have assembled a terrible visage. While fighting in that\r\nbattle, his large bow, resembling that of Sakra himself, seemed to be\r\nalways drawn to a circle. Beholding those feats in battle, thy sons, O\r\nmonarch, filled with exceeding wonder, worshipped the grandsire. The\r\nParthas cast their eyes, with cheerless hearts, upon thy heroic sire\r\nstruggling in battle, like the celestials upon (the Asura) Viprachitti\r\n(in days of old).[474] They could not resist that warrior who then\r\nresembled the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth. In that battle on\r\nthe tenth day, Bhishma, with his sharp shafts, consumed the division of\r\nSikhandin like a conflagration consuming a forest. Him resembling an\r\nangry snake of virulent poison, or the Destroyer urged by Death himself,\r\nSikhandin pierced with three shafts in the centre of the chest. Deeply\r\npierced therewith, Bhishma saw that it was Sikhandin (who was piercing\r\nhim). Excited with wrath, but unwilling (to fight with Sikhandin) Bhishma\r\nlaughingly said, 'Whether thou choosest to strike me or not, I will never\r\nfight with thee. Thou art that Sikhandin still which the Creator had made\r\nthee first',[475] Hearing these words of his, Sikhandin, deprived of his\r\nsenses by wrath, and licking the corners of his mouth addressed Bhishma\r\nin that battle, saying, 'I know thee, O mighty-armed one, to be the\r\nexterminator of the Kshatriya race. I have heard also of thy battle with\r\nJamadagni's son. I have also heard much of thy super-human prowess.\r\nKnowing thy prowess I will still fight with thee today. For doing what is\r\nagreeable to the Pandavas and is agreeable to my own self, O chastiser of\r\nfoes, I will today fight with thee in battle, O best of men. I will, of a\r\ncertainty, slay thee. I swear this before thee by my troth! Hearing these\r\nwords of mine, do that which thou shouldst. Whether thou choosest to\r\nstrike me or not, thou shall not escape me with life. O thou that art\r\never victorious, O Bhishma, look thy last on this world.\r\n\r\nSanjaya continued, \"Having said so, Sikhandin in that battle pierced\r\nBhishma with five straight shafts, having already pierced him with his\r\nwordy shafts. Hearing those words of his, the mighty car-warrior Arjuna,\r\nregarding Sikhandin to be Bhishma's Destroyer, urged him on, saying, 'I\r\nwill fight behind thee, routing the foe with my shafts. Excited with\r\nfury, rush thou against Bhishma of terrible prowess. The mighty Bhishma\r\nwill not be able to afflict thee in battle. Therefore, O mighty-armed\r\none, encounter Bhishma with vigor. If, O sire, thou returnest today\r\nwithout slaying Bhishma, thou wilt, with myself, be an object of ridicule\r\nto the world. Seek to do that in battle by which, O hero, we may not\r\nincur ridicule in this great battle. Stay the grandsire. O thou of great\r\nstrength, I will protect thee in this battle, checking all the\r\ncar-warriors (of the Kuru army). Do thou slay the grandsire. Drona, and\r\nDrona's son, and Kripa, and Suyodhana, and Chitrasena, and Vikarna, and\r\nJayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, Vinda and Anuvinda. of Avanti, and\r\nSudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, and the brave Bhagadatta, and the\r\nmighty king of the Magadhas, and Somadatta's son, and the brave Rakshasas\r\nwho is Rishyasringa's son and the ruler of the Trigartas, alone with all\r\nthe other great car-warriors (of the Kuru army). I will check like the\r\ncontinent resisting the surging sea. Indeed, I will hold in check all the\r\nmighty warriors of the Kuru army assembled together and battling with us.\r\nDo thou slay the grandsire.'"

What mighty car-warriors of the\r\nPandavas army, upraised weapons, desirous of victory, and exerting\r\nthemselves with activity, protected Sikhandin on that occasion which\r\nrequired great activity? How also did Bhishma the son of Santanu, endued\r\nwith great energy, fight on that tenth day of battle with the Pandavas\r\nand the Srinjayas? I cannot brook the idea of Sikhandin encountering\r\nBhishma in battle. (Indeed, when Sikhandin attacked Bhishma), was\r\nBhishma's car or his bow broken?\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"While fighting in that battle, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nneither the bow nor the car of Bhishma had suffered any injury. He was\r\nthen slaying the foe with straight shafts. Many thousands of mighty\r\ncar-warriors belonging to thy army, as also elephants, O king, and steeds\r\nwell harnessed, proceeded for battle, with the grandsire in the van.\r\nAgreeably to his vow, O thou of Kuru's race, the ever-victorious Bhishma\r\nwas incessantly engaged in slaughtering the troops of the Parthas. The\r\nPanchalas and the Pandavas were unable to bear that great bowman battling\r\n(with them) and slaying his foes with his shafts. When the tenth day\r\ncame, the hostile army was torn into pieces by Bhishma with his shafts by\r\nhundreds and thousands. O elder brother of Pandu, the sons of Pandu were\r\nincapable of defeating in battle the great bowman Bhishma who resembled\r\nthe Destroyer himself armed with the lance.\r\n\r\n\"Then, O king, the unvanquished Vibhatsu or Dhananjaya, who was capable\r\nof drawing the bow with even the left hand, came to that spot,\r\nfrightening all the car-warriors. Roaring loudly like a lion, and\r\nrepeatedly drawing the bow-string, and scattering showers of arrows,\r\nPartha careered on the field of battle like Death himself. Frightened at\r\nthose roars of his, thy warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in\r\nterror, like smaller animals, O king, at the sound of the lion. Beholding\r\nthe son of Pandu crowned with victory and thus afflicting that host,\r\nDuryodhana, himself under the influence of terror addressed Bhishma and\r\nsaid, 'You son of Pandu, O sire, with white steeds (yoked unto his car),\r\nand having Krishna for his charioteer, consumeth all my troops like a\r\nconflagration consuming a forest. Behold, O son of Ganga, all troops,\r\nslaughtered by Pandu's son in battle, are, O foremost of warriors,\r\nfleeing away. Indeed, as the herdsman belaboureth his cattle in the\r\nforest, even so, O scorcher of foes is my army being belaboured. Broken\r\nand driven away on all sides by Dhananjaya with his shafts, the\r\ninvincible Bhima is also routing that (already broken) host of mine. And\r\nSatyaki, and Chekitana, and the twin sons of Madri, and the valiant\r\nAbhimanyu,--these also are routing my troops. The brave Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nand the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha also, are vigorously breaking and driving\r\naway my army in this fierce conflict. Of these troops that are being\r\nslaughtered by all those mighty car-warriors, I do not see any other\r\nrefuge in the matter of their staying and fighting on the field, O\r\nBharata, save thee, O tiger among men, that art possessed of prowess\r\nequal to that of the celestials, Therefore, receive thou those great\r\ncar-warriors without delay, and be thou the refuge of these afflicted\r\ntroops. Thus addressed by him, O king, thy sire Devavrata, the son of\r\nSantanu, reflecting for a moment and settling what he should do, said\r\nthese words unto thy son, comforting him (therewith), 'O Duryodhana,\r\nlisten calmly to what I say, O king, O thou of great might, formerly I\r\nvowed before thee that slaying every day ten thousand high-souled\r\nKshatriyas, I would come back from the battle. I have fulfilled that vow,\r\nO bull of Bharata's race! O thou of great might, today I will achieve\r\neven a great feat. Today I will either sleep myself being slain, or, I\r\nwill slay the Pandavas. O tiger among men, I will today free myself from\r\nthe debt I owe thee,--the debt, O king, arising out of the food, thou\r\ngavest me,--by casting away my life at the head of thy army.' Having said\r\nthese words, O chief of the Bharatas, that invincible warrior, scattering\r\nhis shafts among the Kshatriyas, attacked the Pandava host. And the\r\nPandavas then, O bull of Bharata's race, began to resist the son of Ganga\r\nstaying in the midst of his forces and excited with wrath like a snake of\r\nvirulent poison. Indeed, O king, on that tenth day of the battle,\r\nBhishma, displaying his might, slew, O son of Kuru's race, hundreds of\r\nthousands. And he drained the energies of those royal and mighty\r\ncar-warriors that were the foremost among the Panchalas, like the Sun\r\nsucking up the moisture (of the earth) with his rays. Having slain ten\r\nthousand elephants of great activity and ten thousand steeds also, O\r\nking, along with their riders, and full two hundred thousands of\r\nfoot-soldiers, that best of men, viz., Bhishma, shone resplendent in\r\nbattle like a fire without a curl of smoke. And no one amongst the\r\nPandavas was capable of even looking at him who then resembled the\r\nburning Sun staying in the northern solstice. The Pandavas, however,\r\nthough afflicted in battle by that great bowman, still rushed,\r\naccompanied by the mighty car-warriors of the Srinjayas, for slaughtering\r\nhim. Battling with myriads upon myriads around him, Santanu's son Bhishma\r\nthen looked like the cliff of Meru covered on all sides with masses of\r\nclouds. Thy sons, however, stood, surrounding Bhishma on all sides with a\r\nlarge force (for protecting him). Then commenced a fierce battle (between\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas).\""

Thou\r\nshouldst not entertain the slightest fear of Bhishma today. Even I will\r\nthrow him down from his excellent car by means of my sharp shafts'. Thus\r\naddressed by Partha, Sikhandin, O bull of Bharata's race, having heard\r\nthose words, rushed at the son of Ganga. And so Dhrishtadyumna also, O\r\nking, and the mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu, having heard those words of\r\nPartha, joyfully rushed at Bhishma. And old Virata and Drupada, and\r\nKuntibhoja also, clad in mail, rushed at Bhishma in the very sight of thy\r\nson. And Nakula, Sahadeva, and the valiant king Yudhishthira also, and\r\nall the rest of the warriors, O monarch, rushed against Bhishma. As\r\nregards thy warriors O king, that rushed, according to the measure of\r\ntheir might and courage, against those mighty car-warriors (of the\r\nPandava army) united together, listen to me as I speak (of them) unto\r\nthee. Like a young tiger attacking a bull, Chitrasena, O king, rushed\r\nagainst Chekitana who in that battle was proceeding for getting at\r\nBhishma. Kritavarman, O king, resisted Dhrishtadyumna who had reached the\r\npresence of Bhishma and who was exerting himself with great activity and\r\nvigour in that battle. Somadatta's son, O monarch, with great activity,\r\nresisted Bhimasena excited with fury and desirous of slaying Bhishma.\r\nSimilarly Vikarna, desirous of (protecting) Bhishma's life, resisted the\r\nbrave Nakula who was scattering innumerable arrows around. And so, O\r\nking, Kripa the son of Saradwat, excited with rage, resisted Sahadeva\r\nproceeding towards Bhishma's car. And the mighty Durmukha rushed at that\r\nRakshasa of cruel deeds, viz., the mighty son of Bhishmasena, desirous of\r\nBhishma's slaughter. Thy son Duryodhana himself resisted Satyaki\r\nproceeding to battle. Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamavojas, O king,\r\nresisted Abhimanyu, O monarch, who was proceeding towards Bhishma's car.\r\nAnd Aswatthaman, O king, excited with rage, resisted old Virata and\r\nDrupada, those two chastisers of foes united together. And Bharadwaja's\r\nson, exerting himself with vigour in battle, resisted the eldest Pandava,\r\nthat is to say, king Yudhishthira the just, who was desirous of Bhishma's\r\ndeath. And that great bowman, viz., Dussasana, in that battle, resisted\r\nArjuna who was rushing with great speed, with Sikhandin before him,\r\ndesirous of coming upon Bhishma, O monarch, and illuminating the ten\r\nquarters (with his bright weapons). And other warriors of thy army\r\nresisted in that great battle other mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas\r\nproceeding against Bhishma. Dhrishtadyumna, that mighty car-warrior,\r\nexcited with rage, rushed against Bhishma alone and addressing the\r\ntroops, repeatedly said in a loud voice, 'There, Arjuna, that delighter\r\nof Kuru's race, is proceeding against Bhishma in battle. Rush ye against\r\nGanga's son. Be not afraid. Bhishma will not be able to attack you in\r\nbattle.[476] Vasava himself cannot venture to fight with Arjuna in\r\nbattle. What therefore, need be said of Bhishma who, though possessed of\r\nbravery in battle, is feeble and old.\" Hearing these words of their\r\ncommander, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army, filled with joy,\r\nrushed towards the car of Ganga's son. Many foremost of men, however, of\r\nthy army cheerfully received and resisted those heroes coming towards\r\nBhishma like impetuous mass of living energy. That mighty car-warrior,\r\nDussasana, abandoning all fears, rushed against Dhananjaya, desirous of\r\nprotecting the life of Bhishma. And so the heroic Pandavas also, O king,\r\nrushed in. battle against thy sons, those mighty car-warriors, stationed\r\nabout Bhishma's car. And then, O king we beheld a highly wonderful\r\nincident, viz., that Partha, having proceeded as far as Dussasana's car,\r\ncould not advance further. As the continent resists the surging sea, even\r\nso did thy son (Dussasana) resist the angry son of Pandu. Both of them\r\nwere foremost of car-warriors. Both of them, O Bharata, were invincible.\r\nBoth of them, in beauty and splendour, O Bharata, resembled the Sun or\r\nthe Moon. Both of them were excited with wrath. And each of them desired\r\nto slay the other. And they encountered each other in dreadful battle\r\nlike Maya and Sakra in days of old. And Dussasana, O king, in that battle\r\npierced the son of Pandu with three shafts and Vasudeva with twenty. Then\r\nArjuna, excited with rage upon beholding him of Vrishni's race thus\r\nafflicted, pierced Dussasana with a hundred shafts. These, penetrating\r\nthrough the latter's armour, drank his blood in that battle. Then\r\nDussasana, excited with wrath, pierced Partha with five shafts. And once\r\nmore, O chief of the Bharatas, he pierced Arjuna in the forehead with\r\nthree sharp shafts. And with those shafts sticking to his forehead, the\r\nson of Pandu looked beautiful in that battle, like Meru, O king with its\r\ntall crests. That great bowman, viz., Partha, then thus deeply pierced by\r\nthy son wielding the bow, looked resplendent in that battle like a\r\nflowering Kinsuka. The son of Pandu then, excited with rage, afflicted\r\nDussasana, like Rahu inflamed with rage on the fifteenth day of the\r\nlighted fortnight afflicting the Moon at full. Thus afflicted by that\r\nmighty warrior, thy son, O king, pierced Partha in that battle with many\r\nshafts whetted on stone and winged with the features of the Kanka bird.\r\nThen Partha, cutting off Dussasana's bow and splitting his car with three\r\nshafts, sped at him many fierce arrows resembling the darts of Death. Thy\r\nson, however, cut off all those shafts of Partha exerting himself with\r\nvigour before they could reach him. All this seemed highly wonderful.\r\nThen thy son pierced Partha with many shafts of great sharpness. Then\r\nPartha, excited with rage in that battle, placed on his bowstring a\r\nnumber of shafts whetted on stone and furnished with wings of gold and\r\naiming them, sped them all at his foe. These, O king, penetrated the body\r\nof that high-souled warrior, like swans, O monarch, diving into a lake.\r\nThus afflicted by the high-souled son of Pandu, thy son avoiding Partha,\r\nquickly proceeded to the car of Bhishma. Indeed, Bhishma then became an\r\nisland unto him who was thus sinking into fathomless waters. Regaining\r\nconsciousness then, thy son, O monarch, endued with heroism and prowess,\r\nonce more began to resist Partha with sharp arrows like Purandara\r\nresisting (the Asura) Vritra. Of huge form, thy son began to pierce\r\nArjuna, but the latter was scarcely pained (at all this).\""

The\r\nruler of the Pragjyotishas then, with a broad-headed arrow of great\r\nsharpness, displaying great lightness of hand, cut off, the large bow of\r\nSatyaki. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, excited with rage and taking\r\nup another bow of greater impetus, pierced Bhagadatta in that battle with\r\nmany sharp arrows. That mighty bowman, viz., Bhagadatta, then deeply\r\npierced, began to lick the corners of his mouth. And he then hurled at\r\nhis foe, in that dreadful battle, a tough dart, made wholly of iron,\r\ndecked with gold and stones of lapis lazuli, and fierce as the rod of\r\nYama himself. Sped with the might of Bhagadatta's arm and coursing\r\ntowards him impetuously, Satyaki, O king, cut that dart in twain by means\r\nof his shafts. Thereupon that dart fell down suddenly, like a great\r\nmeteor shorn of its splendour. Beholding the dart baffled, thy son\r\n(Duryodhana), O monarch, surrounded him of Madhu's race with a large\r\nnumber of cars. And seeing that mighty car-warrior among the Vrishnis\r\nthus surrounded, Duryodhana, angrily addressing all his brothers, said,\r\n'Take such steps, ye Kauravas, that Satyaki may not, in this battle,\r\nescape you and this large division of cars, with life. If he be slain,\r\nthe vast host of the Pandavas may be regarded as slain also.' Accepting\r\nDuryodhana's words with the answer--So be it,--those mighty car-warriors\r\nfought with Sini's grandson in the view of Bhishma. The mighty ruler of\r\nthe Kamvojas, in that battle, resisted Abhimanyu who was proceeding\r\nagainst Bhishma. The son of Arjuna, having pierced the king with many\r\nstraight shafts,[477] once more pierced that monarch, O monarch, with\r\nfour and sixty shafts. Sudakshina, however, desirous of Bhishma's life,\r\npierced Abhimanyu in that battle with five arrows and his charioteer with\r\nnine. And the battle that took place there, in consequence of the meeting\r\nof those two warriors, was fierce in the extreme. That grinder of foes\r\nSikhandin, then rushed at the of Ganga. Old Virata and Drupada, those\r\nmighty car-warriors, both excited with rage, rushed to battle with\r\nBhishma, resisting the large host of the Kauravas as they went. That best\r\nof car-warriors, viz., Aswatthaman, excited with rage, encountered both\r\nthose warriors. Then commenced a battle, O Bharata, between him and them.\r\nVirata then, O chastiser of foes, struck, with broad-headed shafts, that\r\nmighty bowman and ornament of battle, viz., Drona's son, as the latter\r\nadvanced against them. And Drupada also pierced him with three sharp\r\nshafts. Then the preceptor's soil, Aswatthaman, coming upon those mighty\r\nwarriors thus striking him, viz., the brave Virata and Drupada both\r\nproceeding towards Bhishma, pierced them both with many shafts. Wonderful\r\nwas the conduct that we then beheld of those two old warriors, inasmuch\r\nas they checked all those fierce shafts shot by Drona's son. Like an\r\ninfuriate elephant in the forest rushing against an infuriate compeer,\r\nKripa, the son of Saradwat, proceeded against Sahadeva who was advancing\r\nupon Bhishma. And Kripa, brave in battle, quickly struck that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the son of Madri, with seventy shafts decked with\r\ngold. The son of Madri, however, cut Kripa's bow in twain by means of his\r\nshafts. And cutting off his bow, Sahadeva then pierced Kripa with nine\r\narrows. Taking up then, in that battle, another bow capable of bearing a\r\ngreat strain Kripa, excited with rage and desirous of Bhishma's life,\r\ncheerfully struck Madri's son in that battle with ten shafts. And so the\r\nson of Pandu, in return, desirous of Bhishma's death, excited with rage,\r\nstruck the wrathful Kripa in the chest (with many shafts). And then\r\noccurred there a terrible and fierce battle. That scorcher of foes, viz.,\r\nVikarna, desirous of saving the grandsire Bhishma, excited with rage in\r\nthat battle, pierced Nakula with sixty arrows. Nakula also, deeply\r\npierced by thy intelligent son, pierced Vikarna in return with seven and\r\nseventy shafts. There those two tigers among men, those two chastisers of\r\nfoes, those two heroes, struck each other for the sake of Bhishma, like\r\ntwo bovine bulls in a fold. Thy son Durmukha, endued with great prowess,\r\nproceeded, for the sake of Bhishma, against Ghatotkacha advancing to\r\nbattle and slaughtering thy army as he came. Hidimva's son, however, O\r\nking, excited with rage, struck Durmukha, that chastiser of foes, in the\r\nchest a straight shaft. The heroic Durmukha then, shouting cheerfully,\r\npierced Bhimasena's son on the field of battle with sixty shafts of keen\r\npoints. That mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Hridika resisted\r\nDhrishtadyumna, that foremost of car-warriors, who was advancing to\r\nbattle from desire of Bhishma's slaughter. The son of Prishata, however,\r\nhaving pierced Kritavarman with five shafts made wholly of iron, once\r\nmore, struck him quickly in the centre of the chest fifty shafts. And\r\nsimilarly, O king, Prishata's son struck Kritavarman with nine sharp and\r\nblazing shaft, winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Encountering\r\neach other with great vigour, the battle that took place between them for\r\nBhishma's sake was as fierce as that between Vritra and Vasava. Against\r\nBhimasena who was advancing upon the mighty Bhishma, proceeded\r\nBhurisravas with great speed, saying,--Wait, Wait,--And the son of\r\nSomadatta struck Bhima in the centre of the chest with an arrow of\r\nexceeding sharpness and golden wings in that battle. And the valiant\r\nBhimasena, with that arrow on his chest, looked beautiful, O best of\r\nkings, like the Krauncha mountain in days of old with the dart of Skanda.\r\nAnd those two bulls among men, enraged in battle, shot at each other\r\nshafts brightly polished by their forgers and endued with effulgence of\r\nthe Sun. Bhima, longing for Bhishma's death, fought with the mighty son\r\nof Somadatta, and the latter, desirous of Bhishma's victory, fought with\r\nthe former, each carefully seeking to counteract the other's feats.\r\nBharadwaja's son resisted Yudhishthira the son of Kunti, who, accompanied\r\nby a large force, was coming towards Bhishma. Hearing the rattle of\r\nDrona's car, O king, that resembled the roar of the clouds, the\r\nPrabhadrakas, O sire, began to tremble. That large force, of Pandu's son,\r\nresisted by Drona in battle, could not, exerting vigorously, advance even\r\none step. Thy son Chitrasena, O king, resisted Chekitana of wrathful\r\nvisage who was exerting vigorously for coming upon Bhishma. Possessed of\r\ngreat prowess and great dexterity of hand, that mighty car-warrior for\r\nthe sake of Bhishma, battled with Chekitana, O Bharata, according to the\r\nutmost of his power. And Chekitana also fought with Chitrasena to the\r\nutmost of his power. And the battle that took place there in consequence\r\nof the meeting of those two warriors, was exceedingly fierce. As regards\r\nArjuna, although he was resisted by all means, O Bharata, he still\r\ncompelled thy son to turn back and then crushed thy troops. Dussasana\r\nhowever, to the utmost stretch of his power, began to resist Partha,\r\nwishing, O Bharata, to protect Bhishma. The army of thy son, O Bharata,\r\nundergoing such slaughter, began to be agitated here and there by many\r\nforemost car-warriors (of the Pandava).\""

That\r\nvaliant warrior acquainted with every omen, beholding the omens on all\r\nsides, addressed his son who also was scorching the hostile ranks and\r\nsaid these words, 'This is that day, O son, on which the mighty Partha,\r\ndesirous of slaying Bhishma in battle, will exert himself to the best of\r\nhis might. My arrows are coming out (of the quiver, of their own accord).\r\nMy bow seems to yawn. My weapon seems unwilling to obey my behests, and\r\nmy heart also is cheerless. Animals and birds are uttering fearful and\r\nincessant cries. Vultures seem to disappear beneath the feet of the\r\nBharata troops. The Sun himself seems to have lost hue. The quarters are\r\nall ablaze. The Earth seems to shriek, inspire fear, and tremble\r\neverywhere. Kankas, and vultures, and cranes are frequently crying.\r\nJackals are uttering inauspicious and fierce yells foreboding great\r\ndanger. Large meteors seem to fall from the centre of the solar disc. The\r\nconstellation called Parigha, with a trunkless form, appeareth around the\r\nSun. The solar and the lunar discs have become awful, foreboding great\r\ndanger to Kshatriyas about the mangling of their bodies. The idols of the\r\nKuru king in his temples tremble and laugh and dance and weep. The\r\nillustrious Moon riseth with his horns downward. The bodies of the kings\r\nbelonging to the Kuru army all seem to be pale, and though clad in mail,\r\nare shorn of splendour. The loud blare of Panchajanya and the twang of\r\nGandiva are heard on all sides of both the armies. Without doubt, Arjuna,\r\nrelying upon his great weapons and avoiding other warriors will advance\r\nupon the grandsire. The pores of my body are contracting, and my heart\r\nalso is depressed, thinking, O mighty-armed one, of the encounter between\r\nBhishma and Arjuna. Keeping on his fore the Panchala prince of sinful\r\nsoul and conversant with deceit, Partha is proceeding towards Bhishma for\r\nbattle. Bhishma said before that he would not slay Sikhandin. By the\r\nCreator had that one been made female, though through chance he\r\nsubsequently became a male person. That mighty son of Yajnasena is also\r\nan inauspicious omen (by himself). The son of the Ocean-going (Ganga)\r\nwill not strike that person of inauspicious self. Thinking of this, viz.,\r\nthat Arjuna, excited with wrath, is about to fall upon the aged Kuru\r\ngrandsire, my heart is exceedingly depressed. The wrath of Yudhishthira,\r\nan encounter between Bhishma and Arjuna in battle, and an endeavour like\r\nthis (of the shooting of weapons) by myself,--these (three) are certainly\r\nfraught with great harm to creatures. Arjuna is endued with great energy;\r\nhe is powerful, brave, accomplished in weapons, and possessed of valour\r\nthat is very active. Capable of shooting his arrows to a great distance\r\nand shooting them with force, he is, besides, acquainted with omens,\r\nEndued with great might and intelligence, and above fatigue, that\r\nforemost of warriors is incapable of defeat by the very gods with Vasava\r\nat their head. The son of Pandu possesses terrible weapons and is ever\r\nvictorious in battle. Avoiding his path, go thou to battle (for Bhishma's\r\nvictory) O thou of rigid vows.[478] Today in this dreadful battle thou\r\nwilt behold a great carnage. The beautiful and costly coats of mail,\r\ndecked with gold, of brave warriors will be pierced with straight shafts.\r\nAnd the tops of standards, and bearded javelins, and bows, and bright\r\nlances of sharp points, and darts bright with gold, and the standards on\r\nthe backs of elephants, will all be cut off by Kiritin in wrath. O son,\r\nthis is not the time when dependants should take care of their lives. Go\r\nto battle, keeping heaven before thee, and for the sake of fame and\r\nvictory. There, the ape-bannered (Arjuna) crosseth on his car the river\r\nof battle that is awful and incapable of being easily crossed, and hath\r\ncars, elephants, and steeds, for its eddies. Regard for Brahmanas,\r\nself-restraint, liberality, asceticism, and noble conduct, are seen in\r\nYudhishthira alone who hath for his brothers Dhananjaya, and the mighty\r\nBhimasena, and the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, and who hath Vasudeva of\r\nthe Vrishni race for his protector. The wrath, born of grief, of that\r\nYudhishthira whose body hath been purified by the flames of penance,\r\ndirected to the wicked-souled son of Dhritarashtra, is consuming this\r\nBharata host. There cometh Partha, having Vasudeva for his protector,\r\nchecking (as he cometh) this entire Dhartarashtra army. Behold, Kiritin\r\nis agitating this host like a large whale agitating the vast sea of\r\ncrested waves. Hark, cries of distress and woe are heard in the van of\r\nthe army. Go, encounter the heir of the Panchala king. As for myself, I\r\nwill proceed against Yudhishthira. The heart of king Yudhishthira's very\r\nstrong array is difficult of access. Inaccessible as the interior of the\r\nsea, it is guarded on all sides by Atirathas. Satyaki, and Abhimanyu and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and Vrikodara, and the twins, even these are protecting\r\nthat ruler of men, viz., king Yudhishthira. Dark as the younger brother\r\nof Indra, and risen like a tall Sala, behold Abhimanyu advancing at the\r\nhead of the (Pandava) host, like a second Phalguna! Take up thy mighty\r\nweapons, and with thy large bow in hand proceed against the royal son of\r\nPrishata (viz., Sikhandin), and against Vrikodara. Who is there that doth\r\nnot wish his dear son to live for many years? Keeping the duties of a\r\nKshatriya, however, before me, I am engaging thee (to this task). So\r\nBhishma also, in this battle, is consuming the mighty host of the\r\nPandavas. O son, he is, in battle, equal to Yama or Varuna himself.'\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Hearing these words of the high-souled Drona, Bhagadatta\r\nand Kripa and Salya and Kritavarman, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti,\r\nand Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, and Chitrasena and Vikarna and\r\nDurmarshana and others, these ten warriors of thy army, supported by a\r\nlarge host consisting of many nationalities, fought with Bhimasena,\r\ndesirous of winning high renown in the battle for Bhishma's sake. And\r\nSalya struck Bhima with nine arrows, and Kritavarman struck him with\r\nthree, and Kripa with nine. And Chitrasena and Vikarna and Bhagadatta, O\r\nsire, each struck him with ten arrows. And the ruler of the Sindhus\r\nstruck him with three, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti each struck him\r\nwith five arrows. And Duryodhana struck that son of Pandu with twenty\r\nsharp arrows. Bhimasena, O king, pierced in return every one of those\r\nkings, those foremost of men in the world, those mighty car-warriors of\r\nthe Dhartarashtra army, one after another. The brave Pandava, that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, pierced Salya with seven arrows, and Kritavarman with\r\neight. And he cut off Kripa's bow with arrow fixed thereon, O Bharata, in\r\nthe middle, dividing it in twain. And after thus cutting off his bow, he\r\npierced Kripa once more with seven arrows. And he struck Vinda and\r\nAnuvinda with three arrows each. And he pierced Durmarshana with twenty\r\narrows, and Chitrasena with five, and Vikarna with ten, and Jayadratha\r\nwith five. And once more striking the ruler of the Sindhus with three\r\narrows, he uttered a loud shout, filled with joy. Then Gautama, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, taking up another bow, angrily pierced Bhima\r\nwith ten sharp shafts. Pierced with those ten shafts like a huge elephant\r\nwith the hook, the valiant Bhimasena, O king, filled with wrath, struck\r\nGautama in that battle with many shafts. Possessed of the splendour of\r\nYama himself, as he appears at the end of the Yuga, Bhimasena then, with\r\nthree arrows, despatched unto Death's domain the steeds of the ruler of\r\nthe Sindhus as also his charioteer. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior,\r\n(viz., Jayadratha), quickly jumping down from that car whose steeds had\r\nbeen slain, shot in that battle many sharp-pointed shafts at Bhimasena.\r\nThen, O sire, with a couple of broad-headed arrows, he cut off, O chief\r\nof the Bharatas, the bow of the high-souled king of the Sindhus in the\r\nmiddle. His bow cut off, himself deprived of car, his steeds and\r\ncharioteer slain, Jayadratha then, O king, quickly mounted on the car of\r\nChitrasena. Indeed, the son of Pandu achieved in that battle a most\r\nwonderful feat, for piercing all those mighty car-warriors and holding\r\nthem in check, he deprived, O sire, the ruler of the Sindhus of his car\r\nin the very sight of all the army. Salya could not brook to see the\r\nprowess that Bhimasena displayed, for saying unto him,--Wait, Wait,--he\r\naimed some sharp arrows well-polished by the forger's hands, and pierced\r\nBhima therewith in that battle. And Kripa and Kritavarman and the valiant\r\nBhagadatta, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Chitrasena, and\r\nDurmarshana, and Vikarna, and the valiant ruler of the Sindhus also, in\r\nthat battle,--These chastisers of foes, all quickly pierced Bhima for the\r\nsake of Salya. Bhima then pierced each of them in return with five\r\narrows. And he pierced Salya then with seventy arrows and once more with\r\nten. And Salya then pierced him with nine arrows and once more with five.\r\nAnd he pierced Bhimasena's charioteer also, deep in his vitals, with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow. The valiant Bhimasena then, beholding his charioteer\r\nVisoka deeply pierced, sped three arrows at the arms and chest of the\r\nruler of Madras. And as regards the other great bowmen, he pierced each\r\nof them in that battle With three straight arrows, and then uttered a\r\nloud roar like that of a lion. Each of those great bowmen then, exerting\r\nhimself with vigour, deeply Pierced that son of Pandu skilled in battle,\r\nwith three arrows in his vitals. That mighty bowman viz., Bhimasena,\r\nthough pierced deeply, trembled not (but stood still) like a mountain\r\ndrenched with torrents of rain by showering clouds. Then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior of the Pandavas, filled with wrath, that celebrated hero,\r\ndeeply, pierced the ruler of the Madras with three arrows. And he pierced\r\nthe ruler of the Pragjyotishas, O king, in that battle, with a hundred\r\narrows. Of great renown, he then pierced Kripa with many arrows, and\r\nthen, displaying great dexterity, he cut off with a keen-edged shaft the\r\nbow, with arrow fixed thereon, of the high-souled Kritavarman. Then\r\nKritavarman, that scorcher of foes, taking up another bow, struck\r\nVrikodara between his eyebrows with a long arrow. Bhima, however, in that\r\nbattle, having pierced Salya with nine arrows made wholly of iron, and\r\nBhagadatta with three, and Kritavarman with eight, pierced each of the\r\nothers with Gautama at their head, with two arrows. Those warriors also,\r\nin return, pierced him, O king, with sharp-pointed shafts. Though thus\r\nafflicted by those mighty car-warriors with all kinds of weapons, yet,\r\nregarding them all as straw, he coursed on the field without any anxiety.\r\nThose foremost of car-warriors (on the other hand), with great coolness,\r\nsped at Bhima sharp-pointed arrows by hundreds and thousands. The heroic\r\nand mighty Bhagadatta then, in that battle, hurled at him a dart of\r\nfierce impetuosity furnished with a golden staff. And the Sindhu king, of\r\nstrong arms, hurled at him a lance and an axe. And Kripa, O king, hurled\r\nat him a Sataghni, and Salya an arrow. And the other great bowmen each\r\nsped at him five arrows with great force. The son of the Wind-god then\r\ncut off, with a sharp shaft, that lance in twain. And he cut off that axe\r\nalso with three shafts, as if it were a sesame stalk. And with five\r\nshafts winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird, he cut that Sataghni\r\ninto fragments. That mighty car-warrior then, having cut off the arrow\r\nsped by the ruler of the Madras, forcibly cut off the dart sped by\r\nBhagadatta in that battle. As regards the other fierce shafts, Bhimasena,\r\nproud of his feats in battle, cut them each into three fragments by means\r\nof his own straight shafts. And he struck each of those great bowmen also\r\nwith three shafts. Then Dhananjaya, during the progress of that dreadful\r\nbattle, beholding the mighty car-warrior Bhima striking the foe and\r\nbattling (against many) with his arrows, came thither on his car. Then\r\nthose bulls among men, of thy army, beholding those two high-souled sons\r\nof Pandu together, gave up all hopes of victory. Then Arjuna, desirous of\r\nslaying Bhishma, placing Sikhandin before him, approached Bhima who had\r\nbeen fighting with those great car-warriors and fell upon those fierce\r\ncombatants, numbering ten, of thy army, O Bharata. Then Vibhatsu,\r\ndesirous of doing what was agreeable to Bhima, pierced all those\r\nwarriors, O king, who had been battling with Bhima. Then king Duryodhana\r\nurged Susarman, for the destruction of both Arjuna and Bhimasena, saying,\r\n'O Susarman, go thou quickly supported by a large force. Slay those two\r\nsons of Pandu, viz., Dhananjaya and Vrikodara.' Hearing these words of\r\nhis, the Trigarta king who ruled the country called Prasthala, quickly\r\nrushed in battle upon those two bowmen, viz., Bhima and Dhananjaya, and\r\nsurrounded them both by many thousands of cars. Then commenced a fierce\r\nbattle between Arjuna and the foe.\""

And he pierced\r\nSusarman and Kripa with three arrows each. And in that battle the\r\nAtiratha Arjuna, afflicting thy host, struck the ruler of the\r\nPragjyotishas, and Jayadratha the king of the Sindhus, and Chitrasena,\r\nand Vikarna, and Kritavarman, and Durmarshana, O monarch, and those two\r\nmighty car-warriors, viz., the princes of Avanti, each with three arrows\r\nwinged with the feathers of the Kanka and the peacock. Jayadratha,\r\nstaying on the car of Chitrasena, pierced Partha (in return), O Bharata,\r\nand then, without loss of time, Bhima also, with his shafts. And Salya,\r\nand that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Kripa, both pierced Jishnu, O\r\nmonarch, with diverse arrows capable of penetrating into the very vitals.\r\nThy sons headed by Chitrasena, O king, each quickly pierced Arjuna and\r\nBhimasena in that battle, O sire, with five sharp shafts. Those two\r\nforemost of car-warriors however, viz., those sons of Kunti, those bulls\r\nof Bharata's race, began in that battle to afflict the mighty host of the\r\nTrigartas. Susarman (in return) pierced Partha with nine swift arrows,\r\nand uttered a loud shout frightening the vast host (of the Pandavas). And\r\nother heroic car-warriors pierced Bhimasena and Dhananjaya with many\r\nstraight-going arrows of keen points and golden wings. Amid these\r\ncar-warriors, however, those two bulls of Bharata's race, viz., the two\r\nsons of Kunti, those great car-warriors, looked exceedingly beautiful.\r\nAnd they seemed to sport amid them like two furious lions amid a herd of\r\nkine. Cutting off in various ways the bows and arrows of many brave\r\nwarriors in that battle, those two heroes felled the heads of combatants\r\nby hundreds upon hundreds. Innumerable cars were broken, and steeds by\r\nhundreds were slain, and many elephants, along with their riders, were\r\nlaid low on the field in that dreadful battle. And car-warriors and\r\nhorsemen and elephant-riders in large numbers, O king, deprived of life\r\nwere seen moving in convulsions all over the field. And the earth was\r\ncovered with slain elephants and foot-soldiers in large bands, and steeds\r\ndeprived of life, and cars broken in diverse ways. And the prowess we\r\nbeheld there of Partha was highly wonderful, in as much as holding in\r\ncheck all those heroes, that mighty warrior caused a great slaughter.\r\nKripa, and Kritavarman, and Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus, and\r\nVinda and Anuvinda of Avanti,--these did not forsake the battle. Then\r\nthat great bowman Bhima, and that mighty car-warrior Arjuna, began in\r\nthat battle to rout the fierce host of the Kauravas. The kings (in that\r\narmy) quickly sped at Dhananjaya's car myriads upon myriads and millions\r\nupon millions of arrows furnished with peacock feathers. Partha, however,\r\nchecking those arrows by means of his own arrowy showers, began to send\r\nthose mighty car-warriors to Yama's abode. The great car-warrior Salya\r\nthen, excited with wrath and as if sporting in that battle, struck Partha\r\nin the chest with some straight shafts of broad heads. Partha then,\r\ncutting off by means of five shafts Salya's bow and leathern fence,\r\npierced the latter deeply in the very vitals with many arrows of keen\r\npoints. Taking up another bow capable of bearing a great strain, the\r\nruler of the Madras then furiously attacked Jishnu with three arrows, O\r\nking, and Vasudeva with five. And he struck Bhimasena in the arms and the\r\nchest with nine arrows. Then Drona, O king, and that mighty car-warrior,\r\nviz., the ruler of the Magadhas, commanded by Duryodhana, both came to\r\nthat spot where those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Partha and\r\nBhimasena, were slaughtering the mighty host of the Kuru king. Jayatsena\r\n(the king of the Magadhas) then, O bull of Bharata's race pierced Bhima,\r\nthat wielder of awful weapons in battle, with eight sharp arrows. Bhima,\r\nhowever, pierced him (in return) with ten arrows, and once more with\r\nfive. And with another broad-headed shaft he felled Jayatsena's\r\ncharioteer from his niche in the car. The steeds (of his car), no longer\r\nrestrained, ran wildly in all directions and thus carried away the ruler\r\nof the Magadhas (from battle) in the sight of all the troops. Meanwhile\r\nDrona, noticing an opening, pierced Bhimasena, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nwith eight keen shafts furnished with heads shaped after the frog's\r\nmouth. Bhima, however, ever delighting in battle, pierced the preceptor,\r\nwho was worthy of paternal reverence, with five broad-headed arrows, and\r\nthen, O Bharata, with sixty. Arjuna, again piercing Susarman with a large\r\nnumber of arrows made (wholly) of iron, destroyed his troops like the\r\ntempest destroying mighty masses of clouds. Then Bhishma, and the king\r\n(viz., Duryodhana), and Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, excited\r\nwith rage, advanced upon Bhimasena and Dhananjaya. At this, the heroic\r\nwarriors of the Pandava army, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata,\r\nrushed in battle against Bhishma who was advancing like Death himself\r\nwith wide-open mouth. Sikhandin also, sighting the grandsire of the\r\nBharatas, was filled with joy and rushed at him, abandoning all fear of\r\nthe mighty car-warrior. Then all the Parthas with Yudhishthira at their\r\nhead, placing Sikhandin in the van, and uniting with the Srinjayas,\r\nfought with Bhishma in battle. And similarly all the warriors of thy\r\narmy, placing Bhishma of regulated vows in their van, fought in battle\r\nwith all the Parthas headed by Sikhandin. The battle then that commenced\r\nthere between the Kauravas and the sons of Pandu for the sake of\r\nBhishma's victory or victory over Bhishma, was exceedingly terrible.\r\nIndeed, in that game of battle, played for the sake of victory or the\r\nreverse, Bhishma, O monarch, became the stake on which the victory of thy\r\narmy depended. Then Dhrishtadyumna, O king, commanded all the troops,\r\nsaying, 'Rush against the son of Ganga. Do not fear, ye best of\r\ncar-warriors. Hearing those words of their generalissimo, the army of the\r\nPandavas quickly advanced against Bhishma, ready to lay down their lives\r\nin that dreadful battle. Bhishma then, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nreceived that large host rushing towards him, like the continent\r\nreceiving the surging sea.\""

      "content": "Dhritarashtra said, \"How, O Sanjaya, did Santanu's son Bhishma of mighty\r\nenergy fight on the tenth day of battle, with the Pandavas and the\r\nSrinjayas? How also did the Kurus resist the Pandavas in battle? Describe\r\nto me the great battle fought by Bhishma, that ornament of battle.\"\r\n\r\nSanjaya said, \"I will presently describe to thee, O Bharata, how the\r\nKauravas fought with the Pandavas, and how that battle took place. Day\r\nafter day many mighty car-warriors of thy army, excited with wrath, were\r\ndespatched to the other world by the diadem-decked (Arjuna) with his\r\ngreat weapons. The ever-victorious Kuru warrior Bhishma also, agreeably\r\nto his vow, always caused a great carnage among the Partha army. O\r\nchastiser of foes, beholding Bhishma, fighting at the head of the Kurus,\r\nand Arjuna also fighting at the head of the Panchalas, we could not say\r\ntruly on which side the victory would declare itself. On the tenth day of\r\nbattle, when Bhishma and Arjuna encountered each other, awful was the\r\ncarnage that took place. On that day, O scorcher of foes, Santanu's son,\r\nBhishma, conversant with high and mighty weapons, repeatedly slew\r\nthousands upon thousands of warriors. Many, O Bharata, whose names and\r\nfamilies were not known, but who, endued with great bravery, were\r\nunretreating from battle, were on that day slain by Bhishma. Scorching\r\nthe Pandava army for ten days, Bhishma of virtuous soul, gave up all\r\ndesire of protecting his life. Wishing his own slaughter presently at the\r\nhead of his troops,--No more shall I slay large numbers of foremost of\r\nwarriors.--thought thy mighty-armed sire Devavrata. And seeing\r\nYudhishthira near him, O king, he addressed him, saying, 'O Yudhishthira,\r\nO thou of great wisdom, O thou that art acquainted with every branch of\r\nlearning, listen to these righteous and heaven-leading words, O sire,\r\nthat I say. O Bharata, I no longer desire to protect, O sire, this body\r\nof mine. I have passed much time in slaying large numbers of men in\r\nbattle. If thou wishest to do what is agreeable to me, strive to slay me,\r\nplacing Partha with the Panchalas and the Srinjayas at thy van'.\r\nAscertaining this to be his intention, king Yudhishthira of true sight\r\nproceeded to battle with the Srinjayas (for his support). Then\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O king, and Pandu's son Yudhishthira, having heard those\r\nwords of Bhishma urged their array on. And Yudhishthira said, 'Advance!\r\nFight! Vanquish Bhishma in battle. Ye all will be protected by that\r\nconqueror of foes, viz., Jishnu of unbaffled aim. And this great bowman,\r\nthis generalissimo (of our forces), viz., the son of Prishata, as also\r\nBhima, will assuredly protect you. Ye Srinjayas, entertain no fear today\r\nof Bhishma in battle. Without doubt, we will vanquish Bhishma today,\r\nplacing Sikhandin in our van'. Having, on the tenth day of battle, made\r\nsuch a vow, the Pandavas, resolved to (conquer or) go to heaven,\r\nadvanced, blinded by rage, with Sikhandin and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu\r\nto the fore. And they made the most vigorous efforts for the overthrow of\r\nBhishma. Then diverse kings, of great might, urged by thy son, and\r\naccompanied by Drona and his son and a large force, and the mighty\r\nDussasana at the head of all his uterine brothers, proceeded towards\r\nBhishma staying in the midst of that battle. Then those brave warriors of\r\nthy army, placing Bhishma of high vows in their van, battled with the\r\nParthas headed by Sikhandin. Supported by the Chedis and the Panchalas,\r\nthe ape-bannered Arjuna, placing Sikhandin ahead, proceeded towards\r\nBhishma, the son of Santanu. And the grandson of Sini battled with\r\nDrona's son, and Dhrishtaketu with the descendant of Puru, and Yudhamanyu\r\nwith thy son Duryodhana at the head of his followers. And Virata, at the\r\nhead of his forces, encountered Jayadratha supported by his own troops.\r\nAnd Vardhakshatra's heir, O chastiser of foes, encountered thy son\r\nChitrasena armed with excellent bow and arrows.[479] And Yudhishthira\r\nproceeded against the mighty bowman Salya at the head of his troops. And\r\nBhimasena, well-protected, proceeded against the elephant-division (of\r\nthe Kaurava army). And Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of Panchala, excited\r\nwith fury and accompanied by his brothers, proceeded against Drona, that\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, invincible, and irresistible. That\r\nchastiser of foes, viz., prince Vrihadvala, bearing on his standard the\r\ndevice of the lion, proceeded against Subhadra's son whose standard bore\r\nthe device of the Karnikara flower. Thy sons, accompanied by many kings,\r\nproceeded against Sikhandin and Dhananjaya the son of Pritha, from desire\r\nof slaughtering both of them. When the combatants of both armies rushed\r\nagainst each other with awful prowess, the earth shook (under their\r\ntread). Beholding Santanu's son in battle, the divisions of thy army and\r\nof the foe, O Bharata, became mingled with one another. Tremendous was\r\nthe din, O Bharata, that arose there of those warriors burning with rage\r\nand rushing against each other. And it was heard on all sides, O king.\r\nWith the blare of conchs and the leonine shouts of the soldiers, the\r\nuproar became awful. The splendour, equal to that of either the Sun or\r\nthe Moon, of bracelets and diadems of all the heroic kings, became\r\ndimmed. And the dust that rose looked like a cloud, the flash of bright\r\nweapons constituting its lightning. And the twang of bows, the whiz of\r\narrows, the blare of conchs, the loud beat of drums, and the rattle of\r\ncars, of both the armies, constituted the fierce roar of those clouds.\r\nAnd the welkin, over the field of battle, in consequence of the bearded\r\ndarts, the javelins, the swords and showers of arrows of both armies, was\r\ndarkened. And car-warriors, and horsemen felled horsemen, in that\r\ndreadful battle. And elephants killed elephants, and foot-soldiers slew\r\nfoot-soldiers. And the battle that took place there for Bhishma's sake,\r\nbetween the Kurus and the Pandavas, O tiger among men, was fierce in the\r\nextreme, like that between two hawks for a piece of flesh. Engaged in\r\nbattle, that encounter between those combatants desirous of slaughtering\r\nand vanquishing one another, was extremely dreadful.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Abhimanyu, O king, displaying his prowess for the sake of\r\nBhishma, fought with thy son who was supported by a large force. Then\r\nDuryodhana, excited with wrath, struck Abhimanyu in the chest with rune\r\nstraight arrows, and once more with three. Then in that battle, Arjuna's\r\nson, inflamed with wrath, hurled at Duryodhana's car a terrible dart\r\nresembling the rod of Death himself. Thy son, however, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, O king, with a broad-headed arrow of great sharpness, cut\r\noff in twain that dart of terrible force coursing towards him with great\r\nspeed. Beholding that dart of his drop down on the earth, Arjuna's\r\nwrathful son pierced Duryodhana with three shafts in his arms and chest.\r\nAnd once more, O Chief of the Bharatas, that mighty car-warrior of\r\nBharata's race struck the Kuru king with ten fierce shafts in the centre\r\nof his chest. And the battle, O Bharata, that took place between those\r\ntwo heroes, viz., Subhadra's son, and that bull of Kuru's race, the\r\nformer fighting for compassing Bhishma's death and the latter for\r\nArjuna's defeat, was fierce and interesting to behold, and gratifying to\r\nthe senses, and was applauded by all the kings. That bull among Brahmanas\r\nand chastiser of foes, viz., the son of Drona, excited with wrath in that\r\nbattle, forcibly struck Satyaki in the chest with fierce arrow. The\r\ngrandson of Sini also, that hero of immeasurable soul, struck the\r\npreceptor's son in every vital limbs with nine shafts winged with the\r\nfeathers of the Kanka bird. Aswatthaman then, in that battle, struck\r\nSatyaki (in return) with nine shafts, and once more, quickly, with\r\nthirty, in his arms and chest. Then that great bowman Of the Satwata\r\nrace, possessed of great fame, deeply pierced by Drona's son, pierced the\r\nlatter (in return) with arrows. The mighty car-warrior Paurava, covering\r\nDhrishtaketu in that battle with his shafts, mangled that great bowman\r\nexceedingly. The mighty car-warrior Dhrishtaketu, endued with great\r\nstrength, quickly pierced the former with thirty arrows. Then the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Paurava cut off Dhrishtaketu's bow, and uttering a loud\r\nshout, pierced him with whetted shafts. Dhrishtaketu then taking up\r\nanother bow, pierced Paurava, O king, with three and seventy shafts of\r\ngreat sharpness. Those two great bowmen and mighty car-warriors, both of\r\ngigantic stature, pierced each other with showers of arrows. Each\r\nsucceeded in cutting off the other's bow, and each slew the other's\r\nsteeds. And both of them, thus deprived of their cars, then encountered\r\neach other in a battle with swords. And each took up a beautiful shield\r\nmade of bull's hide and docked with a hundred moons and graced with a\r\nhundred stars. And each of them also took up a polished sword of\r\nbrilliant lustre. And thus equipt, they rushed, O king at each other,\r\nlike two lions in the deep forest, both seeking the companionship of the\r\nsame lioness in her season. They wheeled in beautiful circles, advanced\r\nand retreated, and displayed other movements, seeking to strike each\r\nother. Then Paurava, excited with wrath, addressed Dhrishtaketu,\r\nsaying--Wait, Wait,--and struck him on the frontal bone with that large\r\nscimitar of his. The king of the Chedis also, in that battle, struck\r\nPaurava, that bull among men, on his shoulder-joint, with his large\r\nscimitar of sharp edge. Those two repressors of foes thus encountering\r\neach other in dreadful battle and thus striking each other, O king, both\r\nfell down on the field. Then thy son Jayatsena, taking Paurava up on his\r\ncar, removed him from the field of battle on that vehicle. And as regards\r\nDhrishtaketu, the valiant and heroic Sahadeva, the son of Madri,\r\npossessed of great prowess, bore him away from the field.\r\n\r\n\"Chitrasena, having pierced Susarman with many arrows made wholly of\r\niron, once more pierced him with sixty arrows and once more with nine.\r\nSusarman, however, excited with wrath in battle, pierced thy son, O king,\r\nwith hundreds of arrows. Chitrasena then, O monarch, excited with rage,\r\npierced his adversary with thirty straight shafts. Susarman, however,\r\npierced Chitrasena again in return.[480]\r\n\r\n\"In that battle for the destruction of Bhishma, Subhadra's son, enhancing\r\nhis fame and honour, fought with prince Vrihadvala, putting forth his\r\nprowess for aiding (his sire) Partha and then proceeded towards Bhishma's\r\nfront. The ruler of the Kosalas, having pierced the son of Arjuna with\r\nfive shafts made of iron, once more pierced him with twenty straight\r\nshafts. Then the son of Subhadra pierced the ruler of Kosalas with eight\r\nshafts made wholly of iron. He succeeded not, however, in making the\r\nruler of the Kosalas to tremble, and, therefore, he once more pierced him\r\nwith many arrows. And Phalguni's son then cut off Vrihadvala's bow, and\r\nstruck him again with thirty arrows winged with feathers of the Kanka\r\nbird. Prince Vrihadvala then, taking up another bow, angrily pierced the\r\nson of Phalguni in that battle with many arrows. Verily, O scorcher of\r\nfoes, the battle, for Bhishma's sake, that took place between them, both\r\nexcited with rage and both conversant with every mode of fight, was like\r\nthe encounter of Vali and Vasava in days of old on the occasion of the\r\nbattle between the gods and the Asuras.\r\n\r\n\"Bhimasena, fighting against the elephant-division, looked highly\r\nresplendent like Sakra armed with the thunder after splitting large\r\nmountains.[481] Indeed, elephants, huge as hills, slaughtered by\r\nBhimasena in battle, fell down in numbers on the field, filling the earth\r\nwith their shrieks. Resembling massive heaps of antimony, and of\r\nmountain-like proportions, those elephants with frontal globes split\r\nopen, lying prostrate on the earth, seemed like mountains strewn over the\r\nearth's surface. The mighty bowman Yudhishthira, protected by a large\r\nforce, afflicted the ruler of the Madras, encountering him in that\r\ndreadful battle. The ruler of the Madras, in return, displaying his\r\nprowess for the sake of Bhishma, afflicted the son of Dharma, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, in battle. The king of Sindhus, having pierced Virata with\r\nnine straight arrows of keen points, once more struck him with thirty.\r\nVirata, however, O king, that commander of a large division, struck\r\nJayadratha in the centre of his chest with thirty shafts of keen points.\r\nThe ruler of the Matsyas and the ruler of the Sindhus, both armed with\r\nbeautiful bows and beautiful scimitars, both decked with handsome coats\r\nof mail and weapons and standards, and both of beautiful forms looked\r\nresplendent in that battle.\r\n\r\n\"Drona, encountering Dhrishtadyumna the prince of the Panchalas in\r\ndreadful battle, fought fiercely with his straight shafts. Then Drona, O\r\nking, having cut off the large bow of Prishata's son, pierced him deeply\r\nwith fifty arrows. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of\r\nPrishata, taking up another bow, sped at Drona who was contending with\r\nhim, many arrows. The mighty car-warrior Drona however, cut off all those\r\narrows, striking them with his own. And then Drona sped at Drupada's son\r\nfive fierce shafts. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of\r\nPrishata, excited with rage, hurled at Drona in that battle a mace\r\nresembling the rod of Death himself. Drona however, with fifty arrows\r\nchecked that mace decked with gold as it coursed impetuously towards him.\r\nThereupon that mace, cut into fragments, O king, by those shafts shot\r\nfrom Drona's bow, fell down on the earth. Then that scorcher of foes,\r\nviz., the son of Prishata, beholding his mace baffled, hurled at Drona an\r\nexcellent dart made wholly of iron. Drona, however, O Bharata, cut that\r\ndart with nine shafts in that battle and then afflicted that great\r\nbowman, viz., the son of Prishata. Thus took place, O king, that fierce\r\nand awful battle between Drona and the son of Prishata, for the sake of\r\nBhishma.\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna, getting at the son of Ganga, afflicted him with many arrows of\r\nkeen points, and rushed at him like an infuriate elephant in the forest\r\nupon another. King Bhagadatta, however, of great prowess then rushed at\r\nArjuna, and checked his course in battle with showers of arrows. Arjuna\r\nthen, in that dreadful battle, pierced Bhagadatta's elephant coming\r\ntowards him, with many polished arrows of iron, that were all bright as\r\nsilver and furnished with keen points. The son of Kunti, meanwhile, O\r\nking, urged Sikhandin, saying,--Proceed, proceed, towards Bhishma, and\r\nslay him!--Then, O elder brother of Pandu, the ruler of Pragjyotishas,\r\nabandoning that son of Pandu, quickly proceeded, O king, against the car\r\nof Drupada. Then Arjuna, O monarch, speedily proceeded towards Bhishma,\r\nplacing Sikhandin ahead. And then there took place a fierce battle, for\r\nall the brave combatants of thy army rushed with great vigour against\r\nArjuna, uttering loud shouts. And all this seemed extremely wonderful.\r\nLike the wind dispersing in the summer masses of clouds in the welkin,\r\nArjuna dispersed, O king, all those diverse divisions of thy sons.\r\nSikhandin, however, without any anxiety, coming up at the grandsire of\r\nthe Bharatas, quickly pierced him with great many arrows. As regards\r\nBhishma, his car was then his fire-chamber. His bow was the flame of that\r\nfire. And swords I and darts and maces constituted the fuel of that fire.\r\nAnd the showers of arrows he shot were the blazing sparks of that fire\r\nwith which he was then consuming Kshatriyas in that battle. As a raging\r\nconflagration with constant supply of fuel, wandereth amid masses of dry\r\ngrass when aided by the wind, so did Bhishma blaze up with his flames,\r\nscattering his celestial weapons. And the Kuru hero slew the Somakas that\r\nfollowed Partha in that battle. Indeed that mighty car-warrior checked\r\nalso the other forces of Arjuna, by means of his straight and whetted\r\nshafts furnished with wings of gold. Filling in that dreadful battle all\r\nthe points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary, with his leonine\r\nshouts, Bhishma felled many car-warriors, O king, (from their cars) and\r\nmany steeds along with their riders. And he caused large bodies of cars\r\nto look like forests of palmyras shorn of their leafy heads. That\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, in that battle, deprived cars and\r\nsteeds and elephants, of their riders. Hearing the twang of his bow and\r\nthe slap of his palms, both resembling the roll of the thunder, the\r\ntroops, O king, trembled all over the field. The shafts, O chief of men,\r\nof thy sire were never bootless as they fell. Indeed, shot from Bhishma's\r\nbow they never fell only touching the bodies of the foe (but pierced them\r\nthrough in every case). We saw crowds of cars, O king, deprived of\r\nriders, but unto which were yoked fleet steeds, dragged on all sides with\r\nthe speed of the wind. Full fourteen thousand great car-warriors of noble\r\nparentage, prepared to lay down their lives, unretreating and brave, and\r\npossessed of standards decked with gold, belonging to the Chedis, the\r\nKasis, and the Karushas, approaching Bhishma, that hero who resembled the\r\nDestroyer himself with wide-open mouth, were despatched to the other\r\nworld, with their steeds, cars and elephants. There was not, O king, a\r\nsingle great car-warrior among the Somakas, who, having approached\r\nBhishma in that battle, returned with life from that engagement.\r\nBeholding Bhishma's prowess, people regarded all those warriors (who\r\napproached him) as already despatched to the abode of the king of the\r\nDead. Indeed, no car-warrior ventured to approach Bhishma in battle,\r\nexcept the heroic Arjuna having white steeds (yoked unto his car) and\r\nowning Krishna for his charioteer, and Sikhandin, the prince of Panchala,\r\nof immeasurable energy.\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said,--Sikhandin, O bull among men, approaching Bhishma in\r\nbattle, struck him in the centre of the chest with ten broad-headed\r\narrows The son of Ganga, however, O Bharata, only looked at Sikhandin\r\nwith wrath and as if consuming the Panchala prince with that look.\r\nRemembering his femininity, O king, Bhishma, in the very sight of all,\r\nstruck him not. Sikhandin, however, understood it not. Then Arjuna, O\r\nmonarch, addressed Sikhandin, saying,--'Rush quickly and slay the\r\ngrandsire. What needst thou say, O hero? Slay the mighty car-warrior\r\nBhishma. I do not see any other warrior in Yudhishthira's army who is\r\ncompetent to fight with Bhishma in battle, save thee, O tiger among men.\r\nI say this truly.' Thus addressed by Partha, Sikhandin, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, quickly covered the grandsire with diverse kinds of\r\nweapons. Disregarding those shafts, thy sire Devavrata began, with his\r\nshafts, to check the angry Arjuna only in that battle. And that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, O sire, began also to despatch, with his shafts of keen\r\npoints, the whole army of the Pandavas to the other world. The Pandavas\r\nalso, O king, after the same manner, supported by their vast host, began\r\nto overwhelm Bhishma like the clouds covering the maker of day. O bull of\r\nBharata's race, surrounded on all sides, that Bharata hero consumed many\r\nbrave warriors in that battle like a raging conflagration in the forest\r\n(consuming numberless trees). The prowess that we then beheld there of\r\nthy son (Dussasana) was wonderful, inasmuch as he battled with Partha and\r\nprotected the grandsire at the same time. With that feat of thy son\r\nDussasana, that illustrious bowman, all the people there were highly\r\ngratified. Alone he battled with all the Pandavas having Arjuna amongst\r\nthem; and he fought with such vigour that the Pandavas were unable to\r\nresist him. Many car-warriors were in that battle deprived of their cars\r\nby Dussasana. And many mighty bowmen on horseback and many\r\nmighty-warriors, elephants, pierced with Dussasana's keen shafts, fell\r\ndown on the earth. And many elephants, afflicted with his shafts, ran\r\naway in all directions. As a fire fiercely blazeth forth with bright\r\nflames when fed with fuel, so did thy son blaze forth, consuming the\r\nPandava host. And no car-warrior, O Bharata, of the Pandava host ventured\r\nto vanquish or even proceed against that warrior of gigantic proportions,\r\nsave Indra's son (Arjuna) owning white steeds and having Krishna for his\r\ncharioteer. Then Arjuna also called Vijaya, vanquishing Dussasana in\r\nbattle, O king, in the very sight of all the troops, proceeded against\r\nBhishma. Though vanquished, thy son, however, relying upon the might of\r\nBhishma's arms, repeatedly comforted his own side and battled with the\r\nPandavas with great fierceness. Arjuna, O king, fighting with his foes in\r\nthat battle, looked exceedingly resplendent.[482] Then Sikhandin, in that\r\nbattle, O king, pierced the grandsire with many arrows whose touch\r\nresembled that of the bolts of heaven and which were as fatal as the\r\npoison of the snake. These arrows, however, O monarch, caused thy sire\r\nlittle pain, for the son of Ganga received them laughingly. Indeed, as a\r\nperson afflicted with heat cheerfully receives torrents of rain, even so\r\ndid the son of Ganga received those arrows of Sikhandin. And the\r\nKshatriyas there, O king, beheld Bhishma in that great battle as a being\r\nof fierce visage who was incessantly consuming the troops of the\r\nhigh-souled Pandavas.\r\n\r\n\"Then thy son (Duryodhana), addressing all his warriors, said unto them,\r\n'Rush ye against Phalguni from all sides. Bhishma, acquainted with the\r\nduties of a commander, will protect you'. Thus addressed, the Kaurava\r\ntroops casting off all fear, fought with the Pandavas. (And once more,\r\nDuryodhana said unto them). 'With his tall standard bearing the device of\r\nthe golden palmyra, Bhishma stayeth, protecting the honour and the armour\r\nof all the Dhartarashtra warriors. The very gods, striving vigorously,\r\ncannot vanquish the illustrious and mighty Bhishma. What need be said,\r\ntherefore, of the Parthas who are mortals? Therefore, ye warriors, fly\r\nnot away from the field, getting Phalguni for a foe. I myself, striving\r\nvigorously, will today fight with the Pandavas.. uniting with all of you,\r\nye lords of earth, exerting yourselves actively.' Hearing these words, O\r\nmonarch, of thy son with bow in hand, many mighty combatants, excited\r\nwith rage, belonging to the Videhas, the Kalingas, and the diverse tribes\r\nof the Daserkas, fell upon Phalguni. And many combatants also, belonging\r\nto the Nishadas, the Sauviras, the Valhikas, the Daradas, the Westerners,\r\nthe Northerners, the Malavas, the Abhighatas, the Surasenas, the Sivis,\r\nthe Vasatis, the Salwas, the Sakas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and\r\nthe Kekayas, similarly fell upon Partha, like flights of insects upon a\r\nfire. The mighty Dhananjaya, otherwise called Vibhatsu, then, O monarch,\r\ncalling to mind diverse celestial weapons and aiming them at those great\r\ncar-warriors at the heads of their respective divisions,[483] quickly\r\nconsumed them all, by means of those weapons of great force, like fire\r\nconsuming a flight of insects. And while that firm bowman was (by means\r\nof his celestial weapons) creating thousands upon thousands of arrows,\r\nhis Gandiva looked highly resplendent in the welkin. Then those\r\nKshatriyas, O monarch, afflicted with those arrows with their tall\r\nstandards torn and overthrown, could not even together, approach the\r\nape-bannered (Partha). Car-warriors fell down with their standards, and\r\nhorsemen with their horses, and elephant-riders with their elephants,\r\nattacked by Kiritin with his shafts. And the earth was soon covered all\r\non all sides with the retreating troops of those kings, routed in\r\nconsequence of the shafts shot from Arjuna's arms. Partha then, O\r\nmonarch, having routed the Kaurava army, sped many arrows at Dussasana.\r\nThose arrows with iron heads, piercing thy son Dussasana through, all\r\nentered the earth like snakes through ant-hills. Arjuna then slew\r\nDussasana's steeds and then felled his charioteer. And the lord Arjuna,\r\nwith twenty shafts, deprived Vivingsati of his car, and struck him five\r\nstraight shafts. And piercing Kripa and Vikarna and Salya with many\r\narrows made wholly of iron, Kunti's son owning white steeds deprived all\r\nof them of their cars. Thus deprived of their cars and vanquished in\r\nbattle by Savyasachin, Kripa and Salya, O sire, and Dussasana, and\r\nVikarna and Vivingsati, all fled away. Having vanquished those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, O chief of the Bharatas, in the forenoon, Partha blazed up\r\nin that battle like a smokeless conflagration. Scattering his shafts all\r\naround like the Sun shedding rays of light, Partha felled many other\r\nkings, O monarch. Making those mighty car-warriors turn their backs upon\r\nthe field by means of his arrowy showers, Arjuna caused a large river of\r\nbloody current to flow in that battle between the hosts of the Kurus and\r\nthe Pandavas, O Bharata. Large numbers of elephants and steeds and\r\ncar-warriors were slain by car-warriors. And many were the car-warriors\r\nslain by elephants, and many also were the steeds slain by foot-soldiers.\r\nAnd the bodies of many elephant-riders and horsemen and car-warriors, cut\r\noff in the middle, as also their heads, fell down on every part of the\r\nfield. And the field of battle, O king, was strewn with (slain)\r\nprinces,--mighty car-warriors,--falling or fallen, decked with ear-rings\r\nand bracelets. And it was also strewn with the bodies of many warriors\r\ncut off by car-wheels, or trodden down by elephants. And foot-soldiers\r\nran away, and horsemen also with their horses. And many elephants and\r\ncar-warriors fell down on all sides. And many cars, with wheels and yokes\r\nand standards broken, lay scattered all about on the field. And the field\r\nof battle, dyed with the gore of large numbers of elephants, steeds, and\r\ncar-warriors, looked beautiful like a red cloud, in the autumnal sky.\r\nDogs, and crows, and vultures, and wolves, and jackals, and many other\r\nfrightful beasts and birds, set up loud howls, at the sight of the food\r\nthat lay before them. Diverse kinds of winds blew along all directions.\r\nAnd Rakshasas and evil spirits were seen there, uttering loud roars. And\r\nstrings, embroidered with gold, and costly banners, were seen to wave,\r\nmoved by the wind. And thousands of umbrellas and great cars with\r\nstandards attached to them, were seen lying scattered about on the field.\r\nThen Bhishma, O king, invoking a celestial weapon, rushed at the son of\r\nKunti, in the very sight of all the bowmen. Thereupon Sikhandin, clad in\r\nmail, rushed at Bhishma who was dashing towards Arjuna. At this, Bhishma\r\nwithdrew that weapon resembling fire (in effulgence and energy).\r\nMeanwhile Kunti's son owning white steeds slaughtered thy troops,\r\nconfounding the grandsire.[484]\""

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"When the combatants of both armies, strong in number, were\r\nthus disposed in battle array, all those unretreating heroes, O Bharata,\r\nset their heart upon the region of Brahma.[485] In course of the general\r\nengagement that followed, the same class of combatants did not fight with\r\nthe same class of combatants. Car-warriors fought not with car-warriors,\r\nor foot-soldiers with foot-soldiers, or horsemen with horsemen, or\r\nelephant-warriors with elephant-warriors. On the other hand, O monarch,\r\nthe combatants fought with one another like mad men. Great and dreadful\r\nwas the calamity that overtook both the armies. In that fierce slaughter\r\nwhen elephants and men spread themselves on the field, all distinctions\r\nbetween them ceased, for they fought indiscriminately.\r\n\r\n\"Then Salya and Kripa, and Chitrasena, O Bharata, and Dussasana, and\r\nVikarna, those heroes mounted on their bright cars, caused the Pandava\r\nhost to tremble. Slaughtered in battle by those high-souled warriors, the\r\nPandava army began to reel in diverse ways, O king, like a boat on the\r\nwaters tossed by the wind. As the wintry cold cuts kine to the quick, so\r\ndid Bhishma cut the sons of Pandu to the quick. As regards thy army also,\r\nmany elephants, looking like newly-risen clouds, were felled by the\r\nillustrious Partha. And many foremost of warriors too were seen to be\r\ncrushed by that hero. And struck with arrows and long shafts in\r\nthousands, many huge elephants fell down, uttering frightful shrieks of\r\npain. And the field of battle looked beautiful, strewn with the bodies,\r\nstill decked with ornaments of high-souled warriors deprived of life and\r\nwith heads still decked with ear-rings. And in that battle, O king, which\r\nwas destructive of great heroes, when Bhishma and Dhananjaya the son of\r\nPandu put forth their prowess, thy sons, O monarch, beholding the\r\ngrandsire exert himself vigorously, approached him, with all their troops\r\nplaced ahead. Desirous of laying down their lives in battle and making\r\nheaven itself their goal, they approached the Pandavas in that battle,\r\nwhich was fraught with great carnage. The brave Pandavas also, O king,\r\nbearing in mind the many injuries of diverse kinds inflicted upon them\r\nbefore by thee and thy son, O monarch, and casting off all fear, and\r\neager to win the highest heavens, cheerfully fought with thy son and the\r\nother warriors of thy army.\r\n\r\n\"Then the generalissimo of the Pandava army, viz., the mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtadyumna, addressing his soldiers, said, 'Ye Somakas, accompanied\r\nby the Srinjayas, rush ye at Ganga's son.' Hearing those words of their\r\ncommander the Somakas and the Srinjayas, though afflicted with showers of\r\narrows, rushed at the son of Ganga. Thus attacked, O king, thy sire\r\nBhishma, influenced by wrath, began to fight with the Srinjayas. In days\r\nof old, O sire, the intelligent Rama had imparted to Bhishma of glorious\r\nachievements that instruction in weapons which was so destructive of\r\nhostile ranks. Relying on that instruction and causing a great havoc\r\namong the troops of the foe, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the old\r\nKuru grandsire Bhishma, day after day, slew ten thousand warriors of the\r\nRatha. On the tenth day, however, O bull of Bharata's race, Bhishma,\r\nsingle-handed, slew ten thousand elephants. And then he slew seven great\r\ncar-warriors among the Matsyas and the Panchalas. In addition to all\r\nthis, in that dreadful battle five thousand foot-soldiers, and one\r\nthousand tuskers, and ten thousand steeds, were also slain by thy sire, O\r\nking, through skill acquired by education. Then having thinned the ranks\r\nof all the kings, he slew Satanika, the dear brother of Virata. And the\r\nvaliant Bhishma, having slain Satanika in battle, felled, O king, full\r\none thousand Kshatriyas with his broad-headed shafts. Besides these, all\r\nthe Kshatriyas of the Pandava army who followed Dhananjaya, as soon as\r\nthey approached Bhishma, had to go to Yama's abode. Covering the Pandava\r\nhost from every side with showers of arrows, Bhishma stayed in battle at\r\nthe head of the Kaurava army. Achieving the most glorious feats on the\r\ntenth day, as he stayed between the two armies, bow in hand, none of the\r\nkings, O monarch, could even look at him, for he then resembled the hot\r\nmid-day Sun in the summer sky. As Sakra scorched the Daitya host in\r\nbattle, even so, O Bharata, did Bhishma scorch the Pandava host.\r\nBeholding him thus put forth his prowess, the slayer of Madhu, viz., the\r\nson of Devaki, cheerfully addressing Dhananjaya, said, 'There, Bhishma,\r\nthe son of Santanu, stayeth between the two armies. Slaying him by\r\nputting forth thy might, thou mayst win victory. There, at that spot,\r\nwhence he breaketh our ranks, check him, putting forth thy strength. O\r\nlord, none else, save thee, ventureth to bear the arrows of Bhishma. Thus\r\nurged, the ape-bannered Arjuna at that moment made Bhishma with his car,\r\nsteeds, and standard, invisible by means of his arrows. That bull,\r\nhowever, among the foremost of Kurus, by means of his own arrowy showers,\r\npierced those showers of shafts shot by the son of Pandu. Then the king\r\nof the Panchalas the valiant Dhrishtaketu, Bhimasena the son of Pandu,\r\nDhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva),\r\nChekitana, and the five Kaikaya brothers, and the mighty-armed Satyaki\r\nand Subhadra's son, and Ghatotkacha, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and\r\nSikhandin, and the valiant Kuntibhoja, and Susarman, and Virata, these\r\nand many other powerful warriors of the Pandava army, afflicted by the\r\nshafts of Bhishma, seemed to sink in an ocean of grief, Phalguni,\r\nhowever, rescued them all. Then Sikhandin, taking up a mighty weapon and\r\nprotected by Kiritin, rushed impetuously towards Bhishma alone. The\r\nunvanquished Vibhatsu then, knowing what should be done after what, slew\r\nall those that followed Bhishma, and then himself rushed at him. And\r\nSatyaki, and Chekitana, and Dhristadyumna of Prishata's race, and Virata,\r\nand Drupada, and the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, all protected by that\r\nfirm bowman (viz., Arjuna) rushed against Bhishma alone in that battle.\r\nAnd Abhimanyu, and the five sons of Draupadi also, with mighty weapons\r\nupraised, rushed against Bhishma in battle. All those firm bowmen,\r\nunretreating from battle, pierced Bhishma in diverse parts of his body\r\nwith well-aimed shafts. Disregarding all those shafts, large in number,\r\nshot by those foremost of princes belonging to the Pandava host, Bhishma\r\nof undepressed soul penetrated into the Pandava ranks. And the grandsire\r\nbaffled all those arrows, as if sporting the while. Frequently looking at\r\nSikhandin the prince of the Panchalas with a laugh, he aimed not a single\r\narrow at him, recollecting his femininity. On the other hand, he slew\r\nseven great car-warriors belonging to Drupada's division. Then confused\r\ncries of woe soon arose amongst the Matsyas, the Panchalas, and the\r\nChedis, who were together rushing at that single hero. With large numbers\r\nof foot-soldiers and steeds and cars, and with showers of arrows, O\r\nscorcher of foes, they overwhelmed that single warrior, viz., Bhishma the\r\nson of Bhagirathi, that scorcher of foes, like the clouds overwhelming\r\nthe maker of day. Then in that battle between him and them, which\r\nresembled the battle between the gods and the Asuras in days of old, the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna), placing Sikhandin before him, pierced Bhishma\r\n(repeatedly).'"

      "content": "Sanjaya said, \"Thus all the Pandavas, placing Sikhandin before them\r\npierced Bhishma in that battle repeatedly surrounding him on all sides.\r\nAnd all the Srinjayas, uniting together, struck him with dreadful\r\nSataghnis, and spiked maces, and battle-axes, and mallets, and short\r\nthick clubs, and bearded darts, and other missiles, and arrows furnished\r\nwith golden wing, and darts and lances and kampanas; and with long\r\nshafts, and arrows furnished with heads shaped like the calf-tooth, and\r\nrockets. Thus afflicted by many, his coat of mail was pierced everywhere.\r\nBut though pierced in every vital part, Bhishma felt no pain. On the\r\nother hand, he then seemed to his enemies to resemble in appearance the\r\n(all-destructive) fire that rises at the end of Yuga. His bow and arrows\r\nconstituted the blazing flames (of that fire). The flight of his weapons\r\nconstituted its (friendly) breeze. The rattle of his car-wheels\r\nconstituted its heat and mighty weapons constituted its splendour. His\r\nbeautiful bow formed its fierce tongue, and the bodies of heroic\r\nwarriors, its profuse fuel. And Bhishma was seen to roll through the\r\nmidst of crowds of cars belonging to those kings, or to come out (of the\r\npress) at times, or course once more through their midst. Then,\r\ndisregarding the king of the Panchalas and Dhrishtaketu, he penetrated, O\r\nmonarch, into the midst of the Pandava army. He then pierced the six\r\nPandava warriors, viz., Satyaki, and Bhima, and Dhananjaya the son of\r\nPandu, and Drupada, and Virata, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race,\r\nwith many excellent arrows of great sharpness and dreadful whizz and\r\nexceeding impetuosity, and capable of piercing through every kind of\r\narmour. Those mighty car-warriors, however, checking those keen shafts,\r\nafflicted Bhishma with great force, each of them striking him with ten\r\nshafts. Those mighty shafts, whetted on stone and furnished with golden\r\nwings, which the great car-warrior Sikhandin shot, quickly penetrated\r\ninto Bhishma's body. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna), excited with wrath,\r\nand placing Sikhandin ahead rushed at Bhishma and cut off the latter's\r\nbow. Thereupon mighty car-warriors, seven in number, viz., Drona and\r\nKritavarman, and Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, and Bhurisravas,\r\nand Sala, and Salya, and Bhagadatta could not brook that act of Arjuna.\r\nInflamed with rage, they rushed at him. Indeed, those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, invoking into existence celestial weapons, fell with great\r\nwrath upon that son of Pandu, and covered him with their arrows. And as\r\nthey rushed towards Phalguni's car, the noise made by them was heard to\r\nresemble that made by the ocean itself when it swelleth in rage at the\r\nend of the Yuga, Kill, Bring up (our forces), Take, Pierce, Cut off, this\r\nwas the furious uproar heard about Phalguni's car. Hearing that furious\r\nuproar, the mighty car-warriors of the Pandava army rushed forward, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, for protecting Arjuna. They were Satyaki, and\r\nBhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and both Virata and\r\nDrupada, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and the wrathful Abhimanyu. These\r\nseven, inflamed with rage, and armed with excellent bows, rushed with\r\ngreat speed. And the battle that took place between these and the Kaurava\r\nwarriors was fierce, making the hair stand on end, and resembling O chief\r\nof the Bharatas, the battle of the gods with the Danavas. Sikhandin,\r\nhowever, that foremost of car-warriors, protected in the battle by the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna), pierced Bhishma, in that encounter, with ten\r\nshafts after the latter's bow had been cut off. And he struck Bhishma's\r\ncharioteer with other shafts, and cut off the latter's standard with one\r\nshaft. Then the son of Ganga took up another bow that was tougher. That\r\neven was cut off by Phalguni with three sharp shafts. Indeed, that\r\nchastiser of foes, viz., Arjuna, who was capable of drawing the bow with\r\neven his left hand, excited with rage, one after another, cut off all the\r\nbows that Bhishma took up. Then Bhishma, whose bows were thus cut off,\r\nexcited with rage, and licking the corners of his mouth, took up a dart\r\nthat was capable of riving a hill. In rage he hurled it at Phalguni's\r\ncar. Beholding its course towards him like the blazing bolt of heaven,\r\nthe delighter of the Pandavas fixed five sharp broad-headed arrows (on\r\nhis bow-string). And with those five arrows, O chief of the Bharatas, the\r\nangry Arjuna cut off into five fragments that dart hurled from Bhishma's\r\narms. Thus cut off by the angry Arjuna, that dart then fell down like a\r\nflash of lightning separated from a mass of clouds. Beholding his dart\r\ncut off, Bhishma became filled with rage. That hero, that subjugator of\r\nhostile cities, then began to reflect. And he said unto himself, 'With\r\nonly a single bow I could slay all the Pandavas, if the mighty Vishnu\r\nhimself had not been their protector. For two reasons, however, I will\r\nnot fight with the Pandavas, viz., their unslayableness, and the\r\nfemininity of Sikhandin. Formerly, when my sire wedded Kali, he pleased\r\n(with me) gave me two boons, viz., that I should be incapable of being\r\nslain in battle, and that my death should depend on my own choice. I\r\nshould, however, now wish my own death, this being the proper hour.'\r\nAscertaining this to be the resolve of Bhishma of immeasurable energy,\r\nthe Rishis and the Vasus stationed in the firmament, said, 'That which\r\nhath been resolved by thee is approved by us also, O son! Act according\r\nto thy resolution, O king. Withdraw thy heart from battle.' On the\r\nconclusion, of those words, fragrant and auspicious breeze charged with\r\nparticles of water, began to blow along a natural direction.[486] And\r\ncelestial cymbals of loud sounds began to beat. And a flowery shower fell\r\nupon Bhishma, O sire. The words spoken by the Rishis and the Vasus,\r\nhowever, O king, were not heard by any one save Bhishma himself. I also\r\nheard them, through the power conferred on me by the Muni. Great was the\r\ngrief, O monarch, that filled the hearts of the celestials at the thought\r\nof Bhishma, that favourite of all the worlds, falling down from his car.\r\nHaving listened to these words of the celestials, Santanu's son Bhishma\r\nof great ascetic merit rushed out at Vibhatsu, even though he was then\r\nbeing pierced with sharp arrows capable of penetrating through every\r\narmour. Then Sikhandin, O king, excited with rage, struck the grandsire\r\nof the Bharatas in the chest with nine sharp arrows. The Kuru grandsire\r\nBhishma, however, though struck by him in battle, thus, trembled not, O\r\nmonarch, but remained unmoved like a mountain during an earthquake. Then\r\nVibhatsu, drawing his bow Gandiva with a laugh, pierced the son of Ganga\r\nwith five and twenty arrows. And once more, Dhananjaya, with great speed\r\nand excited with wrath struck him in every vital part with hundreds of\r\narrows. Thus pierced by others, also with thousands of arrows, the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Bhishma pierced those others in return with great speed. And\r\nas regards the arrows shot by those warriors, Bhishma, possessed of\r\nprowess in battle that was incapable of being baffled, equally checked\r\nthem all with his own straight arrows. Those arrows, however, endued with\r\nwings of gold and whetted on stone, which the mighty car-warrior\r\nSikhandin shot in that battle, scarcely caused Bhishma any pain. Then the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna), excited with rage and placing Sikhandin to the\r\nfore, approached Bhishma (nearer) and once more cut off his bow. And then\r\npiercing Bhishma with ten arrows, he cut off the latter's standard with\r\none. And striking Bhishma's chariot with ten arrows, Arjuna caused him to\r\ntremble. The son of Ganga then took up another bow that was stronger.\r\nWithin, however, the twinkling of an eye, as soon, in fact, as it was\r\ntaken up, Arjuna cut that bow also into three fragments with three\r\nbroad-headed shafts. And thus the son of Pandu cut off in that battle\r\neven all the bows of Bhishma. After that, Bhishma the son of Santanu, no\r\nlonger desired to battle with Arjuna. The latter, however, then pierced\r\nhim with five and twenty arrows. That great bowman, thus pierced greatly,\r\nthen addressed Dussasana, and skid, 'Behold, Partha, that great\r\ncar-warrior of the Pandavas, excited with wrath in battle, pierceth me\r\nalone with many thousands of arrows. He is incapable of being vanquished\r\nin battle by the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. As regards myself\r\nalso, O hero, the very gods, Danavas and Rakshasas united together, are\r\nincapable of vanquishing me. What I shall say then of mighty car-warriors\r\namong men?' While Bhishma was thus speaking to Dussasana, Phalguni with\r\nsharp shafts, and placing Sikhandin to the fore, pierced Bhishma in that\r\nbattle. Then Bhishma, deeply and excessively pierced by the wielder of\r\nGandiva with keen-pointed shafts, once more addressed Dussasana with a\r\nsmile and said, 'These arrows coursing towards me in one continuous line,\r\nwhose touch resembleth that of heaven's bolt, have been shot by Arjuna.\r\nThese are not Sikhandin's. Cutting me to the quick, piercing through even\r\nmy hard coat of mail, and striking me with the force of mushalas, these\r\narrows are not Sikhandin's. Of touch as hard as that of the Brahmana's\r\nrod (of chastisement),[487] and of impetus unbearable as that of the\r\nthunder-bolt, these arrows are afflicting my vital forces. These are not\r\nSikhandin's. Of the touch of maces and spiked bludgeons, those arrows are\r\ndestroying my vital forces like messengers of Death commissioned (by the\r\ngrim king himself). These are not Sikhandin's. Like angry snakes of\r\nvirulent poison, projecting their tongues out, these are penetrating into\r\nmy vitals. These are not Sikhandin's--these that cut me to the quick like\r\nthe cold of winter cutting kine to the quick. Save the heroic wielder of\r\nGandiva, viz., the ape-bannered Jishnu, even all other kings united\r\ntogether cannot cause me pain. Saying these words, Bhishma, the valiant\r\nson of Santanu, as if for the object of consuming the Pandavas, hurled a\r\ndart at Partha. Partha, however, caused that dart to drop down, cutting\r\nit into three fragments with three shafts, in the very sight, O Bharata,\r\nof all the Kuru heroes of thy army. Desirous of obtaining either death or\r\nvictory, the son of Ganga then took up a sword and a shield decked with\r\ngold. Before, however, he could come down from his car, Arjuna cut off by\r\nmeans of his arrows, that shield into a hundred fragments. And that feat\r\nof his seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then the king Yudhishthira urged his\r\nown troops, saying, 'Rush ye at Ganga's son. Do not entertain the\r\nslightest fear'. Then, armed with bearded darts, and lances, and arrows,\r\nfrom all sides, with axes, and excellent scimitars, and long shafts of\r\ngreat sharpness, with calf-toothed arrows, and broad-headed shafts, they\r\nall rushed at that single warrior. Then arose from among the Pandava host\r\na loud shout. Then thy sons also, O king, desirous of Bhishma's victory,\r\nsurrounded him and uttered leonine shouts. Fierce was the battle fought\r\nthere between thy troops and those of the enemy on that the tenth day, O\r\nking, when Bhishma and Arjuna met together. Like unto the vortex that\r\noccurs at the spot where the Ganga meets the Ocean, for a short while a\r\nvortex occurred there where the troops of both armies met and struck one\r\nanother down. And the Earth, wet with gore, assumed a fierce form. And\r\nthe even and the uneven spots on her surface could no longer be\r\ndistinguished. Although Bhishma was pierced in all his vital limbs, yet\r\non that the tenth day he stayed (calmly) in battle, having slain ten\r\nthousand warriors. Then that great bowman, Partha, stationed at the head\r\nof his troops, broke the centre of the Kuru army. Ourselves then, afraid\r\nof Kunti's son Dhananjaya having white steeds attached to his car, and\r\nafflicted by him with polished weapons, fled away from the battle. The\r\nSauviras, the Kitavas, the Easterners, the Westerners, the Northerners,\r\nthe Malavas, the Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis, the\r\nSalwas, the Sayas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and the\r\nKaikeyas.[488]--these and many other illustrious warriors,--afflicted\r\nwith arrows and pained by their wounds, abandoned Bhishma in that battle\r\nwhile he was fighting with the diadem-decked (Arjuna). Then a great many\r\nwarriors, surrounding that single warrior on all sides, defeated the\r\nKurus (that protected him) and covered him with shower of arrows. Throw\r\ndown, Seize, Fight, Cut into pieces,--this was the furious uproar, O\r\nking, heard in the vicinity of Bhishma's car. Having slain in that\r\nbattle, O monarch, (his foes) by hundreds and thousands, there was not in\r\nBhishma's body space of even two fingers' breadth that was not pierced\r\nwith arrows. Thus was thy sire mangled with arrows of keen points by\r\nPhalguni in that battle. And then he fell down from his car with his head\r\nto the east, a little before sunset, in the very sight of thy sons. And\r\nwhile Bhishma fell, loud cries of alas and oh, O Bharata, were heard in\r\nthe welkin uttered by the celestials and the kings of the earth. And\r\nbeholding the high-souled grandsire falling down (from his car), the\r\nhearts of all of us fell with him. That foremost of all bowmen, that\r\nmighty-armed hero, fell down, like an uprooted standard of Indra, making\r\nthe earth tremble the while.[489] Pierced all over with arrows, his body\r\ntouched not the ground. At that moment, O bull of Bharata's race, a\r\ndivine nature took possession of that great bowman lying on a bed of\r\narrows. The clouds poured a (cool) shower (over him) and the Earth\r\ntrembled. While falling he had marked that the Sun was then in the\r\nsouthern solstice. That hero, therefore, permitted not his senses to\r\ndepart, thinking of that (inauspicious) season (of death). And all around\r\nin the welkin he heard celestial voices saying, 'Why, Oh why, should\r\nGanga's son, that foremost of all warriors of weapons, yield up his life\r\nduring the southern declension?' Hearing these words, the son of Ganga\r\nanswered, 'I am alive!' Although fallen upon the earth, the Kuru\r\ngrandsire Bhishma, expectant of the northern declension, suffered not his\r\nlife to depart. Ascertaining that to be his resolve, Ganga, the daughter\r\nof Himavat, sent unto him the great Rishis in swanlike form. Then those\r\nRishis in the forms of swans inhabiting the Manasa lake, quickly rose up,\r\nand came together, for obtaining a sight of the Kuru grandsire Bhishma,\r\nto that spot where that foremost of men was lying on his bed of arrows.\r\nThen those Rishis in swanlike forms, coming to Bhishma, beheld that\r\nperpetuator of Kuru's race lying on his bed of arrows. Beholding that\r\nhigh-souled son of Ganga, that chief of the Bharatas, they walked round\r\nhim, and the Sun being then in the southern solstice, they said,\r\naddressing one another, these words, 'Being a high-souled person, why\r\nshould Bhishma pass out (of the world) during the southern declension?'\r\nHaving said these words, those swans went away, proceeding towards the\r\nsouthern direction. Endued with great intelligence, Bhishma, O Bharata.\r\nbeholding them, reflected for a moment. And the son of Santanu then said\r\nunto them. 'I will never pass out (of the world) as long as the Sun is in\r\nthe southern solstice. Even this is my resolve. I will proceed to my own\r\nancient abode when the Sun reacheth the northern solstice. Ye swans, I\r\ntell you this truly. Expectant of the northern declension I will hold my\r\nlife. Since I have the fullest control over the yielding up of my life, I\r\nwill, therefore, hold life, expectant of death during the northern\r\ndeclension. The boon that was granted to me by my illustrious sire, to\r\nthe effect that my death would depend on my own wish O, let that boon\r\nbecome true. I will hold my life, since I have control in the matter of\r\nlaying it down.' Having said these words to those swans, he continued to\r\nlie down on his bed of arrows.\r\n\r\n\"When that crest of the Kuru race, viz., Bhishma of great energy, fell\r\ndown, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas uttered leonine shouts. When the\r\ngrandsire of the Bharatas who was endued with great might was overthrown,\r\nthy son, O bull of Bharata's race, knew not what to do. And all the Kurus\r\nwere entirely deprived of their senses. And the Kurus headed by Kripa,\r\nand Duryodhana, sighed and wept. And from grief they remained for a long\r\nwhile deprived of their senses. And they remained perfectly still, O\r\nmonarch, without setting their hearts on battle. As if seized by thighs,\r\nthey stood motionless, without proceeding against the Pandavas. When\r\nSantanu's son Bhishma of mighty energy, who was (regarded as) unslayable,\r\nwas slain, all of us thought that the destruction of the Kuru king was at\r\nhand.[490] Vanquished by Savyasachin, with our foremost heroes slain, and\r\nourselves mangled with sharp arrows, we knew not what to do. And the\r\nheroic Pandavas possessed of massive arms that looked like spiked maces,\r\nhaving obtained the victory and won a highly blessed state in the other\r\nworld,[491] all blew their great conches. And the Somakas and the\r\nPanchalas all rejoiced, O king. Then when thousands of trumpets were\r\nblown, the mighty Bhimasena slapped his arm-pits and uttered loud shouts.\r\nWhen the all-powerful son of Ganga was slain, the heroic warriors of both\r\narmies, laying down their weapons, began to reflect thoughtfully. And\r\nsome uttered loud shrieks and some fled away, and some were deprived of\r\ntheir senses. And some censured the practices of the Kshatriya order and\r\nsome applauded Bhishma. And the Rishis and the Pitris all applauded\r\nBhishma of high vows. And the deceased ancestors of the Bharatas also\r\npraised Bhishma. Meanwhile the valiant and intelligent Bhishma, the son\r\nof Santanu, having recourse to that Yoga which is taught in the great\r\nUpanishads and engaged in mental prayers, remained quiet, expectant of\r\nhis hour.\""

Even then I\r\nregarded the Kurus and all the others as slain by the Pandavas when\r\nBhishma, despising the son of Drupada, struck him not. Wretch that I am,\r\nalso, I hear today of my sire's slaughter. What can be a heavier sorrow\r\nthan this? My heart assuredly, O Sanjaya, is made of adamant, since it\r\nbreaketh not into a hundred fragments on hearing of Bhishma's death! Tell\r\nme, O thou of excellent vows, what was done by that lion among the Kurus,\r\nviz., the victory-desiring Bhishma when he was slain in battle. I cannot\r\nat all brook it that Devavrata should be slain in battle. Alas, he that\r\nwas not slain by Jamadagni's son himself in days of old by means of even\r\nhis celestial weapons, alas, he hath now been slain by Drupada's son\r\nSikhandin, the prince of Panchala!--\r\n\r\n'Sanjaya said,--\"Slain in the evening the Kuru grandsire Bhishma saddened\r\nthe Dhartarashtras and delighted the Panchalas. Falling down on the\r\nearth, he lay on his bed of arrows without however, touching the earth\r\nwith his body. Indeed, when Bhishma, thrown down from his car fell upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, cries of Oh and Alas were heard among all\r\ncreatures. When that boundary-tree of the Kurus, viz., the ever\r\nvictorious Bhishma, fell down, fear entered the hearts, O king, of the\r\nKshatriyas of both the armies. Beholding Bhishma, the son of Santanu,\r\nwith his standard overthrown and his armour cut open, both the Kurus and\r\nthe Pandavas were inspired, O monarch, with sentiments of cheerlessness.\r\nAnd the welkin was enveloped with a gloom and the Sun himself became dim.\r\nThe Earth seemed to utter loud shrieks when the son of Santanu was slain.\r\nThis one is the foremost of those conversant with the Vedas! This one is\r\nthe best of those that are conversant with the Vedas!--Even thus did\r\ncreatures speak of that bull among men as he lay (on his bed of\r\narrows).This one, formerly, ascertaining his sire Santanu to be afflicted\r\nby Kama, this bull among men, resolved to draw up his vital steed!--Even\r\nthus did the Rishis together with the Siddhas and the Charanas said of\r\nthat foremost one of the Bharatas as he lay on his bed of arrows. When\r\nSantanu's son Bhishma, the grandsire of the Bharatas, was slain, thy\r\nsons, O sire, knew not what to do. Their faces wore an expression of\r\ngrief. The splendour of their countenances seemed to abandon them, O\r\nBharata! All of them stood in shame, hanging down their heads. The\r\nPandavas, on the other hand, having, won the victory, stood at the head\r\nof their ranks. And they all blew their large conchs decked with gold.\r\nAnd when in consequence of their joys thousands of trumpets, O sinless\r\none, were blown there, we beheld O monarch, the mighty Bhimasena, the son\r\nof Kunti, sporting in great glee, having quickly slain many hostile\r\nwarriors endued with great strength. And a great swoon overtook all the\r\nKurus. And Karna and Duryodhana repeatedly drew long breaths. When the\r\nKuru grandsire Bhishma fell down, thus, cries of sorrow were heard all\r\nround, and the greatest confusion prevailed (among the Kuru army).\r\nBeholding Bhishma fallen, thy son Dussasana, with great speed, entered\r\nthe division commanded by Drona. That hero, clad in mail and at the head\r\nof his own troops, had been placed by his elder brother (for the\r\nprotection of Bhishma). That tiger among men now came, plunging the\r\ntroops he had commanded into grief. Beholding him coming towards them,\r\nthe Kauravas surrounded prince Dussasana, desirous, O monarch, of hearing\r\nwhat he had to say. Then Dussasana of Kuru's race informed Drona of\r\nBhishma's slaughter. Drona then, hearing those evil tidings, suddenly\r\nfell down from his car. Then the valiant son of Bharadwaja, quickly\r\nrecovering his senses, forbade the Kuru army, sire, to continue the\r\nfight. Beholding the Kurus desist from battle, the Pandavas also, through\r\nmessengers on fleet horses, forbade their orders, ceased to fight, the\r\nkings of both armies, putting off their armour, all repaired to Bhishma.\r\nDesisting from the fight, thousands of (other) warriors then, proceeded\r\ntowards the high-souled Bhishma like the celestials towards the Lord of\r\nall creatures. Approaching Bhishma who was then, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, lying (on his bed of arrows), the Pandavas and the Kurus stood\r\nthere, having offered him their salutations. Then Santanu's son Bhishma\r\nof righteous soul addressed the Pandavas and the Kurus who having\r\nreverenced him thus, stood before him. And he said,--Welcome to you, ye\r\nhighly blessed ones! Welcome to you, ye mighty car-warriors! Gratified am\r\nI with your sight, ye that are the equals of the very gods.--Thus\r\naddressing them with his head hanging down, he once more said,--'My head\r\nis hanging down greatly. Let a pillow be given to me!--The kings\r\n(standing there) then fetched many excellent pillows that were very soft\r\nand made of very delicate fabrics. The grandsire, however, desired them\r\nnot. That tiger among men then said unto those kings with a\r\nlaugh,--These, ye kings, do not become a hero's bed.--Beholding them that\r\nforemost of men, that mightiest of car-warriors in all the worlds, viz.,\r\nthe mighty-armed Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, he said,--O Dhananjaya, O\r\nthou of mighty arms, my head hangeth down, O sire! Give me a pillow such\r\nas thou regardest to be fit!--'\""

Indeed, give me one without delay O hero, that would become my\r\nbed! Thou O Partha, art competent, thou art the foremost of all wielders\r\nof bows! Thou art conversant with the duties of Kshatriyas and thou art\r\nendued with intelligence and goodness!--Then Phalguni, saying,--So be\r\nit--desired to do Bhishma's bidding. Taking up Gandiva and a number of\r\nstraight shafts, and inspiring them with mantras, and obtaining the\r\npermission of that illustrious and mighty car-warrior of Bharata's race,\r\nArjuna then, with three keen shafts endued with great force, supported\r\nBhishma's head. Then that chief of the Bharatas, viz., Bhishma of\r\nvirtuous soul, conversant with the truths of religion, seeing that\r\nArjuna, having divined his thought, had achieved that feat, became highly\r\ngratified. And after that pillow had thus been given to him, he applauded\r\nDhananjaya. And casting his eyes upon all the Bharatas there, he\r\naddressed Kunti's son Arjuna, that foremost of all warriors, that\r\nenhancer of the joys of his friends and said,--Thou hast given me, O son\r\nof Pandu, a pillow that becometh my bed! If thou hadst acted otherwise, I\r\nwould have cursed thee, from wrath! Even thus, O mighty-armed one, should\r\na Kshatriya, observant of his duties, sleep on the field of battle on his\r\nbed of arrows!--Having addressed Vibhatsu thus, he then said unto all\r\nthose kings and princes that were present there, these words:--Behold ye\r\nthe pillow that the son of Pandu hath given me! I will sleep on this bed\r\ntill the Sun turneth to the northern solstice! Those king that will then\r\ncome to me will behold me (yield up my life)! When the Sun on his car of\r\ngreat speed and unto which are yoked seven steeds, will proceed towards\r\nthe direction occupied by Vaisravana, verily, even then, will I yield up\r\nmy life like a dear friend dismissing a dear friend! Let a ditch be dug\r\nhere around my quarters ye kings! Thus pierced with hundreds of arrows\r\nwill I pay my adorations to the Sun? As regards yourselves, abandoning\r\nenmity, cease ye from the fight, ye kings--\r\n\r\n'Sanjaya continued,--\"Then there came unto him some surgeons well trained\r\n(in their science) and skilled in plucking out arrows, with all becoming\r\nappliances (of their profession). Beholding them, the son of Ganga said\r\nunto thy son,--'Let these physicians, after proper respect being paid to\r\nthem, be dismissed with presents of wealth. Brought to such a plight,\r\nwhat need have I now of physicians? I have won the most laudable and the\r\nhighest state ordained in Kshatriya observances! Ye kings, lying as I do\r\non a bed of arrows, it is not proper for me to submit now to the\r\ntreatment of physicians. With these arrows on my body, ye rulers of men,\r\nshould I be burnt!'--Hearing these words of his, thy son Duryodhana\r\ndismissed those physicians, having honoured them as they deserved. Then\r\nthose kings of diverse realms, beholding that constancy in virtue\r\ndisplayed by Bhishma of immeasurable energy, were filled with wonder.\r\nHaving given a pillow to thy sire thus, those rulers of men, those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the Pandavas and the Kauravas, united together, once\r\nmore approached the high-souled Bhishma lying on that excellent bed of\r\nhis. Reverentially saluting that high-souled one and circumambulating him\r\nthrice, and stationing guards all around for his protection, those\r\nheroes, with bodies drenched in blood, repaired for rest towards their\r\nown tents in the evening, their hearts plunged into grief and thinking of\r\nwhat they had seen.\r\n\r\nThen at the proper time, the mighty Madhava, approaching the Pandavas,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors cheerfully seated together and filled with joy\r\nat the fall of Bhishma, said unto Dharma's son Yudhishthira these\r\nwords,--\"By good luck victory hath been thine, O thou of Kuru's rare! By\r\ngood luck hath Bhishma been overthrown, who is unslayable by men, and is\r\na mighty car-warrior of aim incapable of being baffled! Or, perhaps, as\r\ndestiny would have it, that warrior who was master of every weapon,\r\nhaving obtained thee for a foe that canst slay with thy eyes alone, hath\r\nbeen consumed by thy wrathful eye!--Thus addressed by Krishna, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, replied unto Janardana, saying,--Through Thy grace\r\nis Victory, through Thy wrath is Defeat! Thou art dispeller of the fears\r\nof those that are devoted to thee. Thou art our refuge! It is not\r\nwonderful that they should have victory whom Thou always protectest in\r\nbattle, and in whose welfare Thou art always engaged, O Kesava! Having\r\ngot Thee for our refuge, I do not regard anything as wonderful! Thus\r\naddressed by him, Janardana answered with a smile,--O best of kings,\r\nthese words can come from thee alone!\""

Maidens by thousands, having repaired to that place, gently\r\nshowered over Santanu's son powdered sandal wood and fried paddy, and\r\ngarlands of flowers. And women and old men and children, and ordinary\r\nspectators, all approached Santanu's son like creatures of the world\r\ndesirous of beholding the Sun. And trumpets by hundreds and thousands,\r\nand actors, and mimes, and skilled mechanics also came to the aged Kuru\r\ngrandsire. And ceasing to fight, putting aside their coats of mail, and\r\nlying aside their weapons, the Kurus and the Pandavas, united together,\r\ncame to the invincible Devavrata, that chastiser of foes. And they were\r\nassembled together as in days of old, and cheerfully addressed one\r\nanother according to their respective ages. And that conclave full of\r\nBharata kings by hundreds and adorned with Bhishma, looked beautiful and\r\nblazing like a conclave of the gods in heaven. And that conclave of kings\r\nengaged in honouring the son of Ganga looked as beautiful as a conclave\r\nof the celestials engaged in adorning their Lord, viz., the Grandsire\r\n(Brahman). Bhishma, however, O bull of Bharata's race, suppressing his\r\nagonies with fortitude though burning with the arrows (still sticking to\r\nhis body), was sighing like a snake. His body burning with these arrows,\r\nand himself nearly deprived of his senses in consequence of his\r\nweapon-wounds, Bhishma cast his eyes on those kings and asked for water.\r\nThen those Kshatriyas, O king, brought thither excellent viands and\r\nseveral vessels of cold water. Beholding that water brought for him,\r\nSantanu's son said,--I cannot, O sire, now use any article of human\r\nenjoyment! I am removed from the pale of humanity. I am lying on a bed of\r\narrows. I am staying here, expecting only the return of the Moon and the\r\nSun! Having spoken these words and thereby rebuked those kings, O\r\nBharata, he said,--I wish to see Arjuna!--The mighty-armed Arjuna then\r\ncame there, and reverentially saluting the grandsire stood with joined\r\nhands, and said,--What shall I do?--Beholding then that son of Pandu, O\r\nmonarch, thus standing before him after having offered him respectful\r\nsalutations, Bhishma of righteous soul cheerfully addressed Dhananjaya,\r\nsaying,--Covered all over with thy shafts, my body is burning greatly!\r\nAll the vital parts of my body are in agony. My mouth is dry. Staying as\r\nI am with body afflicted with agony, give me water, O Arjuna! Thou art a\r\ngreat bowman! Thou art capable of giving me water duly!--The valiant\r\nArjuna then saying,--So be it,--mounted on his car, and striking his\r\nGandiva with force, began to stretch it. Hearing the twang of his bow and\r\nthe slap of his palms which resembled the roar of the thunder, the troops\r\nand the kings were all inspired with fear. Then that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, mounted on his car, circumambulated that prostrate chief of\r\nthe Bharatas, that foremost of all wielders of weapons. Aiming then a\r\nblazing arrow, after having inspired it with Mantras and identified it\r\nwith the Parjanya weapon, in the very sight of the entire army, the son\r\nof Pandu, viz., Partha, pierced the Earth a little to the south of where\r\nBhishma lay. Then there arose a jet of water that was pure, and\r\nauspicious, and cool, and that resembling the nectar itself, was of\r\ncelestial scent and taste. And with that cool jet of water Partha\r\ngratified Bhishma, that bull among the Kurus, of godlike deeds and\r\nprowess. And at that feat of Partha who resembled Sakra himself in his\r\nacts, all those rulers of Earth were filled with great wonder. And\r\nbeholding that feat of Vibhatsu implying superhuman prowess, the Kurus\r\ntrembled like kine afflicted with cold. And from wonder all the kings\r\nthere present waved their garments (in the air). And loud was the blare\r\nof conchs and the beat of drums that were then heard all over the field.\r\nAnd Santanu's son, his thirst quenched, then addressed Jishnu, O monarch,\r\nand said, applauding him highly in the presence of all those kings, these\r\nwords, viz.,--O thou of mighty arms, this is not wonderful in thee, O son\r\nof Kuru's race! O thou of immeasurable effulgence, even Narada spoke of\r\nthee as an ancient Rishi! Indeed, with Vasudeva as thy ally, thou wilt\r\nachieve many mighty feats which the chief of the celestials himself with\r\nall the gods, of a certainty, will not venture to achieve! They that have\r\nknowledge of such things know thee to be the destroyer of the whole\r\nKshatriya race! Thou art the one bowman among the bowmen of the world!\r\nThou art the foremost among men. As human beings are, in this world,\r\nforemost of all creatures, as Garuda is the foremost of all winged\r\ncreatures; as the Ocean is the foremost among all receptacles of water\r\nand the cow among all quadrupeds; as the Sun is the foremost amongst all\r\nluminous bodies and Himavat among all mountains; as the Brahmana is the\r\nforemost among all castes, art thou the foremost of all bowmen!\r\nDhritarashtra's son (Duryodhana) listened not to the words repeatedly\r\nspoken by me and Vidura and Drona and Rama and Janardana and also by\r\nSanjaya. Reft of his senses, like unto an idiot, Duryodhana placed no\r\nreliance on those utterances. Past all instructions, he will certainly\r\nhave to lie down for ever, overwhelmed by the might of Bhima!--Hearing\r\nthese words of his, the Kuru king Duryodhana became of cheerless heart.\r\nEyeing him, Santanu's son said,--Listen, O king! Abandon thy wrath! Thou\r\nhast seen, O Duryodhana how the intelligent Partha created that jet of\r\ncool and nectar-scented water! There is none else in this world capable\r\nof achieving such feat. The weapons appertaining to Agni, Varuna, Soma,\r\nVayu, and Vishnu, as also those appertaining to Indra, Pasupati, and\r\nParamesthi, and those of Prajapati, Dhatri, Tashtri, Savitri, and\r\nVivaswat, all these are known to Dhananjaya alone in this world of men!\r\nKrishna, the son of Devaki, also knoweth them. But there is none else\r\nhere that knoweth them. This son of Pandu, O sire, is incapable of being\r\ndefeated in battle by even the gods and the Asuras together. The feats of\r\nthis high-souled one are superhuman. With that truthful hero, that\r\nornament of battle, that warrior accomplished in fight, let peace, O\r\nking, be soon made! As long as the mighty-armed Krishna is not possessed\r\nby wrath, O chief of the Kurus, it is fit, O sire, that peace should be\r\nmade with the heroic Parthas! As long as this remnant of thy brothers is\r\nnot slain, let peace, O monarch, be made! As long as Yudhishthira with\r\neyes burning in wrath doth not consume thy troops in battle, let peace, O\r\nsire, be made! As long as Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhimasena, the sons\r\nof Pandu, do not, O monarch, exterminate thy army, it seems to me that\r\nfriendly relations should be restored between thee and the heroic\r\nPandavas! Let this battle end with my death, O sire! Make peace with the\r\nPandavas, Let these words that are uttered to thee by me be acceptable to\r\nthee, O sinless one! Even this is what I regard to be beneficial both for\r\nthyself and the race (itself of Kuru)! Abandoning thy wrath, let peace be\r\nmade with Parthas. What Phalguni hath already done is sufficient. Let\r\nfriendly relations be restored with the death of Bhishma! Let this\r\nremnant (of warriors) live! Relent, O king! Let half the kingdom be given\r\nto the Pandavas. Let king Yudhishthira the just, go to Indraprastha. O\r\nchief of the Kurus, do not achieve a sinful notoriety among the kings of\r\nthe earth by incurring the reproach of meanness, becoming a fomentor of\r\nintestine dissensions! Let peace come to all with my death! Let these\r\nrulers of earth, cheerfully mix with one another! Let sire get back the\r\nson, let sister's son get back the maternal uncle! If from want of\r\nunderstanding and possessed by folly thou dost not harken to those timely\r\nwords of mine thou wilt have to repent greatly! What I say is true.\r\nTherefore, desist even now! Having, from affection, said these words unto\r\nDuryodhana in the midst of the kings, the son of the ocean-going (Ganga)\r\nbecame silent. Though his vital limbs were burning with the arrow-wounds,\r\nyet, prevailing over his agonies, he applied himself to yoga.\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued--'Having heard these beneficial and peaceful words\r\nfraught with both virtue and profit, thy son, however, accepted them not,\r\nlike a dying man refusing medicine.\""

I tell\r\nthee truly, O son, that I bear thee no malice! It was only for abating\r\nthy energy that I used to say such harsh words to thee! O thou of\r\nexcellent vows without any reason thou speakest ill of all the Pandavas!\r\nSinfully didst thou come into the world. It is for this that thy heart\r\nhath been such. Through pride, and owning also to thy companionship with\r\nthe low, thy heart hateth even persons of merit! It is for this that I\r\nspoke such harsh words about thee in the Kuru camp! I know thy prowess in\r\nbattle, which can with difficulty be borne on earth by foes! I know also\r\nthy regard for Brahmanas. thy courage, and thy great attachment to\r\nalms-giving!

In bowmanship, in aiming weapon, in lightness of hand and in\r\nstrength of weapons, thou art equal to Phalguni himself, or the\r\nhigh-souled Krishna! O Karna, proceeding to the city of Kasi, alone with\r\nthy bow, thou hadst crushed the kings in battle for procuring a bride for\r\nthe Kuru king! The mighty and invincible king Jarasandha also, ever\r\nboastful of his prowess in battle, could not become thy match in fight!\r\nThou art devoted to Brahmanas; thou always fightest fairly! In energy and\r\nstrength, thou art equal to a child of the celestials and certainly much\r\nsuperior to men. The wrath I cherished against thee is gone. Destiny is\r\nincapable of being avoided by exertion. O slayer of foes, the heroic sons\r\nof Pandu are thy uterine brothers! If thou wishest to do what is\r\nagreeable to me, unite with them, O thou of mighty arms! O son of Surya,\r\nlet these hostilities end with me! Let all the kings of Earth be to-day\r\nfreed from danger!--\r\n\r\n\"'Karna said I know this, O thou of mighty arms! All this without doubt,\r\nis (as thou sayest)! As thou tellest me, O, Bhishma, I am Kunti's son,\r\nand not the son of a Suta! I was, however, abandoned by Kunti, and I have\r\nbeen reared by a Suta. Having (so long) enjoyed the wealth of Duryodhana,\r\nI dare not falsify it now. Like Vasudeva's son who is firmly resolved for\r\nthe sake of the Pandavas, I also, O thou that makest profuse presents to\r\nBrahmanas, am prepared to cast away my possessions, my body itself, my\r\nchildren, and my wife, for Duryodhana's sake! Death from disease, O thou\r\nof Kuru's race, doth not become a Kshatriya! Relying upon Suyodhana I\r\nhave always offended the Pandavas! This affairs is destined to take its\r\ncourse. It is incapable of being prevented. Who was there that would\r\nventure to overcome Destiny by exertion? Various omens indicating the\r\ndestruction of the Earth. O grandsire, were noticed by thee and declared\r\nin the assembly. It is well known to me that the son of Pandu, and\r\nVasudeva, are incapable of being conquered by other men. Even with them\r\nwe venture to fight! I will vanquish the son of Pandu in battle! Even\r\nthis is my firm resolve! I am not capable, of casting off this fierce\r\nanimosity (that I cherish against the Pandavas)! With a cheerful heart,\r\nand keeping the duties of my order before my eye, I will contend against\r\nDhananjaya. Firmly resolved that I am on battle, grant me thy permission,\r\nO hero! I will fight. Even this is my wish.

Freed from pride, and relying on thy (own) might and energy,\r\nengage in battle, since a Kshatriya cannot have a (source of) greater\r\nhappiness than a righteous battle. For a long while I made great efforts\r\nfor bringing about peace!

Tapas-kshetra because Kuru, the common ancestor of the rival houses,\r\nperformed his ascetic austerities there. Since Kuru's time, many ascetics\r\ntook up their abode there.\r\n\r\n2. Some texts have Duddharsham for Durddharshas.\r\n\r\n3. Literally, \"gives heat\".\r\n\r\n4. 'Varna' is used here in the sense of races and not castes.\r\n\r\n5. This sloka is variously read. For bhauman in the first line some texts\r\nread bhimam which I have adopted. For sahasa in the second line some\r\ntexts have rajasa, and then aditye (locative) for 'adityas'.\r\n\r\n6. The Bombay text is evidently faulty here; it repeats the second half\r\nof the 7th sloka, making the second half of the 25th the first half of\r\nthe 24th.\r\n\r\n7. i.e., stragglers should not be slain.\r\n\r\n8. Literally, \"confiding.\"\r\n\r\n9. The Bombay text has Castropanayishu; the Bengal texts have\r\nCastropojibishu.\r\n\r\n10. Rather, \"have their periods run out.\"\r\n\r\n11. The Bombay text reads pralahshaye for prajashaye. I have adopted the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n12. Both the Bengal and the Bombay editions have Kukkuran for Kukkutan as\r\nthe Burdwan Pundits correct it. A bitch producing dogs and bitches would\r\nbe no anomaly.\r\n\r\n13. Unlike the Bengal editions, the Bombay edition correctly includes\r\nthis sloka, or rather half sloka, within the 17th, making the 17th a\r\ntriplet instead of a couplet. For the well-known word Dhishthitas\r\nhowever, the Bombay text has Vishthitas.\r\n\r\n14. The Bombay text reads Paricchanna for Paricchinna. The former is\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n15. Vaisase is explained by Nilakantha as Virodhe. Conttavarta---a river\r\nhaving bloody eddies.\r\n\r\n16. Conitam cchardayanniva. I have adopted Nilakantha's explanation. The\r\nBurdwan Pundits take it as referring to \"weapons\" instead of \"hearers.\"\r\nThe passage, however, may mean that the bird screams so frightfully as if\r\nit vomits blood. The only thing that militates against this\r\ninterpretation is that cchardayan is a causal verb. In the Mahabharata,\r\nhowever, causal forms are frequently used without causal meaning.\r\n\r\n17. This sloka is omitted in many editions, though it is certainly\r\ngenuine. I have rendered it very freely, as otherwise it would be\r\nunintelligible. The fact is, three lunations twice meeting together in\r\ncourse of the same lunar fortnight is very rare. The lunar-fortnight\r\n(Paksha) being then reduced by two days, the day of full-moon or that of\r\nnew moon, instead of being (as usual) the fifteenth day from the first\r\nlunation becomes the thirteenth day. Lunar-eclipses always occur on days\r\nof the full-moon, while solar-eclipses on those of the new moon. Such\r\neclipses, therefore, occurring on days removed from the days of the first\r\nlunation by thirteen instead of (as usual) fifteen days, are very\r\nextraordinary occurrences.\r\n\r\n18. Vishamam is battle or war, and akranda is weeping or productive of\r\ngrief. The latter word may also mean a fierce battle. If understood in\r\nthis sense, Vishamam may be taken as indicating hostility, or absence of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n19. Nilakantha explains this in a long note the substance of which is\r\nappended below. Kings are divided into three classes, viz., owners of\r\nelephants (Gajapati), owners of horses (Aswapati), and owners of men\r\n(Narapati). If an evil-omened planet (papa-graha) sheds its influence\r\nupon any of the nine constellations beginning with Aswini, it forebodes\r\ndanger to Aswapatis; if on any of the nine beginning with Magha, it\r\nforebodes danger to Gajapatis; and if on any of the nine beginning with\r\nMula, it forebodes danger to Narapatis. What Vyasa says here, therefore,\r\nis that one or another papa-graha has shed its influence upon one another\r\nof each of the three classes of constellations, thus foreboding danger to\r\nall classes of kings.\r\n\r\n20. Vide note ante.\r\n\r\n21. Aparvani, i.e., not on Parva days or days of full-moon and new-moon\r\nas ordinarily coming. The Bombay edition, after aparvani, reads grahenau\r\ntau. A better reading unquestionably grastavetau, as many Bengal texts\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n22. Pratisrotas; strict grammar would require pratisrotasas; the meaning\r\nis that those that flowed east to west now flow west to east, &c. For\r\nkurddanti some texts have narddanti which is certainly better. Kurddanti\r\nmeans play or sport; wells playing like bulls would be unmeaning, unless\r\nthe sport is accompanied by bellowing.\r\n\r\n23. The Burdwan Pundits reads suskasani for sakrasani. The latter,\r\nhowever, is the true reading.\r\n\r\n24. The original is very obscure. Uluka is explained by Nilakantha as a\r\nbrand (used for want of lambs). The line, however, is elliptical. The\r\nBurdwan Pundits introduce an entirely new line.\r\n\r\n25. Mahabhuta is swelling greatly.\r\n\r\n26. Parena is explained by Nilakantha as atisayena.\r\n\r\n27. Some of the Bengal texts read anugraham (making the initial a silent\r\nafter maharshe, in the vocative case). There can be no doubt however,\r\nthat this is incorrect. The true reading is nadharmam which I have\r\nadopted. The Bombay text reads na cha dharmam. The introduction of the\r\narticle cha needlessly makes the line incorrect as to metre.\r\n\r\n28. The second line of the 67th sloka is very obscure. I have followed\r\nNilakantha in translating it thus. The sense seems to be, that when crows\r\nhover behind an army, that is an auspicious sign; while it is an\r\ninauspicious sign if they are seen ahead. I am not sure that Nilakantha\r\nis right in taking the pronoun ye as referring to even crows.\r\n\r\n29. Such as \"don't fight, for you will be dead men soon.\" &c.\r\n\r\n30. Nilakantha explains these five species thus: trees such as the\r\npeepul; gulma (shrub), as kusa, kasa, &c., growing from a clump\r\nunderneath; creepers, such as all plants growing upon the soil but\r\nrequiring some support to twine round; Valli, those that creep on the\r\nearth and live for a year only, such, as the gourd, the pumpkin, etc.,\r\nand lastly, Trina, such as grass and all plants that are stemless, having\r\nonly their barks and leaves.\r\n\r\n31. When Gayatri, or Brahma or the Universe, is mentioned, these\r\ntwenty-four are indicated, five of which exist independently, the\r\nremaining nineteen being the result of five in those various proportions.\r\n\r\n32. I have rendered 4 and 5 a little too freely. The language of the\r\noriginal is very terse.\r\n\r\n33. Samyam is homogeneity. The allusion is to the state of the universe\r\nbefore creation, when there exists nothing but a homogeneous mass or\r\nBrahma alone. The first compound of the 2nd line is read differently. The\r\nBurdwan Pandits and the Bombay edition read anyonyam (in the accusative);\r\nmany of the Bengal texts read anyonyena (in the instrumental). The\r\nmeaning is scarcely affected by this difference of reading.\r\n\r\n34. The order of destruction is that earth merges into water, water into\r\nfire, fire into air, and air into space. And so the order of birth is\r\nthat from space arises air, from air arises fire, from fire arises water,\r\nand from water arises earth.\r\n\r\n35. Nilakantha explains the last six slokas as having an esoteric\r\nmeaning. By Sudarsana he understands the mind. The rest is explained\r\nconsistently. Interpretations, however, are not rare among commentators\r\nseeking to put sense in non-sense.\r\n\r\n36. The Bombay text reads Varsha parvatas for parvatas samas.\r\n\r\n37. For Pinaddha occurring in the Bengal texts, the Bombay edition reads\r\nVichitra.\r\n\r\n38. The Bengal texts add a line here which is properly omitted in the\r\nBombay edition.\r\n\r\n39. After the 10th occurs a line in the Bengal text which is evidently\r\nvicious.\r\n\r\n40. Day of the full-moon and that of the new-moon.\r\n\r\n41. The Bengal texts, except the Burdwan one, have divi for Daityas, of\r\ncourse, the latter reading is correct.\r\n\r\n42. The Bombay text has Sarvatas (which is better) for Sarvata in the\r\nBengal texts.\r\n\r\n43. in the first line of 28, the Bengal texts read Sirasas (ablative) for\r\nSikhhrat of the Bombay edition. In the last line of 29 also, the Bombay\r\ntext has plavantiva-pravegena for the Bengal reading patatyajapravegena.\r\nNo material difference of meaning arises if one or the other is accepted.\r\n\r\n44. Alluding to the tradition of Siva's holding Ganga on his head and for\r\nwhich the great god is sometimes called Gangadhara.\r\n\r\n45. This word occurs in various forms, Ketumala and Ketumali being two\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n46. The Bombay edition reads tu for cha after Jamvukhanda. The meaning\r\nbecomes changed.\r\n\r\n47. The sacred stream Ganga is believed to have three currents. In heaven\r\nthe current is called Mandakini; on earth, it is called Ganga; and in the\r\nsubterraneous world it is called Bhogavati.\r\n\r\n48. The Bengal texts, excepting the Burdwan one, incorrectly read Sakram\r\nfor Satram.\r\n\r\n49. The correct reading is Gatimanti. Many of the Bengal texts\r\nincorrectly read matimanti, which is unmeaning.\r\n\r\n50. Many of the Bengal texts incorrectly read Merorapyyantaram for\r\nMerorathottaram.\r\n\r\n51. This sloka beginning with mani and ending with prabham is omitted in\r\nthe Bombay text, I don't think rightly. If anything that seems to be a\r\nrepetition is to be omitted.\r\n\r\n52. i.e. \"have fallen away from a celestial state.\"\r\n\r\n53. In sloka 13, the Bengal texts read Bhayanakas for mahavalas. In 15\r\nMudhabhishekas for Purvabhishekas; is substituted in the Bombay text. In\r\n1 again the Bombay text reads Subhas for drumas.\r\n\r\n54. The Bengal texts have Chandrabhasa for Chandraprabha. The difference\r\nis not material.\r\n\r\n55. Both the Burdwan and the Bombay editions read Panchashat (five and\r\nsix). The Bengal texts generally have panchasat (fifty).\r\n\r\n56. The Bombay edition reads Tasmat-sritigamatas param. The Bengal texts\r\nread Yasmat-sringamatas param. The Bengal reading is better. The Asiatic\r\nSociety's edition contains a misprint. The meaning is, \"Because Sringa\r\n(jewelled mountain of that name), therefore superior.\" I have rendered it\r\nsomewhat freely.\r\n\r\n57. They are but portions of the same Supreme Being.\r\n\r\n58. i.e. mountains forming boundaries of divisions.\r\n\r\n59. The Bombay text reads Ikshula and Krimi for \"Ikshumlavi\" occurring in\r\nBengal texts.\r\n\r\n60. The Bengal texts have Gandakincha mahanadim. The Bombay text reads\r\nVandanancha mahanadim with a cha immediately before. The Burdwan Pandits\r\nread Chandanancha mahanadim.\r\n\r\n61. The Bombay texts read Tridiva for Nischita; this is incorrect, for\r\nTridiva occurs in the Bombay text itself a little before. The name\r\nLohatarini occurs in various forms.\r\n\r\n62. For Vetravati, the Bengal texts read Chandrabhaga. Both Chandrabhaga\r\nand Vetravati, however occur before.\r\n\r\n63. Kamadhuk is that species of kine which always yield milk.\r\n\r\n64. Nilakantha explains this in this way. The gods depend on sacrifices\r\nperformed by human beings; and as regards human beings, their food is\r\nsupplied by the Earth. Superior and inferior creatures, therefore, are\r\nall supported by the earth; the Earth then is their refuge. The word\r\nEarth in these slokas is sometimes used to signify the world and\r\nsometimes the element of that name.\r\n\r\n65. I render the last line a little too freely. If the saying is intended\r\nto be general, the translation should run thus: \"Up to this day there is\r\nno man whose desires can be satiated.\"\r\n\r\n66. The Bombay text reads Kimanyat Kathayami te. The Bengal reading is\r\nKimanyat srotumicchasi.\r\n\r\n67. The Bombay text reads Tatas parena; the Bengal reading is Tatas\r\npurvena. I adopt the former.\r\n\r\n68. Probably this mythical account of Sakadwipa embodies some vague\r\ntradition current in ancient India of some republic in Eastern Asia or\r\nOceanic Asia (further east in the Pacific). Accustomed as the Hindus were\r\nto kingly form of government, a government without a king, would strike\r\nthem exactly in the way described in the last two slokas.\r\n\r\n69. The second line of the 3rd sloka is read variously. The Bombay\r\nedition incorrectly reads 'Parvataccha' etc. etc.,; the Bengal reading is\r\nevameva etc. etc. The Bengal reading is better, although the true\r\nreading, I apprehend, is Evametais &c., &c.\r\n\r\n70. Vamanaka and Vamana are the same words the final ka being a suffix\r\ncausing no difference of meaning. So Andhakaraka and Andhakara are the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n71. Dig-gaja, i.e. an elephant supporting the globe. There are four such\r\nin Hindu mythology or ten according to some accounts.\r\n\r\n72. i.e., with the juice trickling down from their cheeks and mouth. In\r\nthe season of rut, a peculiar kind of juice issues from several parts of\r\nan elephant's body. It is believed to be the temporal-juice. The stronger\r\nand fierce the elephant, the greater the quantity of the juice that\r\nissues out its body.\r\n\r\n73. Tasya (singular of Tad) and sa (masculine singular of Tad) both refer\r\nto the four elephants, Gaja-chatushtaya in singular.\r\n\r\n74. Asamyadha lit. \"Unbound\" or \"unrestrained,\" i.e. freely or\r\nirregularly.\r\n\r\n75. It is a remarkable fact that the ratio between the diameter and the\r\ncircumference of a circle was roughly known to the ancient Hindus. The\r\ncircumference is nearly, as stated here, three times and a half of the\r\ndiameter. The next ratio, of course, is slightly less, being three and\r\none-seventh.\r\n\r\n76. The first word of this sloka is variously read. 'Yathadishtam' is the\r\nBengal reading, while the Bombay reading 'Yathoddishtam.' If the latter\r\nreading were adopted, the meaning would be as indicated (in the Sastras).\r\nThe second line literally rendered, is \"pacify thy son Duryodhana.\" But\r\nhow Dhritarashtra is to pacify his son having listened to the\r\ngeographical digression, is not easy to see.\r\n\r\n77. For Sadhusattamas of the Bengal texts, the Bombay edition reads\r\nSadhusammatas. I adopt the last.\r\n\r\n78. The last word in the first line of the 11th sloka, in the Bengal\r\ntexts, is 'Pravriha.' In the Bombay edition it is 'Anikaha.' The\r\ndifference in meaning is immaterial.\r\n\r\n79. The first half of the first line, in the Bengal texts, is read as\r\n'Kathamascha me putra', the Bombay text reads \"Kathamascha me Yoddha'. If\r\nthe latter reading be adopted, the meaning would be--\"Tell me how my\r\nwarriors were, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n80. In the second line of sloka 3, for 'kim na asinmanastada' (what was\r\nthe state of mind of our men) the Bombay text reads 'Kimu asinmanastava'\r\n(what was the state of your mind)?\r\n\r\n81. The Plural pronouns 'ye' in the second line of the 8th sloka (changed\r\ninto 'ya' by rule of Sandhi because coming before tenam) is read 'ke' (or\r\nka)' by the Burdwan Pundits. I think the correction a happy one.\r\nNilakantha would take 7 and 8 and the first half of 9 as a complete\r\nsentence reading 'Asya twama antike' (thou wert near him) for 'Asyaram\r\nantike' (smiting or shooting arrows near).\r\n\r\n82. Some of the Bengal texts have Panchalanam for Pandavanam.\r\n\r\n83. The form of the 2nd line is a negative interrogative, implying,--'I\r\nhope the Kurus did not abandon him.\r\n\r\n84. This comparison, lengthy as it is, is not sustained throughout with\r\nthe usual felicity of Vyasa. In several parts it is undoubtedly faulty.\r\nSlight variation of reading also occur here and there, without affecting\r\nthe sense materially.\r\n\r\n85. Gachchhato durgam gatim. The Bombay edition reads Gachchhanto etc.,\r\netc. The meaning then would be--\"who protected the wings, themselves\r\nmaking the last painful journey?\r\n\r\n86. The Burdwan Pundits make Mahavalas an adjective of Putras. A better\r\nconstruction would be to take it as referring to Bhishma.\r\n\r\n87. Ghatayitwa is, literally, causing to be slain.\r\n\r\n88. The words \"high-souled\" and also \"through whose boon bestowed of me\r\noccur in the 9th sloka following.\r\n\r\n89. Vyotthiopatti vijananam, Vyutthita is a very doubtful word.\r\n\r\n90. Literally, \"in Indra's abodes,\" i.e. Amaravati.\r\n\r\n91. A Kshatriya failing bravely in fight at once goes to the highest\r\nregions of bliss.\r\n\r\n92. Nilakantha in a long note explains that Magha Vishayagas Somas cannot\r\nmean that Soma or the Moon entered the constellation called Magha. He\r\nquotes numerous slokas scattered throughout the Mahabharata that throw\r\nlight, directly or indirectly, on the question of the opening day of the\r\nbattle, and shows that all these lead to a different conclusion. What is\r\nmeant by the Moon approaching the region of the Pitris is that those who\r\nfall in battle immediately ascend to heaven; of course, they have first\r\nto go to the region of Pitris. Thence they have to go to the lunar region\r\nfor obtaining celestial bodies. All this implies a little delay. Here,\r\nhowever, in the case of those that would fall on the field of\r\nKurukshetra, they would not have to incur even such a little delay.\r\nChandramas or Soma approached the region of Pitris so that the fallen\r\nwarriors might have celestial bodies very soon, without, in fact, any\r\nnecessity, on their part, to incur the delay of a journey to the lunar\r\nregion prior to their ascension to heaven with resplendent bodies.\r\n\r\n93. There are nine planets in all the Pauranic astronomy. Of these Rahu\r\nand Ketu are regarded Upagrahas, and hence, of grahas there are only\r\nseven. Thus Nilakantha, and the Burdwan pundits have made a mess of this\r\nline.\r\n\r\n94. The Bengal texts read Bhanumanudito divi. The Bombay reading is\r\nBhanumanudito Ravis. If the latter be adopted, Bhanuman would be an\r\nadjective of Ravis.\r\n\r\n95. Purvais Purvatarais is literally--\"They of old and still older\r\ntimes\"; for Sanatanas some editions read Srutijas (qualifying panthas).\r\nSrutija means arising from the Srutis or as laid down in the Srutis.\r\n\r\n96. Chamupatis is the Bengal reading. The Bombay text reads Chamupari. If\r\nthe latter reading be adopted, the meaning would be, \"at the head of the\r\n(Kuru) army.\"\r\n\r\n97. The Bengal editions read 'Magadhascha ripum yayau.' The Bombay text\r\nreads 'Magadhasya Kripo-yayau.' If the latter reading be adopted, the\r\nmeaning would be \"and guiding the very van of the Magadha troops Kripa\r\nwent.\"\r\n\r\n98. The Bengal reading is Saradabhraghana-prakshyam. The Bombay reading\r\nis 'Sharadamvudhara-prakshyam.'\r\n\r\n99. Vasavartinas is nominative, masculine, plural, referring to cars,\r\n&c.; the Burdwan Pundits take it as a genitive singular qualifying tasya,\r\nand they render it, therefore, as \"of that subordinate of Duryodhana.\"\r\nThis is evidently incorrect.\r\n\r\n100. Machines, perhaps catapults.\r\n\r\n101. 'Vyuha' is an array of troops in a certain form. Many such will be\r\nspoken of in this and the other 'parvas' devoted to the battle.\r\n\r\n102. The Bombay edition reads Yamunantara for Yamunantare of the Bengal\r\ntexts. The difference in meaning is not very material.\r\n\r\n103. The Bengal texts read Syandamana; the Bombay reading is Spandamana.\r\nBoth imply \"moving\", only the motion in the latter case is slower,\r\nperhaps, than in the former.\r\n\r\n104. The word used is Dayadas lit., taker of (one's) wealth.\r\n\r\n105. The Bombay text is here faulty. Darsay swamahavalam is scarcely\r\ncorrect. The Bengal reading is 'Darsayan sumahavalam.'\r\n\r\n106. Literally, \"with rent cheeks and mouth.\"\r\n\r\n107. The Bombay reading is certainly faulty here. For Chalanta iva\r\nparvatas it reads Jimuta iva varashikas, although it makes the previous\r\nline begin Ksharantaiva Jimuta.\r\n\r\n108. A parigha is a thick club mounted with iron. The comparison is very\r\nfeeble, for Bhima's mace, in the popular estimation, is much heavier and\r\nstouter than any parigha manufactured for human combatants. Prachakarsha\r\nis, lit. dragged. I think, however, the root krish must be taken here in\r\nthe sense of crush.\r\n\r\n109. The name Vajra implies either a hard needle for boring diamonds and\r\ngems, or the thunder-bolt. In this sloka the word Vajra is used as\r\nassociated with the thunder and therefore, as thunder is accompanied by\r\nlightning so the bows of the warriors are the lightning-marks of this\r\nparticular Vajra.\r\n\r\n110. The word is Uttaradhus which seems to be very doubtful.\r\n\r\n111. Yenarjunastena, Yena is yatra and tena is tatra, as Nilakantha\r\nrightly explains. The meaning is--\"who would be there where Arjuna would\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n112. The Bengal texts read Dharmenikena chanagha which is evidently\r\nfaulty, remembering that the words are Brahman's to Indra and the\r\ncelestials. The Bombay reading is Dharmenaivodyamena cha which I have\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n113. The sense is that they, viz., the gods, who accepted Krishna's lead,\r\nor selected him for their leader, became victorious. The Bengal reading\r\nis evidently superior, viz., Anu Krishna literally \"behind Krishna,\"\r\ni.e., \"with Krishna in the front, or \"with Krishna as a leader.\" The\r\nBombay reading is Katham Krishna. If this were adopted, the meaning would\r\nbe, \"How O Krishna, shall we conquer?\" I do not understand how victory\r\nshould be theirs who answered in this way. Of course, the answer implies\r\nmodesty. But modesty is not the sole requisite of victory, nor is modesty\r\ninculcated here as the chief means of victory.\r\n\r\n114. The Bengal texts read Kanchana-bhanda-yuktam. The Bombay reading is\r\nmuch better, being Kanchanabhanda-yoktam; again, for Nagakulasya the\r\nBombay edition reads Nagapurasya, Nilakantha notices the latter reading.\r\n\r\n115. The Bengal reading is Mahindram (king of earth, or king); the Bombay\r\nreading is Mahendram (the great Indra). Without iva any word to that\r\neffect, Mahendram would be ungrammatical.\r\n\r\n116. The Bengal texts read, and as I think, correctly, Stutavanta enam.\r\nThe Bombay reading is Srutavanta enam. In the case of regenerate Rishis\r\nand Siddhas it is scarcely necessary to say that they are conversant with\r\nthe Srutis.\r\n\r\n117. The Bengal reading Sahasrani for Savastrani is correct. I adopt the\r\nlatter,\r\n\r\n118. This is how I understand this verse, and I am supported by the\r\nBurdwan Pundits. Nilakantha, it seems, thinks that the car had a thousand\r\nwheels resembling a thousand suns.\r\n\r\n119. Verse 15 is read variously. As the last word of the first line, I\r\nread Achakarsha for raraksha, and accordingly I take that as a genitive\r\nand not an ablative particle.\r\n\r\n120. follow Nilakantha in rendering many of the names occurring in this\r\nand the succeeding slokas. I retain, however, those names that are of\r\ndoubtful etymology, as also those that are very common.\r\n\r\n121. Every scholar knows the derivation of this word as given in this\r\nsloka of Kalidasa (in his Kumara Sambhavam) Umeti matra tapasonishiddha\r\npaschadumakhyam Sumukhi Jagama.\r\n\r\n122. Both Swaha and Swadha are mantras of high efficacy. Kala and Kastha\r\nare divisions of time. Saraswati implies speech.\r\n\r\n123. Sankhye is explained by Nilakantha to be Samyak Khyanam Prakasana\r\nYasmin; hence Atmanatma-vivekarupa Samadhi.\r\n\r\n124. The text of the Gita has come down to us without, it may be ventured\r\nto be stated, any interpolation. The difference of reading are few and\r\nfar between. For Jayadratha some texts read tathaivacha.\r\n\r\n125. The words Aparyaptam and Paryaptam have exercised all commentators.\r\nIf paryaptam is sufficient (as it certainly is), aparyaptam may mean\r\neither more or less than sufficient. The context, however, would seem to\r\nshow that Duryodhana addressed his preceptor in alarm and not with\r\nconfidence of success, I, therefore, take aparyaptam to be less than\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n126. It has been observed before that Schlegel renders the names of these\r\nconches as Gigantea, Theodotes, Arundinca, Triumpphatrix, Dulcisona, and\r\nGemmiflora, and that Professor Wilson approves of them.\r\n\r\n127. It seems a fashion to doubt the etymology of this word, as if\r\ncommentators of the learning of Sreedhara and Sankara, Anandagiri and\r\nNilakantha even upon a question of derivation and grammar can really be\r\nset aside in favour of anything that may occur in the Petersburgh\r\nlexicon. Hrishikesa means the lord of the senses.\r\n\r\n128. Ranasamudyame may also mean \"at the outset of battle.\"\r\n\r\n129. The meaning is that even for the sake of such a rich reward in\r\nprospect I would not kill persons so dear and near to me. I would much\r\nrather suffer them strike me, myself not returning their blows.\r\n\r\n130. The word is atatayinas.\r\n\r\n131. Most editions read savandhavam \"with (their) kinsmen or friends,\" I\r\nthink, however, that swa (own) for (with) is the correct reading. K. T.\r\nTelang adopts it in his translation published ill Vol. VIII of the Sacred\r\nBooks of the East.\r\n\r\n132. In some editions this lesson is stated to be \"Arjuna's grief.\" The\r\ndescription of the lesson again is given in fewer words.\r\n\r\n133. The commentators betray their ingenuity by emphasizing the word\r\nishubhis (with arrows), explaining, \"how can I encounter them with arrows\r\nwhom I cannot encounter with even harsh words?\"\r\n\r\n134. Arthakaman is an adjective qualifying Gurun. Some commentators\r\nparticularly Sreedhara, suggest that it may, instead, qualify bhogan. The\r\nmeaning, however, in that case would be far-fetched.\r\n\r\n135. Sreedhara explains that Karpanya is compassion (for kinsmen), and\r\ndosha is the fear of sin (for destroying a race). The first compound,\r\ntherefore, according to him, means,--\"My nature affected by both\r\ncompassion and fear of sin, etc. It is better, however, to take Karpanya\r\nitself as a dosha (taint or fault). K. T. Telang understands it in this\r\nway. Upahata, however, is affected and not contaminated.\r\n\r\n136. What Arjuna says here is that \"Even if I obtain such a kingdom on\r\nEarth, even if I obtain the very kingship of the gods, I do not yet see\r\nthat will dispel that grief which will overtake me if I slay my preceptor\r\nand kinsmen.\" Telang's version is slightly ambiguous.\r\n\r\n137. The Bengal texts have Parantapa with a Visarga, thus implying that\r\nit refers to Gudakesa. The Bombay edition prints it without the Visarga,\r\nimplying that it is in the vocative case, referring to Dhritarashtra, the\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\n138. One of the most useful rules in translating from one language into\r\nanother is to use identical words for identical expressions in the\r\noriginal. In translating, however, from a language like Sanskrit which\r\nabounds in synonyms, this is not always practicable without ambiguity. As\r\nan example, the word used in 13 is Dhira; that used in 11 is Pandita.\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that Pandita and Dhira have exactly\r\nthe same meaning.\r\n\r\n139. Amritatwa is really emancipation or non-liability to repeated death\r\nor repeated rebirth. To render it as \"immortality\" is, perhaps, a little\r\nslovenly, for every soul is immortal, and this particular section\r\ninculcates it.\r\n\r\n140. Sat and asat are the two words which must be distinctly understood\r\nas they occur often in Hindu philosophy. Sat is explained as the real,\r\ni.e., the soul, or anything as real and permanent as the soul. Asat is\r\nthe reverse of this, i.e., the unreal or the Non-soul. What is said here\r\nby Krishna is that the unreal has no existence; the real, again can have\r\nno non-existence. Is not this a sort of cosmothetic idealism?\r\n\r\n141. Most texts read Yudhaya Yujyaswa. A manuscript belonging to a friend\r\nof mine has the correction in red-ink, Yudhaya Yudhaya Yudhaywa. It\r\naccords so well with the spirit of the lesson sought to be inculcated\r\nhere that I make no scruple to adopt it.\r\n\r\n142. A life in this world that is subject to decay and death. So say all\r\nthe commentators.\r\n\r\n143. What Krishna seeks to inculcate here is the simple truth that\r\npersons who believe in the Vedas and their ordinances laying down\r\nspecific acts for the attainment of a heaven of pleasure and power,\r\ncannot have the devotion without which there cannot be final emancipation\r\nwhich only is the highest bliss. The performance of Vedic rites may lead\r\nto heaven of pleasure and power, but what is that heaven worth? True\r\nemancipation is something else which must be obtained by devotion, by\r\npure contemplation. In rendering Janma-Karma-phalapradam I have followed\r\nSankara. Sreedhara and other commentators explain it differently.\r\n\r\n144. This sloka has been variously rendered by various translators. It is\r\nthe same that occurs in the Sanat-Sujata Parva of the Udyoga. (Vide\r\nUdyoga Parva, Section XLV). Both Sreedhara and Sankara (and I may mention\r\nAnandagiri also) explain it in this way. Shortly stated, the meaning is\r\nthat to an instructed Brahmana (Brahma-knowing person and not a Brahmana\r\nby birth), his knowledge (of self or Brahma) teaches him that which is\r\nobtainable from all the Vedas, just as a man wanting to bathe or drink\r\nmay find a tank or well as useful to him as a large reservoir of water\r\noccupying an extensive area. Nilakantha explains it in a different way.\r\n\r\n145. Srotavyasya Srutasyacha is literally 'of the hearable and the\r\nheard', i.e., \"what you may or will hear, and what you have heard.\"\r\nEuropean translators of the Gita view in these words a rejection of the\r\nVedas by the author. It is amusing to see how confidently they dogmatise\r\nupon this point, rejecting the authority of Sankara, Sreedhara,\r\nAnandagiri, and the whole host of Indian commentators. As K. T. Telang,\r\nhowever, has answered the point elaborately, nothing more need be said\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n146. One may abstain, either from choice or inability to procure them,\r\nfrom the objects of enjoyment. Until, however, the very desire to enjoy\r\nis suppressed, one cannot be said to have attained to steadiness of mind.\r\nOf Aristotle's saying that he is a voluptuary who pines at his own\r\nabstinence, and the Christian doctrine of sin being in the wish, mere\r\nabstinence from the act constitutes no merit.\r\n\r\n147. The particle 'he' in the second line is explained by both Sankara\r\nand Anandagiri as equivalent to Yasmat. The meaning becomes certainly\r\nclearer by taking the word in this sense. The 'he', however, may also be\r\ntaken as implying the sense of \"indeed.\"\r\n\r\n148. Buddhi in the first line is explained by Sreedhara as Aintavishayak\r\nbuddhi. Bhavanta Sreedhara explains, is Dhyanam; and Sankara as\r\nAtmajnanabhinivesas. K. T. Telang renders Bhavana as perseverance. I do\r\nnot think this is correct.\r\n\r\n149. Sankara, Anandagiri, and Nilakantha explain this sloka thus.\r\nSreedhara explains it otherwise. The latter supposes the pronouns yat and\r\ntat to mean a particular sense among the Charatam indriyanam. If\r\nSreedhara's interpretation be correct, the meaning would be--\"That (one\r\nsense) amongst the senses moving (among their objects) which the mind\r\nfollows, (that one sense) tosseth the mind's (or the man's) understanding\r\nabout like the wind tossing a (drunken boatman's) boat on the waters.\"\r\nThe parenthetical words are introduced by Sreedhara himself. It may not\r\nbe out of place to mention here that so far as Bengal, Mithila and\r\nBenares are concerned, the authority of Sreedhara is regarded as supreme.\r\n\r\n150. The vulgar, being spiritually dark, are engaged in worldly pursuits.\r\nThe sage in spiritual light is dead to the latter.\r\n\r\n151. Prakritijais Gunas is explained by Sreedhara as qualities born of\r\none's nature such as Ragadveshadi. Sankara thinks that they are the\r\nqualities or attributes of primal matter (which enters into the\r\ncomposition of every self) such as Satwa, Rajas, and Tamas.\r\n\r\n152. \"Apply to work\", i.e. to work as prescribed in the scriptures. Thus\r\nsays Sankara. \"To morning and evening prayers, etc.\" says Sreedhara.\r\n\r\n153. Sacrifices Vishnu's self as declared by the Srutis; work for\r\nsacrifice, therefore, is work for Vishnu's sake or gratification. For the\r\nsake of that i.e., for sacrifice's, or \"Vishnu's sake. So say all the\r\ncommentators.\r\n\r\n154. Bhavaya is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as Vradhaya or\r\nmake grow. Perhaps, \"rear\" is the nearest approach to it in English. K.\r\nT. Telang renders it, 'please.' The idea is eminently Indian. The gods\r\nare fed by sacrifices, and in return they feed men by sending rain. The\r\nAsuras again who warred with the gods warred with sacrifices.\r\n\r\n155. Parjjanya is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as rain. It\r\nmeans also the clouds or the origin of rain.\r\n\r\n156. The word in the original that is rendered in the Vedas is Brahma. It\r\nmay mean the Supreme Soul. Of course, in Brahmanic literature, the Vedas\r\nare Brahma and Brahma is the Vedas, but still in the second line of 15\r\nthere is no necessity of taking Brahma as equivalent to the Vedas, I do\r\nnot think Telang is accurate in his rendering of this line.\r\n\r\n157. The wheel referred to is what has been said before, viz., from the\r\nVedas are work, from work is rain, from rain is food, from food are\r\ncreatures, from creatures again work and so back to the Vedas.\r\n\r\n158. The sense seems to be, as explained by the commentators, that such a\r\nman earns no merit by action, nor sin by inaction or omission. Nor is\r\nthere anybody from the Supreme Being to the lowest creature on whom he\r\ndepends for anything.\r\n\r\n159. The example set by the great is always catching, Itaras, here, is\r\nVulgar and not \"other\". Kurute which I have rendered as \"maketh\" is used\r\nin the sense of \"regardeth.\" Pramanam, however, may not necessarily mean\r\nsomething else that is set up as an ideal. It may refer to the actions\r\nthemselves of the great men set up by them as a standard.\r\n\r\n160. Sreedhara would connect \"in the three worlds\" with what follows. I\r\nfollow Sankara and the natural order of words.\r\n\r\n161. The word rendered \"nature\" is prakriti. It really implies \"primal\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n162. The second line, literally rendered, is \"deeming that qualities\r\nengage in qualities.\" The first \"qualities\" imply the senses, and the\r\nsecond, the objects of the senses. The purport is that one knowing the\r\ndistinction referred to, never thinks that his soul is the actor, for\r\nthat which is work is only the result of the senses being applied to\r\ntheir objects.\r\n\r\n163. Guna-karmashu is explained by Sankara as works of the qualities, or\r\nworks done by them. Sreedhara explains the compound as \"qualities and\r\n(their) works.\"\r\n\r\n164. Devoting all work to me, i.e., in the belief that all you do is for\r\nme or my sake.\r\n\r\n165. The senses, as regards their diverse objects in the world, are\r\neither drawn towards them or repelled by them. These likes and dislikes\r\n(in the case of men who, of course, only act according to their nature)\r\nstand in the way of their emancipation, if men submit to them.\r\n\r\n166. Desire, if not gratified, results in wrath. Thus say the\r\ncommentators.\r\n\r\n167. Prajahi is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as parityaja\r\n(cast off).\r\n\r\n168. He is the Supreme Soul or Being.\r\n\r\n169. There can be little doubt that what Krishna says here is that no\r\nform of worship is unacceptable to him. Whatever the manner of the\r\nworship, it is I who is worshipped. After K. T. Telang's exhaustive and\r\neffective reply to Dr. Lorinser's strange hypothesis of the Gita having\r\nbeen composed under Christian influences, it is scarcely necessary to add\r\nthat such toleration would ill accord with the theory of the Christian\r\nauthorship of the poem.\r\n\r\n170. i.e., both inactive and undecaying. Work implies exertion, and,\r\ntherefore, loss of energy. In me there is no action, no loss of energy\r\nand therefore, no decay.\r\n\r\n171. 'Kama-sankalpa vivarjjitas.' i.e., freed from kama (desire of fruit)\r\nand sankalpa--the consequent will or determination to do. Thus both\r\nSreedhara and Sankara.\r\n\r\n172. Chitta the mind and atma in this connection is the senses. Thus both\r\nSreedhara and Sankara.\r\n\r\n173. Sacrifice means here the Supreme Soul. What is done for the sake of\r\nsacrifice is done for procuring emancipation.\r\n\r\n174. What is meant by this is that in the case of such a person complete\r\nidentification with Brahma takes place, and when such an identification\r\nhas taken place, action is destroyed.\r\n\r\n175. I.e., offering up sacrifice itself as a sacrifice to the Brahma\r\nfire, they cast off all action.\r\n\r\n176. Offering up the senses to the fire of restraint means restraining\r\nthe senses for the practice of Yoga. Offering up the objects of the\r\nsenses means non-attachment to those objects.\r\n\r\n177. Suspending the functions of life for contemplation or Yoga.\r\n\r\n178. In these cases the sacrifices consist in the giving away of wealth,\r\nin the ascetic austerities themselves, in meditation, in study, etc.\r\nSreedhara explains the first compound of the second line differently.\r\nAccording to him, it means not study and knowledge, but the knowledge\r\nfrom study.\r\n\r\n179. All these are different kinds of Yoga, or the different stages of\r\nYoga practice.\r\n\r\n180. i.e., knowledge being attained, the fruits of action are attained\r\nby, at least, their end being compassed.\r\n\r\n181. Sankhya is renunciation of action, while Yoga is devotion through\r\naction.\r\n\r\n182. The grammatical form of the word Yoga as here employed is\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\n183. The first atman is explained as the soul, the second as the body, by\r\nall the commentators.\r\n\r\n184. Taking means taking anything with the hands.\r\n\r\n185. Water when thrown over a lotus-leaf escapes without soaking or\r\ndrenching the leaf at all.\r\n\r\n186. Telang renders Pura as city, of course, the body having two eyes,\r\ntwo ears, two nostrils, one mouth, and two openings for excretions, is\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n187. Such men are exempted from the obligation of re-birth. Leaving this\r\nbody they merge into the Supreme Soul.\r\n\r\n188. The word is Swapacha meaning a member of the lowest caste.\r\n\r\n189. \"Brahma is faultless and equable\"; so Sreedhara and others,--\"since\r\nfaultless equality is Brahma.\"\r\n\r\n190. The sense is that they are at one with Brahma both here and\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n191. Renouncer and devotee Sannyasin and Yogin.\r\n\r\n192. Which spring from desire.\r\n\r\n193. Self in this sloka is explained by the commentators as mind. The\r\nmind, unless controlled, cannot lead to devotion.\r\n\r\n194. Chitta and atma are explained by the commentators as \"mind and body.\"\r\n\r\n195. Fixed on one's own self, i.e., withdrawn from all objects of sense.\r\nThus Sankara.\r\n\r\n196. Nischayena is explained by Sankara as equivalent to \"with\r\npreservence\" or steadily. Sreedhara explains it as equal to \"with the\r\ncertitude of knowledge acquired by instruction.\"\r\n\r\n197. Mriti-grahitaya Buddhya is, as explained by Sankara and others \"with\r\nunderstanding controlled by patience,\" K. T. Telang renders it \"with firm\r\nresolve coupled with courage.\"\r\n\r\n198. i.e. I am always visible to him, and he too is always within my\r\nsight and I am always kind to him.\r\n\r\n199. i.e. how its stable existence may be secured, the mind being by\r\nnature ever restless.\r\n\r\n200. Fallen off from both, i.e., from heaven (through work) and\r\nabsorption into Brahma (through devotion).\r\n\r\n201. Without leaving anything, i.e., entirely.\r\n\r\n202. The Divine-Word i.e., the Vedas. So great is the efficacy of\r\ndevotion that one merely enquiring of it transcends him who conforms to\r\nthe rites of the Vedas.\r\n\r\n203. Only some one, i.e., very few. Few perfection, i.e., for knowledge\r\nof self. Thus all the commentators.\r\n\r\n204. The last word of the first line of this sloka is param (higher) and\r\nnot aparam with the initial a silent owing to the rules of Sandhi. Many\r\nof the Bengal texts have aparam, not excepting the latest one printed at\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\n205. Kama which I have rendered desire is explained by Sreedhara as the\r\nwish for an unattained object; and raga as the longing or thirst for\r\nmore. The second Kama is explained as desires of the class of love or\r\nlust.\r\n\r\n206. Daivi is explained by Sankara as divine; by Sreedhara as marvellous.\r\n\r\n207. The divine desires are about sons, fame, victory over enemies, etc.,\r\nregulations, such as fasts etc.; their own nature, i.e., disposition as\r\ndependent on the acts of their past lives. Thus all the commentators.\r\n\r\n208. The worshipper obtains his desires, thinking he gets them from the\r\ngodhead he worships. It is however, that gives him those.\r\n\r\n209. The divinities being perishable, myself imperishable. What these\r\nobtain is perishable. What my worshippers obtain is imperishable.\r\n\r\n210. The ignorant, without knowledge of my transcendent essence take me\r\nto be no higher than that what is indicated in my human and other\r\nincarnate manifestations. Thus Sreedhara.\r\n\r\n211. Adhyatman is explained as all that by which Brahman is to be\r\nattained. All actions mean the whole course of duties and practices\r\nleading to the knowledge of Brahman.\r\n\r\n212. The three words occurring in this sloka and explained in the next\r\nsection, forming as they do the subject of a question by Arjuna.\r\n\r\n213. Bhava is production, and Udbhava is growth or development. Thus\r\nSreedhara.\r\n\r\n214. All the doors, i.e., the senses. Confining the mind within the\r\nheart, i.e., withdrawing the mind from all external objects. Murdhni is\r\nexplained by Sreedhara to mean here \"between the eyebrows.\"\r\n\r\n215. All these regions being destructible and liable to re-birth, those\r\nthat live there are equally liable to death and re-birth.\r\n\r\n216. The meaning, as explained by Sreedhara, is that such persons are\r\nsaid to know all, and not those whose knowledge is bounded by the course\r\nof the sun and the moon.\r\n\r\n217. In this round of births and deaths, the creatures themselves are not\r\nfree agents, being all the while subject to the influence of Karma, as\r\nexplained by the commentators.\r\n\r\n218. The commentators explain the word fire, the light, day, &c., as\r\nseveral godheads presiding over particular times.\r\n\r\n219. The atmosphere occupies space without affecting it or its nature. So\r\nall things are in the Supreme Being without affecting him.\r\n\r\n220. My nature, i.e., the unmanifest principle or primal essence.\r\n\r\n221. Prakriti which I render \"nature\" is explained by the commentators as\r\nKarma, the influence of Karma or action being universal in setting the\r\nform of a particular entity at the time of its creation.\r\n\r\n222. This reason, i.e., my supervision.\r\n\r\n223. Sreedhara says that these are different modes of worship; \"with\r\nreverence and ever devoted\" grammatically refers to each of the three\r\nclasses of worshippers indicated.\r\n\r\n224. Performing the sacrifice of knowledge, i.e., believing Vasudeva to\r\nbe everything. In many forms, i.e., as Brahman, Rudra, etc.\r\n\r\n225. Mantra is the sacred verse or verses used for invoking godheads, and\r\nfor other purposes.\r\n\r\n226. Hence they have to come back, explains Sreedhara.\r\n\r\n227. Prayatatmanas is explained as Suddhachittasya.\r\n\r\n228. Iman lokan (this mortal world), Sreedhara says, may mean \"this form\r\nof royal saint that thou hast.\" This is far-fetched.\r\n\r\n229. Telang renders Paramam 'excellent'; Mr. John Davies, 'all\r\nimportant'. The meaning is referring to the 'Supreme Soul'.\r\n\r\n230. Both Sankara and Sreedhara explain Sarvassas as \"in every way\".\r\ni.e., as creator, as guide, &c.\r\n\r\n231. Prajas offspring, including, as Sankara says, both mobile, and\r\nimmobile, therefore, not mankind alone.\r\n\r\n232. Bhava-samanwitas is explained by Sreedhara as \"full of love\", which\r\nK. T. Telang accepts. Sankara explains it as \"endued with penetration\r\ninto the knowledge of the Supreme object.\"\r\n\r\n233. Tityam, ever, is connected with what follows and not what precedes.\r\nThus Sreedhara. Mr. Davies connects it with Kathayantas.\r\n\r\n234. K. T. Telang renders buddhi-yogam as knowledge; Mr. Davies, as\r\nmental devotion and Sankara, \"devotion by special insight.\"\r\n\r\n235. To know thee fully is impossible. In what particular forms or\r\nmanifestations, therefore, shall I think of thee? The word Bhava in the\r\nsecond line is rendered \"entities\" by K. T. Telang, and \"form of being\"\r\nby Mr. Davies.\r\n\r\n236. Vistarasya evidently refers (as explained by all the commentators)\r\nto Vibhutinam. it is a question of grammar and not of doctrine that there\r\ncan be any difference of opinion. Mr. Davies, however, renders it \"of\r\n(my) greatness.\" This is inaccurate.\r\n\r\n237. The Adityas are the solar deities, twelve in number, corresponding\r\nto the twelve months of the year. The Maruts are the wind-gods, whose\r\nchief is Marichi.\r\n\r\n238. The Rudras are a class of destructive gods, eleven in number. The\r\nVasus are an inferior class of deities, eight in number. The lord of\r\ntreasures is Kuvera.\r\n\r\n239. The Japa-sacrifice is the sacrifice by meditation which is superior\r\nto all sacrifices.\r\n\r\n240. Kamadhuk, the wish-giving cow called Surabhi. The cause of\r\nre-production, i.e., I am not the mere carnal passion, but that passion\r\nwhich procreates or is crowned with fruit.\r\n\r\n241. In 28, Vasuki is called the chief of the Sarpas (serpents); in 29\r\nAnanta is spoken of as the chief of the Nagas. The latter are Sarpas as\r\nwell, Sreedhara says that the distinction lies in the fact of the Nagas\r\nbeing without poison. This is hardly correct.\r\n\r\n242. Pavatam may also mean \"of those that have motion.\" Rama is\r\nDasaratha's son, the hero of Valmiki's poem. Ganga is called Jahnavi\r\nbecause she was, after having been drunk up, let out by the ascetic Jahnu\r\nthrough his knee.\r\n\r\n243. Mr. Davies renders Vedas 'Pravadatam' as \"the speech of those that\r\nspeak.\" K. T. Telang renders it \"the argument of controversialists.\"\r\n\r\n244. A, or rather the sound of A as in full, is the initial letter of the\r\nSanskrit alphabet. Of compounds, the Dwanda, or the copulative compound,\r\nis enumerated first. In other respects again, the Dwanda is the best kind\r\nof compound for the words forming it are co-ordinate, without one being\r\ndependent on the other or others.\r\n\r\n245. The Vrihat-saman is said to be the best, because it leads to\r\nemancipation at once. Thus Sankara. The Margasirsha is the month from the\r\nmiddle of February to the middle of March. Productive of flowers, i.e.,\r\nthe Spring.\r\n\r\n246. Mr. Davies renders the last line of this verse as \"I have\r\nestablished in continuance all this universe by one part myself.\" This is\r\nboth obscure and inaccurate.\r\n\r\n247. Adhyatman, i.e., the relation between the Supreme and the individual\r\nsoul. This my delusion, i.e., about my being the slayer.\r\n\r\n248. Avyayam is that which has no decay. Ordinarily, it may be rendered\r\n\"eternal.\" Telang renders it \"inexhaustible\". Elsewhere I have rendered\r\nit as \"understanding.\"\r\n\r\n249. Ekastham, lit. \"all in one\". i.e., collected together.\r\n\r\n250. Devam is explained by Sreedhara as Dyotanatmakam i.e., endued with\r\nsplendour. Mr. Davies renders it resplendent; but Telang renders it\r\n\"deity.\"\r\n\r\n251. Pra-vibhaktam-anekadha (divided diversely) is an adjective of Jagat.\r\nSee Sreedhara. Both Mr. Davies and Telang seem to take it as a predicate\r\nin contra-distinction to Ekastham. This is scarcely correct.\r\n\r\n252. Verse 21 is read differently. For Twam Surasangha, some texts read\r\ntwa-Asurasanghas. Then again for Stuvanti in the second line some read\r\nVikshate.\r\n\r\n253. Pravritti is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as Chesta,\r\ni.e., movements or acts. Mr. Davies is, I think, not correct in taking it\r\nto mean \"evolved or developed form.\"\r\n\r\n254. Kala here is death. Mr. Davies renders it Time, following some other\r\ntranslators. Pravriddha is not (as Mr. Davies renders it) \"old\" or \"very\r\nold,\" but swelling or fully developed. Then again, Mr. Davies commits a\r\nludicrous blunder in rendering Rite twam as \"Except thee.\" This is one of\r\nthose idioms at which a foreigner is sure to stumble who has only the\r\nlexicons for his guide. What Krishna says is not that all would perish\r\nsave Arjuna, but that without Arjuna (i.e., even if he did not fight) all\r\nwould perish.\r\n\r\n255. Nidhanam is either refuge or support or abode or receptacle. Mr.\r\nDavies incorrectly renders it \"treasure-house.\"\r\n\r\n256. Sankara accepts the reading Gururgariyan, Sreedhara takes it as\r\nGururgariyan. In either case the difference in meaning is not material.\r\n\r\n257. Sankara connects Adhyayana with Veda and Yajna. This seems to be\r\nright explanation.\r\n\r\n258. Ata urddham is 'after this,' or 'hereafter on high' as Mr. Davies\r\nrenders it.\r\n\r\n259. Although the limitation \"for fruit\" does not occur in the text, yet,\r\nit is evident, it should be understood. Krishna does not recommend the\r\ntotal abandonment of actions, but abandonment for their fruit. Mr. Davies\r\nrenders arambha as \"enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n260. The learned, i.e., they that are themselves acquainted with is\r\nKshetra and what not. As explained by Krishna himself below, Kshetra is\r\nMatter, and Kshetrajna is Soul.\r\n\r\n261. Dukha-dosha is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as a Dwanda\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\n262. Vivikta is explained by the commentators as Suddha or\r\nChittaprasadakara. There can be no doubt, however, that it is in\r\nopposition to Janasamsadi following. Hence I render it \"lonely\".\r\n\r\n263. The object of the knowledge of truth is the dispelling of ignorance\r\nand the acquisition of happiness.\r\n\r\n264. Nor having eyes, etc., yet seeing, etc.; without attributes, yet\r\nhaving or enjoying all that the attributes give.\r\n\r\n265. All modifications, i.e., of material forms; all qualities, i.e.,\r\npleasure, pain, etc. The word rendered \"nature\" is Prakriti (primal\r\nmatter), and that rendered \"spirit\" is Purusha (the active principle).\r\nVikarna and Gunan include all material forms and attributes of the soul.\r\n\r\n266. Karya-karana-karttritwa is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara\r\nto mean \"the capacity of working (residing) in the body and the senses.\"\r\nK. T. Telang adopts this. Mr. Davies in his text has \"in the activity of\r\nthe organs of action.\" In course of his philological notes, however, he\r\ngives the correct rendering. 'Is said to be' is explained by Sreedhara.\r\nas referring to Kapila and others.\r\n\r\n267. It is the embodied spirit only that can enjoy the qualities of\r\nNature. Then again, the kind of connection it has with those qualities\r\nsettles its birth in good or evil wombs.\r\n\r\n268. Mr. Davies misunderstands the grammatical connection of the words in\r\nthe second line of this verse. K. T. Telang, following Sreedhara, says,\r\nthe word should be rendered \"approver.\"\r\n\r\n269. What is heard, i.e., the Srutis or the sacred doctrines.\r\n\r\n270. Destroying self by self is to be deprived of true knowledge.\r\n\r\n271. Sarvatra in the second line is explained by Sreedhara as \"in every\r\nbody, superior and inferior.\" Grammatically it may mean also, \"in every\r\npart of the body.\" Such a theory, however, of the seat of the soul would\r\nbe contrary to all Hindu ideas.\r\n\r\n272. Bhuta-Prakriti-moksha is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as\r\nmoksha or deliverance from the prakriti (nature) of bhutas' or entities.\r\nIt is true knowledge that effects such deliverance. Mr. Davies renders it\r\n\"deliverance of beings from Nature.\" This is evidently incorrect.\r\n\"Beings\" is not synonymous with self or soul.\r\n\r\n273. Itas is explained by Sreedhara as \"from the fetters of this body.\"\r\n\r\n274. Sreedhara makes mahat an adjective of yoni; Sankara makes it an\r\nadjective of Brahma. K. T. Telang follows Sankara.\r\n\r\n275. Happiness and knowledge are attributes of the mind, not of the soul.\r\nHence, when attached to the soul, they are as fetters from which the soul\r\nshould be freed.\r\n\r\n276. Deha samudbhava is explained by the commentators as having their\r\n\"samudbhava or parinama in deha.\" It is an instance of the vahuvrihi\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\n277. Light, activity, and delusion are the three qualities as indicated\r\nby their effects.\r\n\r\n278. Pratishtha is explained by Sankara as \"something on which another\r\n(here Brahma) stays or rests.\" Sreedhara explains it as Pratima. Telang\r\nfollowing Sreedhara, renders it \"embodiment;\" Mr. Davies, as \"seat.\"\r\nAmritasya and Avyayasya are taken separately by the commentators.\r\n\r\n279. The 'Aswattha' is the sacred Indian fig tree, here emblematical of\r\nthe course of worldly life. Its roots are above; those roots are the\r\nSupreme Being. Its branches are below, these being the inferior deities.\r\nIts leaves are the sacred hymns of the Vedas, i.e., as leaves keep the\r\ntree alive and even conduce to its fruits, so the Vedas support this tree\r\nand lead to salvation.\r\n\r\n280. Upwards and downwards i.e., from the highest to the lowest of\r\ncreated things. Enlarged by the qualities, i.e., the qualities appearing\r\nas the body, the senses, etc. The sprouts are the objects of sense, being\r\nattached to the senses themselves as sprouts to branches. The roots\r\nextending downwards are the desires for diverse enjoyments. Thus Telang,\r\nfollowing the commentators.\r\n\r\n281. Joined to the qualities, i.e., perceiving objects of sense or\r\nexperiencing pleasure and pain.\r\n\r\n282. \"Atmani\" in the first line is \"in the body\" as explained by\r\nSreedhara and others: \"in the understanding\" as explained by Sankara. It\r\nseems, however, to be used in the general senses of \"themselves\", without\r\nparticular reference to either body or understanding. An Akritatman is\r\none whose soul is not made or formed; generally, \"a person of unsubdued\r\npassions.\"\r\n\r\n283. There can be no question that Soma here means the moon and not the\r\nSoma juice quaffed in sacrifices, or sap. It is the moon that supports,\r\nnourishes all herbs and numerous passages may be quoted from Hindu sacred\r\nliterature to show this. Mr. Davies, therefore, clearly errs in rendering\r\nSoma as \"the savoury juice.\"\r\n\r\n284. The four kinds of food are: that which is masticated, that which is\r\nsucked, that which is licked, and that which is drunk.\r\n\r\n285. Apohanam is loss or removal. It is a well-known word and its\r\napplication here is very natural. I am memory and knowledge (to those\r\nthat use them for virtuous acts). I am the loss of these faculties (to\r\nthose that engage in unrighteous acts). Mr. Davies erroneously renders it\r\nas \"The power of reason.\"\r\n\r\n286. Kutashtha is rendered by K. T. Telang as \"the unconcerned one\", by\r\nMr. Davies as \"the lord on high.\" I incline to the scholiasts who explain\r\nit as \"the uniform or the unchangeable one.\"\r\n\r\n287. Sarvabhavena is explained by Sankara by Sarvatma-chintaya (thinking\r\nMe to be the soul of everything). Sreedhara explains it as\r\nSarvaprakarena. Why may it not mean \"with the whole soul\" or \"with excess\r\nof love.\"\r\n\r\n288. I adopt Sankara's explanation of the last compound of the first line\r\nof this sloka, Sreedhara explains it differently.\r\n\r\n289. Prabritti I render \"inclination\" and Nivritti as \"disinclination.\"\r\nThe inclination is, as all the commentators explain, towards righteous\r\nactions, and the disinclination,--consequently, is about all unrighteous\r\nactions. K. T. Telang renders these words as \"action\" and \"inaction\". Mr.\r\nDavies, following the French version of Burnouf, takes them to mean \"the\r\ncreation and its end.\"\r\n\r\n290. Sankara seems to connect the genitive Jagatas with achitas Sreedhara\r\nconnects it (which is natural) with Kshayaya, which I accept.\r\n\r\n291. 'That' evidently refers to sacrifice, penance, and gift, in the\r\nclause before. The commentators, however, suggest that it may, besides,\r\nrefer to Brahma. I am myself not sure that it does not refer to Brahma.\r\n\r\n292. 'What the author wishes to lay down in these verses is that the\r\nwords OM, TAT, and SAT, have each their respective uses. When used as\r\ndirected here, such use cures the defects of the respective actions to\r\nwhich they are applied, it being understood that all three denote Brahma.\r\n\r\n293. Sanyasa I render Renunciation. K. T. Telang does the same. Mr.\r\nDavies renders it \"abstention.\" So 'Tyaga' I render \"abandonment.\" Mr.\r\nDavies renders it \"renunciation.\" What the two words, however, mean is\r\nexplained fully in the verses that follow.\r\n\r\n294. Both Sankara and Sreedhara explain the second line consisting of two\r\npropositions, the connecting verb bhavet being understood.\r\n\r\n295. I have used \"when\" for \"whatever\" to make the sentence grammatical.\r\n\r\n296. Davies, giving the sense correctly, does not follow the true order\r\nof the subject and the predicate. Following Lassen, he renders kusala and\r\nakusala as \"prosperous\" and \"unprosperous;\" for medhabi K. T. Telang has\r\nrendered \"talented\" which has not the sanction of good usage.\r\n\r\n297. That is, as Sreedhara explains, one who hath renounced the fruit of\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n298. Kritante Sankara takes it as an adjective of Sankhye and thinks that\r\nthe reference is to the Vedanta. Sreedhara also seems to be of the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n299. The substratum is the body. The agent is the person that thinks\r\nhimself to be the actor. The organs are those of perception etc. The\r\nefforts are the actions of the vital winds--Prana, etc. The deities are\r\nthose that preside over the eye and the other senses. The deities have no\r\nplace in Kapila's system. Hence, if it is not the Vedanta, some system\r\nmaterially based upon Kapila's and recognising the interference of the\r\ndeities, seems to be indicated. Atra is explained by Sreedhara as\r\nequivalent to \"among\" or \"with these.\" I think, however, it means, \"are\r\nhere\", i.e., are enumerated here, or, in this connection.\r\n\r\n300. Hath no feeling of egoism, i.e., doth not regard himself as the\r\ndoer, Sullied, i.e., by the taint of desire of fruit.\r\n\r\n301. Mr. Davies, I think, is right in rendering Samgrahas as\r\n\"complement.\" K. T. Telang renders it as equivalent to \"in brief.\"\r\n\r\n302. In the enunciation of qualities i.e., in the Sankhya system.\r\n\r\n303. Full of affections, i.e., for children, etc., as Sreedhara.\r\n\r\n304. Prakrita which I have rendered \"without discernment\" following\r\nSreedhara, may be, as Mr. Davies renders it, but \"malicious.\"\r\n\r\n305. Mr. Davies makes \"unswerving\" an adjective of 'devotion.' This is\r\nwrong, for Avyabhicharinya (unswerving) is a feminine instrumental, and\r\nmust qualify Dhritya.\r\n\r\n306. Atma-budhi-prasadajam. K. T. Telang, following an alternative\r\nexplanation offered by Sankara, renders it \"clear knowledge of the self.\"\r\nMr. Davies renders the \"serenity of one's own mind.\" I follow Sreedhara.\r\n\r\n307. Asamsayas is the reading that occurs in every text, and not\r\nAsamsayam. Mr. Davies, therefore, is incorrect in rendering it\r\n\"doubtless\" and making it an adverb qualifying \"come to me.\"\r\n\r\n308. Bhuti is explained by Sreedhara as gradual abhivridhhi, i.e., growth\r\nor greatness. Niti is explained as Nyaya or justice.\r\n\r\n309. Varayudham is according to Nilakantha, the excellent bow. Yena in\r\nverse 8 is equivalent to Yatra.\r\n\r\n310. What Bhishma says is this: I am bound by the Kauravas and,\r\ntherefore, I am not a free agent. Obliged I am to battle against you. Yet\r\nI am saying, \"What do you ask of me?\" as if I could really give you what\r\nyou might ask. My words, therefore, are without meaning, or vain, like\r\nthose of a eunuch. Klivavat is explained by Nilakantha as Kataravat. Even\r\nin that case, the sense would be the same.\r\n\r\n311. The Bengal reading is evidently incorrect. The Bombay text reads\r\nRaja for Vacoa.\r\n\r\n312. Nilakantha thinks that vigatakalmashas refers to Drona; the meaning\r\nhe suggests is \"Tell me with pure heart etc., etc.,\" I think Nilakantha\r\nis not right.\r\n\r\n313. The sense of the first line is that because I am bound by the\r\nKauravas with their wealth, therefore, I am obliged to make this\r\nreservation in the matter of granting thee thy wishes. That reservation\r\nreally nullifies my promise.\r\n\r\n314. Paran is explained by Nilakantha as \"superior\" qualifying Ripun.\r\n\r\n315. Vritosmi is the reading of the Bengal texts, better than Vaddhosmi\r\nof the Bombay edition, and bhristomi of the Burdwan text. Salya was not\r\nbound to the Kauravas like Bhishma or Drona or Kripa by pensions, but\r\ngratified by the reception granted to him by Duryodhana in secret, he,\r\ngenerously agreed to aid the latter even against his own sister's sons\r\nand their step-brothers.\r\n\r\n316. For Puskalan the Bombay text reads Pushkaran which means a kind of\r\ndrum.\r\n\r\n317. For rajan in the Bengal texts, in the first line of the 5th verse,\r\nthe Bombay text reads hyasan which I adopt.\r\n\r\n318. Maha samucchrave is explained by Nilakantha as Mahasamprahare.\r\n\r\n319. Literally, \"showing himself in an awful form.\"\r\n\r\n320. Subhadra's son Abhimanyu.\r\n\r\n321. These fences were made of iguana skins and cased the hands of the\r\nbowmen up to a few inches of the elbow-joint.\r\n\r\n322. Nimitta is explained by Nilakantha as the mark of object aimed at.\r\nDrona was the preceptor in arms of almost all the Bharata princes.\r\n\r\n323. With two Bhallas Abhimanyu cut off his adversary's standard; with\r\none, one of the protectors of his car-wheels: and with another, his\r\ncharioteer. Thus Nilakantha. A Parshni is altogether a different person\r\nfrom a Sarathi. Hence Nilakantha is assuredly right.\r\n\r\n324. 'Angaraka' is the planet Mars, and 'Sukra' i.e. Venus.\r\n\r\n325. Prativindhya was Yudhishthira's son by Draupadi.\r\n\r\n326. Maghavat is Indra, the chief of the celestials.\r\n\r\n327. The word used in the original is Viparitam lit. contrary. The sense\r\nseems to be that car men fought on foot, cavalry soldiers on elephants,\r\nwarriors on elephants from horseback, &c. The very character of the\r\nforces was altered.\r\n\r\n328. i.e., though repulsed, these frequently rallied, and occupied the\r\nsame ground as before.\r\n\r\n329. The last half of the 7th with the 8th forms one sentence. It is\r\ncertainly pleonastic. Ranavaranais of the Bengal texts is preferable to\r\nthe Bombay reading Varavaranais. Toranas are the wooden edifices placed\r\non the backs of elephants for the protection and comfort of the riders.\r\nThese are called in India Hawdas.\r\n\r\n330. Many of the Bengal texts read Avinitas. The correct reading, as in\r\nthe Bombay text, is Abhinitas. Aprabhinna is literally \"unrent,\" i.e.\r\nwith the temporal juice not trickling down. This juice emanates from\r\nseveral parts of the elephant's body when the season of rut comes. To\r\navoid a cumbrous periphrasis, which again would be unintelligible to the\r\nEuropean reader, I have given the sense only.\r\n\r\n331. For the Bengal reading 'Mahaprajna' the Bombay text reads\r\n'Mahaprasas.'\r\n\r\n332. Rathat and not Rathan is the reading that I adopt.\r\n\r\n333. The Bengal reading 'narvarakshaye' seems to be better than\r\n'Mahavirakshaye' of the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n334. Talaketu is lit. Palmyra-bannered. Without using such compounds, the\r\n'brevity' of the sentences cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\n335. Karshni is Krishna's or Arjuna's son Abhimanyu. Arjuna was sometimes\r\ncalled Krishna.\r\n\r\n336. Laghavamargasya is a mis-reading for Laghavamargastham'; then again\r\nchapi is incorrect, the correct reading chapam as in the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n337. The Bengal reading is 'Suaris Vritascha Sainyena'. The Bombay\r\nreading (which I do not adopt) is 'Vritastu Sarva Sainyena.'\r\n\r\n338. Nine slokas and a half, from the second half of the 43rd verse to\r\nthe 52nd verse (as above), are omitted in the Bengal texts. These,\r\nhowever, occur subsequently in section 46 following. The fact is, the\r\nwhole of the passage in this section and the 116 verses in the following\r\nsection, and the first 24 verses in the section 49, are regarded as an\r\ninterpolation. In those sections of the Udyoga Parvam where the Rathas\r\nand the Atirathas, &c, are counted by Bhishma, no mention is made of any\r\nwarrior of the name of Sweta. The Burdwan Pundits omit these passages\r\naltogether. I myself believe them to be an interpolation. Occurring,\r\nhowever, as it does in both the Bengal and the Bombay texts, I cannot\r\nomit in the English version.\r\n\r\n339. The Bombay text reads 'Yavana nihatam,' which is better.\r\n\r\n340. I adopt the Bombay reading of the 22nd verse.\r\n\r\n341. 'Swayam' in some of the Bengal texts is a misprint for 'Kshayam'.\r\n\r\n342. Chakrapani is Vishnu armed with the discus.\r\n\r\n343. For 'Yuthan' which gives no meaning, I read 'Yodhas'. The Bengal\r\nreading 'muktvagnimiva daruna' is better than the Bombay reading 'muktam\r\nripumishu darunam.'\r\n\r\n344. The Bombay reading 'jivitam dustyajam' is better than the Bengal\r\nreading 'jivam taduttham', if it has any meaning.\r\n\r\n345. In the first line of 71st verse, the word is not 'Laghu' but\r\n'alaghu', the initial 'a' being only silent according to the rule of\r\nSandhi. Though omitted in the Bengal texts, it occurs in the Bombay\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n346. 'Ghoram', 'ugram', 'mahabhayam', are pleonastic.\r\n\r\n347. In the first line of 87 for Maheswara (meaning Siva) the Bombay text\r\nreads Dhaneswara (meaning Kuvera, the lord of treasures). For also\r\n'Bhimainipatitiya' in the second line the Bombay text reads 'Bhishma\r\ninipainya'.\r\n\r\n348. The transgression of which Dhritarashtra alludes is the slaughter by\r\nBhishma from his car, of Sweta who was then a combatant on foot. Or, it\r\nmay be the very slaughter of Sweta, who was dear to the Pandavas and\r\nwhich act would, the king thought, provoke them more.\r\n\r\n349. Verses 4 to 7 are exceedingly difficult. I am not sure that I have\r\nunderstood them correctly. They are of the nature of Vyasakutas, i.e.,\r\ndeliberate obscurities for puzzling Ganesa, who acted as the scribe, for\r\nenabling Vyasa to gain time for compositions. In verse 4 'Pitus' means\r\nuncle's and not father's; so also 'durga decam' in verse 6 means\r\nentanglements, like Duryodhana's hostility with the Gandharvas on the\r\noccasion of the tale of cattle. In verse 7 of the Bengal reading is\r\nYudhishthiram bhaktya. The Bombay reading which I adopt, is Yudhishthire\r\nbhaktas. In 8, the purushadhamas are Sakuni and Karna. &c.\r\n\r\n350. As both operations are useless, so are these thy regrets.\r\n\r\n351. The sense is that Arjuna representing one force, and Bhishma\r\nanother, the two forces seemed to mingle, into one another, like one bolt\r\nof heaven against another, as one may say.\r\n\r\n352. Aplavas and Alpave are both correct.\r\n\r\n353. In the first line of the 14th verse Aviseshana seems to be\r\nincorrect. The Bombay text reads Avaseshena which I adopt.\r\n\r\n354. The correct reading is Vishnu, and not Jishnu as in many of the\r\nBengal texts.\r\n\r\n355. Indrayudha is Indra's bow or the rainbow. Akasaga (literally a\r\nranger of the skies) is a bird. The vapoury edifices and forms,\r\nconstantly melting away and reappearing in new shapes, are called\r\nGandharvanagar as (lit. towns of the Gandharvas or celestial choiristers).\r\n\r\n356. The Bengal reading is Savayambhuriva bhanuna which I have adopted.\r\nThe Bombay reading is Merurivabhanuna, which means \"like the mountain\r\nMeru with Sun.\" It is difficult to make a choice between the two.\r\n\r\n357. The Bombay text differs in many respects from the Bengal texts as\r\nregards the positions assigned to the several warriors and races in the\r\nPandava host. It is impossible to settle the true readings. I have,\r\ntherefore, without any attempt at correction, followed the Bengal text.\r\n\r\n358. The last word of the 28th verse is 'Ratheshu cha', and not 'Dhajeshu\r\ncha' for umbrellas could not possibly be fastened to standards.\r\n\r\n359. This identical verse occurs in the first chapter of the Bhagavad\r\nGita (vide, Verse 10, Chap. 25, of this Parvan, ante). There following\r\nthe commentators, particularly Sreedhara, I have rendered Aparyaptam and\r\nParyaptam as less than sufficient and sufficient. It would seem, however,\r\nthat that is erroneous.\r\n\r\n360. For these names, vide note in page ante, Bhishma Parva.\r\n\r\n361. The 26th verse in the Bengal texts consists of three lines. In the\r\nBombay texts, the half-sloka about Artayani does not occur.\r\n\r\n362. In the first line of the 5th verse, the true reading is avidhata and\r\nnot amarshanam.\r\n\r\n363. In the first line of 29, the correct reading is Prishna and not\r\nPritana.\r\n\r\n364. 'Samuchchhritam' or 'Samutthitam,' meaning risen, is scarcely a\r\nhappy adjective here.\r\n\r\n365. 'Parshni' is the wing or side of a car-warrior. The last word of\r\nthis verse is not 'Satpurushochitam' but 'Satparushairvritam'.\r\n\r\n366. 'Kovdara' is the species of ebony called Bauhinia Variegata.\r\n\r\n367. The Bombay reading 'Vegavattaram' is better. Literally, it means,\r\n'capable of imparting a greater impetus.' To avoid such periphrasis I\r\nrender it 'tougher'.\r\n\r\n368. The sense is that all these were entirely shrouded by Arjuna's\r\narrows.\r\n\r\n369. The true reading is Charmanam and not Varmanam: also bhumipa and\r\nbhutale.\r\n\r\n370. i.e., is about to set.\r\n\r\n371. For 'Satyatha tena' the Bombay text reads 'Satyasandhena'. I follow\r\nthe Bengal reading.\r\n\r\n372. What these were it is difficult to determine. The Bombay reading is\r\ndifferent. For Indrajala they read Indrakila which is as unknown as the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n373. The Vaitarani is the fabulous river that separate this world from\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\n374. In the first line of the 5th, for 'rajna' of the Bengal texts the\r\nBombay text reads 'gupta'. I follow the Bengal reading which is better.\r\n\r\n375. In the second line of the 6th, for sasars sena the Bombay reading is\r\nsena mahogra which is better, I adopt it.\r\n\r\n376. I adopt the Bengal reading Vyapta and not Vyala.\r\n\r\n377. The word Saravarani in the text is rendered by K. P. Singha as\r\nquivers. Nilakantha explains it as coats of mail. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that the Burdwan Pundits render it correctly as shields.\r\n\r\n378. In the first line of 19th, the Bengal reading Saykanam is a mistake.\r\nThe true reading is Saditanam.\r\n\r\n379. Salya is called Artayani after the name of his father.\r\n\r\n380. These were Kshuras (arrows with heads like razors), kshurapras,\r\n(arrows with horseshoe heads), bhallas (broad-headed arrows), and\r\nanjalikas (arrows with crescent-shaped-heads).\r\n\r\n381. i.e., the universal destroyer armed with his bow.\r\n\r\n382. Gory mace wet with &c. the original is pleonastic.\r\n\r\n383. The Bengal reading parantapa is a mistake for kathanchana.\r\n\r\n384. 'Kimpaca' is a species of cucurbitaceous plant. To avoid periphrasis\r\nI render it poison.\r\n\r\n385. Aklishtakarman literally means one who is not tired with what he\r\ndoes; hence, one who easily achieves the highest feats. When applied to\r\nKrishna or any divine personage it means one who does everything by a\r\nfiat of his will, without being dependent on means like ordinary persons.\r\nIt may also mean one of pure or white deeds.\r\n\r\n386. Literally \"be a perpetuator (son) of Yadu's race!\"\r\n\r\n387. The Bengal reading is Sa vai devas. The Bombay reading is Purvadevas.\r\n\r\n388. The Three-stepped Lord, Vishnu became vamana or the dwarf for\r\nrobbing the Asura Vali of his dominions. Disguised in that shape he asked\r\nof Vali three steps of land. Vali, smiling at the littleness of what was\r\nasked, gave it. But when the dwarf expanded his form and covered the\r\nheavens and the earth with only two steps of his, no space could be found\r\nfor the third step. Vali was forthwith seized and bound as a\r\npromise-breaker, and sent to reside in the nether regions.\r\n\r\n389. Word of command.\r\n\r\n390. i.e., really existent among all things.\r\n\r\n391. A fabulous aquatic animal resembling an alligator.\r\n\r\n392. Formed after the shape of the hawk.\r\n\r\n393. The Bengal reading is 'Yudhi sandhaya'. The Bombay reading is\r\n'pratisamvarya'. I adopt the latter.\r\n\r\n394. Literally, \"made a fierce battle.\"\r\n\r\n395. The Bengal reading Gooranamatitejasa is what I adopt. The Bombay\r\nreading, Ghoranamapnitaujasam involves a useless hyperbole. Of course,\r\natitejasa qualifies dhanusha in the next line.\r\n\r\n396. Kandigbhutas lit. \"not knowing which point of the compass was which.\"\r\n\r\n397. In the second line of 17, the Bombay text incorrectly reads Arjunam\r\nfor Pandavas.\r\n\r\n398. In the first line of 32 the Bengal reading is Mahabhujas. The\r\ncorrect reading seems to be (as in the Bombay text) Mahadhvajas.\r\n\r\n399. The last half of the second line of 35 in the Bengal text is\r\nvicious, I adopt the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n400. The pronoun 'sa' in the first line of 8 refers to Yuyudhana. Burdwan\r\nPundits erroneously take it as referring to Duryodhana, being misled by\r\nthe words Kurunam Kirtivardhanas.\r\n\r\n401. The Bombay reading asaniparabhan (which I adopt) is better than the\r\nBengal reading asaniswanan, for in connection with yamadanda immediately\r\npreceding the latter would be incongruous, if not unmeaning.\r\n\r\n402. An additional verse occurs here in connection with the slaughter of\r\nSatyaki's sons, in the Bombay texts. The Bengal texts omit it.\r\n\r\n403. Ekayangatas is lit. \"intently.\"\r\n\r\n404. Literally, \"hence his thoughts were so.\"\r\n\r\n405. Suchimukha is literally \"needle-mouthed.\" It is a wedge-like column\r\nwith the thin or pointed end turned towards the side of the enemy.\r\n\r\n406. The Bombay reading, which I adopt, is visravat in the beginning of\r\nthe 2nd line. The Bengal reading is visramvat, meaning \"from motives of\r\naffectionate enquiry\". It may also mean \"from confidence,\" though not in\r\nthis connection.\r\n\r\n407. The last word of 4 is read differently in the Bengal texts viz.,\r\nRathanghas, instead of, as in the Bombay edition, Maharathas.\r\n\r\n408. Vimana the nominative singular of Vamanas refers to Gangasutas. The\r\nBurdwan Pundits wrongly translate it \"with mind unmoved.\" I am not aware\r\nof any other reading.\r\n\r\n409. The last verse is read variously. But the Bombay and the Bengal\r\ntexts have faults of their own. The first word is ugranadam (Bengal) and\r\nnot ugranagam (Bombay). The Vahuvarnarupam (Bombay) is correct, and not\r\nVahuvarnarutam (Bengal). The last word of the first line is\r\nSamudirnamevam (Bombay), and not Samudirnavarnam (Bengal).\r\n\r\n410. Differently read in the Bengal texts, viz., Somadatta with the\r\nSaindhavas.\r\n\r\n411. The Bengal reading Rathas in the first line of 6 is a mistake;\r\nshould be, as in the Bombay text, tatha.\r\n\r\n412. The last word of the first line of 36 is amitan in the Bengal texts.\r\nThe Bombay reading is Varmitan. I prefer the Bengal reading.\r\n\r\n413. Satyaki was Arjuna's disciple in arms. Vijaya was another name of\r\nArjuna.\r\n\r\n414. Divakaram prapya, lit, 'reaching the path of the sun,' i.e., while\r\ncoursing through the sky.\r\n\r\n415. The meaning seems to be that Salya was pleased in witnessing the\r\nskill of his sister's sons, while the twins themselves were pleased in\r\ndisplaying that skill before one who was related to them through their\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n416. The Burdwan Pundits render this verse by carelessly taking, Viryavat\r\nas an adjective of saram. It qualifies Sahadeva. The reading Viryavat\r\noccurs in no text.\r\n\r\n417. Lit. \"This one no longer is\" i.e., 'alive'.\r\n\r\n418. The original is Vichnvantas (a practical) meaning 'plucking as\r\nflowers'.\r\n\r\n419. These, in Hindu physiology, are the three humours of the body always\r\ncontending for mastery over the vital forces.\r\n\r\n420. Bhima had vowed to slay the sons of Dhritarashtra; therefore,\r\nAbhimanyu liked not to falsify his uncle's vow by himself slaying any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n421. Instead of yat in the beginning of the second line, yada would be\r\nbetter. None of the printed text, however, have yada.\r\n\r\n422. In the first line of 50, the Bengal reading is Satam. I prefer the\r\nBombay reading which is atyantam. For, again, paryayasya in the beginning\r\nof the second line, the Bombay text reads anayassa which is better.\r\n\r\n423. The Bombay reading which I adopt is ajnayamanas cha. The Bengal\r\nreading seems to be incorrect.\r\n\r\n424. Vipralapapavidham is literally \"force from unreasoning declamation.\"\r\nThe Bombay reading is vicious.\r\n\r\n425. The meaning seems to be that the arrows shot by Yudhishthira were\r\ncut off by Bhishma, in numberless distinct sets, taking each set at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n426. i.e., just before setting.\r\n\r\n427. Krishna-sarathis (Bombay); the Bengal reading is Vanaradhvajas.\r\n\r\n428. The true reading, I think, is that of the Bombay text, viz.,\r\nnamabhis. The Bengal reading is manobhis. How can persons challenge each\r\nother mentally, although they may single out their antagonists so?\r\n\r\n429. Nagas, which may mean both stones and trees. In either case, the\r\ncomparison would apply.\r\n\r\n430. His pledge, viz., that in battle he would slay all the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra.\r\n\r\n431. The Bengal reading is tatas kruddhar. The Bombay reading is vachas\r\nkruram. I adopt the latter.\r\n\r\n432. The last word of this verse in the Bengal text is Sanjaya; in the\r\nBombay text, it is Samyuge. The latter seems to be the true reading, for\r\nafter Sanjaya in the first line, its repetition in the second is useless.\r\n\r\n433. The last word of the 4th verse is anivartinam. In the Bengal texts\r\nit is sumahatmanam.\r\n\r\n434. The last word of the first line of 8 is Vichetasa and not (as in the\r\nBengal texts, including the Burdwan edition) Viseshatas which would\r\nscarcely have any meaning.\r\n\r\n435. I have expanded the first line of 13, as a closely literal version\r\nwould scarcely be intelligent to the general reader. The sense is that\r\nthe evil consequences, that have now overtaken thee, arose even then when\r\nthe beneficial counsels of Vidura were first rejected.\r\n\r\n436. The Bengal reading Dwidhabhutais is incorrect. It should be, as in\r\nthe Bombay text, tridhabhutais.\r\n\r\n437. In the Bengal texts, tava in the first line is incorrect. It should\r\nbe tatra (Bombay).\r\n\r\n438. Steeds that are described as Nadijas would literally mean \"those\r\nborn in rivers.\" The Punjab, or some other country watered by many rivers\r\nis meant.\r\n\r\n439. Literally, \"in soil belonging to another.\" The original is\r\nparakshetre.\r\n\r\n440. Vayuvega-samsparsam, literally, \"the contact (of whose dash or\r\ncollision) resembles that of the wind in force.\" The meaning, therefore,\r\nis that those chargers dashed against hostile division with the fury of\r\nthe tempest.\r\n\r\n441. In the first line of 64, the true reading is Survamarmajna, and not\r\nSarvadharmajna.\r\n\r\n442. The last word of the second line is variously read. The Bengal\r\nreading is Mahadwijas Probably implying Garuda, the prince of birds. I\r\nhave adopted the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n443. i.e., with temporal juice trickling down.\r\n\r\n444. The duty consisted in not retreating from the field.\r\n\r\n445. i.e., the rescue of the king.\r\n\r\n446. In the second line of 15, the Bengal reading saravarshena is\r\nincorrect. The Bombay reading Rathavansena is what I follow.\r\n\r\n447. The Bengal reading hayais in the instrumental plural is incorrect.\r\nThe Bombay text reads hayas (nom. plural). This is correct.\r\n\r\n448. Literally, 'divided in twin'.\r\n\r\n449. Mountains, in Hindu mythology, had wings, till they were shorn of\r\nthese by Indra with his thunder. Only Mainaka, the son of Himavat, saved\r\nhimself by a timely flight. To this day he conceals himself within the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n450. The Bengal reading of the first line of this verse is vicious. The\r\ntrue reading is parswaistudaritairanye. Both parsa and darita should be\r\n(as here) in the instrumental Plural, and anye should be in the nom.\r\nplural.\r\n\r\n451. The correct reading, as settled by the Burdwan Pundits, is Hataroha\r\nvyodrisyanta. Some texts have Hayaroha which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n452. \"Blinded cheeks.\" The Sanskrit word is madandha. Literally rendered,\r\nit would be \"juice-blind\". This can scarcely be intelligible to the\r\ngeneral European reader. Hence the long-winded adjectival clause I have\r\nused.\r\n\r\n453. The first line is evidently pleonastic. Sanskrit, however, being\r\nvery copious, repetitions can scarcely be marked at the first glance.\r\nLiterally rendered, the original is--\"Juice-blind and excited with rage.\"\r\n'Juice-blind,' I have explained elsewhere.\r\n\r\n454. The word I render \"muskets\" is nalika sometime ago the Bharata (a\r\nBengali periodical of Calcutta edited by Babu Dwijendra Nath Tagore) in a\r\npaper on Hindu weapons of warfare from certain quotations from the\r\nRamayana and the Mahabharata, argued that the nalika must have been some\r\nkind of musket vomiting bullets of iron in consequence of some kind of\r\nexplosive force. The Rishis discouraged use of nalika, declaring them to\r\nbe barbarous and fit only for kings that would come in the Kali age.\r\n\r\n455. Padarakshan lit., those that protected the feet (for any warrior of\r\nnote). These always stood at the flanks and rear of the warrior they\r\nprotected. In the case of car-warriors' these were called chakra-rakshas\r\n(protectors of the wheels). So we have Parshni-rakshas and\r\nPrishata-rakshas', &c.\r\n\r\n456. in the first line of the 3rd verse, the Bengal reading is bhayam.\r\nThe true reading, however, is khayam.\r\n\r\n457. In the second line of 8th, for the Bengal reading, vachaymasa\r\nyodhanam, the Bombay reading is yachtacha Suyodhanam. This is better. The\r\nBengal reading has no meaning.\r\n\r\n458. Literally, \"when its impetuosity is stirred up by the wind.\"\r\n\r\n459. The Bengal reading, which I adopt is sardula iva vegavan. The Bombay\r\nreading is sardula iva darpitas.\r\n\r\n460. In the first line of 54, the Bombay reading pragrihya is better than\r\nthe Bengal reading visrijya.\r\n\r\n461. Literally, hundred-slayers; supposed to be a kind of rockets.\r\n\r\n462. Some of the Bengal texts, in the first line of the 6th, incorrectly\r\nread sa-run for Sakram.\r\n\r\n463. The Bengal reading atmana, the last word of the verse, seems to be a\r\nmistake. The Bombay text gives the right word, which is aimanas\r\n(genitive). Sarvatobhadra seems to have been a kind of square array in\r\nwhich the troops faced all the points of the compass.\r\n\r\n464. In the Bengal texts, savdas in the first line is vicious. The true\r\nreading seems to be sahkhan, as in the Bombay edition. Then again in\r\nKunjaran (Bengal), the Bombay text reads Pushkaran which is\r\nunquestionably correct.\r\n\r\n465. The Bengal reading vanya-nagendra is better than the Bombay reading\r\ngandha-nagendra.\r\n\r\n466. In Hindu mythology, solar eclipses are caused by Rahu's attempts at\r\nswallowing the Sun.\r\n\r\n467. Budha is Mercury, and Sukra is Venus.\r\n\r\n468. Both the Bombay and the Bengal texts repeat Chamarais in the second\r\nline of 24th. This is certainly erroneous. The Burdwan Pundits read it\r\ntomarais. This is correct.\r\n\r\n469. In the second line of 30th, the correct reading is Rathas (nom.\r\nplural) and not Rathan. So in the first line of 31st, the word is\r\nturangas (nom. plural) and not turangan.\r\n\r\n470. Lit. \"reached him with shafts etc.\"\r\n\r\n471. Both the Bengal and the Bombay printed texts are in fault regarding\r\nthe word Pandupurvaja. The Bombay text makes it a nom. plural. The Bengal\r\ntext makes it an accusative singular. There can be no doubt that the\r\nBurdwan Pundits are right in taking it as a vocative.\r\n\r\n472. That you know me to be invincible is a fortunate circumstance, for\r\nif you had not known this, you would have fought on for days together and\r\nthus caused a tremendous destruction of creatures. By your coming to\r\nknow, that destruction may be stopped.\r\n\r\n473. The adjective Vahu in the first line of 32 qualifies rathinas in the\r\nsecond line. The last of the verse is a nom. sing. and not a vocative.\r\n\r\n474. The Bengal texts read mahasuram in the second line of the verse.\r\nThis seems to be vicious. A latter reading would be mahasuram (the great\r\nAsura). The Bombay text reads rane suram. I adopt the last.\r\n\r\n475. i.e. Thou art still a woman though the sex hath been changed.\r\n\r\n476. Literally, \"will not get or obtain you.\"\r\n\r\n477. There can be no doubt that (in the second line of 19 corresponding\r\nwith the first line of 19 of the Bombay text), Arjuni should be a\r\nnominative, and not an accusative. The Bombay reading, therefore, is\r\nvicious. The Burdwan Pundits also err in taking that word as occurring in\r\nthe accusative form.\r\n\r\n478. I think Yatavrata had better be read Yatavratam. It would then mean\r\nBhishma.\r\n\r\n479. Both the Bengal and the Bombay texts are confusing here. I follow\r\nthe text as settled by the Burdwan Pundits. If the erudition of the\r\nBurdwan Pundits be rejected, 28 would read as, \"Virata, at the head of\r\nhis forces, encountered Jayadratha supported by his owl, troops, and also\r\nVardhaskhemi's heir, O Chastiser of foes.\" This would be evidently wrong.\r\n\r\n480. This Susarman was not the king of the Trigartas but another person\r\nwho was on the Pandava side.\r\n\r\n481. Both the Bengal and the Bombay texts have Rathanika. The correct\r\nreading as settled by the Burdwan Pundits, is Gajanika.\r\n\r\n482. Both the Bengal and the Bombay texts read Arjunas in the second line\r\nof 21. The Burdwan Pundits are for correcting it as Arjunam. I do not\r\nthink the correction happy.\r\n\r\n483. In the second line of 35 for Satanika, the true reading, is\r\nSahanikan.\r\n\r\n484. After the 60th verse, three lines occur in the Bombay edition as\r\nfollows,--\"And many elephants, with standards on their backs, were seen\r\nto fly away in all directions. And many Kshatriyas, O monarch, armed with\r\nmaces and darts and bows, were seen lying Prostrate on the field.\"\r\n\r\n485. The Bengal texts read Evam etc.; the Bombay reading is samam, I\r\nadopt the former reading. \"Set their hearts upon the region of Brahma,\"\r\ni.e., fought on, resolved to win the highest heaven by bravery or death\r\nin battle.\r\n\r\n486. The Bengal reading of this verse is vicious. In the first line,\r\nlokasya is incorrect and unmeaning, the correct word being vakyasa. In\r\nthe second line, again, for Prishtha-ascha samantatas, the correct\r\nreading is Prisharaischa samantatas.\r\n\r\n487. Brahma-danda literally means a Brahmana's rod--bamboo-stick. In\r\nconsequence of the Brahmana's ascetic power, this thin rod (symbolical of\r\nthe Brahmana's power of chastisement) is infinitely more powerful than\r\neven Indra's bolt. The latter can strike only one, but the former can\r\nsmite whole countries, and entire races from generation to generation.\r\nWith only his Brahma-danda Vasishtha baffled all the mighty and celestial\r\nweapons of Viswamitra vide, Ramayana, section 56, Valakanda.\r\n\r\n488. Instead of \"the Salwas, the Sayas, and the Trigartas,\" the Bombay\r\ntext reads, \"the Trigartas depending on (king) Salwa.\" I have not,\r\nhowever, met with any Trigartas under Salwa's rule, that race having, at\r\nthis time, Susarman for their ruler.\r\n\r\n489. Indra#ddhwaja was a pole, decked with banners, created in honour of\r\nIndra. The festival attracted considerable crowds.\r\n\r\n490. The second line of 114 in the Bengal text is vicious. I adopt the\r\nBombay reading, which is Kururajasya tarkitas. Literally rendered the\r\nsecond line is \"the destruction of the Kuru king was inferred.\"\r\n\r\n491. By bravery on the field of battle, which, according to the Hindu\r\nscriptures, is always thus rewarded"
