      "content": "OM! HAVING BOWED down to Narayana, and Nara the most exalted of male\r\nbeings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those valiant descendants of Kuru, who belonged\r\nto the same party (with Virata), having joyfully celebrated the nuptials\r\nof Abhimanyu and rested themselves that night, presented themselves at\r\ndawn, well pleased, in the court of Virata, And the chamber of the king\r\nof the Matsya was full of riches, and variegated with choice gems and\r\nprecious stones, with seats methodically arranged, adorned with garlands,\r\nand filled with fragrance. And those mighty monarchs of men all came to\r\nthat place, And on the seats in front sat the two kings Virata and\r\nDrupada. And the revered and aged rulers of the earth, and Valarama and\r\nKrishna along with their father, all sat there. And close to the king of\r\nPanchala was seated the great hero of the race of Sini, together with the\r\nson of Rohini. And side by side with the king of the Matsya sat Krishna\r\nand Yudhishthira, and all the sons of king Drupada, and Bhima and Arjuna,\r\nand the two sons of Madri, and Pradyumna and Samva, both valiant in\r\nbattle, and Abhimanyu with Virata's sons. And those princes, the sons of\r\nDraupadi, rivalling their fathers in valour, strength, grace, and\r\nprowess, sat upon excellent seats inlaid with gold. And when those mighty\r\nheroes wearing shining ornaments and robes had set themselves down, that\r\ngorgeous assembly of kings looked beautiful like the firmament spangled\r\nwith resplendent stars. And those valiant men, assembled together, having\r\nconversed with one another upon various topics, remained for some time in\r\na pensive mood, with their eyes fixed upon Krishna. And at the end of\r\ntheir talk, Krishna drew their attention to the affairs of the Pandavas.\r\nAnd those powerful kings together listened to Krishna's speech, pregnant\r\nand lofty. And Krishna said, It is known to you all, how this\r\nYudhishthira was deceitfully defeated at dice by the son of Suvala, and\r\nhow he was robbed of his kingdom and how a stipulation was made by him\r\nconcerning his exile in the forest. And capable as they were of\r\nconquering the earth by force, the sons of Pandu remained firm in their\r\nplighted faith. And accordingly for six and seven years these\r\nincomparable men accomplished the cruel task imposed upon them. And this\r\nlast, the thirteenth year, was exceedingly hard for them to pass. Yet\r\nunrecognised by any one they have passed it, as known to you, suffering\r\nunendurable hardships of various kinds. This is known to you all. These\r\nillustrious men have spent the thirteenth year, employed in menial\r\nservice of others. This being so, it is for you to consider what will be\r\nfor the good of both Yudhishthira and Duryodhana, and what, as regards\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas, will be consistent with the rules of\r\nrighteousness and, propriety and what will meet with the approbation of\r\nall. The virtuous king Yudhishthira would not unrighteously covet even\r\nthe celestial kingdom. But righteously he would accept the rule even of a\r\nsingle village. How the sons of Dhritarashtra fraudulently robbed him of\r\nhis paternal kingdom, and how he hath passed a life of unendurable\r\nhardships, are known to all the kings assembled here. The sons of\r\nDhritarashtra are incapable of overcoming by strength Arjuna, the son of\r\nPritha. Nevertheless, king Yudhishthira and his friends have no other\r\ndesire than the good of Dhritarashtra's son. These brave sons of Kunti,\r\nand the two sons of Madri, ask for only what they themselves, achieving\r\nvictory in battle, had won from the defeated kings. You, no doubt, know\r\nfull well how those enemies of the Pandavas--with the object of\r\npossessing themselves of the kingdom, endeavoured by various means to\r\ndestroy them, when they were yet mere boys. So wicked and rancorous they\r\nwere. Consider, how grasping they are and how virtuous Yudhishthira is.\r\nConsider also the relationship that exists between them. I beseech you\r\nall to consult together and also think separately. The Pandavas have\r\nalways had a regard for truth. They have fulfilled their promise to the\r\nvery letter. If now treated wrongfully by the sons of Dhritarashtra, they\r\nwould slay them all though banded together. They have friends, who, on\r\nbeing informed of their unworthy treatment at the hands of others, would\r\nstand by them, engaged in fight with their persecutors, and willingly\r\nslay them even if they should lose their own lives for it. If you suppose\r\nthem to be too few to be capable of winning a victory over their enemies,\r\nyou must know that united together and followed by their friends, they\r\nwould, no doubt, try their utmost to destroy those enemies. What\r\nDuryodhana thinks is not exactly known, nor what he may do. When the mind\r\nof the other side is not known, what opinion can be formed by you as to\r\nwhat is best to be done? Therefore, let a person, virtuous and honest and\r\nof respectable birth, and wary,--an able ambassador, set out to beseech\r\nthem mildly for inducing them to give half the kingdom to Yudhishthira.\r\nHaving listened to the speech of Krishna, marked by prudence and a regard\r\nfor virtue and showing a pacific and impartial spirit, his elder brother\r\nthen addressed the assembly bestowing high encomiums on the words of the\r\nyounger brother.'\""

These\r\nvaliant sons of Kunti are ready to give up half their kingdom, and they\r\nmake this sacrifice for the sake of Duryodhana. The sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, therefore, should give up half of the kingdom, and should\r\nrejoice and be exceedingly happy with us that the quarrel can be so\r\nsatisfactorily settled. These mighty persons having obtained the kingdom\r\nwould, no doubt, be pacified and happy, provided the opposite party\r\nbehave well. For them to be pacified will redound to the welfare of men.\r\nAnd I should be well-pleased if somebody from here, with the view of\r\npacifying both the Kurus and the Pandavas, should undertake a journey and\r\nascertain what is the mind of Duryodhana and explain the views of\r\nYudhishthira. Let him respectfully salute Bhishma the heroic scion of\r\nKuru's race, and the magnanimous son of Vichitravirya, and Drona along\r\nwith his son, and Vidura and Kripa, and the king of Gandhara, along with\r\nthe Suta's son. Let him also pay his respects to all the other sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, to all who are renowned for strength and learning, devoted\r\nto their proper duties, heroic, and conversant with signs of the times.\r\nWhen all these persons are gathered together and when also the elderly\r\ncitizens are assembled, let him speak words full of humility and likely\r\nto serve the interests of Yudhishthira, At all events, let them not be\r\nprovoked, for they have taken possession of the kingdom with a strong\r\nhand. When Yudhishthira had his throne, he forgot himself by being\r\nengaged in gambling and was dispossessed by them of his kingdom. This\r\nvaliant Kuru, this descendant of Ajamida, Yudhishthira, though not\r\nskilled in dice and though dissuaded by all his friends, challenged the\r\nson of the king of Gandhara, an adept at dice, to the match. There were\r\nthen at that place thousands of dice-players whom Yudhishthira could\r\ndefeat in a match. Taking however, no notice of any of them, he\r\nchallenged Suvala's son of all men to the game, and so he lost. And\r\nalthough the dice constantly went against him, he would still have Sakuni\r\nalone for his opponent. Competing with Sakuni in the play, he sustained a\r\ncrushing defeat. For this, no blame can attach to Sakuni. Let the\r\nmessenger make use of words characterised by humility, words intended to\r\nconciliate Vichitravirya's son. The messenger may thus bring round\r\nDhritarashtra's son to his own views. Do not seek war with the Kurus;\r\naddress Duryodhana in only a conciliatory tone, The object may possibly\r\nfail to be gained by war, but it may be gained by conciliation, and by\r\nthis means also it may be gained enduringly.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'While that valiant scion of Madhu's race was\r\neven continuing his speech, the gallant son of the race of Sini suddenly\r\nrose up and indignantly condemned the words of the former by these words\r\nof his.'"

There are\r\nbrave men, and likewise those that are cowards. Men may be divided into\r\nthese two well defined classes. As upon a single large tree there may be\r\ntwo boughs one of which beareth fruits while the other doth not, so from\r\nthe self-same line of progenitors may spring persons that are imbecile as\r\nwell as those that are endowed with great strength O thou bearing the\r\nsign of a plough on thy banner, I do not, in sooth, condemn the words\r\nthou hast spoken, but I simply condemn those, O son of Madhu, who are\r\nlistening to thy words! How, indeed, can he, who unblushingly dares\r\nattach even the slightest blame in the virtuous king Yudhishthira be\r\npermitted to speak at all in the midst of the assembly? Persons clever in\r\nthe game of dice challenged the magnanimous Yudhishthira unskilled as he\r\nis in play, and confiding in them he was defeated! Can such persons be\r\nsaid to have virtuously won the game? If they had come to Yudhishthira\r\nwhile playing in this house with his brothers and defeated him there,\r\nthen what they would have won would have been righteously won. But they\r\nchallenged Yudhishthira who was bound in conscience to follow the rules\r\nobserved by the military caste, and they won by a trick. What is there in\r\nthis conduct of theirs that is righteous? And how can this Yudhishthira\r\nhere, having performed to the utmost the stipulations entered into by way\r\nof stakes in the play, freed from the promise of a sojourn in the forest,\r\nand therefore entitled to his ancestral throne, humble himself? Even if\r\nYudhishthira coveted other people's possessions, still it would not\r\nbehove him to beg! How can they be said to be righteous and not intent on\r\nusurping the throne when, although the Pandavas have lived out their\r\nsojourn of concealment unrecognised, they still say that the latter had\r\nbeen recognised? They were besought by Bhishma and the magnanimous Drona,\r\nbut they would not yet consent to give back to the Pandavas the throne\r\nthat belongeth to them by right of birth. The means with which I would\r\nbeseech them would be sharp arrows. I shall fight and with a strong hand\r\nforce them to prostrate themselves at the feet of the illustrious son of\r\nKunti. If, however, they do not bow at the feet of the wise Yudhishthira,\r\nthen they and their partisans must go to the regions of Yama. When\r\nYuyudhana (myself) is enraged and resolved to fight, they, to be sure,\r\nare unequal to withstand his impetus, as mountains are unable to resist\r\nthat of the thunderbolt. Who can withstand Arjuna in fight, or him who\r\nhath the discus for his weapon in battle, or myself as well? Who can\r\nwithstand the unapproachable Bhima? And who, having regard for his life,\r\nwould come near the twin brothers who firmly grasp their bows and\r\nresemble the death-dealing Yama in intelligence? Who would approach\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the son of Drupada, or these five sons of the Pandavas\r\nwho have added lustre to Draupadi's name, rivalling their fathers in\r\nvalour, equal to them in every respect and full of martial pride, or him\r\nof the powerful bow, Subhadra's son, irresistible by even the gods\r\nthemselves; or Gada, or Pradyumna, or Samva, resembling Yama or the\r\nthunderbolt or fire? We shall slay Dhritarashtra's son and Sakuni and\r\nKarna in battle, and place the Pandava on the throne. There is no sin in\r\nslaying them that are bent on slaying us: but to be a beggar before foes\r\nis both impious and infamous. I ask you to be diligent in doing that\r\nwhich is heartily desired by Yudhishthira. Let Pandu's son get back the\r\nkingdom resigned by Dhritarashtra! Either Yudhishthira should get back\r\nhis kingdom this very day or all our enemies shall lie down on the earth\r\nslain by me!'"

Never will Duryodhana give up the kingdom by peaceful\r\nmeans, and Dhritarashtra, who dotes on his son, will follow him in his\r\nwish. And so will Bhishma and Drona from imbecility, and Karna and Sakuni\r\nfrom folly. The words of Valadeva command themselves to my judgment; the\r\ncourse pointed out by him should, indeed, be followed by a man who\r\ndesires peaceful settlement. But Duryodhana should never be addressed in\r\nmild words. Vicious by nature, he, I believe cannot be brought to reason\r\nby mildness. In respect of an ass, mildness is in place; but in respect\r\nof animals of the bovine species, severity should be resorted to.

As we are desirous of adopting a politic course,\r\nthis is, no doubt, our first duty; a man acting otherwise would be a\r\ngreat fool. But our relationship to both the Kurus and the Pandus is\r\nequal, howsoever these two parties may behave with each other. Both you\r\nand we have been invited here on the occasion of a marriage. The marriage\r\nhaving now been celebrated, let us go home well-pleased. You are the\r\nforemost of kings, both in years and learning; and here we all, no doubt\r\nare as if your pupils. Dhritarashtra has always entertained a great\r\nrespect for you; and you are also a friend of the preceptors Drona and\r\nKripa. I, therefore, ask you to send a message (to the Kurus) in the\r\ninterests of the Pandavas. We all resolve even upon this that you should\r\nsend a message unto them. If that chief of the Kuru race should make\r\npeace on equitable terms, then the brotherly feelings between the Kuras\r\nand the Pandus will sustain no injury. If on the other hand, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra should wax haughty and from folly refuse to make peace,\r\nthen, having summoned others, summon us too. The holder of Gadiva then\r\nwill be fired with wrath and the dull-headed and wicked Duryodhana, with\r\nhis partisans and friends, will meet his fate.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'King Virata, then having honoured Krishna, sent him\r\nhome with his followers and relatives. And after Krishna had set out for\r\nDwaraka, Yudhishthira and his followers, with king Virata, began to make\r\npreparations for war. And Virata and his relatives sent word to all the\r\nmonarchs, and king Drupada also did the same. And at the request of those\r\nlions of the Kuru race, as also of the two kings of the Matsyas and the\r\nPanchalas, many lords of the earth possessed of great strength, came to\r\nthe place with cheerful hearts. And when the sons of Dhritarashtra heard\r\nthat the Pandavas had collected a large army, they also assembled many\r\nrulers of the earth. And, O king, at that time the whole land became\r\nthronged with the rulers of the earth who were marching to espouse the\r\ncause of either the Kurus or the Pandavas. And the land was full of\r\nmilitary bands composed of four kinds of forces. And from all sides the\r\nforces began to pour in. And the goddess Earth with her mountains and\r\nforests seemed to tremble beneath their tread.

Of men the twice-born are\r\nsuperior. Of the twice-born, students of the Veda are superior. Of\r\nstudents of the Veda those of cultured understanding are superior. Of\r\ncultured men practical persons are superior. And finally, of practical\r\nmen those knowing the Supreme Being are superior. You, it seems to me,\r\nare at the very top of those that are of cultured understanding. You are\r\ndistinguished both for age and learning. You are equal in intellect to\r\neither Sukra or Vrihaspati, the son of Angiras. You know what kind of man\r\nthe chief of the Kuru race is, and what kind of man also is Yudhishthira,\r\nthe son of Kunti. It was with Dhritarashtra's knowledge that the Pandavas\r\nwere-deceived by their opponents. Though instructed by Vidura he yet\r\nfollows his son! Sakuni advisedly challenged Yudhishthira to a gambling\r\nmatch although the latter was unskilled in gambling while the former was\r\nan adept in it. Unskilled in play, Yudhishthira was guileless and firm in\r\nfollowing the rules of the military order. Having thus cheated the\r\nvirtuous king Yudhishthira, they will, by no means, voluntarily yield up\r\nthe kingdom. If you speak words of righteousness unto Dhritarashtra, you\r\nwill certainly gain the hearts of his fighting men. Vidura also will make\r\nuse of those words of yours and will thus alienate the hearts of Bhishma,\r\nand Drona, and Kripa, and others. When the officers of state are\r\nalienated and fighting men are backward, the task of the enemy will be to\r\ngain back their hearts. In the meantime, the Pandavas will, with ease and\r\nwith their whole hearts, address themselves in preparing the army and in\r\ncollecting stores. And when the enemy's adherents are estranged, and\r\nwhile you are hanging about them, they will surely not be able to make\r\nadequate preparations for war. This course seems expedient in this wise.\r\nOn your meeting with Dhritarashtra it is possible that Dhritarashtra may\r\ndo what you say. And as you are virtuous, you must therefore act\r\nvirtuously towards them. And to the compassionate, you must descant upon\r\nthe various hardships that the Pandavas have endured. And you must\r\nestrange the hearts of the aged persons by discoursing upon the family\r\nusages which were followed by their forefathers. I do not entertain the\r\nslightest doubt in this matter. Nor need you be apprehensive of any\r\ndanger from them, for you are a Brahmana, versed in the Vedas; and you\r\nare going thither as an ambassador, and more specially, you are an aged\r\nman. Therefore, I ask you to set out without delay towards the Kauravas\r\nwith the object of promoting the interests of the Pandavas, timing your\r\ndeparture under the (astrological) combination called Pushya and at that\r\npart of the day called Jaya.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus instructed by the magnanimous Drupada, the\r\nvirtuous priest set out for Hastinapura (the city called after the\r\nelephant).

And having sent messengers to other places, the Kuru hero\r\nDhananjaya, that bull among men and son of Kunti, himself set out for\r\nDwaraka. And after Krishna and Valadeva, the descendants of Madhu, had\r\nboth departed for Dwaraka with all the Vrishnis, the Andhakas and the\r\nBhojas, by hundreds, the royal son of Dhritarashtra had, by sending\r\nsecret emissaries, furnished himself with information of all the doings\r\nof the Pandavas. And learning that Krishna was on his way, the prince\r\nwent to the city of Dwaraka by means of fine horses possessing the speed\r\nof the wind, and taking with him a small number of troops. And on that\r\nvery day the son of Kunti and Pandu, Dhananjaya, also speedily arrived at\r\nthe beautiful city of the Anarta land. And the two scions of the Kuru\r\nrace, those tigers among men, on arriving there saw that Krishna was\r\nasleep, and drew near him as he lay down. And as Krishna was sleeping,\r\nDuryodhana entered the room, and sat down on a fine seat at the head of\r\nthe bed. And after him entered that wearer of the diadem the magnanimous\r\nArjuna. And stood at the back of the bed, bowing and joining his hands.\r\nAnd when the descendant of Vrishni, Krishna awoke, he first cast his eyes\r\non Arjuna. And having asked them as to the safety of their journey, and\r\nhaving fitly bestowed his greetings upon them, the slayer of Madhu\r\nquestioned them as to the occasion of their visit. Then Duryodhana\r\naddressed Krishna, with a cheerful countenance, saying, It behoveth you\r\nto lend me your help in the impending war. Arjuna and myself are both\r\nequally your friends. And, O descendant of Madhu, you also bear the same\r\nrelationship to both of us. And today, O slayer of Madhu, I have been the\r\nfirst to come to you. Right-minded persons take up the cause of him who\r\ncomes first to them. This is how the ancients acted. And, O Krishna, you\r\nstand at the very top of all right-minded persons in the world, and are\r\nalways respected. I ask you to follow the rule of conduct observed by\r\nrightminded men.' Thereat Krishna replied, 'That you have come first, O\r\nking, I do not in the least doubt. But, O king, the son of Kunti,\r\nDhananjaya, has been first beheld by me. On account of your first\r\narrival, and on account of my having beheld Arjuna first, I shall, no\r\ndoubt, lend my assistance, O Suyodhana, to both. But it is said that\r\nthose who are junior in years should have the first choice. Therefore,\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Kunti, is entitled to first choice. There is a\r\nlarge body of cowherds numbering ten crores, rivalling me in strength and\r\nknown as the Narayanas, all of whom are able to fight in the thick of\r\nbattle. These soldiers, irresistible in battle, shall be sent to one of\r\nyou and I alone, resolved not to fight on the field, and laying down my\r\narms, will go to the other. You may, O son of Kunti, first select\r\nwhichever of these two commends itself to you. For, according to law, you\r\nhave the right to the first choice.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Krishna, Dhananjaya the son\r\nof Kunti selected Kesava who was not to fight on the battle-field, even\r\nNarayana himself, the slayer of foes, increate, born among men at his own\r\nwill,--the foremost of all Kshatriyas and above all the gods and the\r\nDanavas. And Duryodhana selected for himself that entire army (composed\r\nof the Narayanas). And, O descendant of Bharata, having obtained those\r\ntroops numbering thousands upon thousands, he was exceedingly delighted,\r\nalthough he knew that Krishna was not on his side. And having secured\r\nthat army possessed of terrible prowess, Duryodhana went to the son of\r\nRohini of great strength, and explained to him, the object of his visit.\r\nThe descendant of Sura in reply addressed the following words to\r\nDhritarashtra's son, 'Thou shouldst remember, O tiger among men, all that\r\nI said at the marriage ceremony celebrated by Vitrata. O thou delighter\r\nof the race of Kuru, for thy sake I then contradicted Krishna and spoke\r\nagainst his opinions. And again and again I alluded to the equality of\r\nour relationship to both the parties. But Krishna did not adopt the views\r\nI then expressed; nor can I separate myself from Krishna for even a\r\nsingle moment. And seeing that I cannot act against Krishna even this is\r\nresolution formed by me, viz., that I will fight neither for Kunti's sons\r\nnor for you. And, O bull of the Bharatas, born as thou art in Bharata's\r\nrace that is honoured by all the kings, go and fight in accordance with\r\nthe rules of propriety.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Duryodhana embraced that hero\r\nwielding a plough for his weapon of battle, and although knowing that\r\nKrishna had been taken away from his side, he yet regarded Arjuna as\r\nalready vanquished. And the royal son of Dhritarashtra then went to\r\nKritavarman. And Kritavarman gave him a body of troops numbering an\r\nAkshauhini. And surrounded by that military host, terrible to behold, the\r\nKaurava marched forth delighting his friends. And after Duryodhana had\r\ndeparted, Krishna, the Creator of the world, clad in yellow attire,\r\naddressed Kiritin, saying, 'For what reason is it that you have selected\r\nme who will not fight at all?'\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon Arjuna answered, 'I question not that you are able to slay\r\nthem all. I also am alone capable of slaying them, O best of men. But you\r\nare an illustrious person in the world; and this renown will accompany\r\nyou. I also am a suitor for fame; therefore, you have been selected by\r\nme. It hath been always my desire to have you for driving my car. I,\r\ntherefore, ask you to fulfil my desire cherished for a long time.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva's son thereupon said, It beseems thee well, O Kunti's son, that\r\nthou measurest thyself with me. I will act as thy charioteer; let thy\r\nwish be fulfilled.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then with a glad heart, Kunti's son,\r\naccompanied by Krishna as well as by the flower of the Dasarha race, came\r\nback to Yudhishthira.'"

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'O king, having learnt the news from the messengers,\r\nSalya, accompanied by a large body of troops and by his sons, all of whom\r\nwere mighty in battle, was coming to the Pandavas. His encampment covered\r\nan area of one and a half yojana, so large was the force owned by that\r\nbest of men. He was the master, O king, of an Akshauhini and had great\r\nprowess and valour. And there were in his army heroes bearing armour of\r\nvarious colours, with diverse kinds of banners and bows and ornaments and\r\ncars and animals, all wearing excellent garlands, and various robes and\r\nornaments. And hundreds and thousands of foremost of Kshatriyas were the\r\nleaders of his troops, dressed and decorated in the manner of their\r\nnative land. And he proceeded by slow marches, giving rest to his troops,\r\ntowards the place where the Pandava was. And the creatures of the earth\r\nfelt oppressed and the earth trembled under the tread of his troops. And\r\nking Duryodhana, hearing that magnanimous and mighty hero was on his way,\r\nhastened towards him and paid him honours, O best of the Bharata race and\r\ncaused finely decorated places of entertainment to be constructed at\r\ndifferent spots for his reception, on beautiful sites, and whither many\r\nartists were directed to entertain the guests. And those pavilions\r\ncontained garlands and meat and the choicest viands and drinks, and wells\r\nof various forms, capable of refreshing the heart, and tanks of various\r\nforms, and edibles, and roomy apartments. And arriving at those\r\npavilions, and waited upon like a very god by the servants of Duryodhana\r\nlocated at different spots, Salya reached another house of entertainment\r\nresplendent as a retreat of the celestials. And there, greeted with\r\nchoice creature-comforts fit for beings superior to man, he deemed\r\nhimself superior even to the lord himself of the gods and thought meanly\r\nof Indra as compared with himself. And that foremost of Kshatriyas,\r\nwell-pleased, asked the servants, saying, 'Where are those men of\r\nYudhishthira, who have prepared these places of refreshment? Let those\r\nmen who made these be brought to me. I deem them worthy of being rewarded\r\nby me. I must reward them, let it so please the son of Kunti!' The\r\nservants, surprised, submitted the whole matter to Duryodhana. And when\r\nSalya was exceedingly pleased and ready to grant even his life,\r\nDuryodhana, who had remained concealed, came forward and showed himself\r\nto his maternal uncle. And the kind of the Madras saw him and understood\r\nthat it was Duryodhana who had taken all the trouble to receive him. And\r\nSalya embraced Duryodhana and said, 'Accept something that you may\r\ndesire.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana thereupon said, 'O thou auspicious one, let thy word be true,\r\ngrant me a boon. I ask thee to be the leader of all my army.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'And hearing this, Salya said, 'Be it so! What\r\nelse is to be done?' And the son of Gandhari repeated again and again,\r\n'It is done.' And Salya said, 'O Duryodhana, O best of men, go to thy own\r\ncity. I shall proceed to pay a visit to Yudhishthira, the subduer of\r\nfoes. O king, I shall speedily come back, O ruler of men. That best of\r\nmen, Pandu's son Yudhishthira, must, by all means, be visited by me.' And\r\nbearing this Duryodhana said, 'O king, O ruler of the earth, having seen\r\nthe Pandava, come speedily back. I depend entirely upon thee, O king of\r\nkings. Remember the boon that thou hast granted me.' And Salya answered,\r\n'Good betide thee! I shall come speedily back. Repair to thy own city, O\r\nprotector of men.' And then those two kings Salya and Duryodhana embraced\r\neach other. And having thus greeted Salya, Duryodhana came back to his\r\nown city. And Salya went to inform the sons of Kunti of that proceeding\r\nof his. And having reached Upaplavya, and entered the encampment, Salya\r\nsaw there all the sons of Panda. And the mighty-armed Salya having met\r\nthe sons of Panda, accepted as usual water for washing his feet, and the\r\ncustomary gifts of honour including a cow. And the king of the Madras,\r\nthat slayer of foes, first asked them how they were, and then with great\r\ndelight embraced Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Arjuna, and the sons of his\r\nsister the two twin-brothers. And when all had sat down, Salya spoke to\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, saying, 'O tiger among kings, O thou\r\ndelighter of the race of Kuru, is it all well with thee? O best of\r\nvictors, how fortunately hast thou spent the term of thy residence in the\r\nwilderness, O king, O lord of monarchs, it was an exceedingly hard task\r\nthat thou hast performed by dwelling in the wilderness together with thy\r\nbrothers and this noble lady here. And awfully difficult task again was\r\nthat sojourn of thine,--the period of concealment,--which task also thou\r\nhast performed, O descendant of Bharata; for one pulled down from a\r\nthrone it is nothing but hardship that awaits him. O king, where is there\r\nany happiness for him! O afflicter of thy foes, in compensation for all\r\nthis vast misery wrought by Dhritarashtra's son, thou wilt attain to\r\nproportional happiness after having killed thy foes, O great king, O lord\r\nof men, the ways of the world are known to thee. Therefore, O my son,\r\nthou art never guided by avarice in any of thy dealings. O descendant of\r\nBharata, do thou treat on the foot-prints of ancient saintly kings. My\r\nson, Yudhishthira, be steady in the path of liberality, and\r\nself-abnegation, and truth. And, O royal Yudhishthira, mercy and self\r\ncontrol, and truth and universal sympathy, and everything wonderful in\r\nthis world, are to be found in thee. Thou art mild, munificent,\r\nreligious, and liberal, and thou regardest virtue as the highest good. O\r\nking, many are the rules of virtue that prevail amongst men, and all\r\nthose are known to thee. O my son, O afflicter of foes, thou knowest in\r\nfact everything relating to this world. O king, O best of Bharata's race,\r\nhow lucky it is that thou hast come out of this difficulty of thine. How\r\nlucky, O king, O foremost of monarchs, O lord, it is that I see thee, so\r\nvirtuous a soul, a treasure-house of righteousness, freed with thy\r\nfollowers from this.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O descendant of Bharata, the king spoke\r\nof his meeting with Duryodhana and gave a detailed account regarding that\r\npromise of his and that boon granted by himself. And Yudhishthira said, O\r\nvaliant king, it has been well-done by thee that being pleased at heart\r\nthou hast plighted thy truth to Duryodhana. But good betide thee, O ruler\r\nof the earth, I ask thee to do one thing only. O king, O best of men,\r\nthou wilt have to do it solely for my sake, though it may not be proper\r\nto be done. O valiant one, hear what I submit to thee. O great king, thou\r\nart equal to Krishna on the field of battle. When, O best of kings, the\r\nsingle combat between Karna and Arjuna will take place, I have no doubt\r\nthou wilt have to drive Karna's car. On that occasion, if thou art\r\ninclined to do good to me, thou must protect Arjuna. O king, thou must\r\nlikewise so act that the Suta's son Karna may be dispirited and the\r\nvictory may be ours. Improper it no doubt is; but, O my uncle, for all\r\nthat thou must do it. Salya said, 'Good betide thee. Listen, O son of\r\nPanda. Thou tellest me to so act that the vile son of the Suta may be\r\ndispirited in fight. To be sure, I shall be his charioteer' on the field,\r\nfor he always considers me equal to Krishna. O tiger like descendant of\r\nKuru, I shall certainly speak to him, when desirous of fighting on the\r\nfield of battle, words contradictory and fraught with harm to him, so\r\nthat bereft of pride and valour, he may be easily slain by his\r\nantagonist. This I tell thee truly. Asked by thee to do it, this I am\r\ndetermined to do, O my son. Whatever else I may be able to bring about, I\r\nshall do for thy good. Whatever troubles were suffered by thee together\r\nwith Draupadi on the occasion of the game at dice, the rude inhuman words\r\nuttered by the Suta's son, the misery inflicted by the Asura Jata and by\r\nKichaka, O illustrious one, all the miseries experienced by Draupadi,\r\nlike those formerly experienced by Damayanti,--will all, O hero, end in\r\njoy. Thou shouldst not be aggrieved at this; for Destiny is all powerful\r\nin this world; and, O Yudhishthira, high-minded persons have to endure\r\nmiseries of various kinds, nay, even the gods themselves, O king, have\r\nsuffered misfortunes. O king, O descendant of Bharata, it is narrated\r\nthat the high-minded Indra, the chief of the celestials, had to endure\r\ntogether with his wife very great misery, indeed.'"

      "content": "\"Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost of monarchs, I wish to know how it was\r\nthat great and unparalleled misery had to be endured by the illustrious\r\nIndra together with his queen.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya said, 'Listen, O king, to me as I relate this ancient story of the\r\nevents of former days,--how, O descendant of Bharata, misery befell Indra\r\nand his wife. Once Twashtri, the lord of creatures and the foremost of\r\ncelestials, was engaged in practising rigid austerities. And it is said\r\nthat from antipathy to Indra he created a son having three heads. And\r\nthat being of universal form possessed of great lustre hankered after\r\nIndra's seat. And possessed of those three awful faces resembling the\r\nsun, the moon, and the fire, he read the Vedas with one mouth, drank wine\r\nwith another, and looked with the third as if he would absorb all the\r\ncardinal points. And given to the practice of austerities, and mild being\r\nand self-controlled, he was intent upon a life of religious practices and\r\nausterities. And his practice of austerities, O subduer of foes, was\r\nrigid and terrible and of an exceedingly severe character. And beholding\r\nthe austerities, courage, and truthfulness of this one possessed of\r\nimmeasurable energy, Indra became anxious, fearing lest that being should\r\ntake his place. And Indra reflected, 'How may he be made to addict\r\nhimself to sensual enjoyments; how may he be made to cease his practice\r\nof such rigid austerities? For were the three-headed being to wax strong,\r\nhe would absorb the whole universe.' And it was thus that Indra pondered\r\nin his mind; and, O best of Bharata's race, endued with intelligence, he\r\nordered the celestial nymphs to tempt the son of Twashtri. And he\r\ncommanded them, saying, 'Be quick, and go without delay, and so tempt him\r\nthat the three-headed being may plunge himself into sensual enjoyment to\r\nthe utmost extent. Furnished with captivating hips, array yourselves in\r\nvoluptuous attires, and decking yourselves in charming necklaces, do ye\r\ndisplay gestures and blandishments of love. Endued with loveliness, do ye\r\ntempt him and alleviate my dread. I feel restless in my heart, O lovely\r\ndamsels. Avert ye, ladies, this awful peril that hangs over me. Good\r\nbetide you.'\r\n\r\n\"Then the nymphs said, 'O Indra, O slayer of Vala, we shall so endeavour\r\nto allure him that thou wilt have nothing to fear at his hands. That very\r\nreceptacle of austerities, sitting now as if scorching everything with\r\nhis eyes, O god, we are going together to tempt. We shall try to bring\r\nhim under our control, and to put an end to your fears.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'Commanded by Indra, they then went to the three-headed\r\nbeing. And arriving there, those lovely damsels tempted him with various\r\ngestures of love, displaying their fine figures. But engaged in the\r\npractice of exceedingly severe austerities, although he looked at them,\r\nyet he was not influenced by desire. Of subdued senses he was like the\r\nocean, full to the brim, in gravity. And the nymphs after having tried\r\ntheir best, came back to Indra. And they all with joined hands spoke to\r\nthe lord of the celestials, saying, 'O, that unapproachable being is\r\nincapable of being disturbed by us. O highly gifted being, thou mayst do\r\nwhat now may seem proper to thee.' The high-minded Indra honoured the\r\nnymphs and then dismissed them reflecting, O Yudhishthira, solely upon\r\nother means of destroying his foe. And endued with intelligence, he fixed\r\nupon a contrivance for destroying the three-headed being. And he said,\r\n'Let me today hurt my thunderbolt at him. By this means he will speedily\r\nbe killed. Even a strong person should not overlook a rising foe,\r\ncontemptible though he may be.' And thus reflecting upon the lessons\r\ninculcated in treatises of learning, he was firmly resolved upon slaying\r\nthat being. Then Indra, enraged, hurled at the three-headed being his\r\nthunderbolt which looked like fire and was terrible to behold, and which\r\ninspired dread. And forcibly struck by that thunderbolt, he was slain and\r\nfell down, as falls on the earth the loosened summit of a hill. And\r\nbeholding him slain by the thunderbolt, and lying down huge as a hill,\r\nthe chief of the celestials found no peace, and felt as if scorched by\r\nthe effulgent appearance of the dead; for though slain, he had a blazing\r\nand effulgent appearance and looked like one alive. And, strange to say,\r\nthough lifeless, his heads seemed to be alive as they were beheld lying\r\nlow on the field. And exceedingly afraid of that lustre, Indra remained\r\nplunged in thought. And at that time, O great king, bearing an axe on his\r\nshoulder, a carpenter came to the forest and approached the spot where\r\nlay that being. And Indra, the lord of Sachi, who was afraid, saw the\r\ncarpenter come there by chance. And the chastiser of Paka said unto him\r\nimmediately, 'Do this my behest. Quickly cut off this one's heads.' The\r\ncarpenter thereupon said, 'His shoulders are broad: this axe will not be\r\nable to cut them off. Nor shall I be able to do what is condemned by\r\nrighteous persons.' And Indra said, 'Do not fear, quickly do what I say.\r\nAt my command thy axe shall equal the thunderbolt.' The carpenter said,\r\n'Whom am I to take thee to be who hast done this frightful deed today?\r\nThis I wish to learn, tell me the exact truth.' And Indra said, 'O\r\ncarpenter, I am Indra, the chief of the gods. Let this be known to thee.\r\nDo thou act just as I have told thee. Do not hesitate, O carpenter! The\r\ncarpenter said, 'O Indra, how is it that thou art not ashamed of this thy\r\ninhuman act? How it is that thou hast no dread of the sin of slaying a\r\nBrahmana, after having slain this son of a saint?' Indra said, 'I shall\r\nafterwards perform some religious ceremony of a rigorous kind to purify\r\nmyself from this taint. This was a powerful enemy of mine whom I have\r\nkilled with my thunderbolt. Even now I am uneasy, O carpenter; I, indeed,\r\ndread him even now. Do thou quickly cut off his heads, I shall bestow my\r\nfavour upon thee. In sacrifices, men will give thee the head of the\r\nsacrificial beast as thy share. This is the favour I confer on thee. Do\r\nthou quickly perform what I desire.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya said, 'Hearing this, the carpenter, at the request of the great\r\nIndra, immediately severed the heads of the three-headed one with his\r\naxe. And when the heads were cut off, out flew therefrom a number of\r\nbirds, viz., partridges, quails and sparrows. And from the mouth\r\nwherewith he used to recite the Vedas and to drink the Soma-juice, came\r\nout partridges in quick succession. And, O king, O son of Pandu, from the\r\nmouth with which he used to look at the cardinal points as if absorbing\r\nthem all, a number of quails came forth. And from that mouth of the\r\nthree-headed being which used to drink wine, out flew a number of\r\nsparrows and hawks. And the heads having been cut off Indra was freed\r\nfrom his trepidation, and went to heaven, glad at heart. And the\r\ncarpenter also went back to his house. And the slayer of Asuras, having\r\nkilled his foe, considered his object gained. Now when the lord of\r\ncreatures, Twashtri, heard that his son had been slain by Indra, his eyes\r\nbecame red with ire, and he spoke the following words, 'Since Indra hath\r\nkilled my son who had committed no offence at all, who was constantly\r\nengaged in the practice of austerities, who was merciful, possessed of\r\nself-control, and of subdued passions, therefore, for the destruction of\r\nIndra, I will create Vritra. Let the worlds behold what power I possess,\r\nand how mighty is the practice of austerities! Let that inhuman,\r\nwicked-minded lord of the gods also witness the same!' And saying this,\r\nthat enraged one, famous for his austerities, washed his mouth with\r\nwater, made offerings on the fire, created the terrible Vritra, and spoke\r\nto him, saying, 'O destined slayer of Indra, grow in might even from the\r\nstrength of my austere rites.' And that Asura grew in might, towering\r\ntowards the firmament, and resembling the son of fire. And he asked,\r\n'Risen like the doomsday sun, what am I to do?' 'Kill Indra,' was the\r\nreply. And then he departed towards the celestial regions. And next\r\nensued a great fight between Vritra and Indra, both fired with wrath. And\r\nthere took place a terrible combat, O best of Kuru's race. And the heroic\r\nVritra seized the celestial lord who had performed a hundred sacrifices.\r\nAnd filled with wrath, he whirled Indra and threw him into his mouth. And\r\nwhen Indra was swallowed up by Vritra, the terrified senior gods,\r\npossessed of great might, created Jrimbhika to kill Vritra. And as Vritra\r\nyawned and his mouth opened the slayer of the Asura, Vala contracted the\r\ndifferent parts of his body, and came out from within Vritra's mouth. And\r\nthenceforth the yawn attaches itself to the living breath of animated\r\nbeings in three worlds. And the gods rejoiced at the egress of Indra. And\r\nonce again commenced the terrible fight between Vritra and Indra, both\r\nfull of ire. And it was waged for a long while, O best of Bharata's race.\r\nAnd when Vritra, inspired with the mighty spirit of Twashtri and himself\r\nendowed with strength, got the upper hand in fight, Indra turned back And\r\non his retreat, the gods became exceedingly distressed. And all of them\r\ntogether with Indra were overpowered by the might of Twashtri. And they\r\nall consulted with the saints, O descendant of Bharata. And they\r\ndeliberated as to what was proper to be done, and were overwhelmed with\r\ndread. And seated on the top of the Mandara mountain, and bent on killing\r\nVritra, they only bethought themselves of Vishnu, the indestructible one.'"

I was capable of yore, but now I am incapable. What good\r\nbetide you, can I do? I believe him to be unapproachable. Powerful and\r\nmagnanimous, possessing immeasurable strength in fight, he would be able\r\nto swallow up all the three worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and the\r\nmen. Therefore, hear ye dwellers of heaven, this is my resolution.\r\nProceeding to the abode of Vishnu, in company with that high-souled Being\r\nmust we consult, and ascertain the means of slaying this ruthless wretch.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'Indra having thus spoken, the gods with that host of\r\nRishis repaired to the mighty god Vishnu to place themselves under\r\nthe-protection of that protector of all. And afflicted with the dread of\r\nVritra, they said unto the Supreme Lord of the deities. Thou hadst in\r\nformer times covered the three worlds with three steps. Thou hadst\r\nprocured the ambrosial food, O Vishnu, and destroyed the Asuras in\r\nbattle. Thou didst bind the great Asura Vali and hadst raised Indra to\r\nthe throne of heaven. Thou art the lord of the gods, and this entire\r\nuniverse is pervaded by thee. Thou art the God, the mighty Deity, saluted\r\nby all persons. Be thou the refuge of all the celestials together with\r\nIndra, O best of gods. The whole universe, O slayer of Asuras, hath been\r\npervaded by Vritra. And Vishnu said, 'I am no doubt bound to do what is\r\nfor your good. I shall, therefore, tell you of a contrivance whereby he\r\nmay be annihilated. Do ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas repair to\r\nthe place where Vritra that bearer of a universal form is and adopt\r\ntowards him a conciliatory policy. You will thus succeed in overthrowing\r\nhim. By virtue of my power, victory, ye gods, will be won by Indra, for,\r\nremaining invisible, I shall enter into his thunderbolt, that best of\r\nweapons. O foremost of gods, depart ye with the Rishis and the\r\nGandharvas. Let there be no delay in effecting a peace between Indra and\r\nVritra.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'When he had thus spoken, the Rishis and the celestials\r\nplaced Indra at their head, and uniting together, went away. Approaching\r\nIndra they behold Vritra glowing and resplendent as if scorching the ten\r\npoints, and swallowing all the three worlds, and resembling the sun or\r\nthe moon. And then the Rishis, came up to Vritra and spoke to him in\r\nconciliatory terms, saying, 'O thou unconquerable being, the whole of\r\nthis universe hath been pervaded by thy energy. Thou art not able however\r\nto overpower Indra, O best of mighty beings. A long period hath now\r\nelapsed since you began to fight. All beings, with the gods and the\r\nAsuras and men, are suffering from the effects of the fight. Let there be\r\neternal friendship between thee and Indra. Thou shalt be happy and shall\r\ndwell eternally in Indra's regions.' And the mighty Vritra having heard\r\nthe words of the saints, bowed his head unto them. And the Asura (thus)\r\nspoke, 'What you, O highly-gifted beings, and also all these Gandharvas\r\nare saying, I have heard. Ye stainless beings, hear also what I have got\r\nto say. How can there be peace between us two, Indra and myself? How can\r\nthere be friendship, ye gods, between two hostile powers?' The Rishis\r\nsaid, 'Friendship among righteous persons happens at a single meeting. It\r\nis a desirable object. Thereafter will happen what is fated to be. The\r\nopportunity of forming friendship with a righteous person should not be\r\nsacrificed. Therefore, the friendship of the righteous should be sought.\r\nThe friendship of the righteous is (like) excellent wealth, for he that\r\nis wise would give advice when it is needed. The friendship of a good\r\nperson is of great use; therefore, a wise person should not desire to\r\nkill a righteous one. Indra is honoured by the righteous, and is the\r\nrefuge of magnanimous persons, being veracious and unblamable, and knows\r\nwhat virtue is, and is possessed of a refined judgment. Let there be\r\neternal friendship between thee and Indra, as described above. In this\r\nway, have faith (in him); let not thy heart be differently inclined.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya said, 'Hearing these words of the great Rishis, the illustrious\r\nAsura spoke to them, 'No doubt, the Rishis, endued with supernatural\r\npowers, are to be respected by me. Let what I am going to say, ye gods,\r\nbe performed in its entirety; then I shall do everything that (these)\r\nbest of Brahmanas have said to me. Ye lords of the Brahmana race, ordain\r\nso that Indra himself or the gods do not kill me by what is dry, or wet;\r\nby stone, or by wood; by a weapon fit for close fight, or by a missile;\r\nin the day time, or at night. On those terms eternal peace with Indra\r\nwould be acceptable to me,--Very good! was what the Rishis told him, O\r\nbest of Bharata race.' Thus peace having been concluded, Vritra was very\r\nmuch pleased. And Indra also became pleased though constantly occupied\r\nwith the thought of killing Vritra. And the chief of the deities passed\r\nhis time in search of a loophole, uneasy (in mind). And on a certain day\r\nwhen it was evening and the hour awful, Indra caught sight of the mighty\r\nAsura on the coast of the sea. And he bethought himself of the boon that\r\nwas granted to the illustrious Asura, saying, 'This is the awful evening\r\ntime; it is neither day, nor night; and this Vritra, my enemy, who hath\r\nstripped me of my all, must undoubtedly be killed by me. It I do not kill\r\nVritra, this great and mighty Asura of gigantic frame, even by deceit, it\r\nwill not go well with me.' And as Indra thought of all this, bearing\r\nVishnu in mind he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth as\r\nlarge as a hill. And he said, 'This is neither dry, nor wet, nor is it a\r\nweapon; let me hurl it at Vritra. Without doubt, he will die\r\nimmediately.' And he threw at Vritra that mass of froth blended with the\r\nthunderbolt. And Vishnu, having entered within that froth, put an end to\r\nthe life of Vritra. And when Vritra was killed, the cardinal points were\r\nfree from gloom; and there also blew a pleasant breeze; and all beings\r\nwere much pleased. And the deities with the Gandharvas and Yakshas and\r\nRakshasas, with the great snakes and saints, glorified the mighty Indra\r\nwith various laudatory hymns. And saluted by all beings, Indra spoke\r\nwords of encouragement to all. And his heart was glad as also that of\r\neveryone of the gods for having killed the foe. And knowing the nature of\r\nvirtue, he worshipped Vishnu, the most praiseworthy of all objects in the\r\nworld. Now when the mighty Vritra, terrible to the gods, was killed,\r\nIndra became overpowered by falsehood, and he became exceedingly sad; and\r\nhe was also overpowered by the sin of Brahmanicide on account of having\r\nkilled the three-headed son of Twashtri. And he betook himself to the\r\nconfines of the worlds, and became bereft of his senses and\r\nconsciousness. And overpowered by his own sins, he could not be\r\nrecognised. And he lay concealed in water, just like a writhing snake.\r\nAnd when the lord of celestials, oppressed with the dread of\r\nBrahmanicide, had vanished from sight, the earth looked as if a havoc had\r\npassed over it. And it became treeless, and its woods withered; and the\r\ncourse of rivers was interrupted; and the reservoirs lost all their\r\nwater; and there was distress among animals on account of cessation of\r\nrains. And the deities and all the great Rishis were in exceeding fear;\r\nand the world had no king, and was overtaken by disasters. Then the\r\ndeities and the divine saints in heaven, separated from the chief of the\r\ngods, became terrified, and wondered who was to be their king. And nobody\r\nhad any inclination to act as the king of the gods.'"

He is powerful and\r\nrenowned, and devoted to virtue ever more.' And they all went and said to\r\nhim, 'O lord of the earth, be thou our king.' And Nahusha intent on his\r\nwelfare, spoke to those gods and saints accompanied by the progenitors\r\n(of mankind), 'I am feeble; I am not capable of protecting you; it is a\r\npowerful person who should be your king; it is Indra who hath always been\r\npossessed of strength.' And all the gods, led by the saints, spoke again\r\nto him, 'Aided by the virtue of our austerities, rule thou the kingdom of\r\nheaven. There is no doubt that we have all our respective fears. Be\r\ncrowned, O lord of monarchs, as the king of heaven. Whatever being may\r\nstand within thy sight, whether he be a god, an Asura, a Yaksha, a saint,\r\na Pitri, or a Gandharva, thou shalt absorb his power and (thereby) wax\r\nstrong. Always placing virtue before (all other things), be thou the\r\nruler of the worlds. Protect also the Brahmarsis (Brahmana saints) and\r\nthe gods in heaven.' Then, O lord of monarchs, Nahusha was crowned king\r\nin heaven. And placing virtue before (everything else), he became the\r\nruler of all the worlds. And though always of a virtuous disposition, yet\r\nwhen he obtained that precious boon and the kingdom of heaven, Nahusha\r\nassumed a sensual turn of mind. And when Nahusha became the king of the\r\ngods, he surrounded himself with celestial nymphs, and with damsels of\r\ncelestial birth, and took to enjoyments of various kinds, in the Nandana\r\ngroves, on mount Kailasa, on the crest of Himavat, on Mandara. the White\r\nhill Sahya, Mahendra and Malaya, as, also upon seas and rivers. And he\r\nlistened to various divine narratives that captivated both the ear and\r\nthe heart, and to the play of musical instruments of different sorts, and\r\nto sweet vocal strains. And Viswavasu and Narada and bevies of celestial\r\nnymphs and bands of Gandharvas and the six seasons in living shapes,\r\nattended upon the king of the gods. And fragrant breezes, refreshingly\r\ncool, blew round him. And while that wretch was thus enjoying himself, on\r\none occasion the goddess who was the favourite queen of Indra came in his\r\nsight. And that vicious soul, having looked at her, said to the\r\ncourtiers, 'Why doth not this goddess, the queen of Indra, attend upon\r\nme? I am the monarch of the gods, and also the ruler of the worlds. Let\r\nSachi make haste and visit me at my house.' Saddened at hearing this, the\r\ngoddess said to Vrihaspati, 'Protect me, O Brahmana, from this Nahusha. I\r\ncome to you as my refuge. You always say, O Brahmana, that I have got on\r\nmy person all the auspicious marks, being the favourite of the divine\r\nking; that I am chaste, devoted to my lord, and destined never to become\r\na widow. All this about me you have said before. Let your words be made\r\ntrue. O possessor of great powers, O lord, you never spoke words that\r\nwere vain. Therefore, O best of Brahmanas, this that you have said ought\r\nto be true.' Then Vrihaspati said to the queen of Indra who was beside\r\nherself through fear, 'What thou hast been told by me will come to be\r\ntrue, be sure, O goddess. Thou shalt see Indra, the lord of the gods, who\r\nwill soon come back here. I tell thee truly, thou hast no fear from\r\nNahusha; I shall soon unite thee with Indra.' Now Nahusha came to hear\r\nthat Indra's queen had taken refuge with Vrihaspati, the son of Angiras.\r\nAnd at this, the king became highly enraged.'"

And the king spoke to the gods, in allusion to Indra, 'Ahalya of\r\nspotless fame, the wife of a saint, was outraged by Indra while her\r\nhusband was alive. Why did ye not prevent him? Many were the deeds of\r\ninhumanity, of unrighteousness, of deceit, committed by Indra in former\r\ntimes. Why did ye not prevent him?

And\r\nthey said, 'We know, O foremost of Brahmanas, that the queen of Indra\r\nhath betaken herself to thy house, for protection, and that thou hast\r\npromised her protection, O best of divine saints! But we, the gods and\r\nGandharvas and saints, beseech thee, O thou of great lustre, to give up\r\nthe queen of Indra to Nahusha. Nahusha, the king of gods, of great\r\neffulgence, is superior to Indra. Let her, that lady of choice figure and\r\ncomplexion, choose him as her lord!'

Go your ways, ye best of gods.\r\nHear what hath formerly been sung by Brahma with regard to the matter at\r\nhand. He that delivereth up to a foe of a person terrified and asking for\r\nprotection obtaineth no protection when he himself is in need of it. His\r\nseed doth not grow at seed-time and rain doth not come to him in the\r\nseason of rains. He that delivereth up to a foe a person terrified and\r\nasking for protection never succeedeth in anything that he undertaketh;\r\nsenseless as he is, he droppeth paralysed from heaven; the god refuse\r\nofferings made by him. His progeny die an untimely death and his\r\nforefathers always quarrel (among themselves). The gods with Indra and\r\ntheir head dart the thunderbolt at him. Know it to be so, I shall not\r\ndeliver up this Sachi here, the queen of Indra, famous in the world as\r\nhis favourite consort. O ye best of gods, what may be for both her good\r\nand mine I ask you to do. Sachi I shall never deliver up!'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'Then the gods and the Gandharvas said these words to\r\nthe preceptor of the gods, 'O Vrihaspati, deliberate upon something that\r\nmay be conformable to sound policy!' Vrihaspati said, 'Let this goddess\r\nof auspicious looks ask for time from Nahusha in order to make up her\r\nmind to his proposal. This will be for the good of Indra's queen, and of\r\nus as well. Time, ye gods, may give rise to many impediments. Time will\r\nsend time onward. Nahusha is proud and powerful by virtue of the boon\r\ngranted to him!'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'Vrihaspati having spoken so, the gods, delighted then\r\nsaid, 'Well hast thou said, O Brahmana. This is for the good of all the\r\ngods. It is no doubt so. Only, let this goddess be propitiated.' Then the\r\nassembled gods led by Agni, with a view to the welfare of all the worlds,\r\nspoke to Indra's queen in a quiet way. And the gods said, 'Thou art\r\nsupporting the whole universe of things mobile and immobile. Thou art\r\nchaste and true: go thou to Nahusha. That vicious being, lustful after\r\nthee, will shortly fall: and Indra, O goddess, will get the sovereignty\r\nof the gods!' Ascertaining this to be the result of that deliberation,\r\nIndra's queen, for attaining her end, went bashfully to Nahusha of awful\r\nmien. The vicious Nahusha also, rendered senseless by lust, saw how\r\nyouthful and lovely she was, and became highly pleased.'"

She bowed her head to Brahma, and\r\njoining her hands spoke to Nahusha, the king of the gods, of awful mien,\r\nsaid, 'O lord of the deities, I desire to obtain time. It is not known\r\nwhat hath become of Indra, or where he is. Having enquired into the truth\r\nregarding him, if, O lord, I obtain no news of him, then I shall visit\r\nthee; this tell I thee for truth.' Thus addressed by Indra's queen,\r\nNahusha was pleased.

I hope thou wilt remember thy plighted truth.'\r\nDismissed by Nahusha, she of auspicious looks stepped out; and that\r\nfamous lady went to the abode of Vrihaspati. And, O best of kings, the\r\ngods with Agni at their head, when they heard her words, deliberated,\r\nintent upon what would promote the interests of Indra. And they then\r\njoined the powerful Vishnu, the God of gods. And skilled in making\r\nspeeches, the uneasy gods spoke the following words to him, 'Indra, the\r\nlord of all the gods, hath been overpowered by the sin of Brahmanicide.\r\nThou, O lord of the gods, art the first-born, the ruler of the universe,\r\nand our refuge. Thou hadst assumed the form of Vishnu for the protection\r\nof all beings. When Vritra was killed through thy energy, Indra was\r\noverwhelmed by the sin of Brahmanicide. O best of all the gods, prescribe\r\nthe means of setting him free.' Having heard these words of the gods,\r\nVishnu said, 'Let Indra. offer sacrifice to me. Even I shall purify the\r\nholder of the thunderbolt. The chastiser of Paka, having performed the\r\nholy horse-sacrifice, will fearlessly regain his dignity as lord of the\r\ngods. And the wicked-minded Nahusha will be led to destruction by his\r\nevil deeds. For a certain period, ye gods, ye must be patient, being\r\nvigilant at the same time.' Having heard these words of Vishnu, words\r\nthat were true, and pleasant like ambrosia to their ears, the gods, with\r\ntheir preceptor, and with the Rishis proceeded to that spot where Indra\r\nwas uneasy with fear. And there, O king, was performed a great\r\nhorse-sacrifice, capable of removing the sin of Brahmanicide, for the\r\npurification of the high-minded and great Indra. And the lord of the\r\ngods,--O Yudhishthira, divided the sin of Brahmanicide among trees and\r\nrivers and mountains and the earth and women. And having distributed it\r\nthus among those beings and parted with it, Indra was free from fever.\r\nAnd rid of his sin, he came to himself. And at that place, the slayer of\r\nthe Asura Vala, quaked when he looked at Nahusha, before whom all\r\nanimated beings felt cowed, and who was unapproachable by virtue of the\r\nboon the Rishis had granted to him. And the divine husband of Sachi\r\nvanished from sight once again. And invisible to all beings, he wandered\r\nbiding his time. And Indra having disappeared, Sachi fell into grief. And\r\nexceedingly miserable, she bewailed, 'Alas! O Indra, if ever I have made\r\na gift, or made offering to the gods, or have propitiated my spiritual\r\nguides, if there is any truth in me, then I pray that my chastity may\r\nremain inviolate. I bow myself to this goddess Night,--holy, pure,\r\nrunning her course during this the northern journey of the sun,[1] let my\r\ndesire be fulfilled.' Saying this, she, in a purified condition of body\r\nand soul, worshipped the goddess Night. And in the name of her chastity\r\nand truth she had recourse to divination.[2] And she asked, 'Show me the\r\nplace where the king of the gods is. Let truth be verified by truth.'

And arrived there they said to\r\nthe great Indra, 'How lucky that the son of Twashtri hath been killed,\r\nand Vritra also! How lucky, O Indra, that we are beholding thee safe and\r\nsound, while all thy enemies have been killed!' Indra received all those\r\nguardians of the worlds, and with a glad heart greeted them in proper\r\nform with a view to requesting them in connection with Nahusha. And he\r\nsaid, 'Nahusha of terrible mien is the king of the gods; therein lend me\r\nyour assistance.' They replied, 'Nahusha is of awful mien; his sight is\r\npoison; we are afraid of him, O God. If thou overthrowest Nahusha, then\r\nwe shall be entitled to our shares of sacrificial offerings, O Indra.'\r\nIndra said, 'Let it be so. You and the ruler of the waters, and Yama, and\r\nKuvera shall this day be crowned along with me. Aided by all the gods,\r\nlet us overthrow the foe Nahusha of terrible gaze.' Then Agni also said\r\nto Indra, 'Give me a share in sacrificial offerings. I also shall lend\r\nyou my assistance.' Indra said to him, 'O Agni, thou also shalt get a\r\nshare in great sacrifices,--there will be a single share (in such) for\r\nboth Indra and Agni.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'Thus did the illustrious lord Indra, the chastiser of\r\nPaka, the giver of boons, bestow, after deliberation upon Kuvera the\r\nsovereignty over the Yakshas, and all the wealth of the world; upon Yama,\r\nthe sovereignty over the Pitris; and upon Varuna, that over the waters.'"

And Agastya honoured the lord of the gods and\r\nsaid, 'How fortunate that thou art flourishing after the destruction of\r\nthat being of universal form, as also that of Vritra.

The pure-spirited Brahmanas and celestial saints, while\r\ncarrying him, weary with toil, questioned that vicious one, O best of\r\nvictors, saying, 'O Indra, there are certain hymns in the Vedas, directed\r\nto be recited while sprinkling the cows. Are they authentic or not?\r\nNahusha, who had lost his senses by the operation of the Tamas, told them\r\nthat they were not authentic.' The saints then said, 'Thou art tending\r\ntowards unrighteousness; thou takest not to the righteous path. The\r\ngreatest saints have formerly said they are authentic, O Indra.' And\r\nincited by Untruth, he touched me on my head with his foot. At this, O\r\nlord of Sachi, he became divested of power and of good looks. Then, as he\r\nwas agitated and overpowered with fear, I spoke to him, 'Since thou hast\r\npronounced as spurious the unexceptionable hymns of the Veda which have\r\nbeen recited by Brahmarsis (Brahmana saints), and since thou hast touched\r\nmy head with thy foot, and since thou, O ignorant wretch, hast turned\r\nthese unapproachable saints, equal to Brahma, into animals for carrying\r\nthee, therefore, O wretch, be divested of thy lustre, and being hurled\r\nheadlong, fall thou from heaven, the effect of all thy good deeds being\r\nexhausted. For ten thousand years, thou shalt, in the form of an enormous\r\nsnake, roam over the earth. When that period is full, thou mayst come\r\nback to heaven. Thus hath that wretch been hurled from the throne of\r\nheaven, O repressor of foes.' How fortunate, O Indra, that we are\r\nflourishing now. That thorn of the Brahmanas hath been killed. O lord of\r\nSachi, repair thou to heaven, protect the worlds, subdue thy senses,\r\nsubdue thy foes, and be glorified by the great saints.'\r\n\r\n\"Salya continued, 'Then, O ruler of men, the gods, and the bands of great\r\nsaints were exceedingly pleased.

And the illustrious Agni, and the\r\ngreat saint Vrihaspati, and Yama, and Varuna, and Kuvera, the lord of\r\nriches, accompanied him. And the lord Sakra, the slayer of Vritra, then\r\nwent to the three worlds surrounded by the gods together with the\r\nGandharvas and the celestial nymphs. And the performer of a hundred\r\nsacrifices, the king of the deities, was thus united with his queen. And\r\nhe began to protect the worlds with exceeding gladness. Then the\r\nillustrious divine saint Angiras arrived in the assembly of Indra and\r\nworshipped him duly by reciting the hymns of the Atharva. And the great\r\nlord Indra became satisfied and granted a boon to the Atharvangiras. And\r\nIndra said, 'Thou wilt be known as a Rishi of the name Atharvangiras in\r\nthe Atharva Veda, and thou wilt also get a share in sacrifices.' And\r\nhaving honoured Atharvangiras thus, the great lord Indra, the performer\r\nof a hundred sacrifices, parted with him, O great king. And he honoured\r\nall the deities and all the saints endued with wealth of asceticism. And,\r\nO king, Indra, well-pleased, governed the people virtuously. Thus was\r\nmisery endured by Indra with his wife. And with the view of slaying his\r\nfoes, even he had to pass a period in concealment. Thou shouldst not take\r\nit to heart that thou, O king of kings, hast suffered with Draupadi as\r\nalso with thy high-minded brothers in the great forest. O king of kings,\r\nO descendant of Bharata, O delighter of Kuru's race, thou wilt get back\r\nthy kingdom in the same way as Indra got his, after having killed Vritra.\r\nThe vicious Nahusha, that enemy of Brahmanas, of evil mind, was\r\noverthrown by the curse of Agastya, and reduced to nothing for endless\r\nyears. Similarly, O slayer of foes, thy enemies, Karna and Duryodhana and\r\nothers of vicious souls will quickly be destroyed. Then, O hero, thou\r\nwilt enjoy the whole of this earth, as far as the sea, with thy brothers\r\nand this Draupadi. This story of the victory of Indra, equal to the Veda\r\nin its sacred character, should be listened to by a king desirous of\r\nvictory and when his forces have been arrayed in order of battle.\r\nTherefore, O best of victors, I am reciting it to thee for thy victory, O\r\nYudhishthira. High-souled persons attain prosperity when they are\r\nglorified. O Yudhishthira, the destruction of high-souled Kshatriyas is\r\nat hand by reason of the crimes of Duryodhana, and through the might also\r\nof Bhima and Arjuna. He who readeth this story of Indra's victory with a\r\nheart full of religious faith, is cleansed of his sins, attaineth a\r\nregion of bliss, and obtaineth joy both in this world and in the next. He\r\nhath no fear of his foes; he never becometh a sonless man, never\r\nencountereth any peril whatever, and enjoyeth long life.

And his soldiers of great valour come from various lands, bore\r\nvarious weapons of war, and heroic in look they beautified the Pandava\r\narmy. And that army looked splendid by reason of battleaxes, and missiles\r\nand spears, and lances, and mallets, and clubs, and staves, and cords,\r\nand stainless swords, and daggers, and arrows of various kinds, all of\r\nthe best temper. And the army, beautified by those weapons, and\r\nresembling in colour the cloudy sky, assumed an appearance like to amass\r\nof clouds with lightning-flashes in its midst. And the army counted an\r\nAkshauhini of troops. And when absorbed in the troops of Yudhishthira it\r\nentirely disappeared, as doth a small river when it enters the sea. And\r\nsimilarly, the powerful chief of the Chedis, Dhrishtaketu, accompanied by\r\nan Akshauhini, came to the sons of Pandu of immeasurable strength. And\r\nthe king of Magadha, Jayatsena of great strength, brought with him for\r\nYudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And similarly, Pandya, who dwelt on\r\nthe coast-land near the sea, came accompanied by troops of various kinds\r\nto Yudhishthira, the king of kings. And, O king, when all these troops\r\nhad assembled, his army, finely dressed and exceedingly strong, assumed\r\nan appearance pleasant to the eye. And the army of Drupada, also was\r\nbeautified by valiant soldiers who had come from various lands, and also\r\nby his mighty sons. And similarly, Virata, the king of the Matsyas, a\r\nleader of troops, accompanied by the king of the hilly regions, came to\r\nPandu's sons. And for the high-souled sons of Pandu there were thus\r\nassembled from various directions, seven Akshauhini of troops, bristling\r\nwith banners of various forms. And eager to fight with the Kurus, they\r\ngladdened the hearts of the Pandavas. And in the same way king\r\nBhagadatta, gladdening the heart of Dhritarashtra's son, gave an\r\nAkshauhini of troops to him. And the unassailable mass of his troops,\r\ncrowded with Chins and Kiratas, all looking like figures of gold, assumed\r\na beauty like to that of a forest of Karnikara trees. And so the valiant\r\nBhurisravas, and Salya, O son of Kuru, came to Duryodhana, with an\r\nAkshauhini of troops each. And Kritavarman, the son of Hridika,\r\naccompanied by the Bhojas, the Andhas, and the Kukuras, came to\r\nDuryodhana with an Akshauhini of troops. And the body of his troops\r\ncomposed of those mighty soldiers, who wore on their persons garlands of\r\nmany-coloured flowers, looked as graceful as a number of sportive\r\nelephants that have passed through a wood. And others led by Jayadratha,\r\nthe dwellers of the land of Sindhusauvira, came in such force that the\r\nhills seemed to tremble under their tread. And their force, counting an\r\nAkshauhini, looked like a mass of clouds moved by the wind. And\r\nSudakshina, the king of the Kambhojas, O ruler of men, accompanied by the\r\nYavanas and Sakas, came to the Kuru chief with an Akshauhini of troops.\r\nAnd the body of his troops that looked like a flight of locusts, meeting\r\nwith the Kuru force, was absorbed and disappeared in it. And similarly\r\ncame king Nila, the resident of the city of the Mahishmati, with mighty\r\nsoldiers from the southern country who carried weapons of pretty make.\r\nAnd the two kings of Avanti, accompanied by a mighty force, brought to\r\nDuryodhana, each a separate Akshauhini of troops. And those tigers among\r\nmen, the five royal brothers, the princes of Kekaya, hastened to\r\nDuryodhana with an Akshauhini of troops, and gladdened his heart. And\r\nfrom the illustrious king, of other quarters there came, O best of\r\nBharata's race, three large divisions of troops. And thus Duryodhana had\r\na force which numbered eleven Akshauhinis all eager to fight with the\r\nsons of Kunti, and bristling with banners of various forms. And, O\r\ndescendant of Bharata, there was no space in the city of Hastinapura even\r\nfor the principal leaders of Duryodhana's army. And for this reason the\r\nland of the five rivers, and the whole of the region called Kurujangala,\r\nand the forest of Rohitaka which was uniformly wild, and Ahichatra and\r\nKalakuta, and the banks of the Ganga, and Varana, and Vatadhana, and the\r\nhill tracts on the border of the Yamuna--the whole of this extensive\r\ntract--full of abundant corn and wealth, was entirely overspread with the\r\narmy of the Kauravas.

And he spoke the following words in\r\nthe midst of all the leaders of Duryodhana's army, 'The eternal duties of\r\nkings are known to you all. But though known, I shall yet recite them as\r\nan introduction to what I am going to say. Both Dhritarashtra and Pandu\r\nare known to be sons of the same father. There is no doubt that the share\r\nof each to the paternal wealth should be equal. The sons of Dhritarashtra\r\nobtained the paternal wealth. Why did not the sons of Pandu at all\r\nreceive their paternal portion? Ye are aware how formerly the sons of\r\nPandu did not receive their paternal property which was all usurped by\r\nDhritarashtra's sons. The latter endeavoured in various ways to remove\r\nthe sons of Pandu from their path by employment even of murderous\r\ncontrivances; but as their destined terms of life had not wholly run out,\r\nthe sons of Pandu could not be sent to the abode of Yama. Then again,\r\nwhen those high-souled princes had carved out a kingdom by their own\r\nstrength, the mean-minded sons of Dhritarashtra, aided by Suvala's son,\r\nrobbed them of it by deceit. This Dhritarashtra gave his sanction even to\r\nthat act as hath been usual with him. And for thirteen years they were\r\nthen sent to sojourn in the great wilderness. In the council-hall, they\r\nhad also been subjected to indignities of various kinds, along with their\r\nwife, valiant though they were. And great also were the sufferings that\r\nthey had to endure in the woods. Those virtuous princes had also to\r\nendure unspeakable woes in the city of Virata,--such as are endured only\r\nby vicious men when their souls transmigrate into the forms of inferior\r\nbeings, Ye best of Kuru's race, overlooking all these injuries of yore\r\nthey desire nothing but a peaceful settlement with the Kurus! Remembering\r\ntheir behaviour, and that of Duryodhana also, the latter's friends should\r\nentreat him to consent to peace! The heroic sons of Pandu are not eager\r\nfor war with the Kurus. They desire to get back their own share without\r\ninvolving the world in ruin. If Dhritarashtra's son assigns a reason in\r\nfavour of war, that can never be a proper reason. The sons of Pandu are\r\nmore powerful. Seven Akshauhinis of troops have been collected on behalf\r\nof Yudhishthira, all eager to fight with the Kurus, and they are now\r\nawaiting his word of command. Others there are tigers among men, equal in\r\nmight to a thousand Akshauhinis, such as Satyaki and Bhimasena, and the\r\ntwin brothers of mighty strength. It is true that these eleven divisions\r\nof troops are arrayed on one side, but these are balanced on the other by\r\nthe mighty-armed Dhananjaya of manifold form. And as Kiritin exceeds in\r\nstrength even all these troops together, so also doth Vasudeva's son of\r\ngreat effulgence and powerful intellect. Who is there that would fight,\r\nin view of the magnitude of the opposing force, the valour of Arjuna, and\r\nthe wisdom of Krishna? Therefore, I ask you to give back what should be\r\ngiven, as dictated by morality and compact. Do not let the opportunity\r\npass!'\""

How fortunate that those\r\nscions of Kuru's race desire peace with their cousins! There is no doubt\r\nthat what thou hast said is true. Thy words, however, are exceedingly\r\nsharp,--the reason, I suppose, being that thou art a Brahmana. No doubt,\r\nthe sons of Pandu were much harassed both here and in woods. No doubt, by\r\nlaw they are entitled to get all the property of their father. Arjuna,\r\nthe son of Pritha, is strong trained in weapons, and is a great\r\ncar-warrior.

What is the good of repeating them again and again? On behalf of\r\nDuryodhana, Sakuni formerly won in game of dice. Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nPandu went to the woods according to a stipulation. He is now paying no\r\nregard to that stipulation, but confident of aid from the Matsyas and\r\nPanchalas, he wisheth to get back his ancestral throne. O learned man,\r\nDuryodhana would not yield even a single foot of land if thou appealest\r\nto his fears, but if justice requires, he would give up the whole earth\r\neven to a foe. If they wish to get back their ancestral throne, they\r\nshould pass the specified period of time in the forest as had been\r\nstipulated. Afterwards let them live as the dependants of Duryodhana,\r\nsafe and sound. From dull-headedness, however, let them not turn their\r\nmind towards an absolutely unrighteous course.

Thou must greet Ajatasatru\r\nin the following words, 'By good luck it is that (emerged from the woods)\r\nthou hast reached such a city. And to all of them thou must say, O\r\nSanjaya, these words. Are ye well, having spent that harassing period of\r\nsojourn, ye who were unworthy of such harassment?' In no time will they\r\nbe appeased towards us, for though treated treacherously (by foes), yet\r\nthey are righteous and good. In no case, O Sanjaya, have I ever met with\r\nany untruthfulness on the part of the Pandavas. It was by their own\r\nvalour that they had won all their prosperity, and (yet) they were ever\r\ndutiful to me. Though I scrutinized their conduct, I could never find\r\nfault with them,--no, not even a single fault for which we might blame\r\nthem. They always act mindful of virtue and wealth; they never give way\r\nto love of sensual enjoyments, or cold, or hunger, or thirst; they subdue\r\nsteep and laziness and wrath and joy and heedlessness. The sons of\r\nPritha, mindful of both virtue and wealth, are ever pleasant to all. On\r\nproper occasions they part with their wealth to friends. Friendship with\r\nthem never loses its ardour on account of length of time; for they bestow\r\nhonours and wealth on every one according to his deserts. Not a soul in\r\nthe race of Ajamida ever entertains hatred for them excepting this vile,\r\ncapricious, dull-headed Duryodhana, and excepting also the still more\r\nmean-minded Karna. These two always enhance the energy of those\r\nhigh-souled ones who have been divested of both friends and happiness.\r\nEnterprising and brought up in every indulgence, Duryodhana reckons all\r\nthat to be well-done. It is childish on Duryodhana's part to think that\r\nit is possible to rob the Pandavas of their just share so long as they\r\nare alive. It is wise to yield to Yudhishthira his due share before the\r\nwar,--to him whose steps are followed by Arjuna and Krishna and Bhima and\r\nSatyaki and the two sons of Madri and the warriors of the Srinjaya race.\r\nThat wielder of the Gandiva, Savyasachin, seated on his car, would alone\r\nbe able to devastate the whole world. And likewise the victorious and\r\nhigh-souled Krishna, the lord of the three worlds, incapable of defeat is\r\nable to do the same. What mortal would stand before him who is the one\r\nworthiest person in all the worlds and who discharges his multitude of\r\narrows that roar like the clouds, covering all sides, like flights of\r\nswiftly-coursing locusts? Alone on his car, holding the Gandiva, he had\r\nconquered the northern regions as also the Kurus of the north and brought\r\naway with him all their wealth. He converted the people of the Dravida\r\nland to be a portion of his own army. It was Falguna, the wielder of the\r\nGandiva, who defeating in the Khandava woods all the gods together with\r\nIndra, made offerings to Agni, enhancing the honour and fame of the\r\nPandavas. Of all wielders again of the mace, there is none equal to\r\nBhima; and there is none also who is so skilful a rider of elephants. On\r\ncar, they say, he yields not to even Arjuna; and as to might of arms, he\r\nis equal to ten thousand elephants. Well-trained and active, he who hath\r\nagain been rendered bitterly hostile, would in anger consume the\r\nDhartarashtras in no time. Always wrathful, and strong of arms, he is not\r\ncapable of being subdued in battle by even Indra himself. Of great heart,\r\nand strong, and endued with great lightness of hand, the two (twin)\r\nbrothers, sons of Madri, carefully trained by Arjuna, would leave not a\r\nfoe alive, like to a pair of hawks preying upon large flocks of birds.\r\nThis our army, so full, to tell thee the truth, will be nowhere when it\r\nwill encounter them. In their side will be Dhrishtadyumna, endued with\r\ngreat activity,--one who is regarded as one of the Pandavas themselves.\r\nThe chief of the Somaka tribe, with his followers, is, I have heard, so\r\ndevoted to the cause of the Pandavas that he is ready to lay down his\r\nvery life for them. Who would be able to withstand Yudhishthira who hath\r\nthe best of the Vrishni tribe (Krishna) for his leader? I have heard that\r\nVirata, the chief of the Matsyas, with whom the Pandavas had lived for\r\nsome time and whose wishes were fulfilled by them, old in years, is\r\ndevoted, along with his sons to the Pandava cause, and hath become an\r\nadherent of Yudhishthira. Deposed from the throne of the Kekaya land, and\r\ndesirous of being reinstated thereon, the five mighty brothers from that\r\nland, wielding mighty bows, are now following the sons of Pritha ready to\r\nfight. All who are valiant among the lords of the earth have been brought\r\ntogether and are devoted to the Pandava cause. I hear that they are bold,\r\nworthy, and respectful,--they who have allied themselves to the virtuous\r\nking Yudhishthira from feelings of attachment to him. And many warriors\r\ndwelling on the hills and inaccessible fastnesses, and many that are high\r\nin lineage and old in years, and many Mlechcha tribes also wielding\r\nweapons of various kinds, have been assembled together and are devoted to\r\nthe cause of the Pandavas. And there hath come Pandya also, who, hardly\r\ninferior to Indra on the field of battle, is followed when he fights by\r\nnumberless warriors of great courage. Remarkably heroic and endued with\r\nprowess and energy that have no parallel, he is devoted to the Pandava\r\ncause. That same Satyaki who, I have heard, obtained weapons from Drona\r\nand Arjuna and Krishna and Kripa and Bhishma, and who is said to be equal\r\nto the son of Krishna, is devotedly attached to the Pandava cause. And\r\nthe assembled kings of the Chedi and the Karusha tribes have all taken\r\nthe part of the Pandavas with all their resources. That one in their\r\nmidst, who, having been endued with blazing beauty, shone like the sun,\r\nwhom all persons deemed unassailable in battle and the very best of all\r\ndrawers of the bow on earth, was slain by Krishna in a trice, by help of\r\nhis own great might, and counting for naught the bold spirit of all the\r\nKshatriya kings. Kesava cast his eyes on that Sishupala and smote him,\r\nenhancing the fame and honour of the sons of Pandu. It was the same\r\nSishupala who was highly honoured by those kings at whose head stood the\r\nking of the Karusha tribe. Then the other kings, deeming Krishna\r\nunassailable when seated on his car drawn by Sugriva and other steeds,\r\nleft the chief of the Chedis and ran away like small animals at the sight\r\nof a lion. And it was thus that he, who, from audacity had sought to\r\noppose and encounter Krishna in a combat hand to hand, was slain by\r\nKrishna and lay down lifeless, resembling a Karnikara tree uprooted by a\r\ngale. O Sanjaya, O son of Gavalgana, what they have told me of the\r\nactivity of Krishna in cause of Pandu's sons, and what I remember of his\r\npast achievements, leave me no peace of mind. No foe whatsoever is\r\ncapable of withstanding them, who are under the lead of that lion of the\r\nVrishni tribe. My heart is trembling with fear upon learning that the two\r\nKrishnas, are seated on the selfsame car. If my dull-headed son forbear\r\nto fight with those two, then may he fare well,--else those two will\r\nconsume the race of Kuru as Indra and Upendra consume the Daitya hosts.\r\nDhananjaya is, I conceive, equal to Indra, and the greatest of the\r\nVrishni race, Krishna, is the Eternal Vishnu himself. The son of Kunti\r\nand Pandu, Yudhishthira, is virtuous and brave and eschews deeds that\r\nbring on shame. Endued with great energy, he hath been wronged by\r\nDuryodhana. If he were not high-minded, the would in wrath burn the\r\nDhritarashtras. I do not so much dread Arjuna or Bhima or Krishna or the\r\ntwin brothers as I dread the wrath of the king, O Suta, when his wrath is\r\nexcited. His austerities are great; he is devoted to Brahmacharya\r\npractices. His heart's wishes will certainly be fulfilled. When I think\r\nof his wrath, O Sanjaya, and consider how just it is, I am filled with\r\nalarm. Go thou speedily on a car, despatched by me, where the troops of\r\nthe king of the Panchalas are encamped. Thou wilt ask Yudhishthira about\r\nhis welfare. Thou wilt repeatedly address him in affectionate terms. Thou\r\nwilt also meet Krishna, O child, who is the chief of all brave men and\r\nwho is endued with a magnanimous soul. Him also thou wilt ask on my part\r\nas to his welfare, and tell him that Dhritarashtra is desirous of peace\r\nwith Pandu's sons. O Suta, there is nothing that Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nKunti, would not do at the bidding of Krishna. Kesava is as dear to them\r\nas their own selves. Possessed of great learning, he is ever devoted to\r\ntheir cause. Thou wilt also enquire about the welfare of all the\r\nassembled sons of Pandu and the Srinjayas and Satyaki and Virata and all\r\nthe five sons of Draupadi, professing to be a messenger from me. And\r\nwhatsoever also thou mayst deem to be opportune, and beneficial for the\r\nBharata race, all that, O Sanjaya, thou must say in the midst of those\r\nkings,--everything, in sooth, that may not be unpalatable or provocative\r\nof war.'"

Having seen thee, O\r\nSanjaya, I feel as if I have seen the king himself, so pleased I am! Is\r\nour aged grandsire Bhishma, the descendant of Kuru, endued with great\r\nenergy and the highest wisdom and always devoted to the practices of his\r\nown order, O sire, in health? I hope he still retains all his former\r\nhabits. I hope the high-souled king Dhritarashtra, the so-n of\r\nVichitravirya, is in health with his sons. I hope the great king Vahlika,\r\nthe son of Pratipa, endued with great learning, is also in health. I\r\nhope, O sire, that Somadatta is in health, and Bhurisravas, and\r\nSatyasandha, and Sala, and Drona with his son, and the Brahmana Kripa are\r\nalso well. I hope all those mighty bowmen are free from disease. O\r\nSanjaya, all those greatest and best of bowmen, endued with the highest\r\nintelligence and versed in letters, and occupying the very top of those\r\nwho wield weapons, have attached themselves to the Kurus. I hope those\r\nbowmen receive their honours due. I hope they are free from disease. How\r\nhappy are they in whose kingdom dwells the mighty and handsome bowman,\r\nthe well-behaved son of Drona! I hope Yuyutsu, the highly intelligent son\r\nof Dhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife is in health. I hope, O sire, the\r\nadviser Karna, whose counsels are followed by the dull-headed Suyodhana,\r\nis in health. I hope, the aged ladies, the mothers of the Bharata race,\r\nand the kitchen-maidens, the bond-maids, the daughters-in-law, the boys,\r\nthe sister's sons, and 'the sisters, and the daughters' sons of\r\nDhritarashtra's house are all free from trouble. O sire, I hope the king\r\nstill allows their former subsistence to the Brahmanas. I hope, O\r\nSanjaya, Dhritarashtra's son hath not seized those gifts to the Brahmanas\r\nthat I made. I hope Dhritarashtra with his sons meets in a spirit of\r\nforbearance any over-bearing conduct on the part of the Brahmanas. I hope\r\nhe never neglects to make provision for them, that being the sole highway\r\nto heaven. For this is the excellent and clear light that hath been\r\nprovided by the Creator in this world of living beings. If like\r\ndull-headed persons, the sons of Kuru do not treat the Brahmanas in a\r\nforbearing spirit, wholesale destruction will overtake them. I hope king\r\nDhritarashtra and his son try to provide for the functionaries of state.\r\nI hope there are no enemies for theirs, who, disguised as friends, are\r\nconspiring for their ruin. O sire, I hope none of these Kurus talk of our\r\nhaving committed any crimes. I hope Drona and his son and the heroic\r\nKripa do not talk of our having been guilty in any way. I hope all the\r\nKurus look up to king Dhritarashtra and his sons as the protectors of\r\ntheir tribe. I hope when they see a horde of robbers, they remember the\r\ndeeds of Arjuna, the leader in all fields of battle. I hope they remember\r\nthe arrows shot from the Gandiva, which course through the air in a\r\nstraight path, impelled onwards by the stretched bow-string in contact\r\nwith the fingers of his hand, and making a noise loud as that of the\r\nthunder. I have not seen the warrior that excels or even rivals Arjuna\r\nwho can shoot by a single effort of his hand sixty-one whetted and\r\nkeen-edged shafts furnished with excellent feathers. Do they remember\r\nBhima also, who, endued with great activity causeth hostile hosts arrayed\r\nin battle to tremble in dread, like an elephant with rent temples\r\nagitating a forest of reeds? Do they remember the mighty Sahadeva, the\r\nson of Madri, who in Dantakura conquered the Kalingas, shooting arrows by\r\nboth the left and right hand? Do they remember Nakula, who, O Sanjaya,\r\nwas sent, under your eye, to conquer the Sivis and the Trigartas, and who\r\nbrought the western region under my power? Do they remember the disgrace\r\nthat was theirs when under evil counsels they came to the woods of\r\nDwaitavana on pretence of taking away their cattle? Those wicked ones\r\nhaving been over-powered by their enemies were afterwards liberated by\r\nBhimasena and Arjuna, myself protecting the rear of Arjuna (in the fight\r\nthat ensued) and Bhima protecting the rear of the sons of Madri, and the\r\nwielder of the Gandiva coming out unharmed from the press of battle\r\nhaving made a great slaughter of the hostile host,--do they remember\r\nthat? It is not by a single good deed, O Sanjaya, that happiness can here\r\nbe attained, when by all our endeavours we are unable to win over the son\r\nof Dhritarashtra!\""

Know, O son of Pandu, that there are\r\ncertainly righteous and aged men, as also men that are sinful and wicked\r\nabout Dhritarashtra's son. Dhritarashtra's son would make gifts even to\r\nhis enemies; it is not likely, therefore, that he should withdraw the\r\ndonations made to the Brahmanas. It is customary with you, Kshatriyas, to\r\nfollow a rule fit for butchers, that leads you to do harm to those that\r\nbear no ill-will to you; but the practice is not good. Dhritarashtra with\r\nhis sons would be guilty of the sin of intestine dissension, where he,\r\nlike a bad man, to bear ill-will towards you who are righteous. He does\r\nnot approve of this injury (done to you); he is exceedingly sorry for it;\r\nhe grieves at his heart-the old man--O Yudhishthira,--for, having\r\ncommunicated with the Brahmanas, he hath learnt that provoking intestine\r\ndissensions is the greatest of all sins. O king of men, they remember thy\r\nprowess on the field, and that of Arjuna, who taketh the lead in the\r\nfield of battle. They remember Bhima wielding his mace when the sound of\r\nthe conch-shell and the drum rises to the highest pitch. They remember\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, the two sons of Madri, who on the field of\r\nbattle career in all directions, shooting incessant showers of shafts on\r\nhostile hosts, and who know not what it is to tremble in fight. I\r\nbelieve, O king, that which Futurity hath in store for a particular\r\nperson cannot be known, since thou, O son of Pandu, who art endowed with\r\nall the virtues, hast had to suffer trouble of such unendurable kind. All\r\nthis, no doubt, O Yudhishthira, thou wilt again make up by help of your\r\nintelligence. The sons of Pandu, all equal to Indra would never abandon\r\nvirtue for the sake of pleasure. Thou, O Yudhishthira, wilt so make up\r\nthy intelligence that they all, viz., the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu\r\nand the Srinjayas, and all the kings who have been assembled here, will\r\nattain peace.

Let all listen to the words I say from a desire for the welfare\r\nof the Kurus. King Dhritarashtra, eagerly welcoming the chance of peace,\r\nhastened the preparation of my car for this journey here. Let it be\r\nacceptable to king Yudhishthira with his brothers and sons and relations.\r\nLet the son of Pandu prefer peace. The sons of Pritha are endowed with\r\nevery virtue with steadiness and mildness and candour. Born in a high\r\nfamily, they are humane, liberal, and loath to do any act which would\r\nbring on shame. They know what is proper to be done. A base deed is not\r\nbefitting you, for you are so high-minded, and have such a terrible\r\nfollowing of troops. If you committed a sinful act, it would be a blot on\r\nyour fair name, as a drop of collyrium on a white cloth. Who could\r\nknowingly be ever guilty of an act, which would result in universal\r\nslaughter, which would be sinful and lead to hell,--an act consisting in\r\nthe destruction (of men), an act the result of which, whether it be\r\nvictory or defeat, is or the self-same value? Blessed are they that have\r\nserved their relative's cause. They are the true sons and friends and\r\nrelatives (of Kuru's race) who would lay down life, life which is liable\r\nto be abused by misdeeds, in order to ensure the welfare of the Kurus. If\r\nyou, ye sons of Pritha, chastise the Kurus, by defeating and slaying all\r\nyour foes,--that subsequent life of yours would be equivalent to death,\r\nfor what, in sooth, is life after having killed all your kinsfolk? Who,\r\neven if he were Indra himself with all the gods on his side, would be\r\nable to defeat you who are aided by Kesava and Chekitanas, and Satyaki,\r\nand are protected by Dhrishtadyumna's arms? Who again, O king, can defeat\r\nin battle the Kurus who are protected by Drona and Bhishma, and\r\nAswatthaman, and Salya, and Kripa and Karna with a host of Kshatriya\r\nkings? Who, without loss to himself, is able to slay the vast force\r\nassembled by Dhritarashtra's son? Therefore it is, that I do not see any\r\ngood either in victory or in defeat. How can the sons of Pritha, like\r\nbase persons of low lineage, commit an act of unrighteousness? Therefore,\r\nI appease, I prostrate myself before Krishna and the aged kin I g of the\r\nPanchalas. I betake myself to you as my refuge, with joined hands, so\r\nthat both the Kurus and the Srinjayas may be benefited. It is not likely\r\nthat either Krishna or Dhananjaya will not act up to these my words.\r\nEither of them would lay down his life, if besought (to do so).\r\nTherefore, I say this for the success of my mission. This is the desire\r\nof the king and his counsellor Bhishma, that there may be confirmed peace\r\nbetween you (and the Kurus).'\""

      "content": "\"Yudhishthira said, 'What words from me, O Sanjaya, hast thou heard,\r\nindicative of war, that thou apprehendest war? O sire, peace is\r\npreferable to war. Who, O charioteer, having got the other alternative\r\nwould wish to fight? It is known to me, O Sanjaya, that if a man can have\r\nevery wish of his heart without having to do anything, he would hardly\r\nlike to do anything even though it might be of the least troublesome\r\nkind, far less would he engage in war. Why should a man ever go to war?\r\nWho is so cursed by the gods that he would select war? The sons of\r\nPritha, no doubt, desire their own happiness but their conduct is ever\r\nmarked by righteousness and conducive to the good of the world. They\r\ndesire only that happiness which results from righteousness. He that\r\nfondly followeth the lead of his senses, and is desirous of obtaining\r\nhappiness and avoiding misery, betaketh himself to action which in its\r\nessence is nothing but misery. He that hankers after pleasure causeth his\r\nbody to suffer; one free from such hankering knoweth not what misery is.\r\nAs an enkindled fire, if more fuel be put upon it, blazeth forth again\r\nwith augmented force, so desire is never satiated with the acquisition of\r\nits object but gaineth force like unkindled fire when clarified butter is\r\npoured upon it. Compare all this abundant fund of enjoyment which king\r\nDhritarashtra hath with what we possess. He that is unfortunate never\r\nwinneth victories. He that is unfortunate enjoyeth not the voice of\r\nmusic. He that is unfortunate doth not enjoy garlands and scents! nor can\r\none that is unfortunate enjoy cool and fragrant unguents! and finally he\r\nthat is unfortunate weareth not fine clothes. If this were not so, we\r\nwould never have been driven from the Kurus. Although, however, all this\r\nis true, yet none cherished torments of the heart. The king being himself\r\nin trouble seeketh protection in the might of others. This is not wise.\r\nLet him, however, receive from others the same behaviour that he displays\r\ntowards them. The man who casteth a burning fire at midday in the season\r\nof spring in a forest of dense underwood, hath certainly, when that fire\r\nblazeth forth by aid of the wind, to grieve for his lot if he wisheth to\r\nescape. O Sanjaya, why doth king Dhritarashtra now bewail, although he\r\nhath all this prosperity? It is because he had followed at first the\r\ncounsels of his wicked son of vicious soul, addicted to crooked ways and\r\nconfirmed in folly. Duryodhana disregarded the words of Vidura, the best\r\nof his well-wishers, as if the latter were hostile to him. King\r\nDhritarashtra, desirous solely of satisfying his sons, would knowingly\r\nenter upon an unrighteous course. Indeed, on account of his fondness for\r\nhis son, he would not pay heed to Vidura, who, out of all the Kurus, is\r\nthe wisest and best of all his well-wishers, possessing vast learning,\r\nclever in speech, and righteous in act. King Dhritarashtra is desirous of\r\nsatisfying his son, who, while himself seeking honours from others, is\r\nenvious and wrathful, who transgresses the rules for the acquisition of\r\nvirtue and wealth, whose tongue is foul, who always follows the dictates\r\nof his wrath, whose soul is absorbed in sensual pleasures, and who, full\r\nof unfriendly feelings to many, obeys no law, and whose life is evil,\r\nheart implacable, and understanding vicious. For such a son as this, king\r\nDhritarashtra knowingly abandoned virtue and pleasure. Even then, O\r\nSanjaya, when I was engaged in that game of dice I thought that the\r\ndestruction of the Kurus was at hand, for when speaking those wise and\r\nexcellent words Vidura obtained no praise from Dhritarashtra. Then, O\r\ncharioteer, did trouble overtake the Kurus when they disregarded the\r\nwords of Vidura. So long as they had placed themselves under the lead of\r\nhis wisdom, their kingdom was in a flourishing state. Hear from me, O\r\ncharioteer, who are the counsellors now of the covetous Duryodhana. They\r\nare Dussasana, and Sakuni the son of Suvala, and Karna the Suta's son! O\r\nson of Gavalgana, look at this folly of his! So I do not see, though I\r\nthink about it, how there can be prosperity for the Kurus and the\r\nSrinjayas when Dhritarashtra hath taken the throne from others, and the\r\nfar seeing Vidura hath been banished elsewhere. Dhritarashtra with his\r\nsons is now looking for an extensive and undisputed sovereignty over the\r\nwhole world. Absolute peace is, therefore, unattainable. He regardeth\r\nwhat he hath already got to be his own. When Arjuna taketh up his weapon\r\nin fight, Karna believeth him capable of being withstood. Formerly there\r\ntook place many great battles. Why could not Karna then be of any avail\r\nto them. It is known to Karna and Drona and the grandsire Bhishma, as\r\nalso to many other Kurus, that there is no wielder of the bow, comparable\r\nto Arjuna. It is known to all the assembled rulers of the earth, how the\r\nsovereignty was obtained by Duryodhana although that repressor of foes,\r\nArjuna, was alive. Pertinanciously doth Dhritarashtra's son believe that\r\nit is possible to rob the sons of Pandu of what is their own, although he\r\nknoweth having himself gone to the place of fight, how Arjuna comforted\r\nhimself when he had nothing but a bow four cubits long for his weapon of\r\nbattle. Dhritarashtra's sons are alive simply because they have not as\r\nyet heard that twang of the stretch Gandiva. Duryodhana believeth his\r\nobject already gained, as long as he beholdeth not the wrathful Bhima. O\r\nsire, even Indra would forbear to rob us of our sovereignty as long as\r\nBhima and Arjuna and the heroic Nakula and the patient Sahadeva are\r\nalive! O charioteer, the old king with his son still entertains the\r\nnotion that his sons will not be perished, O Sanjaya, on the field of\r\nbattle, consumed by the fiery wrath of Pandu's sons. Thou knowest, O\r\nSanjaya, what misery we have suffered! For my respect to thee, I would\r\nforgive them all. Thou knowest what transpired between ourselves and\r\nthose sons of Kuru. Thou knowest how we comforted ourselves towards\r\nDhritarashtra's son. Let the same state of things still continue, I shall\r\nseek peace, as thou counsellest me to do. Let me have Indraprastha for my\r\nkingdom, Let this be given to me by Duryodhana, the chief of Bharata's\r\nrace.'\""

Life is transient,\r\nthat may end in great infamy; considering this, thou shouldst not perish.\r\nO Ajatasatru, if without war, the Kurus will not yield thy share, I\r\nthink, it is far better for thee to live upon alms in the kingdom of the\r\nAndhakas and the Vrishnis than obtain sovereignty by war. Since this\r\nmortal existence is for only a short period, and greatly liable to blame,\r\nsubject to constant suffering, and unstable, and since it is never\r\ncomparable to a good name, therefore, O Pandava, never perpetrate a sin.\r\nIt is the desires, O ruler of men, which adhere to mortal men and are an\r\nobstruction to a virtuous life. Therefore, a wise man should beforehand\r\nkill them all and thereby gain a stainless fame in the world, O son of\r\nPritha. The thirst after wealth is but like fetter in this world; the\r\nvirtue of those that seek it is sure to suffer. He is wise who seeketh\r\nvirtue alone; desires being increased, a man must suffer in his temporal\r\nconcerns, O sire. Placing virtue before all other concerns of life, a man\r\nshineth like the sun when its splendour is great. A man devoid of virtue,\r\nand of vicious soul, is overtaken by ruin, although he may obtain the\r\nwhole of this earth. Thou hast studied the Vedas, lived the life of a\r\nsaintly Brahman, hast performed sacrificial rites, made charities to\r\nBrahmanas. Even remembering the highest position (attainable by beings),\r\nthou hast also devoted thy soul for years and years to the pursuit of\r\npleasure. He who, devoting himself excessively to the pleasures and joys\r\nof life, never employeth himself in the practice of religious meditation,\r\nmust be exceedingly miserable. His joys forsake him after his wealth is\r\ngone and his strong instincts goad him on towards his wonted pursuit of\r\npleasure. Similarly, he who, never having lived a continent life,\r\nforsaketh the path of virtue and commiteth sin, hath no faith in\r\nexistence of a world to come. Dull as he is after death he hath torment\r\n(for his lot). In the world to come, whether one's deeds be good or evil\r\nthese deeds are in no case, annihilated. Deeds, good and evil, precede\r\nthe agent (in his journey to the world to come); the agent is sure to\r\nfollow in their path. Your work (in this life) is celebrated by all as\r\ncomparable to that food, savoury and dainty, which is proper to be\r\noffered with reverence to the Brahmanas--the food which is offered in\r\nreligious ceremonies with large donations (to the officiating priests).\r\nAll acts are done, so long as this body lasts, O son of Pritha. After\r\ndeath there is nothing to be done. And thou hast done mighty deeds that\r\nwill do good to thee in the world to come, and they are admired by\r\nrighteous men. There (in the next world) one is free from death and\r\ndecrepitude and fear, and from hunger and thirst, and from all that is\r\ndisagreeable to the mind; there is nothing to be done in that place,\r\nunless it be to delight one's senses. Of this kind, O ruler of men, is\r\nthe result of our deeds. Therefore, do not from desire act any longer in\r\nthis world. Do not, O Pandu's son, betake to action in this world and\r\nthereby thus take leave of truth and sobriety and candour and humanity.\r\nThou mayst perform the Rajasuya and the Aswamedha sacrifices, but do not\r\neven come near an action which in itself is sin! If after such a length\r\nof time, ye sons of Pritha, you now give way to hate, and commit the\r\nsinful deed, in vain, for virtue's sake, did ye dwell for years and years\r\nin the woods in such misery! It was in vain that you went to exile, after\r\nparting with all your army; for this army was entirely in your control\r\nthen. And these persons who are now assisting you, have been always\r\nobedient to you,--this Krishna, and Satyaki, and Virata of the golden\r\ncar, of Matsya land, with his son at the head of martial warriors. All\r\nthe kings, formerly vanquished by you would have espoused your cause at\r\nfirst. Possessed of mighty resources, dreaded by all, having an army, and\r\nfollowed behind by Krishna and Arjuna, you might have slain your foremost\r\nof foes on the field of battle. You might have (then) brought low\r\nDuryodhana's pride. O Pandava, why have you allowed your foes to grow so\r\npowerful? Why have you weakened your friends? Why have you sojourned in\r\nthe woods for years and years? Why are you now desirous of fighting,\r\nhaving let the proper opportunity slip? An unwise or an unrighteous man\r\nmay win prosperity by means of fighting; but a wise and a righteous man,\r\nwere he free from pride to betake to fight (against better instinct),\r\ndoth only fall away from a prosperous path. O Pritha's son, your\r\nunderstanding inclines not to an unrighteous course. From wrath you ever\r\ncommitted a sinful act. Then what is the cause, and what is the reason,\r\nfor which you are now intent to do this deed, against the dictates of\r\nwisdom? Wrath, O mighty king, is a bitter drug, though it has nothing to\r\ndo with disease; it brings on a disease of the head, robs one of his fair\r\nfame, and leads to sinful acts. It is drunk up (controlled) by those that\r\nare righteous and not by those that are unrighteous. I ask you to swallow\r\nit and to desist from war. Who would incline himself to wrath which leads\r\nto sin? Forbearance would be more beneficial to you than love of\r\nenjoyments where Bhishma would be slain, and Drona with his son, and\r\nKripa, and Somadatta's son, and Vikarna and Vivingsati, and Karna and\r\nDuryodhana. Having slain all these, what bliss may that be, O Pritha's\r\nson, which you will get? Tell me that! Even having won the entire\r\nsea-girt earth, you will never be free from decrepitude and death,\r\npleasure and pain, bliss and misery. Knowing all this, do not be engaged\r\nin war. If you are desirous of taking this course, because your\r\ncounsellors desire the same, then give up (everything) to them, and run\r\naway. You should not fall away from this path which leads to the region\r\nof the gods!'\""

      "content": "\"Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, O Sanjaya, it is true that righteous\r\ndeeds are the foremost of all our acts, as thou sayest. Thou shouldst,\r\nhowever, ensure me having first ascertained whether it is virtue or vice\r\nthat I practise. When vice assumes the aspects of virtue and virtue\r\nitself wholly seems as vice, and virtue, again, appears in its native\r\nform, they that are learned should discriminate it by means of their\r\nreason. So, again, virtue and vice, which are both eternal and absolute,\r\nexchange their aspects during seasons of distress. One should follow\r\nwithout deviation the duties prescribed for the order to which he belongs\r\nby birth. Know, O Sanjaya, that duties in seasons of distress are\r\notherwise. When his means of living are totally gone, the man, that is\r\ndestitute should certainly desire those other means by which he may be\r\nable to discharge the sanctioned duties of his order. One that is not\r\ndestitute of his means of living, as also one that is in distress, are, O\r\nSanjaya, both to be blamed, if they act as if the state of each were\r\notherwise. When the Creator hath ordained expiation for those Brahmanas,\r\nwho, without wishing for self-destruction, betake themselves to acts not\r\nsanctioned for them, this proves that people may, in season of distress,\r\nbetake to acts not ordained for the orders to which they belong. And, O\r\nSanjaya, thou shouldst regard them as worthy that adhere to the practices\r\nof their own order in usual times as also those that do not adhere to\r\nthem in season of distress; thou shouldst censure them that act otherwise\r\nin usual times while adhering to their ordained practices during times of\r\ndistress. As regards men desiring to bring their minds under control,\r\nwhen they endeavour to acquire a knowledge of self, the practices that\r\nare ordained for the best, viz., the Brahmanas, are equally ordained for\r\nthem. As regards those, however, that are not Brahmanas and that do not\r\nendeavour to acquire knowledge of self, those practices should be\r\nfollowed by them that are ordained for their respective orders in seasons\r\nof distress or otherwise. Even that is the path followed by our fathers\r\nand grandfathers before us and those also that had lived before them. As\r\nregards those that are desirous of knowledge and avoiding to act, even\r\nthese also hold the same view and regard themselves as orthodox. I do\r\nnot, therefore, think that there is any other path. Whatsoever wealth\r\nthere may be in this earth, whatsoever there may be among the gods, or\r\nwhatsoever there may be unattainable by them,--the region of the\r\nPrajapati, or heaven or the region of Brahma himself, I would not, O\r\nSanjaya, seek it by unrighteous means. Here is Krishna, the giver of\r\nvirtue's fruits, who is clever, politic, intelligent, who has waited upon\r\nthe Brahmanas, who knows everything' and counsels various mighty kings.\r\nLet the celebrated Krishna say whether I would be censurable if I dismiss\r\nall idea of peace, of whether if I fight, I should be abandoning the\r\nduties of my caste, for Krishna seeketh the welfare of both sides. This\r\nSatyaki, these Chedis, the Andhakas, the Vrishnis, the Bhojas, the\r\nKukuras, the Srinjayas, adopting the counsels of Krishna, slay their foes\r\nand delight their friends. The Vrishnis and the Andhakas, at whose head\r\nstands Ugrasena, led by Krishna, have become like Indra, high-spirited,\r\ndevoted to truth, mighty, and happy. Vabhru, the king of Kasi, having\r\nobtained Krishna, that fructifier of wishes, as his brother, and upon\r\nwhom Krishna showers all the blessings of life, as the clouds upon all\r\nearthly creatures, when the hot season is over, hath attained the highest\r\nprosperity, O sire, so great is this Krishna! Him you must know as the\r\ngreat judge of the propriety or otherwise of all acts. Krishna is dear to\r\nus, and is the most illustrious of men. I never disregard what Krishna\r\nsayeth.'\""

      "content": "\"Krishna said, 'I desire, O Sanjaya, that the sons of Pandu may not be\r\nruined; that they may prosper, and attain their wishes. Similarly, I pray\r\nfor the prosperity of king Dhritarashtra whose sons are many. For\r\nevermore, O Sanjaya, my desire hath been that I should tell them nothing\r\nelse than that peace would be acceptable to king Dhritarashtra. I also\r\ndeem it proper for the sons of Pandu. A peaceful disposition of an\r\nexceedingly rare character hath been displayed by Pandu's son in this\r\nmatter. When Dhritarashtra and his sons, however, are so covetous, I do\r\nnot see why hostility should not run high? Thou canst not pretend, O\r\nSanjaya, to be more versed than I am or Yudhishthira. is, in the niceties\r\nof right and wrong. Then why dost thou speak words of reproach with\r\nreference to the conduct of Yudhishthira who is enterprising, mindful of\r\nhis own duty, and thoughtful, from the very beginning, of the welfare of\r\nhis family, agreeably to the injunctions (of treatises of morality)? With\r\nregard to the topic at hand, the Brahmanas have held opinions of various\r\nkinds. Some say that success in the world to come depends upon work. Some\r\ndeclare that action should be shunned and that salvation is attainable by\r\nknowledge. The Brahmanas say--that though one may have a knowledge of\r\neatable things, yet his hunger will not be appeased unless he actually\r\neats. Those branches of knowledge that help the doing of work, bear\r\nfruit, but not other kinds, for the fruit of work is of ocular\r\ndemonstration. A thirsty person drinks water, and by that act his thirst\r\nis allayed. This result proceeds, no doubt, from work. Therein lies the\r\nefficacy of work. If anyone thinks that something else is better than\r\nwork, I deem, his work and his words are meaningless. In the other world,\r\nit is by virtue of work that the gods flourish. It is by work that the\r\nwind blows. It is by virtue of work that the sleepless Surya rises every\r\nday and becomes the cause of day and night, and Soma passes through the\r\nmonths and the fortnights and the combinations of constellations. Fire is\r\nkindled of itself and burns by virtue of work, doing good to mankind. The\r\nsleepless goddess Earth, sustains by force this very great burden. The\r\nsleepless rivers, giving satisfaction to all (organised) beings, carry\r\ntheir waters with speed. The sleepless Indra, possessed of a mighty\r\nforce, pours down rain, resounding the heaven and the cardinal points.\r\nDesirous of being the greatest of the gods, he led a life of austerities\r\nsuch as a holy Brahmana leads. Indra gave up pleasure, and all things\r\nagreeable to the heart. He sedulously cherished virtue and truth and\r\nself-control, and forbearance, and impartiality, and humanity. It was by\r\nwork that he attained a position the highest (of all). Following the\r\nabove course of life, Indra attained the high sovereignty over the gods.\r\nVrihaspati, intently and with self-control, led in a proper manner that\r\nlife of austerities which a Brahmana leads. He gave up pleasure and\r\ncontrolled his senses and thereby attained the position of the preceptor\r\nof the celestials. Similarly, the constellations in the other world, by\r\nvirtue of work, and the Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, king Yama, and\r\nKuvera, and the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, and the celestial nymphs, all\r\nattained their present position by work. In the other world, the saints\r\nshine, following a life of study, austerity and work (combined). Knowing,\r\nO Sanjaya, that this is the rule followed by the best of Brahmanas, and\r\nKshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and thou being one of the wisest men,--why art\r\nthou making this endeavour on behalf of those sons of Kurus? Thou must\r\nknow that Yudhishthira is constantly engaged in the study of the Vedas.\r\nHe is inclined to the horse-sacrifice and the Rajasuya. Again, he rides\r\nhorses and elephants, is arrayed in armour, mounts a car, and takes up\r\nthe bow and all kinds of weapons. Now, if the sons of Pritha can see a\r\ncourse of action not involving the slaughter of the sons of Kuru, they\r\nwould adopt it. Their virtue would then be saved, and an act of religious\r\nmerit also would be achieved by them, even if they would have then to\r\nforce Bhima to follow a conduct marked by humanity. On the other hand, if\r\nin doing what their forefathers did, they should meet with death under\r\ninevitable destiny, then in trying their utmost to discharge their duty,\r\nsuch death would even be worthy of praise. Supposing thou approvest of\r\npeace alone I should like to hear what thou mayst have to say to this\r\nquestion,--which way doth the injunction of religious law lie, viz.,\r\nwhether it is proper for the king to fight or not?--Thou must, O Sanjaya,\r\ntake into thy consideration the division of the four castes, and the\r\nscheme of respective duties allotted to each. Thou must hear that course\r\nof action the Pandavas are going to adopt. Then mayst thou praise or\r\ncensure, just as it may please thee. A Brahmana should study, offer\r\nsacrifices, make charities, and sojourn to the best of all holy places on\r\nthe earth; he should teach, minister as a priest in sacrifices offered by\r\nothers worthy of such help, and accept gifts from persons who are known.\r\nSimilarly, a Kshatriya should protect the people in accordance with the\r\ninjunctions of the law, diligently practise the virtue of charity, offer\r\nsacrifices, study the whole Veda, take a wife, and lead a virtuous\r\nhouseholder's life. If he be possessed of a virtuous soul, and if he\r\npractise the holy virtues, he may easily attain the religion of the\r\nSupreme Being. A Vaisya should study and diligently earn and accumulate\r\nwealth by means of commerce, agriculture, and the tending of cattle. He\r\nshould so act as to please the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas, be virtuous,\r\ndo good works, and be a householder. The following are the duties\r\ndeclared for a Sudra from the olden times. He should serve the Brahmanas\r\nand submit to them; should not study; sacrifices are forbidden to him; he\r\nshould be diligent and be constantly enterprising in doing all that is\r\nfor his good. The king protects all these with (proper) care, and sets\r\nall the castes to perform their respective duties. He should not be given\r\nto sensual enjoyments. He should be impartial, and treat all his subjects\r\non an equal footing. The King should never obey the dictates of such\r\ndesires as are opposed to righteousness. If there be any body who is more\r\npraise-worthy than he, who is well-known and gifted with all the virtues,\r\nthe king should instruct his subjects to see him. A bad (king), however,\r\nwould not understand this. Growing strong, and inhuman and becoming a\r\nmark for destiny's wrath, he would cast covetous eye on the riches of\r\nothers. Then comes war, for which purpose came into being weapons, and\r\narmour, and bows. Indra invented these contrivances, for putting the\r\nplunderers to death. He also contrived armours, and weapons, and bows.\r\nReligious merit is acquired by putting the robbers to death. Many awful\r\nevils have manifested themselves on account of the Kurus having been\r\nunrighteous, and unmindful of law and religion. This is not right, O\r\nSanjaya. Now, king Dhritarashtra with his sons, hath unreasonably seized\r\nwhat lawfully belonged to Pandu's son. He minds not the immemorial law\r\nobservable by kings. All the Kurus are following in the wake. A thief who\r\nsteals wealth unseen and one who forcibly seizes the same, in open\r\nday-light, are both to be condemned, O Sanjaya. What is the difference\r\nbetween them and Dhritarashtra's sons? From avarice he regards that to be\r\nrighteous which he intends to do, following the dictates of his wrath.\r\nThe shares of the Pandavas is, no doubt, fixed. Why should that share of\r\ntheirs be seized by that fool? This being the state of things, it would\r\nbe praiseworthy for us to be even killed in fight. A paternal kingdom is\r\npreferable to sovereignty received from a stranger. These time-honoured\r\nrules of law, O Sanjaya, thou must propound to the Kurus, in the midst of\r\nthe assembled kings,--I mean those dull-headed fools who have been\r\nassembled together by Dhritarashtra's son, and who are already under the\r\nclutches of death. Look once more at that vilest of all their acts,--the\r\nconduct of the Kurus in the council-hall. That those Kurus, at whose head\r\nstood Bhishma did not interfere when the beloved wife of the sons of\r\nPandu, daughter of Drupada, of fare fame, pure life, and conduct worthy\r\nof praise, was seized, while weeping, by that slave of lust. The Kurus\r\nall, including young and old, were present there. If they had then\r\nprevented that indignity offered to her, then I should have been pleased\r\nwith Dhritarashtra's behaviour. It would have been for the final good of\r\nhis sons also. Dussasana forcibly took Krishna into the midst of the\r\npublic hall wherein were seated her fathers-in-law. Carried there,\r\nexpecting sympathy, she found none to take her part, except Vidura. The\r\nkings uttered not a word of protest, solely because they were a set of\r\nimbeciles. Vidura alone spoke words of opposition, from a sense of\r\nduty,--words conceived in righteousness addressed to that man\r\n(Duryodhana) of little sense. Thou didst not, O Sanjaya, then say what\r\nlaw and morality were, but now thou comest to instruct the son of Pandu!\r\nKrishna, however, having repaired to the hall at that time made\r\neverything right, for like a vessel in the sea, she rescued the Pandavas\r\nas also herself, from that gathering ocean (of misfortunes)! Then in that\r\nhall, while Krishna stood, the charioteer's son addressed her in the\r\npresence of her fathers-in-law saying, 'O Daughter of Drupada thou hast\r\nno refuge. Better betake thyself as a bond-woman to the house of\r\nDhritarashtra's son. Thy husbands, being defeated, no longer exist. Thou\r\nhast a loving soul, choose some one else for thy lord.' This speech,\r\nproceeding from Karna, was a wordy arrow, sharp, cutting all hopes,\r\nhitting the tenderest parts of the organisation, and frightful. It buried\r\nitself deep in Arjuna's heart. When the sons of Pandu were about to adopt\r\nthe garments made of the skins of black deer, Dussasana spoke the\r\nfollowing pungent words, 'These all are mean eunuchs, ruined, and damned\r\nfor a lengthened time.' And Sakuni, the king of the Gandhara land, spoke\r\nto Yudhishthira at the time of the game of dice the following words by\r\nway of a wily trick, 'Nakula hath been won by me from you, what else have\r\nyou got? Now you should better stake your wife Draupadi'. You know, O\r\nSanjaya, all these words of an approbrious kind which were spoken at the\r\ntime of the game of dice. I desire to go personally to the Kurus, in\r\norder to settle this difficult matter. If without injury to the Pandava\r\ncause I succeed in bringing about this peace with the Kurus, an act of\r\nreligious merit, resulting in very great blessings, will then have been\r\ndone by me; and the Kurus also will have been extricated from the meshes\r\nof death. I hope that when I shall speak to the Kurus words of wisdom,\r\nresting on rules of righteousness, words fraught with sense and free from\r\nall tendency to inhumanity, Dhritarashtra's son will, in my presence, pay\r\nheed to them. I hope that when I arrive, the Kurus will pay me due\r\nrespect. Else thou mayst rest assured that those vicious sons of\r\nDhritarashtra, already scorched by their own vicious acts, will be burnt\r\nup by Arjuna and Bhima ready for battle. When Pandu's sons were defeated\r\n(at the play), Dhritarashtra's sons spoke to them words that were harsh\r\nand rude. But when the time will come, Bhima will, no doubt, take care to\r\nremind Duryodhana of those words. Duryodhana is a big tree of evil\r\npassions; Karna is its trunk; Sakuni is its branches; Dussasana forms its\r\nabundant blossoms and fruits; (while) the wise king Dhritarashtra is its\r\ntoots. Yudhishthira is a big tree of righteousness; Arjuna is its trunk;\r\nand Bhima is its branches; the sons of Madri are its abundant flowers and\r\nfruits; and its roots are myself and religion and religious men. King\r\nDhritarashtra with his sons constitutes a forest, while, O Sanjaya, the\r\nsons of Pandu are its tigers. Do not, oh, cut down the forest with its\r\ntigers, and let not the tigers be driven away from the forest. The tiger,\r\nout of the woods, is easily slain; the wood also, that is without a\r\ntiger, is easily cut down. Therefore, it is the tiger that protects the\r\nforest and the forest that shelters the tiger. The Dhritarashtras are as\r\ncreepers, while, O Sanjaya, the Pandavas are Sala trees. A creeper can\r\nnever flourish unless it hath a large tree to twine round. The sons of\r\nPritha are ready to wait upon Dhritarashtra as, indeed, those repressors\r\nof foes are ready for war. Let king Dhritarashtra now do what may be\r\nproper for him to do. The virtuous and the high-souled sons of Pandu,\r\nthough competent to be engaged in fight, are yet now in place (with their\r\ncousins). O learned man, represent all this truly (to Dhritarashtra).'\""

I would also bid farewell to Janardana, to Bhima and Arjuna,\r\nto the son of Madri, to Satyaki, and to Chekitana, and take my departure.\r\nLet peace and happiness be yours. Let all the kings look at me with eyes\r\nof affection.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Permitted by us, O Sanjaya, take your leave. Peace\r\nto thee! O learned man, thou never thinkest ill of us. Both they and we\r\nknow thee to be a person of pure heart in the midst of all in the court\r\n(of the Kurus). Besides, being an ambassador now, O Sanjaya, thou art\r\nfaithful, beloved by us, of agreeable speech and excellent conduct, and\r\nwell-affected towards us. Thy mind is never clouded, and even if\r\naddressed harshly thou art never moved to wrath. O Suta, thou never\r\nutterest harsh and cutting words, or those that are false or bitter. We\r\nknow that thy words, free from malice, are always fraught with morality\r\nand grave import. Amongst envoys thou art the most dear to us. Beside\r\nthee, there is another, who may come here, and that is Vidura. Formerly,\r\nwe always used to see thee. Thou art, indeed, a friend to us as dear as\r\nDhananjaya. Proceeding hence, O Sanjaya, with all speed, thou shouldst\r\nwait upon those Brahmanas of pure energy and devoted to study according\r\nto the Brahmacharya mode,--those, namely, that are devoted to the study\r\nof the Vedas while leading lives of mendicancy, those ascetics that\r\nhabitually dwell in the woods, as also the aged ones of other classes,\r\nshould all be addressed by thee in my name, O Sanjaya, and then their\r\nwelfare should be enquired into by thee. O Suta, repairing unto the\r\npriest of king Dhritarashtra as also unto his preceptors and Ritwijas,\r\nthou shouldst address them and enquire after their welfare. Even amongst\r\nthem that are, though not well-born at least aged, endued with energy,\r\nand possessed of good behaviour and strength, who remembering speak of us\r\nand practise according to their might even the least virtue, should first\r\nbe informed of my peace, O Sanjaya, and then shouldst thou enquire after\r\ntheir welfare. Thou shouldst also enquire after the welfare of those that\r\nlive in the kingdom carrying on trade, and those that live there filling\r\nimportant offices of state. Our beloved preceptor Drona, who is fully\r\nversed in morality, who is our counsellor, who had practised the\r\nBrahmacharya vow for mastering the Vedas, who once again hath made the\r\nscience of weapons full and complete, and who is always graciously\r\ninclined towards us, should be greeted by thee in our name. Thou shouldst\r\nalso enquire into the welfare of Aswatthaman, endued with great learning,\r\ndevoted to the study of the Vedas, leading the Brahmacharya mode of life,\r\npossessed of great activity, and like unto a youth of the Gandharva race,\r\nand who, besides, hath once again made the science of weapons full and\r\ncomplete. Thou must also, O Sanjaya, repair to the abode of Kripa, the\r\nson of Saradwat, that mighty car-warrior and foremost of all persons\r\nhaving a knowledge of self, and repeatedly saluting him in my name touch\r\nhis feet with thy hand. Thou shouldst also, touching his feet, represent\r\nme as hale unto that foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma, in whom are combined\r\nbravery, and abstention from injury, and asceticism, and wisdom and good\r\nbehaviour, and Vedic learning, and great excellence, and firmness.\r\nSaluting unto also the wise, venerable, and blind king (Dhritarashtra),\r\nwho possessed of great learning and reverential to the old, is the leader\r\nof the Kurus. Thou shouldst also, O Sanjaya, enquire, O sire, about the\r\nwelfare of the eldest of Dhritarashtra's sons, Suyodhana, who is wicked\r\nand ignorant and deceitful and vicious, and who now governs the entire\r\nworld. Thou shouldst also enquire about the welfare of even the wicked\r\nDussasana, that mighty bowman and hero among the Kurus, who is the\r\nyounger of Duryodhana and who possesses a character like that of his\r\nelder brother. Thou shouldst, O Sanjaya, also salute the wise chief of\r\nthe Vahlikas, who always cherishes no other wish save that there should\r\nbe peace among the Bharatas. I think, thou shouldst also worship that\r\nSomadatta who is endued with numerous excellent qualities, who is wise\r\nand possesses a merciful heart, and who from his affection for the Kurus\r\nalways controls his anger towards them. The son of Somadatta is worthy of\r\nthe greatest reverence among the Kurus. He is my friend and is a brother\r\nto us. A mighty bowman and the foremost of car-warriors, he is worthy in\r\nall respects. Thou shouldst, O Sanjaya, enquire after his welfare along\r\nwith that of his friends and counsellors. Others there are of youthful\r\nage and of consideration amongst the Kurus, who bear a relationship to us\r\nlike that of sons, grandsons, and brothers. Unto each of these thou must\r\nspeak words which thou mayst consider suitable, enquiring, O Suta, after\r\nhis welfare. Thou must also enquire about the welfare of those kings that\r\nhave been assembled by Dhritarashtra's son for fighting with the\r\nPandavas, viz., the Kekayas, the Vasatis, the Salwakas, the Amvashthas,\r\nand the leading Trigartas, and of those endued with great bravery that\r\nhave come from the east, the north, the south, and the west, and of those\r\nthat have come from hilly countries, in fact, of all amongst them that\r\nare not cruel and that lead good lives. Thou shouldst also represent unto\r\nall those persons who ride on elephants, and horses and cars, and who\r\nfight on foot,--that mighty host composed of honourable men,--that I am\r\nwell, and then thou must enquire about their own welfare. Thou must also\r\nenquire about the welfare of those that serve the king in the matter of\r\nhis revenue or as his door-keepers, or as the leaders of his troops, or\r\nas the accountants of his income and outlay, or as officers constantly\r\noccupied in looking after other important concerns. Thou must, O sire,\r\nalso enquire about the welfare of Dhritarashtra's son by his Vaisya\r\nwife,--that youth who is one of the best of the Kuru race,--who never\r\nfalls into error, who possesseth vast wisdom, who is endued with every\r\nvirtue, and who never cherishes a liking for this war! Thou shouldst also\r\nask about the welfare of Chitrasena who is unrivalled in the tricks of\r\ndice, whose tricks are never detected by others, who plays well, who is\r\nwell-versed in the art of handling the dice, and who is unconquerable in\r\nplay but not in fight. Thou must also, O sire, enquire about the welfare\r\nof Sakuni, the king of the Gandharas, that native of the hilly country,\r\nwho is unrivalled in deceitful games at dice, who enhances the pride of\r\nDhritarashtra's son, and whose understanding naturally leads to\r\nfalsehood. Thou must also enquire about the welfare of Karna, the son of\r\nVikartana, that hero who is ready to vanquish, alone and unassisted,\r\nmounted on his car, the Pandavas whom no one dares assail in battle, that\r\nKarna who is unparalleled in deluding those that are already deluded.\r\nThou must also enquire about the welfare of Vidura, O sire, who alone is\r\ndevoted to us, who is our instructor, who reared us, who is our father\r\nand mother and friend, whose understanding finds obstruction in nought,\r\nwhose ken reaches far, and who is our counsellor. Thou must also salute\r\nall the aged dames and those who are known to be possessed of merit, and\r\nthose who are like mothers to us, meeting them gathered together in one\r\nplace. Thou must tell them, O Sanjaya, these words at first,--Ye mothers\r\nof living sons, I hope, your sons comfort themselves towards you in a\r\nkindly, considerate, and worthy way.--Thou must then tell them that\r\nYudhishthira is doing well with his sons. Those ladies, O Sanjaya, who\r\nare in the rank of our wives, thou must ask as to their welfare also\r\naddressing them in these words,--I hope, you are well-protected. I hope,\r\nyour fair fame hath suffered no injury. I hope, you are dwelling within\r\nyour abodes blamelessly and carefully. I hope, you are comforting\r\nyourselves towards your fathers-in-law in a kindly, praise-worthy and\r\nconsiderate way. You must steadily adopt such a conduct for yourselves as\r\nwill help you to win your husband's favour! Those young ladies, O\r\nSanjaya, who bear a relationship to us like that of your\r\ndaughters-in-law, who have been brought from high families, who are\r\npossessed of merit and who are mothers of children,--thou must meet them\r\nall and tell them that Yudhishthira send his kindly greetings to them.\r\nThou must, O Sanjaya, embrace the daughters of your house, and must ask\r\nthem about their welfare on my behalf. Thou must tell them,--May your\r\nhusbands be kindly and agreeable; may you be agreeable to your husbands;\r\nmay you have ornaments and clothes and perfumery and cleanliness; may you\r\nbe happy and have at your command the joys of life; may your looks be\r\npretty and words pleasant; Thou must ask, O sire, the women of the house\r\nas to their welfare. Thou must also represent unto the maid-servants and\r\nman-servants there, may be of the Kurus, and also the many humpbacked and\r\nlame ones among them, that I am doing well, and thou must then ask them\r\nabout their welfare. Thou must tell them,--I hope, Dhritarashtra's son\r\nstill vouchsafes the same kindly treatment to you. I hope, he gives you\r\nthe comforts of life.--Thou must also represent unto those that are\r\ndefective in limb, those that are imbecile, the dwarfs to whom\r\nDhritarashtra gives food and raiment from motives of humanity, those that\r\nare blind, and all those that are aged, as also to the many that have the\r\nuse only of their hands being destitute of legs, that I am doing well,\r\nand that I ask them regarding their welfare, addressing them in the\r\nfollowing words,--Fear not, nor be dispirited on account of your unhappy\r\nlives so full of sufferings; no doubt, sins must have been committed by\r\nyou in your former lives. When I shall check my foes, and delight my\r\nfriends, I shall satisfy you by gifts of food and clothes.--Thou shouldst\r\nalso, O sire, at our request, enquire after the welfare of those that are\r\nmasterless and weak, and of those that vainly strive to earn a living,\r\nand of those that are ignorant, in fact, of all those persons that are in\r\npitiable circumstances. O charioteer, meeting those others, that coming\r\nfrom different quarters, have sought the protection of the\r\nDhritarashtras, and in fact, all who deserve our greetings, thou shouldst\r\nalso enquire about their welfare and peace. Thou shouldst also enquire\r\nabout the welfare of those who have come to the Kurus of their own accord\r\nor who have been invited, as also of all the ambassadors arrived from all\r\nsides and then represent unto them that I am well. As regards the\r\nwarriors that have been obtained by Dhritarashtra's son, there are none\r\nequal to them on earth. Virtue, however, is eternal, and virtue is my\r\npower for the destruction of my enemies. Thou shouldst, O Sanjaya, also\r\nrepresent unto Suyodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, the following,--That\r\ndesire of thine which torments thy heart, viz., the desire of ruling the\r\nKurus without a rival, is very unreasonable. It had no justification. As\r\nfor ourselves, we will never act in such a way as to do anything that may\r\nbe disagreeable to thee! O foremost of heroes anwng the Bharatas, either\r\ngive me lack my own Indraprastha or fight with me!'\""

If\r\nDhritarashtra ask thee about our strength, tell him everything truly,\r\nhaving cheerfully consulted with everyone here and ascertained the truth.\r\nO son of Gavalgana, repairing unto the Kurus, thou wilt salute the mighty\r\nDhritarashtra, and touching his feet enquire after his welfare speaking\r\nin our name. And when seated in the midst of the Kurus, tell him from\r\nus.--The sons of Pandu, O king, are living happily in consequence of thy\r\nprowess. It was through thy grace, O repressor of foes, that those\r\nchildren of tender years had obtained a kingdom. Having first bestowed a\r\nkingdom on them, thou shouldst not now be indifferent to them, for\r\ndestruction then would overtake them! The whole of this kingdom, O\r\nSanjaya, is not fit to be owned by one person. Tell him again, from\r\nus.--O sire, we wish to live united. Do not suffer thyself to be\r\nvanquished by foes.--Thou shouldst again, O Sanjaya, bending thy head, in\r\nmy name salute the grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu. Having saluted our grandsire, he should then be told.--By thee,\r\nwhen Santanu's race was about to be extinct, it was revived. Therefore, O\r\nsire, do that according to thy own judgment by which thy grandsons may\r\nall live in amity with one another. Thou shouldst then address Vidura\r\nalso, that adviser of the Kurus, saying.--Counseleth peace, O amiable\r\none, from desire of doing good unto Yudhishthira.--Thou shouldst address\r\nthe unforbearing prince Duryodhana also, when seated in the midst of the\r\nKurus, beseeching him again and again, saying,--The insults thou hadst\r\noffered to innocent and helpless Draupadi in the midst of the assembly,\r\nwe will quietly bear, simply because we have no mind to see the Kurus\r\nslain. The other injuries also, both before and after that, the sons of\r\nPandu are quietly bearing, although they are possessed of might to avenge\r\nthem. All this, indeed, the Kauravas know. O amiable one, thou hadst even\r\nexiled us dressed in deer-skins. We are bearing that also because we do\r\nnot want to see the Kurus slain. Dussasana, in obedience to thee, had\r\ndragged Krishna, disregarding Kunti. That act also will be forgiven by\r\nus. But, O chastiser of foes, we must have our proper share of the\r\nkingdom. O bull among men, turn thy coveting heart from what belongeth to\r\nothers. Peace then, O king, will be amongst our gladdened selves. We are\r\ndesirous of peace; give us even a single province of the empire. Give us\r\neven Kusasthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, and for the fifth any\r\nother that thou likest. Even this will end the quarrel. O Suyodhana, give\r\nunto thy five brothers at least five villages,--O Sanjaya, O thou of\r\ngreat wisdom, let there be peace between us and our cousins. Tell him\r\nalso,--Let brothers follow brothers, let sires unite with sons. Let the\r\nPanchalas mingle with the Kurus in merry laughter. That I may see the\r\nKurus and the Panchalas whole and sound, is what I desire. O bull of the\r\nBharata race, with, cheerful hearts let us make peace. O Sanjaya, I am\r\nequally capable of war and peace. I am prepared to acquire wealth as well\r\nas to earn virtue. I am fit enough for severity as for softness.'\""

Reaching Hastinapura he quickly entered it,\r\nand presented himself at the gate of the inner apartments of the palace.\r\nAddressing the porter, he said, 'O gate-keeper, say unto Dhritarashtra\r\nthat I, Sanjaya, have just arrived, coming from the sons of Pandu. Do not\r\ndelay. If the king be awake, then only shouldst thou say so, O keeper,\r\nfor I like to enter having first apprised him of my arrival. In the\r\npresent instance I have something of very great importance to\r\ncommunicate.' Hearing this, the gate-keeper went to the king and\r\naddressed him, saying, 'O lord of earth, I bow to thee. Sanjaya is at thy\r\ngates, desirous of seeing thee. He cometh, bearing a message from the\r\nPandavas. Issue your commands, O king, as to what he should do.'\r\n\r\n\"The king said, 'Tell Sanjaya that I am happy and hale. Let him enter.\r\nWelcome to Sanjaya. I am always ready to receive him. Why should he stay\r\noutside whose admission is never forbidden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, with the king's permission, having\r\nentered that spacious apartment, the Suta's son, with joined hands,\r\napproached the royal son of Vichitravirya who was protected by many wise,\r\nvaliant, and righteous persons, and who was then seated on his throne.\r\nAnd Sanjaya addressed him, saying, 'I am Sanjaya, O king. I bow unto\r\nthee. O chief of men, proceeding hence I found the sons of Pandu. After\r\nhaving paid his salutations to thee, Pandu's son, the intelligent\r\nYudhishthira, enquired of thy welfare. And well-pleased, he also\r\nenquireth after thy sons, and asketh thee whether thou art happy with thy\r\nsons and grandsons and friends and counsellors, and, O king, all those\r\nthat depend upon thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O child, giving my blessings to Ajatasatru, I ask\r\nthee, O Sanjaya, whether that king of the Kauravas, Pritha's son, is well\r\nwith his sons and brothers and counsellors.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Pandu's son is well with his counsellors. He desires\r\npossessions of that which he formerly had as his own. He seeketh virtue\r\nand wealth without doing anything that is censurable, possesseth\r\nintelligence and vast learning, and is, besides, far-sighted and of\r\nexcellent disposition. With that son of Pandu, abstention from injury is\r\neven superior to virtue, and virtue superior to the accumulation of\r\nwealth. His mind, O Bharata, is always inclined to happiness and joy, and\r\nto such course of action as are virtuous and conducive to the higher ends\r\nof life. Even like doll pulled this way and that by threads, man (in this\r\nworld) moveth, swayed by a force not his own. Beholding the sufferings of\r\nYudhishthira, I regard the force of destiny to be Superior to the effect\r\nof human exertion. Beholding again thy unworthy deeds, which, besides,\r\nbeing highly sinful and unspeakable, are sure to terminate in misery, it\r\nseemeth to me that one of thy nature winneth praise only so long as his\r\nable foe bideth his time. Renouncing all sin, even as a serpent casteth\r\noff its worn out slough which it cannot any longer retain, the heroic\r\nAjatasatru shineth in his natural perfection, leaving his load of sins to\r\nbe borne by thee. Consider, O king, thy own acts which are contrary to\r\nboth religion and profit, and to the behaviour of those that are\r\nrighteous. Thou hast, O king, earned a bad repute in this world, and wilt\r\nreap misery in the next. Obeying the counsels of thy son thou hopest to\r\nenjoy this doubtful property, keeping them aloof. This unrighteous deed\r\nis loudly bruited about in the world, Therefore, O foremost of the\r\nBharatas, this deed is unworthy of thee. Calamity overtaketh him who is\r\ndeficient in wisdom, or who is of low birth, or who is cruel, or who\r\ncherisheth hostility for a long time, or who is not steady in Kshatriya\r\nvirtues, or is devoid of energy, or is of a bad disposition, in fact, him\r\nwho hath such marks. It is by virtue of luck that a person taketh his\r\nbirth in good race, or becometh strong, or famous, or versed in various\r\nlore, or possesseth the comforts of life, or becometh capable of subduing\r\nhis senses, or discriminating virtue and vice that are always linked\r\ntogether. What person is there, who, attended upon by foremost of\r\ncounsellors, possessed of intelligence, capable of discriminating between\r\nvirtue and vice in times of distress, not destitute of the rituals of\r\nreligion, and retaining the use of all his faculties, would commit cruel\r\ndeeds. These counsellors, ever devoted to thy work, wait here united\r\ntogether. Even this is their firm determination (viz., that the Pandavas\r\nare not to get back their share). The destruction of the Kurus,\r\ntherefore, is certain to be brought about by the force of circumstances.\r\nIf, provoked by the offences, Yudhishthira wisheth for misery to thee,\r\nthen Kurus will be destroyed prematurely, while, imparting all his sins\r\nto thee, the blame of that deed will be thine in this world. Indeed, what\r\nelse is there save the will of the Gods, for Arjuna, the son of Pritha,\r\nleaving this world ascended to the very heavens and was honoured there\r\nvery greatly. This proves that individual exertion is nothing. There is,\r\nno doubt, as to this. Seeing that the attributes of high birth, bravery,\r\netc., depended for their development or otherwise on acts, and beholding\r\nalso prosperity and adversity and stability and instability (in persons\r\nand their possessions), king Vali, in his search after causes, having\r\nfailed to discover a beginning (in the chain of acts of former lives one\r\nbefore another), regarded the eternal Essence to be the cause of\r\neverything. The eye, the ear, the nose, the touch, and the tongue, these\r\nare the doors of a person's knowledge. If desire be curbed, these would\r\nbe gratified by themselves. Therefore, cheerfully and without repining\r\none should control the senses. Others there are that think differently.\r\nThey hold that if a person's acts are well-applied, these must produce\r\nthe desired result. Thus the child begot by the act of the mother and the\r\nfather grows when duly tended with food and drink. Men in this world\r\nbecome subject to love and hate, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. A\r\nman is praised when he behaves honestly. Thee I blame, since these\r\ndissensions of the Bharatas (whose root thou art) will surely bring about\r\nthe destruction of innumerable lives. If peace be not concluded, then\r\nthrough thy fault Arjuna will consume the Kurus like a blazing fire\r\nconsuming a heap of dried grass. O ruler of men, thou alone of all the\r\nworld, yielding to thy son whom no restraints can blind, hadst regarded\r\nthyself as crowned with success and abstained from avoiding dispute at\r\nthe time of the match at dice. Behold now the fruit of that (weakness of\r\nthine)! O monarch, by rejecting advisers that are faithful and accepting\r\nthose that deserve no confidence, this extensive and prosperous empire, O\r\nson of Kuru, thou art unable to retain owing to thy weakness. Wearied by\r\nmy fast journey and very much fatigued, I solicit thy permission to go to\r\nbed now, O lion of men, for tomorrow morning will the Kurus, assembled\r\ntogether in the council-hall, hear the words of Ajatasatru.'\""

Despatched by Dhritarashtra, the messenger went to\r\nKshatri and said, 'O thou of great wisdom, our lord the mighty king\r\ndesireth to see thee.' Thus addressed, Vidura (set out and) coming to the\r\npalace, spoke unto the orderly, 'Apprise Dhritarashtra of my arrival.'\r\nThereupon the orderly went to Dhritarashtra, and said, O, foremost of\r\nkings, Vidura is here at thy command. He wisheth to behold thy feet.\r\nCommand me as to what he is to do.' Thereupon Dhritarashtra said, 'Let\r\nVidura of great wisdom and foresight enter. I am never unwilling or\r\nunprepared to see Vidura.' The orderly then went out and spoke unto\r\nVidura, 'O Kshatri, enter the inner apartments of the wise king. The king\r\nsays that he is never unwilling to see thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having entered Dhritarashtra's chamber, Vidura\r\nsaid with joined hands unto that ruler of men who was then plunged in\r\nthought, 'O thou of great wisdom, I am Vidura, arrived here at thy\r\ncommand. If there is anything to be done, here I am, command me!'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Vidura, Sanjaya hath come back. He hath gone away\r\nafter rebuking me. Tomorrow he will deliver, in the midst of the court,\r\nAjatasatru's message. I have not been able today to ascertain what the\r\nmessage is of the Kuru hero. Therefore, my body is burning, and that hath\r\nproduced sleeplessness. Tell us what may be good for a person that is\r\nsleepless and burning. Thou art, O child, versed in both religion and\r\nprofit. Ever since, Sanjaya hath returned from the Pandavas, my heart\r\nknoweth no peace. Filled with anxiety about what he may deliver, all my\r\nsenses have been disordered'.\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'Sleeplessness overtaketh thief, a lustful person, him that\r\nhath lost all his wealth, him that hath failed to achieve success, and\r\nhim also that is weak and hath been attacked by a strong person. I hope,\r\nO king, that none of these grave calamities have overtaken thee. I hope,\r\nthou dost not grieve, coveting the wealth of others.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I desire to hear from thee words that are\r\nbeneficial and fraught with high morality. In this race of royal Rishis\r\nthou alone art reverenced by the wise.' Vidura replied, 'King\r\n(Yudhishthira), graced with every virtue, is worthy of being the\r\nsovereign of the three worlds; yet, O Dhritarashtra, however worthy of\r\nbeing kept by thy side, he was exiled by thee. Thou art, however,\r\npossessed of qualities which are thy very reverse of those possessed by\r\nhim. Although virtuous and versed in morality, thou hast yet no right to\r\na share in the kingdom owing to thy loss of sight. In consequence of his\r\ninoffensiveness and kindness, his righteousness, love of truth and\r\nenergy, and his remembering the reverence that is due to thee,\r\nYudhishthira patiently bears innumerable wrongs. Having bestowed on\r\nDuryodhana and Suvala's son and Karna, and Dussasana the management of\r\nthe empire, how canst thou hope for prosperity? He that is not served\r\nfrom the high ends of life by the aid of self-knowledge, exertion,\r\nforbearance and steadiness in virtue, is called wise. These again are the\r\nmarks of a wise man, viz., adherence to acts, worthy of praise and\r\nrejection of what is blamable, faith, and reverence. He whom neither\r\nanger nor joy, nor pride, nor false modesty, nor stupefaction, nor\r\nvanity, can draw away from the high ends of life, is considered as wise.\r\nHe whose intended acts, and proposed counsels remain concealed from foes,\r\nand whose acts become known only after they have been done, is considered\r\nwise. He whose proposed actions are never obstructed by heat or cold,\r\nfear of attachment, prosperity or adversity, is considered wise. He whose\r\njudgment dissociated from desire, followeth both virtue and profit, and\r\nwho disregarding pleasure chooseth such ends as are serviceable in both\r\nworlds, is considered wise. They that exert to the best of their might,\r\nand act also to the best of their might, and disregard nothing as\r\ninsignificant, are called wise. He that understandeth quickly, listeneth\r\npatiently, pursueth his objects with judgment and not from desire and\r\nspendeth not his breath on the affairs of others without being asked, is\r\nsaid to possess the foremost mark of wisdom. They that do not strive for\r\nobjects that are unattainable, that do not grieve for what is lost and\r\ngone, that do not suffer their minds to be clouded amid calamities, are\r\nregarded to possess intellects endued with wisdom. He who striveth,\r\nhaving commenced anything, till it is completed, who never wasteth his\r\ntime, and who hath his soul under control, is regarded wise. They that\r\nare wise, O bull of the Bharata race, always delight in honest deeds, do\r\nwhat tendeth to their happiness and prosperity, and never sneer at what\r\nis good. He who exulteth not at honours, and grieveth not at slights, and\r\nremaineth cool and unagitated like a lake in the course of Ganga, is\r\nreckoned as wise. That man who knoweth the nature of all creatures (viz.,\r\nthat everything is subject to destruction), who is cognisant also of the\r\nconnections of all acts, and who is proficient in the knowledge of the\r\nmeans that men may resort to (for attaining their objects), is reckoned\r\nas wise. He who speaketh boldly, can converse on various subjects,\r\nknoweth the science of argumentation, possesseth genius, and can\r\ninterpret the meaning of what is writ in books, is reckoned as wise. He\r\nwhose studies are regulated by reason, and whose reason followeth the\r\nscriptures, and who never abstaineth from paying respect to those that\r\nare good, is called a wise man. He, on the other hand, who is ignorant of\r\nscripture yet vain, poor yet proud, and who resorteth to unfair means for\r\nthe acquisition of his objects, is a fool. He who, forsaking his own,\r\nconcerneth himself with the objects of others, and who practiseth\r\ndeceitful means for serving his friends, is called a fool. He who wisheth\r\nfor those things that should not be desired, and forsaketh those that may\r\nlegitimately be desired, and who beareth malice to those that are\r\npowerful, is regarded to be a foolish soul. He who regardeth his foe as\r\nhis friend, who hateth and beareth malice to his friend, and who\r\ncommitteth wicked deeds, is said to be a person of foolish soul. O bull\r\nof the Bharata race, he who divulgeth his projects, doubteth in all\r\nthings, and spendeth a long time in doing what requireth a short time, is\r\na fool. He who doth not perform the Sraddha for the Pitris, nor\r\nworshippeth the deities, nor acquireth noble-minded friends, is said to\r\nbe a person of foolish soul. That worst of men who entereth a place\r\nuninvited, and talketh much without being asked, and reposeth trust on\r\nuntrustworthy wights, is a fool. That man who being himself guilty\r\ncasteth the blame on others, and who though impotent giveth vent to\r\nanger, is the most foolish of men. That man, who, without knowing his own\r\nstrength and dissociated from both virtue and profit, desireth an object\r\ndifficult of acquisition, without again adopting adequate means, is said\r\nto be destitute of intelligence. O king, he who punisheth one that is\r\nundeserving of punishment, payeth homage to persons without their\r\nknowledge, and waiteth upon misers, is said to be of little sense. But he\r\nthat, having attained immense wealth and prosperity or acquired (vast)\r\nlearning, doth not bear himself haughtily, is reckoned as wise. Who,\r\nagain, is more heartless than he, who, though possessed of affluence,\r\neateth himself and weareth excellent robes himself without distributing\r\nhis wealth among his dependents? While one person committeth sins, many\r\nreap the advantage resulting therefrom; (yet in the end) it is the doer\r\nalone to whom the sin attacheth while those that enjoy the fruit escape\r\nunhurt. When a bowman shooteth an arrow, he may or may not succeed in\r\nslaying even a single person, but when an intelligent individual applieth\r\nhis intelligence (viciously); it may destroy an entire kingdom with the\r\nking. Discriminating the two by means of the one, bring under thy\r\nsubjection the three by means of four, and also conquering the five and\r\nknowing the six, and abstaining from the seven, be happy. Poison slayeth\r\nbut one person, and a weapon also but one; wicked counsels, however,\r\ndestroy an entire kingdom with king and subject. Alone one should not\r\npartake of any savoury viand, nor alone reflect on concerns of profit,\r\nnor alone go upon a journey, nor alone remain awake among sleeping\r\ncompanions. That Being who is One without a second, and whom, O king,\r\nthou hast not been able to comprehend, is Truth's self, and the Way to\r\nheaven, even like a boat in the ocean. There is one only defect in\r\nforgiving persons, and not another; that defect is that people take a\r\nforgiving person to be weak. That defect, however, should not be taken\r\ninto consideration, for forgiveness is a great power. Forgiveness is a\r\nvirtue of the weak, and an ornament of the strong. Forgiveness subdueth\r\n(all) in this world; what is there that forgiveness cannot achieve? What\r\ncan a wicked person do unto him who carrieth the sabre of forgiveness in\r\nhis hand? Fire falling on a grassless ground is extinguished of itself.\r\nAnd unforgiving individual defileth himself with many enormities.\r\nRighteousness is the one highest good; and forgiveness is the one supreme\r\npeace; knowledge is one supreme contentment; and benevolence, one sole\r\nhappiness. Even as a serpent devoureth animals living in holes, the earth\r\ndevoureth these two, viz., a king who is incompetent to fight, and a\r\nBrahmana who doth not sojourn to holy places. A man may attain renown in\r\nthis world by doing two things, viz., by refraining from harsh speech,\r\nand by disregarding those that are wicked. O tiger among men, these two\r\nhave not a will of their own, viz., those women who covet men simply\r\nbecause the latter are coveted by others of their sex, and that person\r\nwho worships another simply because the latter is worshipped by others.\r\nThese two are like sharp thorns afflicting the body, viz., the desires of\r\na poor man, and the anger of the impotent. These two persons never shine\r\nbecause of their incompatible acts, viz., a householder without exertion,\r\nand a beggar busied in schemes. These two, O king, live (as it were) in a\r\nregion higher than heaven itself, viz., a man of power endued with\r\nforgiveness, and poor man that is charitable. Of things honestly got,\r\nthese two must be looked upon as misuse, viz., making gifts to the\r\nunworthy and refusing the worthy. These two should be thrown into the\r\nwater, tightly binding weights to their necks, viz., a wealthy man that\r\ndoth not give away, and a poor man that is proud. These two, O tiger\r\namong men, can pierce the orb itself of the sun, viz., a mendicant\r\naccomplished in yoga, and a warrior that hath fallen in open fight. O\r\nbull of the Bharata race, persons versed in the Vedas have said that\r\nmen's means are good, middling, and bad. Men also, O king, are good,\r\nindifferent, and bad. They should, therefore, be respectively employed in\r\nthat kind of work for which they may be fit. These three, O king, cannot\r\nhave wealth of their own, viz., the wife, the slave, and the son, and\r\nwhatever may be earned by them would be his to whom they belong. Great\r\nfear springeth from these three crimes, viz., theft of other's property,\r\noutrage on other's wives, and breach with friend. These three, besides,\r\nbeing destructive to one's own self, are the gates of hell, viz., lust,\r\nanger, and covetousness. Therefore, every one should renounce them. These\r\nthree should never be forsaken even in imminent danger, viz., a follower,\r\none who seeks protection, saying,--I am thine,--and lastly one who hath\r\ncome to your abode. Verily, O Bharata, liberating a foe from distress,\r\nalone amounteth in point of merit, to these three taken together, viz.,\r\nconferring a boon, acquiring a kingdom, and obtaining a son. Learned men\r\nhave declared that a king, although powerful, should never consult with\r\nthese four, viz., men of small sense, men that are procrastinating, men\r\nthat are indolent, and men that are flatterers. O sire, crowned with\r\nprosperity and leading the life of a householder, let these four dwell\r\nwith thee, viz., old consanguineous, relatives, high-born persons fallen\r\ninto adversity, poor friends, and issueless sisters. On being asked by\r\nthe chief of the celestials, Vrihaspati, O mighty king declared four\r\nthings capable of fructifying or occurring within a single day, viz., the\r\nresolve of the gods, the comprehensions of intelligent persons, the\r\nhumility of learned men, and the destruction of the sinful. These four\r\nthat are calculated to remove fear, bring on fear when they are\r\nimproperly performed, viz., the Agni-hotra, the vow of silence, study,\r\nand sacrifice (in general). O bull of the Bharata race, these five fires,\r\nshould be worshipped with regard by a person, viz., father, mother, fire\r\n(proper), soul and preceptor. By serving these five, men attain great\r\nfame in this world, viz., the gods, the Pitris, men, beggars, and guests.\r\nThese five follow thee wherever thou goest, viz., friends, foes, those\r\nthat are indifferent, dependants, and those that are entitled to\r\nmaintenance. Of the five senses beholding to man, if one springeth a\r\nleak, then from that single hole runneth out all his intelligence, even\r\nlike water running out from a perforated leathern vessel. The six faults\r\nshould be avoided by a person who wisheth to attain prosperity, viz.,\r\nsleep, drowsiness, fear, anger, indolence and procrastination. These six\r\nshould be renounced like a splitting vessel in the sea, viz., a preceptor\r\nthat cannot expound the scriptures, a priest that is illiterate, a king\r\nthat is unable to protect, a wife that speaketh disagreeable words, a\r\ncow-herd that doth not wish to go to the fields, and a barber that\r\nwisheth to renounce a village for the woods. Verily, those six qualities\r\nshould never be forsaken by men, viz., truth, charity, diligence,\r\nbenevolence, forgiveness and patience. These six are instantly destroyed,\r\nif neglected, viz., kine, service, agriculture, a wife, learning, and the\r\nwealth of a Sudra. These six forget those who have bestowed obligations\r\non them, viz., educated disciples, their preceptors; married persons,\r\ntheir mothers; persons whose desires have been gratified, women; they who\r\nhave achieved success, they who had rendered aid; they who have crossed a\r\nriver, the boat (that carried them over); and patients that have been\r\ncured, their physicians. Health, unindebtedness, living at home,\r\ncompanionship with good men, certainty as regards the means of\r\nlivelihood, and living without fear, these six. O king, conduce to the\r\nhappiness of men. These six are always miserable, viz., the envious, the\r\nmalicious, the discontented, the irascible, the ever-suspicious, and\r\nthose depending upon the fortunes of others. These six, O king, comprise\r\nthe happiness of men, viz., acquirement of wealth, uninterrupted health,\r\na beloved and a sweet-speeched wife, an obedient son, and knowledge that\r\nis lucrative. He that succeedeth in gaining the mastery over the six that\r\nare always present in the human heart, being thus the master of his\r\nsenses, never committeth sin, and therefore suffereth calamity. These six\r\nmay be seen to subsist upon other six, viz., thieves, upon persons that\r\nare careless; physicians, on persons that are ailing; women, upon persons\r\nsuffering from lust; priests, upon them that sacrifice; a king, upon\r\npersons that quarrel; and lastly men of learning, upon them that are\r\nwithout it. A king should renounce these seven faults that are productive\r\nof calamity, inasmuch as they are able to effect the ruin of even\r\nmonarchs firmly established; these are women, dice, hunting, drinking,\r\nharshness of speech, severity of punishment, and misuse of wealth. These\r\neight are the immediate indications of a man destined to destruction,\r\nviz., hating the Brahmanas, disputes with Brahmanas, appropriation of a\r\nBrahmana's possessions, taking the life of Brahmana, taking a pleasure in\r\nreviling Brahmanas, grieving to hear the praises of Brahmanas, forgetting\r\nthem on ceremonious occasions, and giving vent to spite when they ask for\r\nanything. These transgressions a wise man should understand, and\r\nunderstanding, eschew. These eight, O Bharata, are the very cream of\r\nhappiness, and these only are attainable here, viz., meeting with\r\nfriends, accession of immense wealth, embracing a son, union for\r\nintercourse, conversation with friends in proper times, the advancement\r\nof persons belong to one's own party, the acquisition of what had been\r\nanticipated, and respect in society. These eight qualities glorify a man,\r\nviz., wisdom, high birth, self-restraint, learning, prowess, moderation\r\nin speech gift according to one's power, and gratitude. This house hath\r\nnine doors, three pillars, and five witnesses. It is presided over by the\r\nsoul. That learned man who knoweth all this is truly wise. O\r\nDhritarashtra, these ten do not know what virtue is viz., the\r\nintoxicated, inattentive, the raving, the fatigued, the angry, the\r\nstarving, the hasty, the covetous, the frightened, and the lustful.\r\nTherefore, he that is wise must eschew the company of these. In this\r\nconnection is cited the old story about what transpired between Suyodhana\r\nand (Prahlada), the chief of the Asuras in relation to the latter's son.\r\nThat king who renounceth lust and anger, who bestoweth wealth upon proper\r\nrecipients, and is discriminating, learned, and active, is regarded as an\r\nauthority of all men. Great prosperity attends upon that king who knoweth\r\nhow to inspire confidence in others, who inflicteth punishment on those\r\nwhose guilt hath been proved, who is acquainted with the proper measure\r\nof punishment, and who knoweth when mercy is to be shown. He is a wise\r\nperson who doth not disregard even a weak foe; who proceeds with\r\nintelligence in respect of a foe, anxiously watching for an opportunity;\r\nwho doth not desire hostilities with persons stronger than himself; and\r\nwho displayeth his prowess in season. That illustrious person who doth\r\nnot grieve when a calamity hath already come upon him, who exerteth with\r\nall his senses collected, and who patiently beareth misery in season, is\r\ncertainly the foremost of persons, and all his foes are vanquished. He\r\nwho doth not live away from hope uselessly, who doth not make friends\r\nwith sinful persons, who never outrageth another's wife, who never\r\nbetrayeth arrogance, and who never committeth a theft or showeth\r\ningratitude or indulgeth in drinking is always happy. He who never\r\nboastfully striveth to attain the three objects of human pursuit, who\r\nwhen asked, telleth the truth, who quarreleth not even for the sake of\r\nfriends, and who never becometh angry though slighted, is reckoned as\r\nwise. He who beareth not malice towards others but is kind to all, who\r\nbeing weak disputeth not with others, who speaketh not arrogantly, and\r\nforgeteth a quarrel, is praised everywhere. That man who never assumeth a\r\nhaughty mien, who never censureth others praising himself the while, and\r\nnever addresseth harsh words to others for getting himself, is ever loved\r\nby all. He who raketh not up old hostilities, who behaveth neither\r\narrogantly nor with too much humility, and who even when distressed never\r\ncommitteth an improper act, is considered by respectable men a person of\r\ngood conduct. He who exulteth not at his own happiness, nor delighteth in\r\nanother's misery, and who repenteth not after having made a gift, is said\r\nto be a man of good nature and conduct. He who desireth to obtain a\r\nknowledge of the customs of different countries, and also the languages\r\nof different nations, and of the usages of different orders of men,\r\nknoweth at once all that is high and low; and wherever he may go, he is\r\nsure to gain an ascendancy over even those that are glad. The intelligent\r\nman who relinquisheth pride, folly, insolence, sinful acts, disloyalty\r\ntowards the king, crookedness of behaviour, enmity with many, and also\r\nquarrels with men that are drunk, mad and wicked, is the foremost of his\r\nspecies. The very gods bestow prosperity upon him who daily practiseth\r\nself-restraint, purification, auspicious rites, worship of the gods,\r\nexpiatory ceremonies, and other rites of universal observance. The acts\r\nof that learned man are well-conceived, and well-applied who formeth\r\nmatrimonial alliances with persons of equal positions and not with those\r\nthat are inferior, who placeth those before him that are more qualified,\r\nand who talketh, behaveth and maketh friendships with persons of equal\r\nposition. He who eateth frugally after dividing the food amongst his\r\ndependants, who sleepeth little after working much, and who, when\r\nsolicited giveth away even unto his foes, hath his soul under control,\r\nand calamities always keep themselves aloof from him. He whose counsels\r\nare well-kept and well-carried out into practice, and whose acts in\r\nconsequence thereof are never known by others to injure men, succeedeth\r\nin securing even his most trifling objects. He who is intent upon\r\nabstaining from injury to all creatures, who is truthful, gentle,\r\ncharitable, and pure in mind, shineth greatly among his kinsmen like a\r\nprecious gem of the purest ray having its origin in an excellent mine.\r\nThat man who feeleth shame even though his faults be not known to any\r\nsave himself, is highly honoured among all men. Possessed of a pure heart\r\nand boundless energy and abstracted within himself, he shineth in\r\nconsequence of his energy like the very sun. King Pandu consumed by a\r\n(Brahmana's) curse, had five sons born unto him in the woods that are\r\nlike five Indras. O son of Ambika, thou hast brought up those children\r\nand taught them everything. They are obedient to thy commands. Giving\r\nthem back their just share of the kingdom, O sire, filled with joy, be\r\nthou happy with thy sons. Then, O monarch, thou shalt inspire confidence\r\nin both the gods and men.'\""

Advise me wisely, O Vidura. O\r\nthou of magnanimous heart, tell me what is thou deemest to be beneficial\r\nfor Ajatasatru and what is productive of good to the Kurus. Apprehending\r\nfuture evils. I look back only on my previous guilt: I ask thee with\r\nanxious heart, O learned one, tell me what is exactly in Ajatasatru's\r\nmind,'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'Even if unasked, one should speak truly, whether his words\r\nbe good or bad, hateful or pleasing, unto him whose defeat one doth not\r\nwish. I shall, therefore, say, O king, what is for the good of the Kurus.\r\nI shall say what is both beneficial and consistent with morality. Listen\r\nto me. Do not, O Bharata, set the heart upon means of success that are\r\nunjust and improper. A man of intelligence must not grieve if any purpose\r\nof his doth not succeed, notwithstanding the application of fair and\r\nproper means. Before one engageth in an act, one should consider the\r\ncompetence of the agent, the nature of the act itself, and its purpose,\r\nfor all acts are dependent on these. Considering these one should begin\r\nan act, and not take it up on a sudden impulse. He that is wise should\r\neither do an act or desist from it fully considering his own ability, the\r\nnature of the act, and the consequence also of success. The king who\r\nknoweth not proportion or measure as regards territory, gain, loss,\r\ntreasury, population, and punishment, cannot retain his kingdom long. He,\r\non the other hand, who is acquainted with the measures of these as\r\nprescribed in treatises, being necessarily possessed of the knowledge of\r\nreligion and profit, can retain his kingdom. As the stars are affected by\r\nthe planets, so is this world affected by the senses, when they are\r\ndirected, uncontrolled, to their respective objects. Like the moon during\r\nthe lighted fortnight, calamities increase in respect of him who is\r\nvanquished by the five senses in their natural state, which ever lead him\r\ntowards various acts. He who wisheth to control his counsellors before\r\ncontrolling his own self, or to subdue his adversaries before controlling\r\nhis counsellors, at last succumbs deprived of strength. He, therefore,\r\nwho first subdueth his own self regarding it as a foe, never faileth to\r\nsubdue his counsellors and adversaries at last. Great prosperity waiteth\r\nupon him who hath subdued his senses, or controlled his soul, or who is\r\ncapable of punishing all offenders, or who acteth with judgment or who is\r\nblessed with patience. One's body, O king, is one's car; the soul within\r\nis the driver; and the senses are its steeds. Drawn by those excellent\r\nsteeds, when well-trained, he that is wise, pleasantly performeth the\r\njourney of life, and awake in peace. The horses that are unbroken and\r\nincapable of being controlled, always lead an unskilful driver to\r\ndestruction in the course of the journey; so one's senses, unsubdued,\r\nlead only to destruction. The inexperienced wight, who, led by this\r\nunsubdued senses, hopeth to extract evil from good and good from evil,\r\nnecessarily confoundeth misery with happiness. He, who, forsaking\r\nreligion and profit, followeth the lead of his senses, loseth without\r\ndelay prosperity, life, wealth and wife. He, who is the master of riches\r\nbut not of his senses, certainly loseth his riches in consequence of his\r\nwant of mastery over his senses. One should seek to know one's self by\r\nmeans of one's own self, controlling one's mind, intellect, and senses,\r\nfor one's self is one's friend as, indeed, it is one's own foe. That man,\r\nwho hath conquered self by means of self, hath his self for a friend, for\r\none's self is ever one's friend or foe. Desire and anger, O king, break\r\nthrough wisdom, just as a large fish breaks through a net of thin cords.\r\nHe, who in this world regarding both religion and profit, seeketh to\r\nacquire the means of success, winneth happiness, possessing all he had\r\nsought. He, who, without subduing his five inner foes of mental origin,\r\nwisheth to vanquish other adversaries, is, in fact, overpowered by the\r\nlatter. It is seen that many evil-minded kings, owing to want of mastery\r\nover their senses, are ruined by acts of their own, occasioned by the\r\nlust of territory. As fuel that is wet burneth with that which is dry, so\r\na sinless man is punished equally with the sinful in consequence of\r\nconstant association with the latter. Therefore, friendship with the\r\nsinful should be avoided. He that, from ignorance, faileth to control his\r\nfive greedy foes, having five distinct objects, is overwhelmed by\r\ncalamities. Guilelessness and simplicity, purity and contentment,\r\nsweetness of speech and self-restraint, truth and steadiness,--these are\r\nnever the attributes of the wicked. Self-knowledge and steadiness,\r\npatience and devotion to virtue, competence to keep counsels and\r\ncharity,--these,--O Bharata, never exist in inferior men. Fools seek to\r\ninjure the wise by false reproaches and evil speeches, The consequence\r\nis, that by this they take upon themselves the sins of the wise, while\r\nthe latter, freed from their sins, are forgiven. In malice lieth the\r\nstrength of the wicked; in criminal code, the strength of kings, in\r\nattentions of the weak and of women; and in forgiveness that of the\r\nvirtuous. To control speech, O king, is said to be most difficult. It is\r\nnot easy to hold a long conversation uttering words full of meaning and\r\ndelightful to the hearers. Well-spoken speech is productive of many\r\nbeneficial results; and ill-spoken speech, O king, is the cause of evils.\r\nA forest pierced by arrows, or cut down by hatchets may again grow, but\r\none's heart wounded and censured by ill-spoken words never recovereth.\r\nWeapons, such as arrows, bullets, and bearded darts, can be easily\r\nextracted from the body, but a wordy dagger plunged deep into the heart\r\nis incapable of being taken out. Wordy arrows are shot from the mouth;\r\nsmitten by them one grieveth day and night. A learned man should not\r\ndischarge such arrows, for do they not touch the very vitals of others.\r\nHe, to whom the gods ordain defeat, hath his senses taken away, and it is\r\nfor this that he stoopeth to ignoble deeds. When the intellect becometh\r\ndim and destruction is nigh, wrong, looking like right., firmly sticketh\r\nto the heart. Thou dost not clearly see it, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nthat clouded intellect hath now possessed thy sons in consequence of\r\ntheir hostility to the Pandavas. Endued with every auspicious mark and\r\ndeserving to rule the three worlds, Yudhishthira is obedient to thy\r\ncommands. Let him, O Dhritarashtra, rule the earth, to the exclusion of\r\nall thy sons, Yudhishthira is the foremost of all thy heirs. Endued with\r\nenergy and wisdom, and acquainted with the truths of religion and profit,\r\nYudhishthira, that foremost of righteous men, hath, O king of kings,\r\nsuffered much misery out of kindness and sympathy, in order to preserve\r\nthy reputation.\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O thou of great intelligence, tell me again words\r\nsuch as these, consistent with religion and profit. My thirst for hearing\r\nthem is not quenched. What thou sayst is charming!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'Ablution in all the holy places and kindness to all\r\ncreatures,--these two are equal. Perhaps, kindness to all creatures\r\nsurpasseth the former. O master, show kindness unto all thy sons, for by\r\nthat winning great fame in this world, thou wilt have heaven hereafter.\r\nAs long as a man's good deeds are spoken of in this world, so long, O\r\ntiger among men, is he glorified in heaven. In this connection is cited\r\nan old story about the conversation between Virochana and Sudhanwan, both\r\nsuitors for Kesini's hand. Once on a time, O king, there was a maiden of\r\nthe name of Kesini, unrivalled for beauty; moved by the desire of\r\nobtaining a good husband, she resolved to choose her lord in Swayamvara.\r\nThen one of the sons of Diti, Virochana by name, went to that spot,\r\ndesirous of obtaining the maiden. Beholding that chief of the Daityas,\r\nKesini addressed him, saying, 'Are Brahmanas superior, O Virochana, or\r\nare the sons of Diti superior? And why also should not Sudhanwan sit on\r\nthe sofa?' Virochana said, 'Sprung from Prajapati himself, we, O Kesini,\r\nare the best and at the top of all creatures, and this world is ours\r\nwithout doubt. Who are the gods, and who are the Brahmanas?' Kesini said,\r\n'We will, O Virochana, stay here in this very pavilion. Sudhanwan will\r\ncome here on the morrow, and let me see both of you sitting together.'\r\nVirochana said, 'O amiable and timid girl, I will do what thou sayst.\r\nThou wilt behold Sudhanwan and myself met together in the morning.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued, 'When the night had passed away and the solar disc had\r\nrisen, Sudhanwan, O best of kings, came to that place where, O master,\r\nVirochana was waiting with Kesini. And Sudhanwan saw there both\r\nPrahlada's son and Kesini. And beholding the Brahmana arrived, Kesini, O\r\nbull of the Bharata race, rising up from hers, offered him a seat, water\r\nto wash his feet, and Arghya. And asked by Virochana (to share his seat)\r\nSudhanwan said, 'O son of Prahlada, I touch thy excellent golden seat. I\r\ncannot, however, suffer myself to be regarded as thy equal, and sit on it\r\nwith thee.' Virochana said, 'A piece of wooden plank, an animal skin, or\r\na mat of grass or straw,--these only, O Sudhanwan, are fit for thee. Thou\r\ndeservest not, however, the same seat with me.' Sudhanwan said, 'Father\r\nand son. Brahmanas of the same age and equal learning, two Kshatriyas,\r\ntwo Vaisyas and two Sudras, can sit together on the same seat, Except\r\nthese, no other can sit together. Your father used to pay his regards to\r\nme, taking a seat lower than that occupied by me. Thou art a child,\r\nbrought tip in every luxury at home and thou understandest nothing.'\r\nVirochana said, 'Staking all the gold, kine, horses, and every other kind\r\nof wealth that we have among the Asuras, let us, O Sudhanwan, ask them\r\nthis question that are able to answer.' Sudhanwan said, 'Let alone your\r\ngold, kine, and heroes, O Virochana? Making our lives forfeited, we will\r\nask them this question that are competent.' Virochana said, 'Wagering our\r\nlives where shall we go? I will not appear before any of the gods and\r\nnever before any among men.' Sudhanwan said, 'Having wagered our lives,\r\nwe will approach thy father, for he, Prahlada, will never say an untruth\r\neven for the sake of his son.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued, 'Having thus laid a wager, Virochana and Sudhanwan,\r\nboth moved by rage, proceeded to that place where Prahlada was. And\r\nbeholding them together, Prahlada said, 'These two who had never before\r\nbeen companions, are now seen together coming hither by the same road,\r\nlike two angry snakes. Have ye now become companions,--ye who were never\r\ncompanions before? I ask thee, O Virochana, has there been friendship\r\nbetween thee and Sudhanwan?' Virochana said, 'There is no friendship\r\nbetween me and Sudhanwan. On the other hand, we have both wagered our\r\nlives. O chief of the Asuras, I shall ask thee a question, do not answer\r\nit untruly!' Prahlada said, 'Let water, and honey and curds, be brought\r\nfor Sudhanwan. Thou deservest our worship, O Brahmana. A white and fat\r\ncow is ready for thee.' Sudhanwan said, 'Water and honey and curds, have\r\nbeen presented to me on my way hither. I shall ask thee a question.\r\nPrahlada, answer it truly! are Brahmanas superior, or is Virochana\r\nsuperior?' Prahlada said, O Brahmana, this one is my only son. Thou also\r\nart present here in person. How can one like us answer a question about\r\nwhich ye two have quarrelled? Sudhanwan said, 'Give unto thy son thy kine\r\nand other precious wealth that thou mayst have, but, O wise one, thou\r\nshouldst declare the truth when we two are disputing about it.' Prahlada\r\nsaid, 'How doth that misuser of his tongue suffer, O Sudhanwan, who\r\nanswereth not truly but falsely, a question that is put to him? I ask\r\nthee this.' Sudhanwan said, 'The person that misuseth his tongue suffers\r\nlike the deserted wife, who pineth, at night, beholding her husband\r\nsleeping in the arms of a co-wife; like a person who hath lost at dice,\r\nor who is weighed down with an unbearable load of anxieties. Such a man\r\nhath also to stay, starving outside the citygates, into which his\r\nadmission is barred. Indeed, he that giveth false evidence is destined to\r\nalways find his foes. He that speaketh a lie on account of an animal,\r\ncasteth down from heaven five of his sires of the ascending order. He\r\nthat speaketh a lie on account of a cow casteth down from heaven ten of\r\nhis ancestors. A lie on account of a horse causeth the downfall of a\r\nhundred; and a lie on account of a human being, the downfall of a\r\nthousand of one's sires of the ascending order. An untruth on account of\r\ngold ruineth the members of one's race both born and unborn, while an\r\nuntruth for the sake of land ruineth everything. Therefore, never speak\r\nan untruth for the sake of land.' Prahlada said, 'Angiras is superior to\r\nmyself, and Sudhanwan is superior to thee, O Virochana. Mother also of\r\nSudhanwan is superior to thy mother; therefore, thou, O Virochana, hath\r\nbeen defeated by Sudhanwan. This Sudhanwan is now the master of thy life.\r\nBut, O Sudhanwan, I wish that thou shouldst grant Virochana his life.'\r\nSudhanwan said, 'Since, O Prahlada, thou hast preferred virtue and hast\r\nnot, from temptation, said an untruth, I grant thy son his life that is\r\ndear to thee. So here is thy son Virochana, O Prahlada, restored by me to\r\nthee. He shall, however, have to wash my feet in the presence of the\r\nmaiden Kesini.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued, 'For these reasons, O king of kings, it behoveth thee\r\nnot to say an untruth for the sake of land. Saying an untruth from\r\naffection for thy son, O king, hasten not to destruction, with all thy\r\nchildren and counsellors. The gods do not protect men, taking up clubs in\r\ntheir hands after the manner of herdsmen; unto those, however, they wish\r\nto protect, they grant intelligence. There is no doubt that one's objects\r\nmeet with success in proportion to the attention he directs to\r\nrighteousness and morality. The Vedas never rescue from sin a deceitful\r\nperson living by falsehood. On the other hand, they forsake him while he\r\nis on his death-bed, like newly fledged birds forsaking their nests.\r\nDrinking, quarrels, enmity with large numbers of men, all connections\r\nwith connubial disputes, and severance of relationship between husband\r\nand wife, internal dissensions, disloyalty to the king,--these and all\r\npaths that are sinful, should, it is said, be avoided. A palmist, a thief\r\nturned into a merchant, a fowler, a physician, an enemy, a friend, and a\r\nminstrel, these seven are incompetent as witness. An Agnihotra performed\r\nfrom motives of pride, abstention from speech, practised from similar\r\nmotives, study and sacrifice from the same motives,--these four, of\r\nthemselves innocent, become harmful when practised unduly. One that\r\nsetteth fire to a dwelling house, an administerer of poison, a pander, a\r\nvendor of the Soma-juice, a maker of arrows, an astrologer, one that\r\ninjureth friends, an adulterer, one that causeth abortion, a violater of\r\nhis preceptor's bed, a Brahmana addicted to drink, one that is\r\nsharp-speeched, a raker of old sores, an atheist, a reviler of the Vedas,\r\nand taker of bribes, one whose investiture with the sacred thread has\r\nbeen delayed beyond the prescribed age, one that secretly slayeth cattle,\r\nand one that slayeth him who prayeth for protection,--these all are\r\nreckoned as equal in moral turpitude as the slayers of Brahmanas. Gold is\r\ntested by fire; a well-born person, by his deportment; an honest man, by\r\nhis conduct. A brave man is tested during a season of panic; he that is\r\nself-controlled, in times of poverty; and friends and foes, in times of\r\ncalamity and danger. Decrepitude destroyeth beauty; ambitious hopes,\r\npatience; death, life, envy, righteousness, anger, prosperity,\r\ncompanionship with the low, good behaviour; lust, modesty, and pride,\r\neverything. Prosperity taketh its birth in good deeds, groweth in\r\nconsequence of activity, driveth its roots deep in consequence of skill,\r\nand acquireth stability owing to self-control. Wisdom, good lineage,\r\nself-control, acquaintance with the scriptures, prowess, absence of\r\ngarrulity, gift to the extent of one's power, and grateful ness,--these\r\neight qualities shed a lustre upon their possessor. But, O sire, there is\r\none endowment which alone can cause all these attributes to come\r\ntogether; the fact is, when the king honoureth a particular person, the\r\nroyal favour can cause all these attributes to shed their lustre (on the\r\nfavourite). Those eight, O king, in the world of men, are indications of\r\nheaven. Of the eight (mentioned below) four are inseparably connected,\r\nwith the good, and four others are always followed by the good. The first\r\nfour which are inseparably connected with the good, are sacrifice, gift,\r\nstudy and asceticism, while the other four that are always followed by\r\nthe good, are self-restraint, truth, simplicity, and abstention from\r\ninjury to all.\r\n\r\n'Sacrifice, study, charity, asceticism, truth, forgiveness, mercy, and\r\ncontentment constitute the eight different paths of righteousness. The\r\nfirst four of these may be practised from motives of pride, but the last\r\nfour can exist only in those that are truly noble. That is no assembly\r\nwhere there are no old men, and they are not old who do not declare what\r\nmorality is. That is not morality which is separated from truth, and that\r\nis not truth which is fraught with deceit. Truth, beauty, acquaintance\r\nwith the scriptures, knowledge, high birth, good behaviour, strength,\r\nwealth, bravery, and capacity for varied talk,--these ten are of heavenly\r\norigin. A sinful person, by committing sin, is overtaken by evil\r\nconsequences. A virtuous man, by practising virtue, reapeth great\r\nhappiness. Therefore, a man, rigidly resolved, should abstain from sin.\r\nSin, repeatedly perpetrated, destroyeth intelligence; and the man who\r\nhath lost intelligence, repeatedly committeth sin. Virtue, repeatedly\r\npractised, enhanceth intelligence; and the man whose intelligence hath\r\nincreased, repeatedly practiseth virtue. The virtuous man, by practising\r\nvirtue, goeth to regions of blessedness. Therefore, a man should, firmly\r\nresolved, practise virtue. He that is envious, he that injureth others\r\ndeeply, he that is cruel, he that constantly quarreleth, he that is\r\ndeceitful, soon meeteth with great misery for practising these sins. He\r\nthat is not envious and is possessed of wisdom, by always doing what is\r\ngood, never meeteth with great misery; on the other hand, he shineth\r\neverywhere. He that draweth wisdom from them that are wise is really\r\nlearned and wise. And he that is wise, by attending to both virtue and\r\nprofit, succeedeth in attaining to happiness. Do that during the day\r\nwhich may enable thee to pass the night in happiness; and do that during\r\neight months of the year which may enable thee to pass the season of\r\nrains happily. Do that during youth which may ensure a happy old age; and\r\ndo that during thy whole life here which may enable thee to live happily\r\nhereafter. The wise prize that food which is easily digested, that wife\r\nwhose youth hath passed away, that hero who is victorious and that\r\nascetic whose efforts have been crowned with success. The gap that is\r\nsought to be filled by wealth acquired wrongfully, remaineth uncovered,\r\nwhile new ones appear in other places. The preceptor controlleth them\r\nwhose souls are under their own control; the king controlleth persons\r\nthat are wicked; while they that sin secretly have their controller in\r\nYama, the son of Vivaswat. The greatness of Rishis, of rivers, of\r\nriver-banks, of high-souled men, and the cause of woman's wickedness,\r\ncannot be ascertained. O king, he that is devoted to the worship of the\r\nBrahmanas, he that giveth away, he that behaveth righteously towards his\r\nrelatives, and the Kshatriya that behaveth nobly, rule the earth for\r\never. He that is possessed of bravery, he that is possessed of learning,\r\nand he that knows how to protect others,--these three are always able to\r\ngather flowers of gold from the earth. Of acts, those accomplished by\r\nintelligence are first; those accomplished by the arms, second; those by\r\nthe thighs, and those by bearing weights upon the head, are the very\r\nworst. Reposing the care of thy kingdom on Duryodhana, on Sakuni, on\r\nfoolish Dussasana, and on Karna, how canst thou hope for prosperity?\r\nPossessed of every virtue, the Pandavas, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\ndepend on thee as their father. O, repose thou on them as on thy sons!\""

      "content": "\"Vidura said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse\r\nbetween the son of Atri and the deities called Sadhyas is as heard by us.\r\nIn days of old, the deities known by the name of Sadhyas questioned the\r\nhighly wise and great Rishi of rigid vows (the son of Atri), while the\r\nlatter was wandering in the guise of one depending on eleemosynary\r\ncharity for livelihood. The Sadhyas said, 'We are, O great Rishi, deities\r\nknown as Sadhyas. Beholding thee, we are unable to guess who thou art. It\r\nseemeth to us, however, that thou art possessed of intelligence and\r\nself-control in consequence of acquaintance with the scriptures. It,\r\ntherefore, behoveth thee to discourse to us in magnanimous words fraught\r\nwith learning.' The mendicant Rishi answered, 'Ye immortals, it hath been\r\nheard by me that by untying all the knots in the heart by the aid of\r\ntranquillity, and by mastery over all the passions, and observance of\r\ntrue religion, one should regard both the agreeable and the disagreeable\r\nlike his own self. One should not return the slanders or reproaches of\r\nothers for the pain that is felt by him who beareth silently, consumeth\r\nthe slanderer; and he that beareth, succeedeth also in appropriating the\r\nvirtues of the slanderer. Indulge not in slanders and reproaches. Do not\r\nhumiliate and insult others. Quarrel not with friends. Abstain from\r\ncompanionship with those that are vile and low. Be not arrogant and\r\nignoble in conduct. Avoid words that are harsh and fraught with anger.\r\nHarsh words burn and scorch the very vitals, bones, heart, and the very\r\nsources of the life of men. Therefore, he, that is virtuous, should\r\nalways abstain from harsh and angry words. That worst of men is of harsh\r\nand wrathful speech, who pierceth the vitals of others with wordy thorns,\r\nbeareth hell in his tongue, and should ever be regarded as a dispenser of\r\nmisery to men. The man that is wise, pierced by another's wordy arrows,\r\nsharp-pointed and smarting like fire or the sun, should, even if deeply\r\nwounded and burning with pain, bear them patiently remembering that the\r\nslanderer's merits become his. He that waiteth upon one that is good or\r\nupon one that is wicked, upon one that is possessed of ascetic merit or\r\nupon one that is a thief, soon taketh the colour from that companion of\r\nhis, like a cloth from the dye in which it is soaked. The very gods\r\ndesire his company, who, stung with reproach, returneth if not himself\r\nnor causeth others to return it, or who being struck doth not himself\r\nreturn the blow nor causeth other to do it, and who wisheth not the\r\nslightest injury to him that injureth him. Silence, it is said, is better\r\nthan speech, if speak you must, then it is better to say the truth; if\r\ntruth is to be said, it is better to say what is agreeable; and if what\r\nis agreeable is to be said, then it is better to say what is consistent\r\nwith morality. A man becometh exactly like him with whom he liveth, or\r\nlike him whom he regardeth, or like that which he wisheth to be. One is\r\nfreed from those things from which one abstaineth, and if one abstaineth\r\nfrom everything he hath not to suffer even the least misery. Such a man\r\nneither vanquisheth others, nor is vanquished by others. He never\r\ninjureth nor opposeth others. He is unmoved by praise or blame. He\r\nneither grieveth nor exalteth in joy. That man is regarded as the first\r\nof his species who wisheth for the prosperity of all and never setteth\r\nhis heart on the misery of others, who is truthful in speech, humble in\r\nbehaviour, and hath all his passions under control. That man is regarded\r\nas a mediocre in goodness who never consoleth others by saying what is\r\nnot true; who giveth having promise; and who keepeth an eye over the\r\nweakness of others. These, however, are the indications of a bad man,\r\nviz., incapacity to be controlled; liability to be afflicted by dangers;\r\nproneness to give way to wrath, ungratefulness; inability to become\r\nanother's friend, and wickedness of heart. He too is the worst of men,\r\nwho is dissatisfied with any good that may come to him from others who is\r\nsuspicious of his own self, and who driveth away from himself all his\r\ntrue friends. He that desireth prosperity to himself, should wait upon\r\nthem that are good, and at times upon them that are indifferent, but\r\nnever upon them that are bad. He that is wicked, earneth wealth, it is\r\ntrue, by putting forth his strength, by constant effort, by intelligence,\r\nand by prowess, but he can never win honest fame, nor can he acquire the\r\nvirtues and manners of high families (in any of which he may be born).'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'The gods, they that regard both virtue and profit\r\nwithout swerving from either, and they that are possessed of great\r\nlearning, express a liking for high families. I ask thee, O Vidura, this\r\nquestion,--what are those families that are called high?'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'Asceticism, self-restraint, knowledge of the Vedas,\r\nsacrifices, pure marriages, and gifts of food,--those families in which\r\nthese seven exist or are practised duly, are regarded as high. There are\r\nhigh families who deviate not from the right course whose deceased\r\nancestors are never pained (by witnessing the wrong-doings of their\r\ndescendants), who cheerfully practise all the virtues, who desire to\r\nenhance the pure fame of the line in which they are born, and who avoid\r\nevery kind of falsehood. Families that are high, fall down and become low\r\nowing to the absence of sacrifices, impure marriages, abandonment of the\r\nVedas, and insults offered to Brahmanas. High families fall off and\r\nbecome low owing to their members disregarding or speaking ill of\r\nBrahmanas, or to the misappropriation, O Bharata, of what had been\r\ndeposited with them by others. Those families that are possessed of\r\nmembers, wealth and kine, are not regarded as families if they be wanting\r\nin good manners and conduct, while families wanting in wealth but\r\ndistinguished by manners and good conduct are regarded as such and win\r\ngreat reputation. Therefore, should good manners and good conduct be\r\nmaintained with care, for, as regards wealth, it cometh or goeth. He that\r\nis wanting in wealth is not really wanting, but he that is wanting in\r\nmanners and conduct is really in want. Those families that abound in kine\r\nand other cattle and in the produce of the field are not really worthy of\r\nregard and fame if they be wanting in manners and conduct. Let none in\r\nour race be a fomenter of quarrels, none serve a king as minister, none\r\nsteal the wealth of others, none provoke intestine dissensions, none be\r\ndeceitful or false in behaviour, and none eat before serving the Rishis,\r\nthe gods, and guests. He, in our race, who slayeth Brahmanas, or\r\nentertaineth feelings of aversion towards them, or impedeth or otherwise\r\ninjureth agriculture, doth not deserve to mix with us. Straw (for a\r\nseat), ground (for sitting upon), water (to wash the feet and face), and,\r\nfourthly sweet words,--these are never wanting in the houses of the good.\r\nVirtuous men devoted to the practice of righteous acts, when desirous of\r\nentertaining (guests), have these things ready for being offered with\r\nreverence. As the Sandal tree, O king, though thin, is competent to bear\r\nweights which timbers of other trees (much thicker) cannot; so they that\r\nbelong to high families are always able to bear the weight of great cares\r\nwhich ordinary men cannot. He is no friend whose anger inspireth fear, or\r\nwho is to be waited upon with fear. He, however, on whom one can repose\r\nconfidence as on a father, is a true friend. Other friendships are\r\nnominal connection. He that beareth himself as a friend, even though\r\nunconnected by birth of blood, is a true friend, a real refuge, and a\r\nprotector. He, whose heart is unsteady, or who doth not wait upon the\r\naged, or who is of a restless disposition cannot make friends. Success\r\n(in the attainment of objects) forsaketh the person whose heart is\r\nunsteady, or who hath no control over his mind, or who is a slave of his\r\nsenses, like swans forsaking a tank whose waters have dried up. They that\r\nare of weak minds suddenly give way to anger and are gratified without\r\nsufficient cause; they are like clouds that are so inconstant. The very\r\nbirds of prey abstain from touching the dead bodies of those who having\r\nbeen served and benefited by friends, show ingratitude to the latter.\r\nBeest thou poor or beest thou rich, thou shouldst honour thy friends.\r\nUntil some service is asked, the sincerity or otherwise of friends cannot\r\nbe known. Sorrow killeth beauty; sorrow killeth strength; sorrow killeth\r\nthe understanding; and sorrow bringeth on disease. Grief, instead of\r\nhelping the acquisition of his object, drieth up the body, and maketh\r\none's foes glad. Therefore, do not yield to grief, Men repeatedly die and\r\nare reborn; repeatedly they wither away and grow; repeatedly they ask\r\nothers for help, and they themselves are asked for help; repeatedly they\r\nlament and are lamented. Happiness and misery, plenty and want, gain and\r\nloss, life and death, are shared by all in due order. Therefore, he that\r\nis self-controlled should neither exult in joy nor repine in sorrow. The\r\nsix senses are always restless. Through the most predominant one amongst\r\nthem one's understanding escapeth in proportion to the strength it\r\nassumes, like water from a pot through its holes.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'King Yudhishthira who is like a flame of fire, has\r\nbeen deceived by me. He will surely exterminate in battle all my wicked\r\nsons. Everything, therefore, seems to me to be fraught with danger, and\r\nmy mind is full of anxiety, O thou of great intelligence, tell me such\r\nwords as may dispel my anxiety.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'O sinless one, in nothing else than knowledge and\r\nasceticism, in nothing else than restraining the senses, in nothing else\r\nthan complete abandonment of avarice, do I see thy good. Fear is\r\ndispelled by self-knowledge; by asceticism one winneth what is great and\r\nvaluable; by waiting upon superiors learning is acquired; and peace is\r\ngained by self-restraint. They that desire salvation without having\r\nacquired the merit attainable by gifts, or that which is attainable by\r\npractising the ritual of the Vedas, do not sojourn through life, freed\r\nfrom anger and aversion. The happiness that may be derived from a\r\njudicious course of study, from a battle fought virtuously, from ascetic\r\nausterities performed rigidly, always increaseth at the end. They that\r\nare no longer in peace with their relatives, obtain no steep even if they\r\nhave recourse to well-made beds; nor do they, O king, derive any plea.\r\nsure from women, or the laudatory hymns of bards and eulogists. Such\r\npersons can never practise virtue. Happiness can never be theirs, in this\r\nworld. Honours can never be theirs, and peace hath no charm for them.\r\nCounsels that are for their benefit please them not. They never acquire\r\nwhat they have not, nor succeed in retaining what they have, O king,\r\nthere is no other end for such men save destruction. As milk is possible\r\nin kine, asceticism in Brahmanas, and inconstancy in women, so fear is\r\npossible from relatives. Numerous thin threads of equal length, collected\r\ntogether, are competent to bear, from the strength of numbers, the\r\nconstant rolling of the shuttle-cock over them. The case is even so with\r\nrelatives that are good, O bull of the Bharata race, separated from one\r\nanother, burning brands produce only smoke; but brought together they\r\nblaze forth into a powerful flame. The case is even so, O Dhritarashtra,\r\nwith relatives. They, O Dhritarashtra, who tyrannise over Brahmanas,\r\nwomen, relatives, and kine, soon fall off their stalks, like fruits that\r\nare ripe. And the tree that stands singly, though gigantic and strong and\r\ndeep-rooted, hath its trunk soon smashed and twisted by a mighty wind.\r\nThose trees, however, that grow in close compact are competent owing to\r\nmutual dependence to resist winds more violent still. Thus he that is\r\nsingle, however, endowed with all the virtues, is regarded by foes as\r\ncapable of being vanquished like an isolated tree by the wind. Relatives,\r\nagain, in consequence of mutual dependence and mutual aid, grow together,\r\nlike lotus-stalks in a lake. These must never be slain, viz., Brahmanas,\r\nkine, relatives, children, women, those whose food is eaten, and those\r\nalso that yield by asking for protection. O king, without wealth no good\r\nquality can show itself in a person. If, however, thou art in health,\r\nthou canst achieve thy good, for he is dead who is unhealthy and ill. O\r\nking, anger is a kind of bitter, pungent, acrid, and hot drink, painful\r\nin its consequences: it is a kind of headache not born of any physical\r\nillness, and they that are unwise can never digest it. Do thou, O king,\r\nswallow it up and obtain peace. They that are tortured by disease have no\r\nliking for enjoyments, nor do they desire any happiness from wealth. The\r\nsick, however, filled with sorrow, know not what happiness is or what the\r\nenjoyments of wealth are. Beholding Draupadi won at dice, I told thee\r\nbefore, O king, these words,--They that are honest avoid deceit in play.\r\nTherefore, stop Duryodhana! Thou didst not, however, act according to my\r\nwords. That is not strength which is opposed to softness. On the other\r\nhand, strength mixed with softness constitutes true policy which should\r\never be pursued. That prosperity which is dependent on crookedness alone\r\nis destined to be destroyed. That prosperity, however, which depends on\r\nboth strength and softness, descends to sons and grandsons in tact. Let,\r\ntherefore, thy sons cherish the Pandavas, and the Pandavas also cherish\r\nthy sons. O king, let the Kurus and the Pandavas, both having same\r\nfriends and same foes, live together in happiness and prosperity. Thou\r\nart, today, O king, the refuge of the sons of Kuru. Indeed, the race of\r\nKuru, O Ajamida, is dependent on thee. O sire, preserving thy fame\r\nunsullied, cherish thou the children of Pandu, afflicted as they are with\r\nthe sufferings of exile. O descendant of Kuru, make peace with the sons\r\nof Pandu. Let not thy foes discover thy holes. They all, O god among men,\r\nare devoted to truth. O king of men, withdraw Duryodhana from his evil\r\nways.'\""

      "content": "\"Vidura said, 'O son of Vichitravirya, Manu, the son of the Self-created,\r\nhath, O king, spoken of the following seven and ten kinds of men, as\r\nthose that strike empty space with their fists, or seek to bend the\r\nvapoury bow of Indra in the sky, or desire to catch the intangible rays\r\nof the sun. These seven and ten kinds of foolish men are as follow: he\r\nwho seeketh to control a person that is incapable of being controlled; he\r\nwho is content with small gains; he who humbly pays court to enemies; he\r\nwho seeks to restrain women's frailty; he who asketh him for gifts who\r\nshould never be asked; he who boasteth, having done anything; he who,\r\nborn in a high family, perpetrateth an improper deed; he who being weak\r\nalways wageth hostilities with one that is powerful; he who talketh to a\r\nperson listening scoffingly; he who desireth to have that which is\r\nunattainable; he who being a father-in-law, jesteth with his\r\ndaughter-in-law; he who boasteth at having his alarms dispelled by his\r\ndaughter-in-law; he who scattereth his own seeds in another's field; he\r\nwho speaketh ill of his own wife; he who having received anything from\r\nanother sayeth that he doth not remember it, he who, having given away\r\nanything in words in holy places, boasteth at home when asked to make\r\ngood his words, and he who striveth to prove the truth of what is false.\r\nThe envoys of Yama, with nooses in hand, drag those persons to hell. One\r\nshould behave towards another just as that other behaveth towards him.\r\nEven this is consistent with social polity. One may behave deceitfully\r\ntowards him that behaveth deceitfully, but honestly towards him that is\r\nhonest in his behaviour. Old age killeth beauty; patience, hope; death,\r\nlife; the practice of virtue, worldly enjoyments; lust, modesty;\r\ncompanionship with the wicked, good behaviour; anger, prosperity; and\r\npride, everything.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Man hath been spoken of in all the Vedas as having\r\nhundred years for the period of his life. For what reason then, do not\r\nall men attain the allotted period?'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'Excess of pride, excess in speech, excess in eating,\r\nanger, the desire of enjoyment, and intestine dissensions,--these, O\r\nking, are six sharp swords that cut off the period of life allotted to\r\ncreatures. It is these which kill men, and not death. Knowing this,\r\nblessed be thou!'\r\n\r\n'He who appropriates to himself the wife of one who hath confided in him;\r\nhe who violates the bed of his preceptor; that Brahmana, O Bharata, who\r\nbecomes the husband of a Sudra woman, or drinks wines; he who commendeth\r\nBrahmanas or becometh their master, or taketh away the lands that support\r\nthem; and he who taketh the lives of those who yield asking for\r\nprotection, are all guilty of the sin of slaying Brahmanas. The Vedas\r\ndeclare that contact with these requires expiation. He that accepts the\r\nteaching of the wise; he that is acquainted with the rules of morality;\r\nhe that is liberal; he that eateth having first dedicated the food to the\r\ngods and Pitris; he that envieth none; he that is incapable of doing\r\nanything that injureth others; he that is grateful, truthful, humble and\r\nlearned, succeedeth in attaining to heaven.\r\n\r\n'They are abundant, O king, that can always speak agreeable words. The\r\nspeaker, however, is rare, as also the hearer, of words that are\r\ndisagreeable but medicinal. That man who, without regarding what is\r\nagreeable or disagreeable to his master but keeping virtue alone in view,\r\nsayeth what is unpalatable, but medicinal, truly addeth to the strength\r\nof the king. For the sake of the family a member may be sacrificed; for\r\nthe sake of the village, a family may be sacrificed; for the sake of a\r\nkingdom a village may be sacrificed; and for the sake of one's soul, the\r\nwhole earth may be sacrificed. One should protect his wealth in view of\r\nthe calamities that may overtake him; by his wealth one should protect\r\nhis wives, and by both his wealth and wives one should protect his own\r\nself. From very olden times it hath been seen that gambling provoketh\r\nquarrels. Therefore, he that is wise, should not resort to it even in\r\njest. O son of Pratipa, at the time of that gambling match I told thee, O\r\nking--this is not proper. But, O son of Vichitravirya, like medicine to a\r\nsick man, those words of mine were not agreeable to thee. O king, thou\r\ndesirest to vanquish the sons of Pandu, who are just as peacocks of\r\nvariegated plumage, whereas thy sons are all as crows. Forsaking lions\r\nthou art protecting jackals! O king, when the time cometh, thou wilt have\r\nto grieve for all this. That master, O sire, who doth not give vent to\r\nhis displeasure with devoted servants zealously pursuing his good,\r\nenlisteth the confidence of his servants. In fact, the latter adhere to\r\nhim even in distress. By confiscating the grants to one's servants or\r\nstopping their pay, one should not seek to amass wealth, for even\r\naffectionate counsellors deprived of their means of life and enjoyment,\r\nturn against him and leave him (in distress). Reflecting first on all\r\nintended acts and adjusting the wages and allowances of servants with his\r\nincome and expenditure, a king should make proper alliances, for there is\r\nnothing that cannot be accomplished by alliances. That officer who fully\r\nunderstanding the intentions of his royal master dischargeth all duties\r\nwith alacrity, and who is respectable himself and devoted to his master,\r\nalways telleth what is for his master's good, and who is fully acquainted\r\nwith the extent of his own might and with that also of those against,\r\nwhom he may be engaged, should be regarded by the king as his second\r\nself. That servant, however, who commanded (by his master) disregardeth\r\nthe latter's injunctions and who enjoined to do anything refuseth to\r\nsubmit, proud as he is of his own intelligence and given to arguing\r\nagainst his master, should be got rid of without the least delay. Men of\r\nlearning say that a servant should be endued with these eight qualities,\r\nviz., absence of pride, ability, absence of procrastination, kindness,\r\ncleanliness, incorruptibility, birth in a family free from the taint of\r\ndisease, and weightiness of speech. No man should confidently enter an\r\nenemy's house after dusk even with notice. One should not at night lurk\r\nin the yard of another's premises, nor should one seek to enjoy a woman\r\nto whom the king himself might make love. Never set thyself against the\r\ndecision to which a person hath arrived who keepeth low company and who\r\nis in the habit of consulting all he meeteth. Never tell him,--I do not\r\nbelieve thee,--but assigning some reason send him away on a pretext. A\r\nking who is exceedingly merciful, a woman of lewd character, the servant\r\nof a king, a son, a brother, a widow having an infant son one serving in\r\nthe army, and one that hath suffered great losses, should never be\r\nengaged in pecuniary transactions of lending or borrowing. These eight\r\nqualities shed a lustre on men, viz., wisdom, high lineage, acquaintance\r\nwith scriptures, self-restraint, prowess, moderation in speech, gift to\r\nthe extent of one's power, and gratefulness. These high qualities, O\r\nsire, are necessarily brought together by one only by gifts. When the\r\nking favours a person, that incident (of royal favour) bringeth in all\r\nothers and holdeth them together. He that performeth ablutions winneth\r\nthese ten, viz., strength, beauty, a clear voice, capacity to utter all\r\nthe alphabetical sounds, delicacy of touch, fineness of scent,\r\ncleanliness, gracefulness, delicacy of limbs, and beautiful women. He\r\nthat eateth sparingly winneth these six, viz., health, long life, and\r\nease; his progeny also becometh healthy, and nobody reproacheth him for\r\ngluttony. One should not give shelter to these in his house, viz., one\r\nthat always acteth improperly, one that eateth too much, one that is\r\nhated by all, one that is exceedingly deceitful, one that is cruel, one\r\nthat is ignorant of the proprieties of time and place, and one that\r\ndresseth indecently. A person, however distressed, should never solicit a\r\nmiser for alms, or one that speaketh ill of others, or one that is\r\nunacquainted with the shastras, or a dweller in the woods, or one that is\r\ncunning, or one that doth not regard persons worthy of regard, or one\r\nthat is cruel, or one that habitually quarrels with others, or one that\r\nis ungrateful. A person should never wait upon these six worst of men,\r\nviz., one that is a foe, one that always errs, one that is wedded to\r\nfalsehood, one that is wanting in devotion to the gods, one that is\r\nwithout affection, and one that always regards himself competent to do\r\neverything. One's purposes depend (for their success) on means; and means\r\nare dependent, again, on the nature of the purposes (sought to be\r\naccomplished by them). They are intimately connected with each other, so\r\nthat success depends on both. Begetting sons and rendering them\r\nindependent by making some provision for them, and bestowing maiden\r\ndaughters on eligible persons, one should retire to the woods, and desire\r\nto live as a Muni. One should, for obtaining the favours of the Supreme\r\nBeing, do that which is for the good of all creatures as also for his own\r\nhappiness, for it is this which is the root of the successful of all\r\none's objects. What anxiety hath he for a livelihood that hath\r\nintelligence, energy, prowess, strength, alacrity and perseverance?\r\n\r\n'Behold the evils of a rupture with the Pandavas which would sadden the\r\nvery gods with Sakra. These are, first, enmity between them that are all\r\nthy sons; secondly, a life of continued anxiety; thirdly, the loss of the\r\nfair fame of the Kurus; and lastly, the joy of those that are thy\r\nenemies. The wrath of Bhishma, O thou of the splendour of Indra, of\r\nDrona, and the king Yudhishthira, will consume the whole world, like a\r\ncomet of large proportions falling transversely on the earth. Thy hundred\r\nsons and Karna and the sons of Pandu can together rule the vast earth\r\nwith the belt of the seas. O king, the Dhartarashtras constitute a forest\r\nof which the Pandavas are, I think, tigers. O, do not cut down that\r\nforest with its tigers! O, let not the tigers be driven from that forest!\r\nThere can be no forest without tigers, and no tigers without a forest.\r\nThe forest shelters the tigers and tigers guard the forest!'\r\n\r\nThey that are sinful never seek so much to ascertain the good qualities\r\nof others as to ascertain their faults. He that desires the highest\r\nsuccess in all matters connected with worldly profit, should from the\r\nvery beginning practise virtue, for true profit is never separated from\r\nheaven. He whose soul hath been dissociated from sin and firmly fixed on\r\nvirtue, hath understood all things in their natural and adventitious\r\nstates; he that followeth virtue, profit, and desire, in proper seasons,\r\nobtaineth, both here and hereafter, a combination of all three. He that\r\nrestraineth the force of both anger and joy, and never, O king, loseth\r\nhis senses under calamities, winneth prosperity. Listen to me, O king.\r\nMen are said to have five different kinds of strength, Of these, the\r\nstrength of arms is regarded to be of the most inferior kind. Blessed be\r\nthou, the acquisition of good counsellors is regarded as the second kind\r\nof strength. The wise have said that the acquisition of wealth is the\r\nthird kind of strength. The strength of birth, O king, which one\r\nnaturally acquireth from one's sires and grandsires, is regarded as the\r\nfourth kind of strength. That, however, O Bharata, by which all these are\r\nwon, and which is the foremost of all kinds of strength, is called the\r\nstrength of the intellect. Having provoked the hostility of a person who\r\nis capable of inflicting great injury on a fellow creature, one should\r\nnot gather assurance from the thought that one liveth at a distance from\r\nthe other. Who that is wise that can place his trust on women, kings,\r\nserpents, his own master, enemies, enjoyments, and period of life? There\r\nare no physicians nor medicines for one that hath been struck by the\r\narrow of wisdom. In the case of such a person neither the mantras of\r\nhoma, nor auspicious ceremonies, nor the mantras of the Atharva Veda, nor\r\nany of the antidotes of poison, are of any efficacy. Serpents, fire,\r\nlions, and consanguineous relatives,--none of these, O Bharata, should be\r\ndisregarded by a man; all of these are possessed of great power. Fire is\r\na thing of great energy in this world. It lurketh in wood and never\r\nconsumeth it till it is ignited by others. That very fire, when brought\r\nout by friction, consumeth by its energy not only the wood in which it\r\nlurketh, but also an entire forest and many other things. Men of high\r\nlineage are just like fire in energy. Endued with forgiveness, they\r\nbetray no outward symptoms of wrath and are quiet like fire in wood.\r\nThou, O king, with thy sons art possessed of the virtue of creepers, and\r\nthe sons of Pandu are regarded as Sala trees.

      "content": "\"Vidura said, 'The heart of a young man, when an aged and venerable\r\nperson cometh to his house (as a guest), soareth aloft. By advancing\r\nforward and saluting him, he getteth it back. He that is self-controlled,\r\nfirst offering a seat, and bringing water and causing his guest's feet to\r\nbe washed and making the usual enquiries of welcome, should then speak of\r\nhis own affairs, and taking everything into consideration, offer him\r\nfood. The wise have said that man liveth in vain in whose dwelling a\r\nBrahmana conversant with mantras doth not accept water, honey and curds,\r\nand kine from fear of being unable to appropriate them, or from\r\nmiserliness and unwillingness with which the gifts are made. A physician,\r\na maker of arrows, even one that hath given up the vow of Brahmacharya\r\nbefore it is complete, a thief, a crooked-minded man, a Brahmana that\r\ndrinks, one that causeth miscarriage, one that liveth by serving in the\r\narmy, and one that selleth the Vedas, when arrived as a guest, however\r\nundeserving he may be the offer of water should be regarded (by a\r\nhouseholder) as exceedingly dear. A Brahmana should never be a seller of\r\nsalt, of cooked food, curds, milk, honey, oil, clarified butter, sesame,\r\nmeat, fruits, roots, potherbs, dyed clothes, all kinds of perfumery, and\r\ntreacle. He that never giveth way to anger, he that is above grief, he\r\nthat is no longer in need of friendship and quarrels, he that\r\ndisregardeth both praise and blame, and he that standeth aloof from both\r\nwhat is agreeable and disagreeable, like one perfectly withdrawn from the\r\nworld, is a real Yogin of the Bhikshu order. That virtuous ascetic who\r\nliveth on rice growing wild, or roots, or potherbs, who hath his soul\r\nunder control, who carefully keepeth his fire for worship, and dwelling\r\nin the woods is always regardful of guests, is indeed, the foremost of\r\nhis brotherhood. Having wronged an intelligent person, one should never\r\ngather assurance from the fact that one liveth at a distance from the\r\nperson wronged. Long are the arms which intelligent persons have, by\r\nwhich they can return wrongs for wrongs done to them, One should never\r\nput trust on him who should not be trusted, nor put too much trust on him\r\nwho should be trusted, for the danger that ariseth from one's having\r\nreposed trust on another cutteth off one's very roots. One should\r\nrenounce envy, protect one's wives, give to others what is their due, and\r\nbe agreeable in speech. One should be sweet-tongued and pleasant in his\r\naddress as regards one's wives, but should never be their slave. It hath\r\nbeen said that wives that are highly blessed and virtuous, worthy of\r\nworship and the ornaments of their homes, are really embodiments of\r\ndomestic prosperity. They should, therefore, be protected particularly.\r\nOne should devolve the looking over of his inner apartments on his\r\nfather; of the kitchen, on his mother; of the kine, on somebody he looks\r\nupon as his own self, but as regards agriculture, one should look over it\r\nhimself. One should look after guests of the trader-caste through his\r\nservants, and those of the Brahmana caste through his sons. Fire hath its\r\norigin in water; Kshatriyas in Brahmanas; and iron in stone. The energy\r\nof those (i.e., fire, Kshatriyas, and iron) can affect all things but is\r\nneutralised as soon as the things come in contact with their progenitors.\r\nFire lieth concealed in wood without showing itself externally. Good and\r\nforgiving men born of high families and endued with fiery energy, do not\r\nbetray any outward symptoms of what is within them. That king whose\r\ncounsels cannot be known by either outsiders or those about him, but who\r\nknoweth the counsels of others through his spies, enjoyeth his prosperity\r\nlong. One should never speak of what one intends to do. Let anything thou\r\ndoest in respect of virtue, profit, and desire, be not known till it is\r\ndone. Let counsels be not divulged. Ascending on the mountain-top or on\r\nthe terrace of a palace, or proceeding to a wilderness devoid of trees\r\nand plants, one should, in secrecy, mature his counsels. O Bharata,\r\nneither a friend who is without learning, nor a learned friend who hath\r\nno control over his senses, deserveth to be a repository of state\r\nsecrets. O king, never make one thy minister without examining him well,\r\nfor a king's finances and the keeping of his counsels both depend on his\r\nminister. That king is the foremost of rulers, whose ministers know his\r\nacts in respect of virtue, profit and desire, only after they are done.\r\nThe king whose counsels are kept close, without doubt, commandeth\r\nsuccess. He that from ignorance committeth acts that are censurable,\r\nloseth his very life in consequence of the untoward results of those\r\nacts. The doing of acts that are praise-worthy is always attended with\r\nease. Omission to do such acts leadeth to repentance. As a Brahmana\r\nwithout having studied the Vedas is not fit to officiate at a Sraddha (in\r\nhonour of the Pitris), so he that hath not heard of the six (means for\r\nprotecting a kingdom) deserveth not to take part in political\r\ndeliberations. O king, he that hath an eye upon increase, decrease, and\r\nsurplus, he that is conversant with the six means and knoweth also his\r\nown self, he whose conduct is always applauded, bringeth the whole earth\r\nunder subjection to himself. He whose anger and joy are productive of\r\nconsequences, he who looketh over personally what should be done, he who\r\nhath his treasury under his own control, bringeth the whole earth under\r\nsubjection to himself. The king should be content with the name he wins\r\nand the umbrella that is held over his head. He should divide the wealth\r\nof the kingdom among these that serve him. Alone he should not\r\nappropriate everything. A Brahmana knoweth a Brahmana, the husband\r\nunderstandeth the wife, the king knoweth the minister, and monarchs know\r\nmonarchs. A foe that deserveth death, when brought under subjection\r\nshould never be set free. If one be weak one should pay court to one's\r\nfoe that is stronger, even if the latter deserves death; but one should\r\nkill that foe as soon as one commandeth sufficient strength, for, if not\r\nkilled, dangers soon arise from him. One should, with an effort, control\r\nhis wrath against the gods, kings, Brahmanas, old men, children, and\r\nthose that are helpless. He that is wise should avoid unprofitable\r\nquarrels such as fools only engage in. By this one winneth great fame in\r\nthis world and avoideth misery and unhappiness. People never desire him\r\nfor a master whose grace is fruitless and whose wrath goest for nothing,\r\nlike women never desiring him for a husband who is a eunuch. Intelligence\r\ndoth not exist for the acquisition of wealth, nor is idleness the cause\r\nof adversity; the man of wisdom only knoweth, and not others, the cause\r\nof the diversities of condition in this world. The fool, O Bharata,\r\nalways disregardeth those that are elderly in years, and eminent in\r\nconduct and knowledge, in intelligence, wealth, and lineage. Calamities\r\nsoon come upon them that are of wicked disposition, devoid of wisdom,\r\nenvious, or sinful, foul-tongued, and wrathful. Absence of deceitfulness,\r\ngift, observance of the established rules of intercourse, and speech\r\nwell-controlled, bring all creatures under subjection. He that is without\r\ndeceitfulness, he that is active, grateful, intelligent, and guileless,\r\neven if his treasury be empty, obtaineth friends, counsellors, and\r\nservants. Intelligence, tranquillity of mind, self-control, purity,\r\nabsence of harsh speech and unwillingness to do anything disagreeable to\r\nfriends,--these seven are regarded as the fuel of prosperity's flame. The\r\nwretch who doth not give to others their due, who is of wicked soul, who\r\nis ungrateful, and shameless, should, O king, be avoided. The guilty\r\nperson who provoketh another about him that is innocent, cannot sleep\r\npeacefully at night, like a person passing the night with a snake in the\r\nsame room. They, O Bharata, who upon being angry endanger one's\r\npossessions and means of acquisition, should always be propitiated like\r\nthe very gods. Those objects that depend upon women, careless persons,\r\nmen that have fallen away from the duties of their caste, and those that\r\nare wicked in disposition, are doubtful of success. They sink helplessly.\r\nO king, like a raft made of stone, who have a woman, a deceitful person,\r\nor a child, for their guide. They that are competent in the general\r\nprinciples of work, though not in particular kinds of work are regarded\r\nby men as learned and wise for particular kinds of work, are subsidiary,\r\nThat man who is highly spoken of by swindlers, mimes and women of ill\r\nfame, is more dead than alive, Forsaking these mighty bowmen of\r\nimmeasurable energy, viz., the son of Pandu, thou hast. O Bharata,\r\ndevolved on Duryodhana, the cares of a mighty empire. Thou shalt,\r\ntherefore, soon see that swelling affluence fall off, like Vali fallen\r\noff from the three worlds.'\""

Indeed, the Creator\r\nhath made man subject to Destiny. Go on telling me, I am attentive to\r\nwhat thou sayest.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'O Bharata, by speaking words out of season even Vrihaspati\r\nhimself incurreth reproach and the charge of ignorance, one becometh\r\nagreeable by gift, another by sweet words, a third by the force of\r\nincantation and drugs. He, however, that is naturally agreeable, always\r\nremaineth so. He that is hated by another is never regarded by that other\r\nas honest or intelligent or wise. One attributeth everything good to him\r\none loveth; and everything evil to him one hateth. O king, as soon as\r\nDuryodhana was born I told thee,--thou shouldst abandon this one son, for\r\nby abandoning him thou wouldst secure the prosperity of thy hundred\r\nsons,--and by keeping him, destruction would overtake thy hundred sons,\r\nthat gain should never be regarded highly which leadeth to loss. On the\r\nother hand, that loss even should be regarded highly which would bring on\r\ngain. That is no loss, O king, which bringeth on gain. That, however,\r\nshould be reckoned as loss which is certain to bring about greater losses\r\nstill. Some become eminent in consequence of good qualities; others\r\nbecome so in consequence of wealth. Avoid them, O Dhritarashtra, that are\r\neminent in wealth but destitute of good qualities!'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'All that you sayest is approved by the wise and is\r\nfor my future good. I dare not, however, abandon my son. It is well-known\r\nthat where there is righteousness there is victory.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura said, 'He that is graced with every virtue and is endued with\r\nhumility, is never indifferent to even the minutest sufferings of living\r\ncreatures. They, however, that are ever employed in speaking ill of\r\nothers, always strive with activity quarrelling with one another and in\r\nall matters, calculated to give pain to others. There is sin in accepting\r\ngifts from, and danger in making gifts to them, whose very sight is\r\ninauspicious and whose companionship is fraught with danger. They that\r\nare quarrelsome, covetous, shameless, deceitful, are known unrighteous,\r\nand their companionship should always be avoided. One should also avoid\r\nthose men that are endued with similar faults of a grave nature, When the\r\noccasion that caused the friendship is over the friendship of those that\r\nare low, the beneficial result of that connection, and the happiness also\r\nderivable from it, all come to an end. They then strive to speak ill of\r\ntheir (late) friend and endeavour to inflict loss on him, and if the loss\r\nthey sustain be even very small, for all that they, from want of\r\nself-control, fail to enjoy peace. He that is learned, examining\r\neverything carefully and reflecting well, should, from a distance, avoid\r\nthe friendship of vile and wicked-minded persons such as these. He that\r\nhelpeth his poor and wretched and helpless relatives, obtain children and\r\nanimals and enjoyeth prosperity that knoweth no end. They that desire\r\ntheir own benefit should always succour their relatives. By every means,\r\ntherefore, O king, do thou seek the growth of thy race. Prosperity will\r\nbe thine, O Monarch, if thou behavest well towards all thy relatives.\r\nEven relatives that are destitute of good qualities should be protected.\r\nO bull of the Bharata race, how much more, therefore, should they be\r\nprotected that are endued with every virtue and are humbly expectant of\r\nthy favours? Favour thou the heroic sons of Pandu, O monarch, and let a\r\nfew villages be assigned to them for their maintenance. By acting thus, O\r\nking, fame will be thine in this world. Thou art old; thou shouldst,\r\ntherefore, control thy sons. I should say what is for thy good. Know me\r\nas one that wishes well to thee. He that desireth his own good should\r\nnever quarrel, O sire, with his relatives. O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nhappiness should ever be enjoyed with one's relatives, and not without\r\nthem, to eat with one another, to talk with one another, and to love one\r\nanother, are what relatives should always do. They should never quarrel.\r\nIn this world it is the relatives that rescue, and the relatives that\r\nruin (relatives). Those amongst them that are righteous rescue; while\r\nthose that are unrighteous sink (their brethren). O king, be thou, O\r\ngiver of honours, righteous in thy conduct towards the sons of Pandu.\r\nSurrounded by them, thou wouldst be unconquerable by thy foes. If a\r\nrelative shrinks in the presence of a prosperous relative, like a deer at\r\nsight of a hunter armed with arrows, then the prosperous relative hath to\r\ntake upon himself all the sins of the other. O best of men, repentance\r\nwill be thine (for this thy inaction at present) when in future thou wilt\r\nhear of the death of either the Pandavas or thy sons. O, think of all\r\nthis. When life itself is unstable, one should in the very beginning\r\navoid that act in consequence of which one would have to indulge in\r\nregrets having entered the chamber of woe. True it is that a person other\r\nthan Bhargava, the author of the science of morality is liable to commit\r\nactions that go against morality. It is seen, however, that a just notion\r\nof consequence is present in all persons of intelligence. Thou art an\r\naged scion of Kuru's race. If Duryodhana inflicted these wrongs on the\r\nsons of Pandu, it is thy duty, O king of men, to undo them all.\r\nRe-instating them in their position, thou wilt, in this world, be\r\ncleansed of all thy sins and be, O king of men, an object of worship with\r\neven those that have their souls under control. Reflecting on the\r\nwell-spoken words of the wise according to their consequences, he that\r\nengageth in acts never loseth fame. The knowledge imparted by even men of\r\nlearning and skill is imperfect, for that which is sought to be\r\ninculcated is ill-understood, or, if understood, is not accomplished in\r\npractice. That learned person who never doth an act, the consequences of\r\nwhich are sin and misery, always groweth (in prosperity). The person,\r\nhowever, of wicked soul, who from folly pursueth his sinful course\r\ncommenced before falleth into a slough of deep mire. He that is wise\r\nshould ever keep in view the (following) six conduits by which counsels\r\nbecome divulged, and he that desireth success and a long dynasty should\r\never guard himself from those six. They are, intoxication, sleep,\r\ninattention to spies, set over one by another, one's own demeanour as\r\ndependent on the working of one's own heart, confidence reposed on a\r\nwicked counsellor, and unskilful envoys. Knowing these six doors (through\r\nwhich counsels are divulged), he that keepeth them shut while pursuing\r\nthe attainment of virtue, profit, and desire, succeedeth in standing over\r\nthe heads of his foes. Without an acquaintance with the scriptures and\r\nwithout waiting upon the old, neither virtue nor profit can be known (or\r\nwon) by persons blessed even with the intelligence of Vrihaspati. A thing\r\nis lost if cast into the sea; words are lost if addressed to one that\r\nlistens not; the scriptures are lost on one that hath not his soul under\r\ncontrol; and a libation of clarified butter is lost if poured over the\r\nashes left by a fire that is extinguished. He that is endued with the\r\nintelligence maketh friendships with those that are wise, having first\r\nexamined by the aid of his intelligence, repeatedly searching by his\r\nunderstanding, and using his ears, eyes, and judgment. Humility removeth\r\nobloquy, ears, failure, prowess; forgiveness always conquereth anger; and\r\nauspicious rites destroy all indications of evil. One's lineage, O king,\r\nis tested by his objects of enjoyment, place of birth, house, behaviour,\r\nfood, and dress. When an object of enjoyment is available, even that one\r\nwho hath attained emancipation is not unwilling to enjoy; what, again,\r\nneed be said of him that is yet wedded to desire? A king should cherish a\r\ncounsellor that worshippeth persons of wisdom, is endued with learning,\r\nvirtue, agreeable appearance, friends, sweet speech, and a good heart.\r\nWhether of low or high birth, he who doth not transgress the rules of\r\npolite intercourse, who hath an eye on virtue, who is endued with\r\nhumility and modesty, is superior to a hundred persons of high birth. The\r\nfriendship of those persons never cooleth, whose hearts, secret pursuits,\r\nand pleasures, and acquirements, accord in every respect. He that is\r\nintelligent should avoid an ignorant person of wicked soul, like a pit\r\nwhose mouth is covered with grass, for friendship with such a person can\r\nnever last. The man of wisdom should never contract friendship with those\r\nthat are proud, ignorant, fierce, rash and fallen off from righteousness.\r\nHe that is grateful, virtuous, truthful, large-hearted, and devoted, and\r\nhe that hath his senses under control, preserveth his dignity, and never\r\nforsaketh a friend, should be desired for a friend. The withdrawal of the\r\nsenses from their respective objects is equivalent to death itself. Their\r\nexcessive indulgence again would ruin the very gods. Humility, love of\r\nall creatures, forgiveness, and respect for friends,--these, the learned\r\nhave said, lengthen life. He who with a firm resolution striveth to\r\naccomplish by a virtuous policy purposes that have once been frustrated,\r\nis said to possess real manhood. That man attaineth all his objects, who\r\nis conversant with remedies to be applied in the future, who is firmly\r\nresolved in the present, and who could anticipate in the past how an act\r\nbegun would end. That which a man pursueth in word, deed, and thought,\r\nwinneth him for its own; therefore, one should always seek that which is\r\nfor his good. Effort after securing what is good, the properties of time,\r\nplace, and means, acquaintance with the scriptures, activity,\r\nstraightforwardness, and frequent meetings with those that are\r\ngood,--these bring about prosperity. Perseverance is the root of\r\nprosperity, of gain, and of what is beneficial. The man that pursueth an\r\nobject with perseverance and without giving it up in vexation, is really\r\ngreat, and enjoyeth happiness that is unending. O sire, there is nothing\r\nmore conducive of happiness and nothing more proper for a man of power\r\nand energy as foregiveness in every place and at all times. He that is\r\nweak should forgive under all circumstances. He that is possessed of\r\npower should show forgiveness from motives of virtue; and he, to whom the\r\nsuccess or failure of his objects is the same, is naturally forgiving.\r\nThat pleasure the pursuit of which doth not injure one's virtue and\r\nprofit, should certainly be pursued to one's fill. One should not,\r\nhowever, act like a fool by giving free indulgence to his senses.\r\nProsperity never resides in one who suffers himself to be tortured by a\r\ngrief, who is addicted to evil ways, who denies Godhead, who is idle, who\r\nhath not his senses under control, and who is divested of exertion. The\r\nman that is humble, and who from humility is modest is regarded as weak\r\nand persecuted by persons of misdirected intelligence. Prosperity never\r\napproacheth from fear the person that is excessively liberal, that giveth\r\naway without measure, that is possessed of extraordinary bravery, that\r\npractiseth the most rigid vows, and that is very proud of his wisdom.\r\nProsperity doth not reside in one that is highly accomplished, nor in one\r\nthat is without any accomplishment. She doth not desire a combination of\r\nall the virtues, nor is she pleased with the total absence of all\r\nvirtues. Blind, like a mad cow, prosperity resides with some one who is\r\nnot remarkable. The fruits of the Vedas are ceremonies performed before\r\nthe (homa) fire; the fruits of an acquaintance with the scriptures are\r\ngoodness of disposition and conduct. The fruits of women are the\r\npleasures of intercourse and offspring; and the fruits of wealth are\r\nenjoyment and charity. He that performeth acts tending to secure his\r\nprosperity in the other world with wealth acquired sinfully, never\r\nreapeth the fruits of these acts in the other world, in consequence of\r\nthe sinfulness of the acquisitions (spent for the purpose). In the midst\r\nof deserts, or deep woods, or inaccessible fastnesses, amid all kinds of\r\ndangers and alarms or in view of deadly weapons upraised for striking\r\nhim, he that hath strength of mind entertaineth no fear. Exertion,\r\nself-control, skill, carefulness, steadiness, memory, and commencement of\r\nacts after mature deliberation,--know that these are the roots of\r\nprosperity. Austerities constitute the strength of ascetics; the Vedas\r\nare the strength of those conversant with them; in envy lieth the\r\nstrength of the wicked; and in forgiveness, the strength of the virtuous.\r\nThese eight, viz., water, roots, fruits, milk, clarified butter (what is\r\ndone at) the desire of a Brahmana, (or at) the command of a preceptor,\r\nand medicine, are not destructive of a vow. That which is antagonistic to\r\none's own self, should never be applied in respect of another. Briefly\r\neven this is virtue. Other kinds of virtue there are, but these proceed\r\nfrom caprice. Anger must be conquered by forgiveness; and the wicked must\r\nbe conquered by honesty; the miser must be conquered by liberality, and\r\nfalsehood must be conquered by truth. One should not place trust on a\r\nwoman, a swindler, an idle person, a coward, one that is fierce, one that\r\nboasts of his own power, a thief, an ungrateful person, and an atheist.\r\nAchievements, period of life, fame, and power--these four always expand\r\nin the case of him that respectfully saluteth his superiors and waiteth\r\nupon the old. Do not set thy heart after these objects which cannot be\r\nacquired except by very painful exertion, or by sacrificing\r\nrighteousness, or by bowing down to an enemy. A man without knowledge is\r\nto be pitied; an act of intercourse that is not fruitful is to be pitied;\r\nthe people of a kingdom that are without food are to be pitied; and a\r\nkingdom without a king is to be pitied. These constitute the source of\r\npain and weakness to embodied creatures; the rains, decay of hills and\r\nmountains; absence of enjoyment, anguish of women; and wordy arrows of\r\nthe heart. The scum of the Vedas is want of study; of Brahmanas, absence\r\nof vows; of the Earth, the Vahlikas; of man, untruth; of the chaste\r\nwoman, curiosity; of women, exile from home. The scum of gold is silver;\r\nof silver, tin; of tin, lead; and of lead, useless dross. One cannot\r\nconquer sleep by lying down; women by desire; fire by fuel; and wine by\r\ndrinking. His life is, indeed, crowned with success who hath won his\r\nfriends by gifts, his foes in battle, and wife by food and drink; they\r\nwho have thousands live; they, who have hundreds, also live. O\r\nDhritarashtra, forsake desire. There is none who cannot manage to live by\r\nsome means or other. Thy paddy, wheat, gold, animals, and women that are\r\non earth all cannot satiate even one person .. Reflecting on this, they\r\nthat are wise never grieve for want of universal dominion. O king, I\r\nagain tell thee, adopt an equal conduct towards thy children, i.e.,\r\ntowards the sons of Pandu and thy own sons.'\""

He\r\nthat forsaketh, of his own accord, even a great object owing to its being\r\nfraught with unrighteousness, liveth happily, casting off all foes, like\r\na snake that hath cast off its slough. A victory gained by an untruth,\r\ndeceitful conduct towards the king, and insincerity of intentions\r\nexpressed before the preceptor,--these three are each equal to the sin of\r\nslaying a Brahmana. Excessive envy, death, and boastfulness, are the\r\ncauses of the destruction of prosperity. Carelessness in waiting upon\r\npreceptor, haste, and boastlessness, are the three enemies of knowledge.\r\nIdleness, inattention, confusion of the intellect, restlessness,\r\ngathering for killing time, haughtiness, pride, and covetous ness,--these\r\nseven constitute, it is said, the faults of students in the pursuit of\r\nlearning. How can they that desire pleasure have knowledge? Students,\r\nagain, engaged in the pursuit of learning, cannot have pleasure. Votaries\r\nof pleasure must give up knowledge, and votaries of knowledge must give\r\nup pleasure. Fire is never gratified with fuel (but can consume any\r\nmeasure thereof). The great ocean is never gratified with the rivers it\r\nreceives (but can receive any number of them). Death is never gratified\r\neven with entire living creatures. A beautiful woman is never gratified\r\nwith any number of men (she may have). O king, hope killeth patience;\r\nYama killeth growth; anger killeth prosperity; miserliness killeth fame;\r\nabsence of tending killeth cattle; one angry Brahmana destroyeth a whole\r\nkingdom. Let goats, brass, silver, honey, antidotes of poison, birds,\r\nBrahmanas versed in the Vedas, old relatives, and men of high birth sunk\r\nin poverty, be always present in thy house. O Bharata, Manu hath said\r\nthat goats, bulls, sandal, lyres, mirrors, honey, clarified butter, iron,\r\ncopper, conch-shells, salagram (the stony-image of Vishnu with gold\r\nwithin) and gorochana should always be kept in one's house for the\r\nworship of the gods. Brahmanas, and guests, for all those objects are\r\nauspicious. O sire, I would impart to thee another sacred lesson\r\nproductive of great fruits, and which is the highest of all teachings,\r\nviz., virtue should never be forsaken from desire, fear, or temptation,\r\nnay, nor for the sake of life itself. Virtue is everlasting; pleasure and\r\npain are transitory; life is, indeed, everlasting but its particular\r\nphases are transitory. Forsaking those which are transitory, betake\r\nthyself to that which is everlasting, and let contentment be thine, for\r\ncontentment is the highest of all acquisitions. Behold, illustrious and\r\nmighty kings, having ruled lands abounding with wealth and corn, have\r\nbecome the victims of the Universal Destroyer, leaving behind their\r\nkingdoms and vast sources of enjoyment. The son brought up with anxious\r\ncare, when dead, is taken up and carried away by men (to the burning\r\nground). With the dishevelled hair and crying piteously, they then cast\r\nthe body into the funeral pyre, as if it were a piece of wood. Others\r\nenjoy the deceased's wealth, while birds and fire feast on the elements\r\nof his body. With two only he goeth to the other world, viz., his merits\r\nand his sins which keep him company. Throwing away the body, O sire,\r\nrelatives, friends, and sons retrace their steps, like birds abandoning\r\ntrees without blossoms and fruits. The person cast into the funeral pyre\r\nis followed only by his own acts. Therefore, should men carefully and\r\ngradually earn the merit of righteousness. In the world above this, and\r\nalso in that below this, there are regions of great gloom and darkness.\r\nKnow, O king, that those are regions where the senses of men are\r\nexceedingly afflicted. Oh, let not any of those places to thine.\r\nCarefully listening to these words, if thou canst act according to them,\r\nthou wilt obtain great fame in this world of men, and fear will not be\r\nthine here or hereafter. O Bharata, the soul is spoken of as a river;\r\nreligious merit constitutes its sacred baths; truth, its water;\r\nself-control, its banks; kindness, its waves. He that is righteous\r\npurifieth himself by a bath therein, for the soul is sacred, and the\r\nabsence of desire is the highest merit. O king, life is a river whose\r\nwaters are the five senses, and whose crocodiles and sharks are desire\r\nand anger. Making self-control thy raft, cross thou its eddies which are\r\nrepresented by repeated births! Worshipping and gratifying friends that\r\nare eminent in wisdom, virtue, learning, and years, he that asketh their\r\nadvice about what he should do and should not do, is never misled. One\r\nshould restrain one's lust and stomach by patience; one's hands and feet\r\nby one's eyes; one's eyes and ears by one's mind; and one's mind and\r\nwords by one's acts. That Brahmana who never omitteth to perform his\r\nablutions, who always weareth his sacred thread, who always attendeth to\r\nthe study of the Vedas, who always avoideth food that is unclean, who\r\ntelleth the truth and performeth acts in honour of his preceptor, never\r\nfalleth off from the region of Brahma. Having studied the Vedas, poured\r\nlibations into fire, performed sacrifices, protected subjects, sanctified\r\nhis soul by drawing weapons for protecting kine and Brahmanas, and died\r\non the field of battle, the Kshatriya attaineth to heaven. Having studied\r\nthe Vedas, and distributed in proper time, his wealth among Brahmanas,\r\nKshatriyas, and his own dependents, and inhaled the sanctified smoke of\r\nthe three kinds of fires, the Vaisya enjoyeth heavenly bliss in the other\r\nworld. Having properly worshipped Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisayas in\r\ndue order, and having burnt his sins, by gratifying them, and then\r\npeacefully casting off his body, the Sudra enjoyeth the bliss of heaven.\r\nThe duties of the four orders are thus set forth before thee. Listen now\r\nto the reason of my speech as I discourse it. Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nPandu, is falling off from the duties of the Kshatriya order. Place him,\r\ntherefore, O king, in a position to discharge the duties of kings.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, It is even so as thou always teachest me. O amiable\r\none, my heart also inclineth that very way of which thou tellest me.\r\nAlthough, however, I incline in my mind towards the Pandavas even as thou\r\nteachest me to do, yet as soon as I come in contact with Duryodhana it\r\nturneth off in a different way. No creature is able to avert fate.\r\nIndeed, Destiny, I think, is certain to take its course; individual\r\nexertion is futile.'\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'Then the illustrious and wise king Dhritarashtra,\r\nhaving applauded the words spoken by Vidura, questioned Sanat-sujata in\r\nsecret, desirous of obtaining the highest of all knowledge. And the king\r\nquestioned the Rishi saying, 'O Sanat-sujata, I hear that thou art of the\r\nopinion that there is no Death. Again it is said that the gods and the\r\nAsuras, practise ascetic austerities in order to avoid death. Of these\r\ntwo opinions, then, which is true?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'Some say, death is avertable by particular acts;\r\nothers' opinion there is no death; thou hast asked me which of these is\r\ntrue. Listen to me, O king, as I discourse to thee on this, so that thy\r\ndoubts may be removed. Know, O Kshatriya, that both of these are true.\r\nThe learned are of opinion that death results from ignorance. I say that\r\nignorance is Death, and so the absence of ignorance (Knowledge) is\r\nimmortality. It is from ignorance that the Asuras became subject to\r\ndefeat and death, and it is from the absence of ignorance that the gods\r\nhave attained the nature of Brahman. Death doth not devour creatures like\r\na tiger; its form itself is unascertainable. Besides this, some imagine\r\nYama to be Death. This, however, is due to the weakness of the mind. The\r\npursuit of Brahman or self-knowledge is immortality. That (imaginary) god\r\n(Yama) holdeth his sway in the region of the Pitris, being the source of\r\nbliss to the virtuous and of woe to the sinful. It is at his command that\r\ndeath in the form of wrath, ignorance, and covetousness, occurreth among\r\nmen. Swayed by pride, men always walk in unrighteous path. None amongst\r\nthem succeeds in attaining to his real nature. With their understanding\r\nclouded, and themselves swayed by there passions, they cast off their\r\nbodies and repeatedly fall into hell. They are always followed by their\r\nsenses. It is for this that ignorance receives the name of death. Those\r\nmen that desire the fruits of action when the time cometh for enjoying\r\nthose fruits, proceed to heaven, casting off their bodies. Hence they\r\ncannot avoid death. Embodied creatures, from inability to attain the\r\nknowledge of Brahman and from their connection with earthly enjoyments,\r\nare obliged to sojourn in a cycle of re-births, up and down and around,\r\nThe natural inclination of man towards pursuits that are unreal is alone\r\nthe cause of the senses being led to error. The soul that is constantly\r\naffected by the pursuit of objects that are unreal, remembering only that\r\nwith which it is always engaged, adoreth only earthly enjoyments that\r\nsurround it. The desire of enjoyments first killeth men. Lust and wrath\r\nsoon follow behind it. These three, viz., the desire of enjoyments, lust,\r\nand wrath, lead foolish men to death. They, however, that have conquered\r\ntheir souls, succeed by self-restraint, to escape death. He that hath\r\nconquered his soul without suffering himself to be excited by his\r\nambitious desire, conquereth these, regarding them as of no value, by the\r\naid of self-knowledge. Ignorance, assuming the form of Yama, cannot\r\ndevour that learned man who controlled his desires in this manner. That\r\nman who followeth his desires is destroyed along with his desires. He,\r\nhowever, that can renounce desire, can certainly drive away all kinds of\r\nwoe. Desire is, indeed, ignorance and darkness and hell in respect of all\r\ncreatures, for swayed by it they lose their senses. As intoxicated\r\npersons in walking along a street reel towards ruts and holes, so men\r\nunder the influence of desire, misled by deluding joys, run towards\r\ndestruction. What can death do to a person whose soul hath not been\r\nconfounded or misled by desire? To him, death hath no terrors, like a\r\ntiger made of straw. Therefore, O Kshatriya, if the existence of desire,\r\nwhich is ignorance, is to be destroyed, no wish, not even the slightest\r\none, is either to be thought of or pursued. That soul, which is in thy\r\nbody, associated as it is with wrath and covetousness and filled with\r\nignorance, that is death. Knowing that death arises in this way, he that\r\nrelies on knowledge, entertaineth no fear of death. Indeed, as the body\r\nis destroyed when brought under the influence of death, so death itself\r\nis destroyed when it comes under the influence of knowledge.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'The Vedas declare the emancipating capacity of\r\nthose highly sacred and eternal regions, that are said to be obtainable\r\nby the regenerate classes by prayers and sacrifices. Knowing this, why\r\nshould not a learned person have recourse to (religious) acts?'[3]\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'Indeed, he that is without knowledge proceedeth\r\nthither by the path indicated by thee, and the Vedas also declare that\r\nthither are both bliss and emancipation. But he that regardeth the\r\nmaterial body to be self, if he succeeds in renouncing desire, at once\r\nattaineth emancipation (or Brahman). If, however, one seeketh\r\nemancipation without renouncing desire, one must have to proceed along\r\nthe (prescribed) route of action, taking care to destroy the chances of\r\nhis retracing the routes that he hath once passed over.'[4]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Who is it that urgeth that Unborn and Ancient One?\r\nIf, again, it is He that is all this Universe in consequence of His\r\nhaving entered everything (without desire as He is) what can be His\r\naction, or his happiness? O learned sage, tell me all this truly.'[5]\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'There is great objection in completely identifying\r\n(as here) the two that are different Creatures always spring from the\r\nunion of Conditions (with what in its essence is without Conditions).\r\nThis view doth not detract from the supremacy of the Unborn and the\r\nAncient One. As for men, they also originate in the union of Conditions.\r\nAll this that appears is nothing but that everlasting Supreme Soul.\r\nIndeed, the universe is created by the Supreme Soul itself undergoing\r\ntransformations. The Vedas to attribute this power (of\r\nself-transformation) to the Supreme Soul. For the identity, again, of the\r\npower and its possessor, both the Vedas and others are the authority.'[6]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'In this world, some practise virtue, and some\r\nrenounce action or Karma (adopting what is called Sannyasa Yoga).\r\n(Respecting those that practise virtue) I ask, is virtue competent to\r\ndestroy vice, or is it itself destroyed by vice?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'The fruits of virtue and of (perfect) inaction are\r\nboth serviceable in that respect (i.e., for procuring emancipation).\r\nIndeed, both are sure means for the attainment of emancipation. The man,\r\nhowever, that is wise, achieveth success by knowledge (inaction). On the\r\nother hand, the materialist acquireth merit (by action) and (as the\r\nconsequence thereof) emancipation. He hath also (in course of his\r\npursuit) to incur sin. Having obtained again fruits of both virtue and\r\nvice which are transitory, (heaven having its end as also hell in respect\r\nof the virtuous and the sinful), the man of action becometh once more\r\naddicted to action as the consequence of his own previous virtues and\r\nvices. The man of action, however, who possesseth intelligence,\r\ndestroyeth his sins by his virtuous acts. Virtue, therefore, is strong,\r\nand hence the success of the man of action.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, according to their gradation, of those\r\neternal regions that are said to be attainable, as the fruits of their\r\nown virtuous acts, by regenerate persons, engaged in the practice of\r\nvirtue. Speak unto me of others' regions also of a similar kind. O\r\nlearned sire, I do not wish to hear of actions (towards which man's heart\r\nnaturally inclineth, however interdicted or sinful they may be).'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'Those regenerate persons that take pride in their\r\nYoga practices, like strong men in their own strength, departing hence,\r\nshine in the region of Brahman. Those regenerate persons that proudly\r\nexert in performing sacrifices and other Vedic rites, as the fruit of\r\nthat knowledge which is theirs, in consequence of those acts, freed from\r\nthis world, proceed to that region which is the abode of the deities.\r\nThere are others, again, conversant with the Vedas, who are of opinion\r\nthat the performance of the sacrifices and rites (ordained by the Vedas)\r\nis obligatory (their non-performance being sinful). Wedded to external\r\nforms, though seeking the development of the inner self (for they\r\npractise these rites for only virtue's sake and not for the\r\naccomplishment of particular aims), these persons should not be regarded\r\nvery highly (although some respect should be theirs). Wherever, again,\r\nfood and drink worthy of a Brahmana are abundant, like grass and reeds in\r\na spot during the rainy season, there should the Yogin seek for his\r\nlivelihood (without afflicting the householder of scanty means); by no\r\nmeans should he afflict his own self by hunger and thirst. In a place,\r\nwhere there may be both inconvenience and danger to one, for one's\r\naversion, to disclose one's superiority, he that doth not proclaim his\r\nsuperiority is better than he that doth. The food offered by that person\r\nwho is not pained at the sight of another disclosing his superiority, and\r\nwho never eateth without offering the prescribed share to Brahmanas and\r\nguests, is approved by the righteous. As a dog oftentimes devoureth its\r\nown evacuations to its injury, so those Yogins devour their own vomit who\r\nprocure their livelihood by disclosing their pre-eminence. The wise know\r\nhim for a Brahmana, who, living in the midst of kindred, wishes his\r\nreligious practices to remain always unknown to them. What other Brahmana\r\ndeserveth to know the Supreme Soul, that is unconditioned, without\r\nattributes, unchangeable, one and alone, and without duality of any kind?\r\nIn consequence of such practices, a Kshatriya can know the Supreme Soul\r\nand behold it in his own soul. He that regardeth the Soul to be the\r\nacting and feeling Self,--what sins are not committed by that thief who\r\nrobbeth the soul of its attributes? A Brahmana should be without\r\nexertion, should never accept gifts, should win the respect of the\r\nrighteous, should be quiet, and though conversant with the Vedas should\r\nseem to be otherwise, for then only may he attain to knowledge and know\r\nBrahman. They that are poor in earthly but rich in heavenly wealth and\r\nsacrifices, become unconquerable and fearless, and they should be\r\nregarded as embodiments of Brahman. That person even, in this world, who\r\n(by performing sacrifices) succeedeth in meeting with the gods that\r\nbestow all kinds of desirable objects (on performers of sacrifices), is\r\nnot equal to him that knoweth Brahman for the performer of sacrifices\r\nhath to undergo exertions (while he that knoweth Brahman attaineth to Him\r\nwithout such exertions). He was said to be really honoured, who,\r\ndestitute of actions, is honoured by the deities. He should never regard\r\nhimself as honoured who is honoured by others. One should not, therefore,\r\ngrieveth when one is not honoured by others. People act according to\r\ntheir nature just as they open and shut their eyelids; and it is only the\r\nlearned that pay respect to others. The man that is respected should\r\nthink so. They again, in this world, that are foolish, apt to sin, and\r\nadepts in deceit, never pay respect to those that are worthy of respect;\r\non the other hand, they always show disrespect to such persons. The\r\nworld's esteem and asceticism (practices of Mauna), can never exist\r\ntogether. Know that this world is for those that are candidates for\r\nesteem, while the other world is for those that are devoted to\r\nasceticism. Here, in this world, O Kshatriya, happiness (the world's\r\nesteem) resides in worldly prosperity. The latter, however, is an\r\nimpediment (to heavenly bliss). Heavenly prosperity, on the other hand,\r\nis unattainable by one that is without true wisdom. The righteous say\r\nthat there are various kinds of gates, all difficult of being guarded,\r\nfor giving access to the last kind of prosperity. These are truth,\r\nuprightness, modesty, self-control, purity of mind and conduct and\r\nknowledge (of the Vedas). These six are destructive of vanity and\r\nignorance.'\""

O Muni, how also is asceticism\r\n(mauna) to be practised here?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'Since the Supreme Soul cannot be penetrated by both\r\nthe Vedas and the mind, it is for this that Soul itself is called mauna.\r\nThat from which both the Vedic syllable Om and this one (ordinary sounds)\r\nhave arisen, that One, O king, is displayed as the Word.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Is he that knoweth both the Rig and the Yajus\r\nVedas, is he that knoweth the Sama Veda, sullied by sins or not when he\r\ncommiteth sins?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'I tell thee truly that the man that hath not\r\nrestrained his senses is not rescued from his sinful acts by either the\r\nSama or the Rig, or the Yajus Veda. The Vedas never rescue from sin the\r\ndeceitful person living by deceit. On the other hand, like newfledged\r\nbirds forsaking their nest, the Vedas forsake such a person at the end.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O thou that hast restrained thy senses, if, indeed,\r\nthe Vedas are not competent to rescue a person without the aid of virtue,\r\nwhence then is this delusion of the Brahmanas that the Vedas are always\r\ndestructive of sins?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'O magnanimous one, this universe hath sprung from\r\nthat Supreme Soul by the union of Conditions respecting name, form, and\r\nother attributes. The Vedas also, pointing it out duly, declare the same,\r\nand inculcate that the Supreme Soul and the universe are different and\r\nnot identical. It is for attaining to that Supreme Soul that asceticism\r\nand sacrifices are ordained, and it is by these two that the man of\r\nlearning earneth virtue. Destroying sin by virtue, his soul is\r\nenlightened by knowledge. The man of knowledge, by the aid of knowledge,\r\nattaineth to the Supreme Soul. Otherwise, he that coveteth the four\r\nobjects of human pursuit, taking with him all that he doth here, enjoyeth\r\ntheir fruits hereafter, and (as those fruits) are not everlasting cometh\r\nback to the region of action (when the enjoyment is over). Indeed, the\r\nfruits of ascetic austerities performed in this world have to be enjoyed\r\nin the other world (as regards those persons who have not obtained the\r\nmastery of their souls). As regards those Brahmanas employed in ascetic\r\npractices (who have the mastery of their souls), even these regions are\r\ncapable of yielding fruits.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Sanat-sujata, how can ascetic austerities which\r\nare all of the same kind, be sometimes successful and sometimes\r\nunsuccessful? Tell us this in order that we may know it!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'That asceticism which is not stained by (desire and\r\nother) faults is said to be capable of procuring emancipation, and is,\r\ntherefore, successful, while the asceticism that is stained by vanity and\r\nwant of true devotion is regarded unsuccessful. All thy enquiries, O\r\nKshatriya, touch the very root of asceticism. It is by asceticism that\r\nthey that are learned, know Brahman and win immortality!'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have listened to what thou hast said about\r\nasceticism unstained by faults, and by which I have succeeded in knowing\r\nan eternal mystery. Tell me now, O Sanat-sujata, about asceticism that is\r\nstained by faults!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'O king, the twelve, including anger, as also the\r\nthirteen kinds of wickedness, are the faults of asceticism that is\r\nstained. Anger, lust, avarice, ignorance of right and wrong, discontent,\r\ncruelty, malice, vanity, grief, love of pleasure, envy, and speaking ill\r\nof others, are generally the faults of human beings. These twelve should\r\nalways be avoided by men. Any one amongst these can singly effect the\r\ndestruction of men, O bull among men. Indeed, every one of these wait for\r\nopportunity in respect of men, like a hunter expectant of opportunities\r\nin respect of deer. Assertion of one's own superiority, desire of\r\nenjoying others' wives, humiliating others from excess of pride,\r\nwrathfulness, fickleness, and refusing to maintain those worthy of being\r\nmaintained, these six acts of wickedness are always practised by sinful\r\nmen defying all dangers here and hereafter. He that regards the\r\ngratification of lust to be one of life's aims, he that is exceedingly\r\nproud, he that grieves having given away, he that never spends money, he\r\nthat persecutes his subjects by exacting hateful taxes, he that delights\r\nin the humiliation of others, and he that hates his own wives,--these\r\nseven are others that are also called wicked. Righteousness, truth\r\n(abstention from injury and truthfulness of speech), self-restraint,\r\nasceticism, delight in the happiness of others, modesty, forbearance,\r\nlove of others, sacrifices, gifts, perseverance, knowledge of the\r\nscriptures,--these twelve constitute the practices of Brahmanas. He that\r\nsucceeds in acquiring these twelve, becomes competent to sway the entire\r\nearth. He that is endued with three, two, or even one, of these, should\r\nbe regarded of heavenly prosperity. Self-restraint, renunciation, and\r\nknowledge of Self,--in these are emancipation. Those Brahmanas that are\r\nendued with wisdom, say, that these are attributes in which truth\r\npredominates. Self-restraint is constituted by eighteen virtues. Breaches\r\nand non-observance of ordained acts and omissions, falsehood, malice,\r\nlust, wealth, love of (sensual) pleasure, anger, grief, thirst, avarice,\r\ndeceit, joy in the misery of others, envy, injuring others, regret,\r\naversion from pious acts, forgetfulness of duty, calumniating others, and\r\nvanity-he that is freed from these (eighteen) vices; is said by the\r\nrighteous to be self-restrained. The eighteen faults (that have been\r\nenumerated) constitute what is called mada or pride. Renunciation is of\r\nsix kinds. The reverse of those six again are faults called mada. (The\r\nfaults, therefore, that go by the name of mada are eighteen and six). The\r\nsix kinds of renunciation are all commendable. The third only is\r\ndifficult of practice, but by that all sorrow is overcome. Indeed, if\r\nthat kind of renunciation be accomplished in practice, he that\r\naccomplishes it overcomes all the pairs of contraries in the world.\r\n\r\n'The six kinds of renunciation are all commendable. They are these: The\r\nfirst is never experiencing joy on occasions of prosperity. The second is\r\nthe abandonment of sacrifices, prayers, and pious acts. That which is\r\ncalled the third, O king, is the abandonment of desire or withdrawing\r\nfrom the world. Indeed, it is in consequence of this third kind of\r\nrenunciation of desire, which is evidenced by the abandonment of all\r\nobjects of enjoyment (without enjoying them) and not their abandonment\r\nafter having enjoyed them to the fill, nor by abandonment after\r\nacquisition, nor by abandonment only after one has become incompetent to\r\nenjoy from loss of appetite. The fourth kind of renunciation consists in\r\nthis: One should not grieve nor suffer his self to be afflicted by grief\r\nwhen one's actions fail, notwithstanding one's possession of all the\r\nvirtues and all kinds of wealth. Or, when anything disagreeable happens,\r\none feeleth no pain. The fifth kind of renunciation consists in not\r\nsoliciting even one's sons, wives, and others that may all be very dear.\r\nThe sixth kind consists in giving away to a deserving person who\r\nsolicits, which act of gifts is always productive of merit. By these\r\nagain, one acquires the knowledge of Self. As regards this last\r\nattribute, it involves eight qualities. These are truth, meditation,\r\ndistinction of subject and object, capacity for drawing inferences,\r\nwithdrawal from the world, never taking what belongeth to others, the\r\npractices of Brahmacharya vows (abstinence), and non-acceptance (of\r\ngifts).\r\n\r\n'So also the attribute of mada (the opposite of dama or self-restraint)\r\nhath faults which have all been indicated (in the scriptures). These\r\nfaults should be avoided. I have spoken (to thee) of renunciation and\r\nself-knowledge. And as, self-Knowledge hath eight virtues, so the want of\r\nit hath eight faults. Those faults should be avoided. O Bharata, he that\r\nis liberated from this five senses, mind, the past and the future,\r\nbecomes happy. O king, let thy soul be devoted to truth; all the worlds\r\nare established on truth; indeed, self-control, renunciation, and\r\nself-knowledge are said to have truth for their foremost attribute.\r\nAvoiding (these) faults, one should practise asceticism here. The\r\nOrdainer hath ordained that truth alone should be the vow of the\r\nrighteous. Asceticism, that is dissociated from these faults and endued\r\nwith these virtues, becomes the source of great prosperity, I have now\r\nbriefly told these about that sin-destroying and sacred subject which\r\nthou hadst asked me and which is capable of liberating a person from\r\nbirth, death, and decrepitude.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'With Akhyana (Puranas) as their fifth, the Vedas\r\ndeclare the Supreme Soul to be this universe consisting of mobile and\r\nimmobile things. Others regard four God-heads; and others three; others\r\nagain regard two; and others only one; and others regard Brahman alone as\r\nthe sole existent object (there being nothing else possessing a separate\r\nexistence). Amongst these, which should I know to be really possessed of\r\nthe knowledge of Brahman.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata, 'There is but one Brahman which is Truth's self. It is\r\nfrom ignorance of that One, that god-heads have been conceived to be\r\ndiverse. But who is there, O king, that hath attained to Truth's self or\r\nBrahman? Man regardeth himself wise without knowing that One Object of\r\nknowledge, and from desire of happiness is engaged in study and the\r\npractices of charity and sacrifices. They have deviated from Truth\r\n(Brahman) and entertain purposes corresponding (with their state) and\r\nhence relying on the truth of Vedic texts thereof perform sacrifices.\r\nSome perform (or attain the object of) sacrifices by the mind\r\n(meditation), some by words (recitation of particular prayers, or Yapa);\r\nand some by acts (actual consummation of the Yatishtoma and other costly\r\nrites). The person, however, who seeketh Brahman through Truth, obtaineth\r\nhis desired objects at home. When however, one's purposes become abortive\r\n(through absence of knowledge of Self), one should adopt vows of silence\r\nand such like, called Dikshavrata. Indeed, Diksha cometh from the root\r\nDiksha, meaning the observance of vows. As regards those that have\r\nknowledge of Self, with them Truth is the highest object of pursuit.'\r\n\r\n'The fruits of knowledge are visible; asceticism yieldeth fruits\r\nhereafter. A Brahmana who (without knowledge and asceticism) hath only\r\nread much should only be known as a great reader. Therefore, O Kshatriya,\r\nnever think that one can be a Brahman (Brahman-knowing) by only reading\r\nthe scriptures. He, on the other hand, should be known by thee to be\r\npossessed of the knowledge of the Brahman who doth not deviate from\r\nTruth. O Kshatriya, the verses that were recited by Atharvan to a\r\nconclave of great sages, in days of old, are known by the name of\r\nChhandas. They are not be regarded as acquainted with the Chhandas who\r\nhave only read through the Vedas, without having attained to the\r\nknowledge of Him who is known through the Vedas. The Chhandas, O best of\r\nmen, become the means of obtaining Brahman independently and without the\r\nnecessity of anything foreign. They cannot be regarded as acquainted with\r\nthe Chhandas who are acquainted only with the modes of sacrifice enjoined\r\nin the Vedas. On the other hand, having waited upon those that are\r\nacquainted with the Vedas, have not the righteous attained to the Object\r\nthat is knowable by the Vedas? There is none who hath truly caught the\r\nsense of the Vedas or there may be some who have, O king, caught the\r\nsense. He that hath only read the Vedas, doth not know the Object\r\nknowable by them. He, however, that is established in Truth, know the\r\nObject knowable by the Vedas. Amongst those faculties which lead to\r\nperception of the body as the acting agent, there is none by which true\r\nknowledge may be acquired. By the mind alone one cannot acquire the\r\nknowledge of Self and Not-Self. Indeed, he that knoweth Self also knoweth\r\nwhat is Not-self. He, on the other hand, that knoweth only what is\r\nNot-self, doth not know Truth. He, again, that knoweth the proofs,\r\nknoweth also that which is sought to be proved. But what that Object in\r\nits nature is (which is sought to be proved) is not known to either the\r\nVedas or those that are acquainted with the Vedas. For all that, however,\r\nthose Brahmanas that are (truly) acquainted with the Vedas succeed in\r\nobtaining a knowledge of the Object knowable (by the Vedas) through the\r\nVedas. As the branch of a particular tree is sometimes resorted to for\r\npointing out the lunar digit of the first day of the lighted fortnight so\r\nthe Vedas are used for indicating the highest attributes of the Supreme\r\nSoul. I know him to be a Brahmana (possessing a knowledge of Brahman) who\r\nexpoundeth the doubts of others, having himself mastered all his own\r\ndoubts, and who is possessed of the knowledge of Self. One cannot find\r\nwhat the Soul is by seeking in the East, the South, the West, the North,\r\nor in the subsidiary directions or horizontally. Very rarely can it be\r\nfound in him who regardeth this body be to Self. Beyond the conception of\r\neven the Vedas, the man of Yoga-meditation only can behold the Supreme.\r\nCompletely restraining all thy senses and thy mind also seek thou that\r\nBrahman which is known to reside in thy own Soul. He is not a Muni who\r\npractiseth only Yoga-meditation; nor he who liveth only in the woods\r\n(having retired from the world). He, however, is a Muni and is superior\r\nto all who knoweth his own nature. In consequence of one's being able to\r\nexpound every object (Vyakarana), one is said to be endued with universal\r\nknowledge (Vaiyakarana); and, indeed, the science itself is called\r\nVyakarana owing to its being able to expound every object to its very\r\nroot (which is Brahman). The man who beholdeth all the regions as present\r\nbefore his eyes, is said to be possessed of universal knowledge. He that\r\nstayeth in Truth and knoweth Brahman is said to be a Brahmana, and a\r\nBrahmana, possesseth universal knowledge. A Kshatriya also, that\r\npractises such virtues, may behold Brahman. He may also attain to that\r\nhigh state by ascending step by step, according to what is indicated in\r\nthe Vedas. Knowing it for certain, I tell thee this.'\""

After (the senses have been restrained\r\nand) the will hath been merged in the pure intellect, the state that\r\nsucceeds in one of utter absence of worldly thought. Even that is\r\nknowledge (leading to the attainment of Brahman). It is attainable only\r\nby practising Brahmacharya.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou sayest that the knowledge of Brahman dwelleth\r\nof itself in the mind, being only discovered by Brahmacharya; that is\r\ndwelling in the mind, it requires for its manifestation no efforts (such\r\nas are necessary for work) being manifested (of itself) during the\r\nseeking (by means of Brahmacharya). How then is the immortality\r\nassociated with the attainment of Brahman?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'Though residing in and inherent to the mind, the\r\nknowledge of Brahman is still unmanifest. It is by the aid of the pure\r\nintellect and Brahmacharya that, that knowledge is made manifest. Indeed,\r\nhaving attained to that knowledge, Yogins forsake this world. It is\r\nalways to be found among eminent preceptors. I shall now discourse to\r\nthee on that knowledge.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'What should be the nature of that Brahmacharya by\r\nwhich the knowledge of Brahman might be attained without much difficulty?\r\nO regenerate one, tell me this.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'They, who, residing in the abodes of their\r\npreceptors and winning their good will and friendship, practise\r\nBrahmacharya austerities, become even in this world the embodiments of\r\nBrahman and casting off their bodies are united with the Supreme Soul.\r\nThey that in this world desirous of obtaining the state of Brahman,\r\nsubdue all desires, and endued as they are with righteousness, they\r\nsucceed in dissociating the Soul from the body like a blade projected\r\nfrom a clump of heath. The body, O Bharata, is created by these, viz.,\r\nthe father and the mother; the (new) birth, however, that is due to the\r\npreceptor's instructions is sacred, free from decrepitude, and immortal.\r\nDiscoursing upon Brahman and granting immortality, he who wraps all\r\npersons with (the mantle of) truth, should be regarded as father and\r\nmother; and bearing in mind the good he does, one should never do him any\r\ninjury. A disciple must habitually salute his preceptor with respect, and\r\nwith purity (of body and mind) and well-directed attention, he must\r\nbetake to study. He must not consider any service as mean, and must not\r\nharbour anger. Even this is the first step of Brahmacharya. The practices\r\nof that disciple who acquires knowledge by observing the duties ordained\r\nfor one of his class are regarded also as the first step of Brahmacharya.\r\nA disciple should, with his very life and all his possessions, in\r\nthought, word and deed, do all that is agreeable to the preceptor. This\r\nis regarded as the second step of Brahmacharya. He should behave towards\r\nhis preceptor's wife and son also in the same way as towards his\r\npreceptor himself. This also is regarded as the second step of\r\nBrahmacharya. Bearing well in mind what has been done to him by the\r\npreceptor, and understanding also its object, the disciple should, with a\r\ndelighted heart think,--I have been taught and made great by him. This is\r\nthe third step of Brahmacharya. Without requiring the preceptor by\r\npayment of the final gift, a wise disciple must not betake to another\r\nmode of life; nor should he say or even think of in his mind,--I make\r\nthis gift. This is the fourth step of Brahmacharya. He attaineth the\r\nfirst step of (knowledge of Brahman which is) the object of Brahmacharya\r\nby aid of time; the second step, through the preceptor's prelections; the\r\nthird, by the power of his own understanding; and finally, the fourth, by\r\ndiscussion. The learned have said that Brahmacharya is constituted by the\r\ntwelve virtues, the Yoga-practices are called its Angas, and perseverance\r\nin Yoga-meditation called is its Valam and one is crowned with success in\r\nthis in consequence of the preceptor's aid and the understanding of the\r\nsense of the Vedas. Whatever wealth a disciple, thus engaged, may earn,\r\nshould all be given to the preceptor. It is thus that the preceptor\r\nobtaineth his highly praise-worthy livelihood. And thus also should the\r\ndisciple behave towards the preceptor's son. Thus stationed (in\r\nBrahmacharya), the disciple thriveth by all means in this world and\r\nobtaineth numerous progeny and fame. Men also from all directions shower\r\nwealth upon him; and many people come to his abode for practising\r\nBrahmacharya. It is through Brahmacharya of this kind that the celestials\r\nattained to their divinity, and sages, highly blessed and of great\r\nwisdom, have obtained the region of Brahman. It is by this that the\r\nGandharvas and the Apsaras acquired such personal beauty, and it is\r\nthrough Brahmacharya that Surya riseth to make the day. As the seekers of\r\nthe philosopher's stone derive great happiness when they obtain the\r\nobject of their search those mentioned above (the celestials and others),\r\non completing their Brahmacharya, derive great happiness in consequence\r\nof being able to have whatever they desire. He, O king, who devoted to\r\nthe practice of ascetic austerities, betaketh himself to Brahmacharya in\r\nits entirety and thereby purifieth his body, is truly wise, for by this\r\nhe becometh like a child (free from all evil passions) and triumpheth\r\nover death at last. Men, O Kshatriya, by work, however, pure, obtain only\r\nworlds that are perishable; he, however, that is blessed with Knowledge,\r\nattaineth, by the aid of that Knowledge, to Brahman which is everlasting.\r\nThere is no other path (than Knowledge or the attainment of Brahman)\r\nleading to emancipation.\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'The existence of Brahman, thou sayest, a wise man\r\nperceiveth in his own soul. Now, is Brahman white, or red, or black or\r\nblue, or purple? Tell me what is the true form and colour of the\r\nOmnipresent and Eternal Brahman?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanat-sujata said, 'Indeed, Brahman as (perceived) may appear as white,\r\nred, black, brown, or bright. But neither on the earth, nor in the sky,\r\nnor in the water of the ocean, is there anything like it, Neither in the\r\nstars, nor in lightning, nor in the clouds, is its form to be seen, nor\r\nis it visible in the atmosphere, nor in the deities, nor in the moon, nor\r\nin the sun. Neither in the Riks, nor among the Yajus, nor among the\r\nAtharvans, nor in the pure Samans, it is to be found. Verily, O king, it\r\nis not to be found in Rathantara or Varhadratha, nor in great sacrifices.\r\nIncapable of being compassed and lying beyond the reach of the limited\r\nintellect, even the universal Destroyer, after the Dissolution, is\r\nhimself lost in it. Incapable of being gazed at, it is subtle as the edge\r\nof the razor, and grosser than mountains. It is the basis upon which\r\neverything is founded; it is unchangeable; it is this visible universe\r\n(omnipresent); it is vast; it is delightful; creatures have all sprung\r\nfrom it and are to return to it. Free from all kinds of duality, it is\r\nmanifest as the universe and all-pervading. Men of learning say that it\r\nis without any change, except in the language used to describe it. They\r\nare emancipated that are acquainted with That in which this universe is\r\nestablished.'\""

Each of these, O monarch, wait for\r\nopportunities to seize mankind. Afflicted by them, men lose their senses\r\nand commit sinful acts. He that is covetous, he that is fierce, he that\r\nis harsh of speech, he that is garrulous, he that is given to nursing\r\nanger, he that is boastful,--these six of wicked disposition, on\r\nobtaining wealth, cannot treat others with courtesy. He that regardeth\r\nsensual gratification as the end of life, he that is self-conceited, he\r\nthat boasteth having made a gift, he that never spendeth, he that is weak\r\nin mind, he that is given to self-admiration, and he that hateth his own\r\nwife,--these seven are counted as wicked men of sinful habits.\r\nRighteousness, truth, asceticism, self-restraint, contentment, modesty,\r\nrenunciation, love of others, gift, acquaintance with the scriptures,\r\npatience, and forgiveness,--these twelve are the practices of a Brahmana.\r\nHe that doth not fall off from these twelve, may sway the entire earth.\r\nHe that is endued with three, or two, or even one, of these, doth never\r\nregard anything as his own to the exclusion of others. Self-restraint,\r\nrenunciation, and knowledge,--in these reside emancipation. These are the\r\nattributes of Brahmanas endued with wisdom and regarding Brahman as the\r\nhighest of all objects of attainment. True or false, it is not laudable\r\nfor a Brahmana to speak ill of others; they that do this have hell for\r\ntheir abode. Mada hath eighteen faults which have not yet been enumerated\r\nby me. They are ill-will towards others, throwing obstacles in the way of\r\nvirtuous acts, detraction, falsehood in speech, lust, anger, dependence,\r\nspeaking ill of others, finding out the faults of others for report,\r\nwaste of wealth, quarrel, insolence, cruelty to living creatures, malice,\r\nignorance, disregard of those that are worthy of regard, loss of the\r\nsenses of right and wrong, and always seeking to injure others. A wise\r\nman, therefore, should not give way to mada, for the accompaniments of\r\nmada are censurable. Friendship is said to possess six indications;\r\nfirstly, friends delight in the prosperity of friends, and secondly, are\r\ndistressed at their adversity. If any one asketh for anything which is\r\ndear to his heart, but which should not be asked for, a true friend\r\nsurely giveth away even that. Fourthly, a true friend who is of a\r\nrighteous disposition, when asked, can give away his very prosperity, his\r\nbeloved sons, and even his own wife. Fifthly, a friend should not dwell\r\nin the house of a friend, on whom he may have bestowed everything, but\r\nshould enjoy what he earneth himself. Sixthly, a friend stoppeth not to\r\nsacrifice his own good (for his friend). The man of wealth who seeketh to\r\nacquire those good qualities, and who becometh charitable and righteous\r\nrestraineth his five senses from their respective objects. Such restraint\r\nof the senses is asceticism. When it groweth in degree, it is capable of\r\nwinning regions of bliss hereafter (unlike Knowledge which leadeth to\r\nsuccess even here). They that have fallen off from patience (and are\r\nincapable, therefore, of attaining to Knowledge) acquire such asceticism\r\nin consequence of the purpose they entertain, viz., the attainment of\r\nbliss in the high regions hereafter. In consequence of his ability to\r\ngrasp that Truth (Brahman) from which sacrifices flow, the Yogin is\r\ncapable of performing sacrifices by the mind. Another performeth\r\nsacrifices by Words (Yapa) and another by Work. Truth (Brahman) resides\r\nin him who knoweth Brahman as vested with attributes. It dwelleth more\r\ncompletely in him who knoweth Brahman as divested of attributes. Listen\r\nnow to something else from me. This high and celebrated philosophy should\r\nbe taught (to disciples). All other systems are only a farrago of words.\r\nThe whole of this (universe) is established in this Yoga-philosophy. They\r\nthat are acquainted with it are not subjected to death. O king, one\r\ncannot, by Work, however well-accomplished, attain to Truth (Brahman).\r\nThe man that is destitute of knowledge even if he poureth homa libations\r\nor performeth sacrifices, can never, by Work, O king, attain to\r\nimmortality (emancipation). Nor doth he enjoy great happiness at the end.\r\nRestraining all the external senses and alone, one should seek Brahman.\r\nGiving up Work, one should not exert mentally. One should also (while\r\nthus engaged) avoid experiencing joy at praise or anger at blame. O\r\nKshatriya, by conducting himself in this way according to the successive\r\nsteps indicated in the Vedas, one may, even here, attain to Brahman.\r\nThis, O learned one, is all that I tell thee.'\""

It leadeth the senses, and it is in consequence of that Seed\r\nthat Surya shineth. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by\r\nYogins (by their mental eye). It is in consequence of that Seed (which is\r\nJoy's self) that Brahman becomes capable of Creation and it is through it\r\nthat Brahman increaseth in expansion. It is that Seed which entering into\r\nluminous bodies giveth light and heat. Without deriving its light and\r\nheat from any other thing it is self-luminous, and is an object of terror\r\nto all luminous bodies. The Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by\r\nYogins (by their mental eye). The body composed of the five grosser\r\nelements, that are themselves sprung from the five subtler ones,--the\r\nlatter, in their turn, originating in one homogeneous substance called\r\nBrahman--is upheld (realised) in consciousness by both the creature-Soul\r\nendued with life and Iswara. (These two, during sleep and the universal\r\ndissolution, are deprived of consciousness). Brahman on the other hand,\r\nwhich is never bereft of consciousness, and which is the Sun's Sun,\r\nupholdeth both these two and also the Earth and the Heaven. The Eternal\r\nOne endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). The\r\nSeed upholdeth the two gods, the Earth and the Heaven, the Directions,\r\nand the whole Universe. It is from that Seed that directions (points of\r\nthe compass) and rivers spring, and the vast seas also have derived their\r\norigin. The Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by\r\ntheir mental eye). The body is like a car destined to destruction. Its\r\nacts, however, are undying. Tied to the wheels of that car (which are\r\nrepresented by the acts of past lives), the senses, that are as steeds,\r\nlead, through the region of consciousness, the man of wisdom towards that\r\nIncreate and Unchangeable One, that One endued with Divinity is beheld by\r\nYogins (by their mental eye). The form of that One cannot be displayed by\r\nany comparison. None ever beholdeth Him by the eye. They that know him by\r\nthe rapt faculties, the mind, and the heart, become freed from death. The\r\nEternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental\r\neye). The stream of illusion is terrible; guarded by the gods, it hath\r\ntwelve fruits. Drinking of its waters and beholding many sweet things in\r\nits midst, men swim along it to and fro. This stream flows from that\r\nSeed. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their\r\nmental eye). Destined to sojourn to and fro, the creature-Soul, having\r\nreflected enjoyeth (in the other world) only half of the fruits of his\r\nacts. It is that creature-Soul which is Iswara, pervading everything in\r\nthe universe. It is Iswara that hath ordained sacrifices. That Eternal\r\nOne endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). Souls\r\ndivested of accidents, resorting to Avidya, which is like unto a tree of\r\ngolden foliage, assume accidents, and take births in different orders\r\naccording to their propensities. That Eternal One endued with Divinity\r\n(in Whom all those Souls are united) is beheld by Yogins (by their mental\r\neye). Accidents (which coming in contact with Brahman make the latter\r\nassume many forms) raise the universe in its Fulness from that Brahman\r\nwhich is full. Those accidents also, in their Fulness, arise from Brahman\r\nin its Fulness. When one succeeds in dispelling all accidents from\r\nBrahman which is ever Full, that which remains is Brahman in its Fulness.\r\nThat Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their\r\nmental eye). It is from that Seed that the five elements have arisen, and\r\nit is in it that the power resideth for controlling them. It is from that\r\nSeed that both the consumer and the consumed (called Agni and Soma) have\r\nsprung, and it is in it that the living organisms with the senses rest.\r\nEverything should be regarded to have sprung from it. That Seed called in\r\nthe Vedas TATH (Tad), we are unable to describe. That Eternal One endued\r\nwith Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). The vital air\r\ncalled Apana is swallowed up by the Air called Prana; Prana is swallowed\r\nup by the Will, and the Will by the Intellect, and the Intellect by the\r\nSupreme Soul. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins\r\n(by their mental eye). The Supreme Soul endued with four legs, called\r\nrespectively Waking, Dream, profound Sleep, and Turiya, like unto a swan,\r\ntreading above the unfathomable ocean of worldly affairs doth not put\r\nforth one leg that is hid deep. Unto him that beholdeth that leg (viz.,\r\nTuriya) as put forth for the purpose of guiding the other three, both\r\ndeath and emancipation are the same. That Eternal One endued with\r\nDivinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). Of the measure of the\r\nthumb, ever Full, and different from this eternal organism, coming in\r\ncontact with the Vital airs, the Will, the Intellect, and the ten Senses,\r\nit moveth to and fro. That Supreme Controller, worthy of reverential\r\nhymns, capable of everything when vested with accidents and the prime\r\ncause of everything, is manifest as Knowledge in creature-Souls. Fools\r\nalone do not behold him; that Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld\r\nby Yogins (by their mental eye). Among individuals there are those that\r\nhave obtained the mastery of their minds, and those that have not. Yet in\r\nall men the Supreme Soul may be seen equally. Indeed, it resideth equally\r\nin him that is emancipate and in him that is not, with only this\r\ndifference that they that are emancipate obtain honey flowing in a thick\r\njet. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their\r\nmental eye). When one maketh life's Sojourn, having attained to the\r\nknowledge of Self and Not-Self, then it matters little whether his\r\nAgni-hotra is performed or not. O monarch, let not such words as 'I am\r\nthy servant' fall from their lips. The Supreme Soul hath another name,\r\nviz., Pure Knowledge. They only that have restrained their minds obtain\r\nHim. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their\r\nmental eye). Even such is He. Illustrious and Full, all living creatures\r\nare merged into Him. He that knoweth that embodiment of Fullness\r\nattaineth to his object (emancipation) even here. That Eternal One endued\r\nwith Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). That which\r\nflieth away stretching forth thousands of wings, yea, if endued with the\r\nspeed of the mind, must yet come back to the Central Spirit within the\r\nliving organism (in which the most distant things reside... That Eternal\r\nOne endued with Divinity) is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). His\r\nform cannot be an object of sight. They only, that are of pure hearts,\r\ncan behold him. When one seeketh the good of all, succeedeth in\r\ncontrolling his mind, and never suffereth his heart to be affected by\r\ngrief, then he is said to have purified his heart. Those again that can\r\nabandon the world and all its cares, become immortal. (That Supreme Soul\r\nwhich is undying),--that Eternal One endued with Divinity--is beheld by\r\nYogins (by their mental eye). Like serpents concealing themselves in\r\nholes, there are persons who following the dictates of their preceptors,\r\nor by their own conduct conceal their vices from scrutiny's gaze. They\r\nthat are of little sense are deceived by these. In fact, bearing\r\nthemselves outwardly without any impropriety, these deceive their victims\r\nfor leading them to hell. (Him, therefore, who may be attained by\r\ncompanionship with persons of the very opposite class), that Eternal One\r\nendued with Divinity--is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). He that\r\nis emancipate thinks,--this transitory organism can never make me liable\r\nto joy and grief and the other attributes inhering to it: nor can there\r\nbe, in my case, anything like death and birth: and, further, when\r\nBrahman, which hath no opposing force to contend against and which is\r\nalike in all times and all places, constitutes the resting-place of both\r\nrealities and unrealities, how can emancipation be mine? It is I alone\r\nthat am the origin and the end of all causes and effects.--(Existing in\r\nthe form of I or Self) that Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by\r\nYogins (by their mental eye). The Brahman-knowing person, who is equal\r\nunto Brahman itself, is neither glorified by good acts nor defiled by bad\r\nones. It is only in ordinary men that acts, good or bad, produce\r\ndifferent results. The person that knoweth Brahman should be regarded as\r\nidentical with Amrita or the state called Kaivalya which is incapable of\r\nbeing affected by either virtue or vice. One should, therefore, disposing\r\nhis mind in the way indicated, attain to that essence of sweetness\r\n(Brahman). That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by\r\ntheir mental eye). Slander grieveth not the heart of the person that\r\nknoweth Brahman not the thought--I have not studied (the Veda), or, I\r\nhave not performed my Agni-hotra. The knowledge of Brahman soon imparteth\r\nto him that wisdom which they only obtain who have restrained their mind.\r\n(That Brahman which freeth the Soul from grief and ignorance)-that\r\nEternal One endued with Divinity-is beheld by Yogins (by their mental\r\neye). He, therefore, that beholdeth his own Self in everything, hath no\r\nlonger to grieve, for they only have to grieve who are employed in\r\ndiverse other occupations of the world. As one's purposes (appeasing\r\nthirst, etc.) may be served in a well as in a large reservoir or vast\r\nexpanse, so the various purposes of the Vedas may all be derivable by him\r\nthat knoweth the Soul. Dwelling in the heart, and of the measure of the\r\nthumb, that illustrious One--the embodiment of Fullness--is not an object\r\nof sight. Unborn he moveth, awake day and night. He that knoweth him,\r\nbecometh both learned and full of joy. I am called the mother and father.\r\nI am again the son. Of all that was, and of all that we will be, I am the\r\nSoul. O Bharata, I am the old grandsire, I am the father, I am the son.\r\nYe are staying in my soul, yet ye are not mine, nor am I yours! The Soul\r\nis the cause of my birth and procreation. I am the warp and woof of the\r\nuniverse. That upon which I rest is indestructible. Unborn I move, awake\r\nday and night. It is I knowing whom one becometh both learned and full of\r\njoy. Subtler than the subtle, of excellent eyes capable of looking into\r\nboth the past and the future, Brahman is awake in every creature. They\r\nthat knows Him know that Universal Father dwelleth in the heart of every\r\ncreated thing!'\""

And anxious to hear the\r\nmessage of Partha's, fraught with virtue and profit, all the kings with\r\nDhritarashtra at their head, went to that beautiful hall. Spotlessly\r\nwhite and spacious, it was adorned with a golden floor. And effulgent as\r\nthe moon and exceedingly beautiful, it was sprinkled over with\r\nsandal-water. And it was spread over with excellent seats made of gold\r\nand wood, and marble and ivory. And all the seats were wrapped with\r\nexcellent covers. And Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Salya, and\r\nKritavarman and Jayadratha, and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and Somadatta\r\nand Vahlika and Vidura of great wisdom and Yuyutsu, the great\r\ncar-warrior,--all these heroic kings in a body, O bull among the\r\nBharatas, having Dhritarashtra at their head, entered that hall of great\r\nbeauty. And Dussasana and Chitrasena, and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and\r\nDurmukha and Dussaha, Karna and Uluka and Vivingsati,--these also, with\r\nDuryodhana, the wrathful king of the Kurus, at their head, entered that\r\nhall, O monarch, like the celestials forming the train of Sakra himself.\r\nAnd filled with these heroes possessed of arms like maces of iron, that\r\nhall looked, O king, like a mountain-cave filled with lions. And all\r\nthese mighty bowmen, endued with great energy and blazing, with solar\r\neffulgence, entering the hall, seated themselves on those beautiful\r\nseats. And after all those kings, O Bharata, had taken their seats, the\r\norderly-in-waiting announced the arrival of the Suta's son, saying,\r\n'Yonder cometh the car that was despatched to the Pandavas. Our envoy\r\nhath returned quickly, by the aid of well-trained steeds of the, Sindhu\r\nbreed.' And having approached the place with speed and alighted from the\r\ncar, Sanjaya adorned with ear-rings entered that hall full of high-souled\r\nkings. And the Suta said, 'Ye Kauravas, know that having gone to the\r\nPandavas I am just returning from them. The sons of Pandu offer their\r\ncongratulations to all the Kurus according to the age of each. Having\r\noffered their respects in return, the sons of Pritha have saluted the\r\naged ones, and those that are equal to them in years, and those also that\r\nare younger, just as each should, according to his years, be saluted.\r\nListen, ye kings, to what I, instructed before by Dhritarashtra, said to\r\nthe Pandavas, having gone to them from this place.'"

Fearless (in battle) and conscious of the might of his\r\narms, the heroic Kiritin, eager for fight, spoke thus unto me in the\r\npresence of Vasudeva, 'Do thou, O suta, say unto Dhritarashtra's son, in\r\nthe presence of all the Kurus, and also in the hearing of that Suta's\r\nson, of foul tongue and wicked soul, of little sense, stupid reason, and\r\nof numbered days, who always desires to fight against me, and also in the\r\nhearing of those kings assembled for fighting against the Pandavas, and\r\ndo thou see that all the words now uttered by me are heard well by that\r\nking with his counsellors.' O monarch, even as the celestials eagerly\r\nlisten to the words of their chief armed with the thunderbolt, so did the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas listened to those words of grave import\r\nuttered by Kiritin. Just these are the words spoken by Arjuna, the\r\nwielder of Gandiva, eager for the fight and with eyes red as the lotus,\r\n'If Dhritarashtra's son doth not surrender to king Yudhishthira of the\r\nAjamida race, his kingdom, then (it is evident) there must be some sinful\r\nact committed by the sons of Dhritarashtra, whose consequences are yet\r\nunreaped by them, for it can be nothing else when they desire battle with\r\nBhimasena and Arjuna, and the Aswins and Vasudeva and Sini's son, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna infallible in arms, and Sikhandin, and Yudhishthira, who\r\nis like Indra himself and who can consume heaven and earth by merely\r\nwishing them ill. If Dhritarashtra's son desireth war with these, then\r\nwill all objects of the Pandavas be accomplished. Do not, therefore,\r\npropose peace for the sons of Pandu, but have war if thou likest. That\r\nbed of woe in the woods which was Yudhishthira's when that virtuous son\r\nof Pandu lived in exile; Oh, let a more painful bed than that, on the\r\nbare earth, be now Duryodhana's and let him lie down on it, as his last,\r\ndeprived of life. Win thou over those men that were ruled by the wicked\r\nDuryodhana of unjust conduct to the side of Pandu's son endued with\r\nmodesty and wisdom and asceticism and self-restraint and valour and might\r\nregulated by virtue. Endued with humility and righteousness, with\r\nasceticism and self-restraint and with valour regulated by virtue, and\r\nalways speaking the truth, our king, though afflicted by numerous\r\ndeceptions, hath forgiven all and hath patiently borne great wrongs. When\r\nthe eldest son of Pandu, of soul under proper control, will indignantly\r\ndart at the Kurus his terrible wrath accumulated for years, then will the\r\nson of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. As a blazing fire burning all\r\naround consumeth dry grass in the hot season, so will Yudhishthira,\r\ninflamed with wrath, consume the Dhritarashtra host by glance alone of\r\nhis eye. When Dhritarashtra's son will behold Bhimasena, that wrathful\r\nPandava of terrific impetus, stationed on his car, mace in hand, vomiting\r\nthe venom of his wrath, then will Duryodhana repent for this war. Indeed,\r\nwhen he will behold Bhimasena, who always fighteth in the van, accoutred\r\nin mail, scarcely capable of being looked at even by his own followers\r\nfelling hostile heroes and devastating the enemy's ranks like Yama\r\nhimself, then will the exceedingly vain Duryodhana recollect these words.\r\nWhen he will behold elephants, looking like mountain-peaks, felled by\r\nBhimasena, blood flowing their broken heads like water from broken casks,\r\nthen will Dhritarashtra's son repent for this war. When falling upon the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra the fierce Bhima of terrible mien, mace in hand,\r\nwill slaughter them, like a huge lion falling upon a herd of kine, then\r\nwill Duryodhana repent for this war. When the heroic Bhima undaunted even\r\nin situations of great danger and skilled in weapons-when that grinder of\r\nhostile hosts in battle,--mounted on his car, and alone will crush by his\r\nmace crowds of superior cars and entire ranks of infantry, seize by his\r\nnooses strong as iron, the elephants of the hostile army, and mow down\r\nthe Dhritarashtra's host, like a sturdy woodsman cutting a forest down\r\nwith an axe, then will Dhritarashtra's son repent for this war. When he\r\nwill behold the Dhartarashtra's host consumed like a hamlet full of\r\nstraw-built huts by fire, or a field of ripe corn by lightning,--indeed\r\nwhen he will behold his vast army scattered, its leaders slain, and men\r\nrunning away with their back towards the field afflicted with fear, and\r\nall the warriors, humbled to the dust, being scorched by Bhimasena with\r\nthe fire of his weapons,--then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for\r\nthis war, When Nakula, that warrior of wonderful feats, that foremost of\r\nall car-warriors, dexterously shooting arrows by hundreds, will mangle\r\nthe car-warriors of Duryodhana, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent\r\nfor this war. Accustomed to enjoy all the comforts and luxuries of life,\r\nwhen Nakula, recollecting that bed of woe on which he had slept for a\r\nlong time in the woods, will vomit the poison of his wrath like an angry\r\nsnake, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. Ready to\r\nlay down their very lives, the (allied) monarchs, O Suta, urged to battle\r\nby king Yudhishthira the just, will furiously advance on their\r\nresplendent cars against the (hostile) army. Beholding this, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra will certainly have to repent. When the Kuru prince will\r\nbehold the five heroic sons of (Draupadi), tender in years but not in\r\nacts, and all well-versed in arms, rush, reckless of their lives, against\r\nthe Kauravas, then will that son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war.\r\nWhen bent upon carnage Sahadeva, mounted on his car of noiseless wheels,\r\nand motion incapable of being obstructed, and set with golden stars, and\r\ndrawn by well-trained steeds, will make the heads of monarchs roll on the\r\nfield of battle with volleys of arrows,--indeed, beholding that warrior\r\nskilled in weapons, seated on his car in the midst of that frightful\r\nhavoc, turning now to the left and now to the right and falling upon the\r\nfoe in all directions, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this\r\nwar. Indeed, when the modest but mighty Sahadeva, skilled in battle,\r\ntruthful, conversant with all the ways of morality, and endued with great\r\nactivity and impetuousness, will fall upon the son of Gandhari in fierce\r\nencounter and rout all his followers, then will the son of Dhritarashtra\r\nrepent for this war. When he will behold the sons of Draupadi, those\r\ngreat bowmen, those heroes skilled in weapons and well-versed in all the\r\nways of chariot-fighting, dart at the foe like snakes of virulent poison,\r\nthen will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, Abhimanyu, skilled in arms like Krishna himself, will\r\noverpower the foe showering upon them, like the very clouds, a thick\r\ndownpour of arrows, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this\r\nwar. Indeed, when he will behold that son of Subhadra, a child in years\r\nbut not in energy, skilled in weapons and like unto Indra himself,\r\nfailing like Death's self upon the ranks of the foe, then will the son of\r\nDhritarashtra repent for this war. When the youthful Prabhadrakas, endued\r\nwith great activity, well-versed in battle, and possessed of the energy\r\nof lions will overthrow the sons of Dhritarashtra with all their troops,\r\nthen will Duryodhana repent for this war. When those veteran car-warriors\r\nVirata and Drupada will assail, at the head of their respective\r\ndivisions, the sons of Dhritarashtra and their ranks, then will\r\nDuryodhana repent for this war. When Drupada, skilled in weapons, and\r\nseated on his car, desirous of plucking the heads of youthful warriors,\r\nwill wrathfully strike them off with arrows shot from his bow, then will\r\nthe son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes, Virata will penetrate into the ranks of the foe, grinding all\r\nbefore him with the aid of his Matsya warriors of cool courage, then will\r\nthe son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When he will behold in the\r\nvery van the eldest son of the Matsya king, of cool courage and collected\r\nmien, seated on his car and accoutred in mail on behalf of the Pandavas,\r\nthen will the son of Dhritarashtra. repent for this war. I tell thee\r\ntruly that when that foremost of Kaurava heroes, the virtuous son of\r\nSantanu, will be slain in battle by Sikhandin, then all our foes, without\r\ndoubt, will perish. Indeed, when, overthrowing numerous car-warriors,\r\nSikhandin, seated on his own well-protected car, will proceed towards\r\nBhishma, crushing multitudes of (hostile) cars by means of his own\r\npowerful steeds, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war.\r\nWhen he will behold Dhristadyumna unto whom Drona hath imparted all the\r\nmysteries of the science of weapons, stationed in splendour in the very\r\nvan of the Srinjaya ranks, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent.\r\nIndeed, when the leader of the Pandava host, of immeasurable prowess and\r\ncapable of withstanding the rush of any force, will proceed to attack\r\nDrona in battle, crushing with his arrows the Dhritarashtra ranks, then\r\nwill Duryodhana repent for this war. What enemy can withstand him who\r\nhath, for fighting in his van, that lion of the Vrishni race, that chief\r\nof the Somakas, who is modest and intelligent, mighty and endued with\r\ngreat energy, and blessed with every kind of prosperity? Say also this\r\n(unto Duryodhana),--Do not covet (the kingdom). We have chosen, for our\r\nleader, the dauntless and mighty car-warrior Satyaki, the grandson of\r\nSini, skilled in weapons and having none on earth as his equal. Of broad\r\nchest and long arms, that grinder of foes, unrivalled in battle, and\r\nacquainted with the best of weapons, the grandson of Sini, skilled in\r\narms and perfectly dauntless, is a mighty car-warrior wielding a bow of\r\nfull four cubits' length. When that slayer of foes, that chief of the\r\nSinis, urged by me, will shower, like the very clouds, his arrows on the\r\nfoe, completely overwhelming their leaders with that downpour, then will\r\nthe son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When that illustrious\r\nwarrior of long arms and firm grasp of the bow, musters his resolution\r\nfor fight, the foe then, like kine getting the scent of the lion, fly\r\naway from him before even commencing the encounter. That illustrious\r\nwarrior of long arms and firm grasp of the bow is capable of splitting\r\nthe very hills and destroying the entire universe. Practised in weapons,\r\nskilled (in battle), and endued with exceeding lightness of hand, he\r\nshineth on the field of battle like the sun himself in the sky. That lion\r\nof the Vrishni race, that scion of Yadu's line, of superior training,\r\nhath diverse wonderful and excellent weapons. Indeed, Satyaki is\r\npossessed of a knowledge of all those uses of weapons that are said to be\r\nof the highest excellence. When he will behold in battle the golden car\r\nof Satyaki of Madhu's race, drawn by four white steeds, then will that\r\nwretch of uncontrolled passions, the son of Dhritarashtra, repent. When\r\nhe will also behold my terrible car, endued with the effulgence of gold\r\nand bright gems, drawn by white steeds and furnished with the banner\r\nbearing the device of the Ape and guided by Kesava himself, then will\r\nthat wretch of uncontrolled passions repent. When he will hear the fierce\r\ntwang produced by the constant stretch of the bow-string with fingers\r\ncased in leather gloves,--that terrible twang, loud as the rolling of the\r\nthunder, of my bow Gandiva wielded by me in the midst of the great\r\nbattle,--then will that wicked wretch, the son of Dhritarashtra repent,\r\nbeholding himself abandoned by his troops, flying away like kine from the\r\nfield of battle in all directions, overwhelmed with the darkness created\r\nby my arrowy downpour. When he will behold innumerable keen-edged arrows,\r\nfurnished with beautiful wings, and capable of penetrating into the very\r\nvitals, shot from the string of Gandiva, like fierce and terrible flashes\r\nof lightning emitted by the clouds, destroying enemies by thousands, and\r\ndevouring numberless steeds and elephants clad in mail, then will the son\r\nof Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When he will behold the arrows shot\r\nby the enemy turned off, or turned back struck by my shafts, or cut to\r\npieces pierced transversely by my arrows, then will the foolish son of\r\nDhritarashtra repent for this war. When broad-headed arrows shot by my\r\nhands will strike off the heads of youthful warriors, like birds picking\r\noff fruits from the tree-tops, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent\r\nfor this war. When he will behold excellent warriors of his failing down\r\nfrom their cars, and elephants and steeds rolling on the field, deprived\r\nof life by my arrows, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this\r\nwar. When he will behold his brothers, even before fairly coming within\r\nthe range of the enemy's weapons, die all around, without having achieved\r\nanything in battle, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this\r\nwar. When pouring my blazing shafts incessantly, I will, like Death\r\nhimself with mouth wide-open, destroy on all sides multitudes of cars and\r\nfoot-soldiers, then will that wretch repent. When he will behold his own\r\ntroops, covered with the dust raised by my car wander in all directions,\r\ntorn to pieces by Gandiva and reft of senses, then will that wretch\r\nrepent. When he will behold his whole army running away in fear in all\r\ndirections, mangled in limbs, and bereft of senses; when he will behold\r\nhis steeds, elephants, and foremost of heroes slain; when he will see his\r\ntroops thirsty, struck with panic, wailing aloud, dead and dying, with\r\ntheir animals exhausted; and hair, bones and skulls lying in heaps around\r\nlike half-wrought works of the Creator, then will that wretch repent.\r\nWhen he will behold on my car, Gandiva, Vasudeva, and the celestial conch\r\nPanchajanya, myself, my couple of inexhaustible quivers, and my conch\r\ncalled Devadatta as also my white steeds, then will the son of\r\nDhritarashtra repent for this war. When I consume the Kauravas, like Agni\r\nconsuming innumerable wicked souls assembled together at the time of\r\nushering in another Yuga at the end of the last one, then Dhritarashtra\r\nwith all his sons repent. When the wicked, hearted and the wrathful son\r\nof Dhritarashtra will be deprived of prosperity with brothers and army\r\nand followers, then, reft of pride and losing heart and trembling all\r\nover, will that fool repent. One morning when I had finished my\r\nwater-rites and prayers, a Brahmana spoke unto me these pleasant words,\r\n'O Partha, thou shalt have to execute a very difficult task. O\r\nSavyasachin, thou shalt have to fight with thy foes. Either Indra riding\r\non his excellent steed and thunderbolt in hand will walk before thee\r\nslaying thy foes in battle, or Krishna, the son of Vasudeva will protect\r\nthee from behind riding on his car drawn by the steeds headed by Sugriva.\r\nRelying on those words, I have, in this battle passing over Indra, the\r\nwielder of the thunderbolt, preferred Vasudeva as my ally. That Krishna\r\nhath been obtained by me for the destruction of those wicked ones. I see\r\nthe hand of the gods in all this. The person whose success is only wished\r\nfor by Krishna, without the latter's actually taking up arms in his\r\nbehalf, is certain to prevail over all enemies, even if those be the\r\ncelestials with Indra at their head, while anxiety there is none if they\r\nbe human. He that wisheth to conquer in battle that foremost of heroes,\r\nVasudeva's son Krishna endued with great energy, wisheth to cross by his\r\ntwo arms alone the great ocean of wide expanse and immeasurable water.\r\nHe. that wisheth to split by a slap of his palm the high Kailasa\r\nmountain, is not able to do the slightest damage to the mountain although\r\nhis hand only with its nails is sure to wear away. He that would conquer\r\nVasudeva in battle, would, with his two arms, extinguish a blazing fire,\r\nstop the Sun and the Moon, and plunder by force the Amrita of the\r\ngods,--that Vasudeva, viz., who having mowed down in battle by main force\r\nall the royal warriors of the Bhoja race, had carried off on a single car\r\nRukmini of great fame for making her his wife; and by her was afterwards\r\nborn Pradyumna of high soul. It was this favourite of the gods, who,\r\nhaving speedily smashed the Gandharas and conquered all the sons of\r\nNagnajit, forcibly liberated from confinement king Sudarsana of great\r\nenergy. It was he that slew king Pandya by striking his breast against\r\nhis, and moved down the Kalingas in battle Burnt by him, the city of\r\nVaranasi remained for many years without e king, incapable of being\r\ndefeated by others. Ekalavya, the king of the Nishadas, always used to\r\nchallenge this one to battle; but slain by Krishna he lay dead like the\r\nAsura Jambha violently thrashed on a hillock. It was Krishna, who, having\r\nBaladeva for his second, slew Ugrasena's wicked son (Kansa), seated in\r\ncourt in the midst of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, and then gave unto\r\nUgrasena the kingdom. It was Krishna who fought with king Salya, the lord\r\nof Saubha, stationed in the skies, fearless in consequence of his powers\r\nof illusion; and it was he, who, at the gate of Subha caught with his\r\nhands the fierce Sataghni (hurled by Saubha's lord). What mortal is able\r\nto bear his might? The Asuras had a city named Pragjyotisha, which was\r\nformidable, inaccessible and unbearable. It was there that the mighty\r\nNaraka, the son of the Earth, kept the jewelled ear-rings of Aditi,\r\nhaving brought them by force. The very gods, who, fearless of death,\r\nassembled together with Sakra at their head were incapable of conquering\r\nhim. Beholding Kesava's prowess and might, and weapon that is\r\nirresistible, and knowing also the object of his birth, the gods employed\r\nhim for the destruction of those Asuras. Vasudeva, too, endued with all\r\nthe divine attributes that ensure success, agreed to undertake that\r\nexceedingly difficult task. In the city of Nirmochana that hero slew six\r\nthousand Asuras, and cutting into pieces innumerable keen-edged shafts,\r\nhe slew Mura and hosts of Rakshasas, and then entered that city. It was\r\nthere, that an encounter took place between the mighty' Naraka and Vishnu\r\nof immeasurable strength. Slain by Krishna, Naraka lay lifeless there,\r\nlike a Karnikara tree uprooted by the wind. Having slain the Earth's son,\r\nNaraka, and also Mura, and having recovered those jewelled ear-rings, the\r\nlearned Krishna of unparalleled prowess came back, adorned with beauty\r\nand undying fame. Having witnessed his terrible feats in that battle, the\r\ngods then and there blessed him saying, 'Fatigue will never be thine in\r\nfights, neither the firmament nor the waters shall stop thy course, nor\r\nshall weapons penetrate thy body.' And Krishna, by all this, regarded\r\nhimself amply rewarded. Immeasurable, and possessed of great might, in\r\nVasudeva ever exist all the virtues. And yet the son of Dhritarashtra\r\nseeketh to vanquish that unbearable Vishnu of infinite energy, for that\r\nwretch often thinks of imprisoning him. Krishna, however, beareth all\r\nthis for our sake only. That wretch seeketh to create a sudden disunion\r\nbetween Krishna and myself. How far, however, he is capable of taking\r\naway the affection of Krishna from the Pandavas, he will see on the field\r\nof battle. Having bowed down unto Santanu's son, and also Drona with his\r\nson, and the unrivalled son of Saradwat, I shall fight for regaining our\r\nkingdom. The God of justice himself, I am sure, will bring destruction on\r\nthat sinful man who will fight with the Pandavas. Deceitfully defeated at\r\ndice by those wretches, ourselves, of royal birth, had to pass twelve\r\nyears in great distress in the forest and one long year in a state of\r\nconcealment. When those Pandavas are still alive, how shall the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra rejoice, possessing rank and affluence? If they vanquish us\r\nin fight, aided by the very gods headed by Indra, the then practice of\r\nvice would be better than virtue, and surely there would be nothing like\r\nrighteousness on earth. If man is affected by his acts, if we be superior\r\nto Duryodhana, then, I hope that, with Vasudeva as my second, I shall\r\nslay Duryodhana, with all his kinsmen. O lord of men, if the act of\r\nrobbing us of our kingdom be wicked, if these our own good deeds be not\r\nfruitless, than beholding both this and that, it seems to me, the\r\noverthrow of Duryodhana is certain. Ye Kauravas, ye will see it with your\r\neyes that, if they fight, the sons of Dhritarashtra shall certainly\r\nperish. If they act otherwise instead of fighting, then they may live;\r\nbut in the event of a battle ensuing, none of them will be left alive.\r\nSlaying all the sons of Dhritarashtra along with Karna, I shall surely\r\nwrest the hole of their kingdom, Do ye, meanwhile, whatever ye think\r\nbest, and enjoy also your wives and other sweet things of life. There\r\nare, with us, many aged Brahmanas, versed in various sciences, of amiable\r\nbehaviour, well-born, acquainted with the cycle of the years, engaged in\r\nthe study of astrology, capable of understanding with certainty the\r\nmotions of planets and the conjunctions of stars as also of explaining\r\nthe mysteries of fate, and answering questions relating to the future,\r\nacquainted with the signs of the Zodiac, and versed with the occurrences\r\nof every hour, who are prophesying the great destruction of the Kurus and\r\nthe Srinjayas, and the ultimate victory of the Pandavas, so that\r\nYudhishthira, who never made an enemy, already regardeth his objects\r\nfulfilled in consequence of the slaughter of his foes. And Janardana\r\nalso, that lion among the Vrishnis, endued with the knowledge of the\r\ninvisible future, without doubt, beholdeth all this. And I also, with\r\nunerring foresight, myself behold that future, for that foresight of\r\nmine, acquired of old, is not obstructed. The sons of Dhritarashtra, if\r\nthey fight, will not live. My bow, Gandiva, yawneth without being\r\nhandled; my bow-string trembleth without being stretched; and arrows\r\nalso, issuing from my quiver's mouth, are again and again seeking to fly.\r\nMy bright scimitar issueth of itself from its sheath, like a snake\r\nquitting its own worn off slough; and on the top of my flag-staff are\r\nheard terrific voices,--When shall thy car be yoked, O Kiritin?\r\nInnumerable jackals set up hideous howls at night, and Rakshasas\r\nfrequently alight from the sky; deer and jackals and peacocks, crows and\r\nvultures and cranes, and wolves and birds of golden plumage, follow in\r\nthe rear of my car when my white steeds are yoked unto it. Single-handed\r\nI can despatch, with arrowy showers, all warlike kings, to the regions of\r\ndeath. As a blazing fire consumeth a forest in the hot season, so,\r\nexhibiting diverse courses, I will hurl those great weapons called\r\nSthur-karna, Pasupata, and Brahma, and all those that Sakra gave me, all\r\nof which are endued with fierce impetuosity. And with their aid, setting\r\nmy heart on the destruction of those monarchs, I will leave no remnant of\r\nthose that come to the field of battle. I will rest, having done all\r\nthis. Even this is my chief and decided resolve. Tell them this, O son of\r\nGavalgana. Look at the folly of Duryodhana! O Suta, they that are\r\ninvincible in battle even if encountered with the aid of the very gods\r\nheaded by Indra,--even against them that son of Dhritarashtra thinketh of\r\nwarring! But so let it be even as the aged Bhishma, the son of Santanu,\r\nand Kripa, and Drona with his son, and Vidura endued with great wisdom,\r\nare saying, 'May the Kauravas all live long!\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'In the midst, O Bharata, of all those assembled\r\nkings, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, then said these words unto\r\nDuryodhana, 'Once on a time, Vrihaspati and Sakra went to Brahma. The\r\nMaruts also with Indra, the Vasus with Agni, the Adityas, the Sadhyas,\r\nthe seven celestial Rishis, the Gandharvas, Viswavasu, and the beautiful\r\ntribes of the Apsaras, all approached the ancient Grandsire. And having\r\nbowed down unto the Lord of the universe, all those dwellers of heaven\r\nsat around him. Just then, the two ancient deities, the Rishis Nara and\r\nNarayana, as if drawing unto themselves by their own energy the minds and\r\nenergies of all who were present there, left the place.' Thereupon,\r\nVrihaspati asked Brahma, saying,--Who are these two that leave the place\r\nwithout worshipping thee? Tell us, O Grandsire, who are they? Thus asked,\r\nBrahma said, 'These two, endued with ascetic merit, blazing with\r\neffulgence and beauty, illuminating both the earth and the heaven,\r\npossessed of great might, and pervading and surpassing all, are Nara and\r\nNarayana, dwelling now in the region of Brahman having arrived from the\r\nother world. Endued with great might and prowess, they shine in\r\nconsequence of their own asceticism. By their acts they always contribute\r\nto the joy of the world. Worshipped by the gods and the Gandharvas, they\r\nexist only for the destruction of Asuras.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'Having heard these words, Sakra went to the spot\r\nwhere those two were practising ascetic austerities, accompanied by all\r\nthe celestials and having Vrihaspati at their head. At that time, the\r\ndwellers of heaven had been very much alarmed in consequence of a war\r\nraging between themselves and the Asuras. And Indra asked that\r\nillustrious couple to grant him a boon. Thus solicited, O best of the\r\nBharata race, those two said,--Name thou the boon.--Upon this Sakra said\r\nunto them,--Give us your aid.--They then said unto Sakra,--We will do\r\nwhat thou wishest. And then it was with their aid that Sakra subsequently\r\nvanquished the Daityas and the Danavas. The chastiser of foes, Nara, slew\r\nin battle hundreds and thousands of Indra's foes among the Paulomas and\r\nthe Kalakhanjas. It was this Arjuna, who, riding on a whirling car,\r\nsevered in battle, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of the Asura\r\nJambha while the latter was about to swallow him. It was he who afflicted\r\n(the Daitya city of Hiranyapura) on the other side of the ocean, having\r\nvanquished in battle sixty thousands of Nivatakavachas. It was this\r\nconqueror of hostile towns, this Arjuna of mighty arms, that gratified\r\nAgni, having vanquished the very gods with Indra at their head. And\r\nNarayana also hath, in this world, destroyed in the same way numberless\r\nother Daityas and Danavas. Even such are those two of mighty energy that\r\nare now seen united with each other. It hath been heard by us that the\r\ntwo heroic and mighty car-warriors, Vasudeva and Arjuna, that are now\r\nunited with each other, are those same ancient gods, the divine Nara and\r\nNarayana. Amongst all on earth they are incapable of being vanquished by\r\nthe Asuras and the gods headed by Indra himself. That Narayana is\r\nKrishna, and that Nara is Falguna. Indeed, they are one Soul born in\r\ntwain. These two, by their acts, enjoy numerous eternal and inexhaustible\r\nregions, and are repeatedly born in those worlds when destructive wars\r\nare necessary. For this reason their mission is to fight. Just this is\r\nwhat Narada, conversant with the Vedas, had said unto the Vrishnis. When\r\nthou, O Duryodhana, wilt see Kesava with conch-shell and discus, and mace\r\nin hand, and that terrible wielder of the bow, Arjuna, armed with\r\nweapons, when thou wilt behold those eternal and illustrious ones, the\r\ntwo Krishnas seated on the same car, then wilt thou, O child, remember\r\nthese my words. Why should not such danger threaten the Kurus when thy\r\nintellect, O child, hath fallen off from both profit and virtue? If thou\r\nheedest not my words, thou shalt then have to hear of the slaughter of\r\nmany, for all the Kauravas accept thy opinion. Thou art alone in holding\r\nas true the opinion, O bull of the Bharata race, only three persons,\r\nviz., Karna, a low-born Suta's son cursed by Rama, Sakuni, the son of\r\nSuvala, and thy mean and sinful brother Dussasana.'\r\n\r\n'Karna said. 'It behoveth thee not, O blessed grandsire, to use such\r\nwords towards me, for I have adopted the duties of the Kshatriya order\r\nwithout falling off from those of my own. Besides, what wickedness is\r\nthere in me? I have no sin known to any one of Dhritarashtra's people. I\r\nhave never done any injury to Dhritarashtra's son; on the other hand, I\r\nwill slay all the Pandavas in battle. How can they that are wise make\r\npeace again with those that have before been injured? It is always my\r\nduty to do all that is agreeable to king Dhritarashtra, and especially to\r\nDuryodhana, for he is in possession of the kingdom.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having listened to these words of Karna,\r\nBhishma the son of Santanu, addressing king Dhritarashtra, again said,\r\n'Although this one often boasteth saying,--I shall slay the\r\nPandavas,--yet he is not equal to even a sixteenth part of high-souled\r\nPandavas. Know that the great calamity that is about to overtake thy sons\r\nof wicked souls, is the act of this wretched son of a Suta! Relying upon\r\nhim, thy foolish son Suyodhana hath insulted those heroes of celestial\r\ndescent, those chastiser of all foes. What, however, is that difficult\r\nfeat achieved by this wretch before that is equal to any of those\r\nachieved of old by every one of the Pandavas? Beholding in the city of\r\nVirata his beloved brother slain by Dhananjaya who displayed such\r\nprowess, what did this one then do? When Dhananjaya, rushing against all\r\nthe assembled Kurus, crushed them and took away their robes, was this one\r\nnot there then? When thy son was being led away as a captive by the\r\nGandharvas on the occasion of the tale of the cattle, where was this son\r\nof a Suta then who now belloweth like a bull? Even there, it was Bhima,\r\nand the illustrious Partha, and the twins, that encountered the\r\nGandharvas and vanquished them. Ever beautiful, and always unmindful of\r\nboth virtue and profit, these, O bull of the Bharata race, are the many\r\nfalse things, blessed be thou, that this one uttereth.'\r\n\r\n'Having heard these words of Bhishma, the high-souled son of Bharadwaja,\r\nhaving paid due homage unto Dhritarashtra and the assembled kings, spoke\r\nunto him these words, 'Do that, O king, which the best of the Bharatas,\r\nBhishma, hath said. It behoveth thee not to act according to the words of\r\nthose that are covetous of wealth. Peace with the Pandavas, before the\r\nwar breaks out, seems to be the best. Everything said by Arjuna and\r\nrepeated here by Sanjaya, will, I know, be accomplished by that son of\r\nPandu, for there is no bowman equal unto him in the three world!' Without\r\nregarding, however, these words spoken by both Drona and Bhishma, the\r\nking again asked Sanjaya about the Pandavas. From that moment, when the\r\nking returned not a proper answer to Bhishma and Drona, the Kauravas gave\r\nup all hopes of life.'\""

Hear, O King, with whom the Pandavas will contend against you.\r\nWith that hero Dhrishtadyumna as their ally, they will fight against you.\r\nWith that personage of virtuous soul, who never forsaketh truth through\r\nanger or fear, temptation, or for the sake of wealth, of disputation; and\r\nwho is, O King, a very authority in matters of religion, himself being\r\nthe best of those that practise virtue;--with him, who hath never made an\r\nenemy, the sons of Pandu will fight against you.' He unto whom no one on\r\nearth is equal in might of arms, and who, wielding his bow had brought\r\nall kings under subjection, and who, vanquishing of old all the people of\r\nKasi and Anga and Magadha, as also the Kalingas;--with that Bhimasena\r\nwill the sons of Pandu fight against, you. Indeed, he through whose might\r\nthe four sons of Pandu quickly could alight on the earth, having issued\r\nforth from the (burning) house of lac that son of Kunti, Vrikodara, who\r\nbecame the means of their rescue from the cannibal Hidimva; that son of\r\nKunti, Vrikodara, who became their refuge when the daughter of Yajnasena\r\nwas being carried away by Jayadratha; indeed, with that Bhima. who\r\nrescued the assembled Pandavas from the conflagration at Varanavata; even\r\nwith him (as their ally) will they fight against you. He, who for the\r\ngratification of Krishna slew the Krodhavasas, having penetrated the\r\nrugged and terrible mountains of Gandhamadana, he to whose arms hath been\r\nimparted the might of ten thousand elephants; with that Bhimasena (as\r\ntheir ally) the Pandavas will fight against you. That hero, who, for the\r\ngratification of Agni, with Krishna only for his second, bravely\r\nvanquished of yore Purandara in fight; he who gratified by combat that\r\nGod of gods, the trident-bearing lord of Uma--Mahadeva himself having the\r\nmountains for his abode; that foremost of warriors who subjugated all the\r\nkings of the earth--with that Vijaya (as their ally) the Pandavas will\r\nencounter you in battle. That wonderful warrior Nakula, who vanquished\r\nthe whole of the western world teeming with Mlechchas, is present in the\r\nPandava camp. With that handsome hero, that unrivalled bowman, that son\r\nof Madri, O Kauravya, the Pandavas will fight against you. He who\r\nvanquished in battle the warriors of Kasi, Anga, and Kalinga,--with that\r\nSahadeva will the Pandavas encounter you in battle.

With those mighty bowmen, all, brothers those five\r\nKekaya princes, with those heroes clad in mail will the Pandavas fight\r\nagainst you. With that warrior of long arms: endued with great activity\r\nin the use of weapons, possessed of intelligence and prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, with that Yuyudhana, the lion of the Vrishni race, will\r\nyou have to fight. He, who had been the refuge of the high-souled\r\nPandavas for a time, with that Virata, will ye have an encounter in\r\nbattle.

The high-souled sons of Draupadi, tender in years but invincible in\r\nbattle, and unapproachable like snakes of virulent poison, with them,\r\nwill the Pandavas fight against you. He, that in energy is like unto\r\nKrishna and in self-restraint unto Yudhishthira, with that Abhimanyu,\r\nwill the Pandavas fight against you. That war-like son of Sisupala,\r\nDhrishtaketu of great fame, who in energy is beyond comparison and who\r\nwhen angry is incapable of being withstood in battle, with that king of\r\nthe Chedis who has joined the Pandavas at the head of an Akshauhini of\r\nhis own, will the sons of Pandu fight against you.

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'All these named by thee are, indeed, endued with\r\ngreat courage, but all of them together are equal to Bhima singly. My\r\nfear, O child, from the wrathful Bhima is, indeed, very great, like that\r\nof fat deer from an enraged tiger. I pass all my nights in sleeplessness,\r\nbreathing deep and hot sighs afraid of Vrikodara, O child, like an animal\r\nof any other species afraid of the lion. Of mighty arms, and in energy\r\nequal unto Sakra himself, I see not in this whole army even one that can\r\nwithstand him in battle. Exceedingly wrathful and determined in\r\nanimosity, that son of Kunti and Pandu smileth not even in jest, is mad\r\nwith rage, casteth his glances obliquely, and speaketh in a voice of\r\nthunder. Of great impetuosity and great courage, of long arms and great\r\nmight, he will not, in battle, leave even one of my foolish sons alive.\r\nIndeed, Vrikodara, that bull among the Kurus, whirling his mace in\r\nbattle, will, like a second Yama mace in hand slay all my sons who are\r\nafflicted by a heavy calamity. Even now I see that terrible mace of his,\r\nwith eight sides made of steel, and adorned with gold, uplifted like a\r\nBrahmana's curse. As a lion of mighty strength among a flock of deer,\r\nBhima will range among my troops. He only (amongst his brothers) always\r\ndisplayed his strength cruelly towards my sons. Eating voraciously, and\r\nendued with great impetuosity, from his very childhood he hath been\r\nbehaving inimically towards my children. My heart trembleth (to remember)\r\nthat even in their childhood, Duryodhana and other sons of mine, while\r\nfighting with him (sportively) were always ground down by the\r\nelephant-like Bhima. Alas, my sons have always been oppressed by his\r\nmight, and it is that Bhima of terrible prowess that hath been the cause\r\nof this rupture. Even now I behold Bhima, mad with rage, fighting in the\r\nvery van, and devouring the whole of my host consisting of men,\r\nelephants, and steeds. Equal unto Drona and Arjuna in weapons, his speed\r\nequal unto the velocity of the wind, and in wrath like unto Maheswara\r\nhimself, who is there, O Sanjaya, that would slay that wrathful and\r\nterrible hero in battle? I think it to be a great gain that my sons were\r\nnot even then slain by that slayer of enemies who is endued with such\r\nenergy. How can a human being withstand the impetuosity of that warrior\r\nin battle who slew Yakshas and Rakshasas of terrible might before? O\r\nSanjaya, even in his childhood he was never completely under my control.\r\nInjured by my wicked sons, how can that son of Pandu come under my\r\ncontrol now? Cruel and extremely wrathful, he would break but not bend.\r\nOf oblique glances and contracted eye-brows, how can he be induced to\r\nremain quiet? Endued with heroism, of incomparable might and fair\r\ncomplexion, tall like a palmyra tree, and in height taller than Arjuna by\r\nthe span of the thumb, the second son of Pandu surpasseth the very steeds\r\nin swiftness, and elephants in strength, speaketh in indistinct accents,\r\nand possesseth eyes having the hue of honey. As regards form and might,\r\neven such was he in his very boyhood, as I truly heard long before from\r\nthe lips of Vyasa! Terrible and possessed of cruel might, when angry he\r\nwill destroy in battle with his iron-mace cars and elephants and men and\r\nhorses. By acting against his wishes, that foremost of smiters who is\r\never wrathful and furious, hath before been, O child, insulted by me.\r\nAlas, how will my sons bear that mace of his which is straight, made of\r\nsteel, thick, of beautiful sides, adorned with gold, capable of slaying a\r\nhundred, and producing a terrible sound when hurled at the foe? Alas, O\r\nchild, my foolish sons are desirous of crossing that inaccessible ocean\r\nconstituted by Bhima, which is really shoreless, without a raft on it,\r\nimmeasurable in depth, and full of currents impetuous as the course of\r\narrows. Fools in reality though boasting of their wisdom, alas, my\r\nchildren do not listen to me even though I cry out. Beholding only the\r\nhoney they do not see the terrible fall that is before them. They that\r\nwill rush to battle with Death himself in that human shape, are certainly\r\ndoomed to destruction by the Supreme Ordainer, like animals within the\r\nlion's view. Full four cubits in length, endued with six sides and great\r\nmight, and having also a deadly touch, when he will hurl his mace from'\r\nthe sting, how shall my sons, O child, bear its impetus? Whirling his\r\nmace and breaking therewith the heads of (hostile) elephants, licking\r\nwith his tongue the corners of his mouth and drawing long breaths, when\r\nhe will rush with loud roars against mighty elephants, returning the\r\nyells of those infuriated beasts that might rush against him, and when\r\nentering the close array of cars he will slay, after taking proper aim,\r\nthe chief warriors before him, what mortal of my party will escape from\r\nhim looking like a blazing flame? Crushing my forces and cutting a\r\npassage through them, that mighty armed hero, dancing with mace in hand,\r\nwill exhibit the scene, witnessed during the universal Dissolution at the\r\nend of a Yuga. Like an infuriated elephant crushing trees adorned with\r\nflowers, Vrikodara, in battle will, furiously penetrate the ranks of my\r\nsons. Depriving my warriors of their cars, drivers, steeds, and\r\nflag-staff, and afflicting all warriors fighting from cars and the backs\r\nof elephants, that tiger among men will, O Sanjaya, like the impetuous\r\ncurrent of Ganga throwing down diverse trees standing on its banks, crush\r\nin battle the troops of my sons. Without doubt, O Sanjaya, afflicted by\r\nthe fear of Bhimasena, my sons and their dependents and all the allied\r\nkings will fly in different directions. It was this Bhima who, having\r\nentered of old, with Vasudeva's aid, the innermost apartments of\r\nJarasandha, overthrew that king endued with great energy; that lord of\r\nMagadha, the mighty Jarasandha, having fully brought under his subjection\r\nthe goddess Earth, oppressed her by his energy. That the Kauravas in\r\nconsequence of Bhishma's prowess, and the Andhakas and the Vrishnis in\r\nconsequence of their policy, could not be subjugated by him was due only\r\nto their good fortune. What could be more wonderful than that the heroic\r\nson of Pandu, of mighty arms and without any weapons, having approached\r\nthat king, slew him in a trice? Like a venomous snake, whose poison hath\r\naccumulated for years, Bhima will, O Sanjaya, vomit in battle the poison\r\nof his wrath upon my sons! Like the foremost of the celestials, the great\r\nIndra, smiting the Danavas with his thunderbolt, Bhimasena will, mace in\r\nhand, slay all my sons! Incapable of being withstood or resisted, of\r\nfierce impetus and powers, and with eyes of a coppery hue, I behold even\r\nnow that Vrikodara failing upon my sons. Without mace or bow, without car\r\nor coat of mail, fighting with his bare arms only, what man is there that\r\ncan stand before him? Bhishma, that regenerate Drona, and Kripa the son\r\nof Saradwat,--these are as much acquainted as I myself with the energy of\r\nthe intelligent Bhima. Acquainted with the practice of those that are\r\nnoble, and desirous of death in battle, these bulls among men will take\r\ntheir stand in the van of our army. Destiny is everywhere powerful,\r\nespecially in the case of a male person, for beholding the victory of the\r\nPandavas in battle, I do not yet restrain my sons. These mighty bowmen of\r\nmine, desirous of treading in that ancient track leading up to heaven,\r\nwill lay down their lives in battle, taking care, however, of earthly\r\nfame. O child, my sons are the same to these mighty bowmen as the\r\nPandavas are to them, for all of them are grandsons of Bhishma and\r\ndisciples of Drona and Kripa. O Sanjaya, the little acceptable services\r\nthat we have been able to do unto these three venerable ones, will\r\ncertainly be repaid by them owing to their own noble dispositions. It is\r\nsaid that death in battle of a Kshatriya, who hath taken up arms and\r\ndesireth to observe Kshatriya practices is, indeed, both good and\r\nmeritorious. I weep, however, for all those that will fight against the\r\nPandavas. That very danger hath now come which was foreseen by Vidura at\r\nthe outset. It seems, O Sanjaya, that wisdom is incapable of dispelling\r\nwoe; on the other hand, it is overwhelming woe that dispelleth wisdom.\r\nWhen the very sages, that are emancipated from all worldly concerns and\r\nthat behold, standing aloof, all the affairs of the universe, are\r\naffected by prosperity and adversity, what wonder is there that I should\r\ngrieve, I who have my affections fixed on a thousand things such as sons,\r\nkingdom, wives, grandsons, and relatives? What good can possibly be in\r\nstore for me on the accession of such a frightful danger? Reflecting on\r\nevery circumstance, I see the certain destruction of the Kurus. That\r\nmatch at dice seems to be the cause of this great danger of the Kurus.\r\nAlas, this sin was committed from temptation by foolish Duryodhana,\r\ndesirous of wealth; I believe all this to be the untoward effect of\r\never-fleeting Time that bringeth on everything. Tied to the wheel of\r\nTime, like its periphery, I am not capable of flying away from it. Tell\r\nme, O Sanjaya, where shall I go? What shall I do, and, how shall I do it?\r\nThese foolish Kauravas will all be destroyed, their Time having come.\r\nHelplessly I shall have to hear the wailing of women when my hundred sons\r\nwill all be slain. Oh, how may death come upon me? As a blazing fire in\r\nthe summer season., when urged by the wind, consumeth dry grass, so will\r\nBhima, mace in hand, and united with Arjuna, slay all on my side!'\""

Reflecting from day to day I do not find the warrior\r\nwho may, on his car, advance in battle against the wielder of Gandiva.\r\nWhen that wielder of Gandiva will shoot winged arrows and Nalikas and\r\nshafts capable of piercing the breast of warriors, there is no rival of\r\nhis in battle. If those bulls among men, those heroes,--Drona and\r\nKarna,--those foremost of mighty men, versed in weapons and invincible in\r\nbattle, withstand him, the result may be very doubtful, but I am sure\r\nthat the victory will not be mine. Karna is both compassionate and\r\nheedless, and preceptor is aged and hath affection for this pupil.\r\nPartha, however, is able and mighty, of firm grasp (of the bow). Terrible\r\nwill be the encounter between them, without resulting in any one's\r\ndefeat. Conversant with weapons and endued with heroism, all of them have\r\nearned great fame. They may relinquish the very sovereignty of the gods,\r\nbut not the chance of winning victory. There would be peace, without\r\ndoubt, upon the fall of either of these two (Drona and Karna) or of\r\nFalguna, There is none, however, who can either slay or vanquish Arjuna.\r\nAlas, how may his wrath that hath been excited against my foolish sons be\r\npacified. Others there are acquainted with the use of weapons, that\r\nconqueror are conquered; but it is heard that Falguna always conquereth.\r\nThree and thirty years have passed away since the time, when Arjuna,\r\nhaving invited Agni, gratified him at Khandava, vanquishing all the\r\ncelestials. We have never heard of his defeat anywhere, O child. Like the\r\ncase of Indra, victory is always Arjuna's, who hath for his charioteer in\r\nbattle Hrishikesa, endued with the same character and position. We hear\r\nthat the two Krishnas on the same car and the stringed Gandiva,--these\r\nthree forces,--have been united together. As regards ourselves, we have\r\nnot a bow of that kind, or a warrior like Arjuna, or a charioteer like\r\nKrishna. The foolish followers of Duryodhana are not aware of this. O\r\nSanjaya, the blazing thunderbolt falling on the head leaveth something\r\nundestroyed, but the arrows, O child, shot by Kiritin leave nothing\r\nundestroyed. Even now I behold Dhanajaya shooting his arrows and\r\ncommitting a havoc around, picking off heads from bodies with his arrowy\r\nshowers! Even now I behold the arrowy conflagration, blazing all around,\r\nissuing from the Gandiva, consuming in battle the ranks of my sons. Even\r\nnow it seemeth to me that, struck with panic at the rattle of\r\nSavyasachin's car, my vast army consisting of diverse forces is running\r\naway in all directions. As a tremendous conflagration, wandering in all\r\ndirections, of swelling flames and urged by the wind, consumeth dry\r\nleaves and grass, so will the great fame of Arjuna's weapons consume all\r\nmy troops. Kiritin, appearing as a foe in battle, will vomit innumerable\r\narrows and become irresistible like all destroying Death urged forward by\r\nthe Supreme Ordainer.

Even\r\nthou, O son, hast told me of my mighty enemies, viz., the kings of the\r\nPanchalas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, and the Magadhas. He, again, who at\r\nhis will can bring under his subjection all the three worlds with Indra\r\nat their head, even that Creator of the universe, the mighty Krishna is\r\nbent on giving victory upon the Pandavas. As regards Satyaki, he acquired\r\nin no time the whole science of arms from Arjuna. That scion of Sini's\r\nrace will stand on the battle-field, shooting his shafts like husbandmen\r\nsowing seeds. The prince of Panchala, Dhristadyumna, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior of merciless deeds, acquainted with all superior weapons,\r\nwill fight with my host. Great is my fear, O child from the wrath of\r\nYudhishthira, from the prowess of Arjuna, and from the Twins and\r\nBhimasena. When those lords of men will, in the midst of my army, spread\r\ntheir superhuman net of arrows, I fear my troops will not come out of it.\r\nIt is for this, O Sanjaya, that I weep. That son of Pandu, Yudhishthira,\r\nis handsome, endued with great energy, highly blessed, possessed of\r\nBrahma force, intelligent, of great wisdom, and virtuous soul. Having\r\nallies and counsellors, united with persons ready for battle, and\r\npossessing brothers and father-in-law who are all heroes and mighty\r\ncar-warriors, that tiger among men, the son of Pandu, is also endued with\r\npatience, capable of keeping his counsels, compassionate, modest, of\r\npowers incapable of being baffled, possessed of great learning, with soul\r\nunder proper control, ever waiting upon the aged, and subdued senses;\r\npossessed thus of every accomplishment, he is like unto a blazing fire.\r\nWhat fool, doomed to destruction and deprived of sense, will jump,\r\nmoth-like, into that blazing and irresistible Pandava fire! Alas, I have\r\nbehaved deceitfully towards him. The king, like unto a fire of long\r\nflames, will destroy all my foolish sons in battle without leaving any\r\nalive. I, therefore, think that it is not proper to fight with them. Ye\r\nKauravas, be ye of the same mind. Without doubt, the whole race of Kuru\r\nwill be destroyed, in case of hostilities being waged. This appears to me\r\nvery clearly, and if we act accordingly, my mind may have peace. If war\r\nwith them doth not seem beneficial to you, then we will strive to bring\r\nabout peace. Yudhishthira will never be indifferent when he sees us\r\ndistressed, for he censures me only as the cause of this unjust war.'\""

This, however, I do not understand, how when thou art\r\nalways wise and especially acquainted with the prowess of Savyasachin,\r\nthou followest yet the counsels of thy sons. Having O bull of the Bharata\r\nrace, injured the sons of Pritha from the very beginning, having in fact,\r\ncommitted sins repeatedly, this is not, O great king, the time (to\r\ngrieve). He that occupies the position of a father and a friend, if he is\r\nalways watchful and of good heart, should seek the welfare (of his\r\nchildren); but he that injures, cannot be called a father. Hearing of the\r\ndefeat of the Pandavas at dice, thou hadst, O king, laughed like a child,\r\nsaying, 'This is won, this is acquired!' When the harshest speeches were\r\naddressed to the sons of Pritha, thou didst not then interfere, pleased\r\nat the prospect of thy sons winning the whole kingdom. Thou couldst not\r\nhowever, then see before thee inevitable fall. The country of the Kurus,\r\nincluding the region called Jangala is, O king, thy paternal kingdom.\r\nThou hast, however, obtained the whole earth by those heroes. Won by the\r\nstrength of their arms, the sons of Pritha made over thee this extensive\r\nempire. Thou thinkest, however, O best of kings, that all this was\r\nacquired by thee. When thy sons, seized by the king of the Gandharvas,\r\nwere about to sink in a shoreless sea without a raft to save them, it was\r\nPartha, O king, that brought them back. Thou hadst, like a child,\r\nrepeatedly laughed, O monarch, at the Pandavas when they were defeated at\r\ndice and were going into exile. When Arjuna poureth a shower of keen\r\narrows, the very oceans dry up, let alone beings of flesh and blood.\r\nFalguna is the foremost of all shooters; Gandiva is the foremost of all\r\nbows; Kesava is the foremost of all beings; the Sudarsana is the foremost\r\nof all weapons; and of cars, that furnished with the banner bearing the\r\nblazing Ape on it is the foremost. That car of his, bearing all these and\r\ndrawn by white steeds, will, O king, consume us all in battle like the\r\nupraised wheel of Time. O bull of the Bharata race, his is even now the\r\nwhole earth and he is the foremost of all kings, who hath Bhima and\r\nArjuna to fight for him. Beholding the host sinking in despair when\r\nsmitten by Bhima, the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana will all meet\r\ndestruction. Struck with the fear of Bhima and Arjuna, the sons, O king,\r\nand the kings following them, will not, O lord, be able to win victory.\r\nThe Matsyas, the Panchalas, the Salways and the Surasenas, all decline to\r\npay thee homage now and all disregard thee. Acquainted with the energy of\r\nthat wise king, all of them, however, have joined that son of Pritha, and\r\nfor their devotion to him they are always opposed to thy sons. He that,\r\nby his evil deeds, afflicted the sons of Pandu, who are all wedded to\r\nvirtue and undeserving of destruction, he that hateth them even\r\nnow,--that sinful man, O monarch, who is none else than thy son,--should,\r\nwith all his adherents, be checked by all means. It behoveth thee not to\r\nbewail in this strain. Even this was said by myself as well as by the\r\nwise Vidura at the time of the gambling match at dice. These thy\r\nlamentations in connection with the Pandavas, as if thou wert a helpless\r\nperson, are, O king, all useless.'\""

      "content": "\"Duryodhana said, 'Fear not, O king. Nor shouldest thou grieve for us. O\r\nmonarch, O lord, we are quite able to vanquish the foe in battle. When\r\nthe Parthas had been exiled to the woods, there came unto them the slayer\r\nof Madhu with a vast army in battle array and capable of crushing hostile\r\nkingdoms; and there also came unto them the Kekayas, and Dhrishtaketu,\r\nand Dhrishtadyumna of Pritha's race and numerous other kings in their\r\ntrain; and all those great car-warriors were assembled in a place not far\r\nfrom Indraprastha; and having assembled together they censured thee and\r\nall the Kurus. And O Bharata, all those warriors with Krishna at their\r\nhead paid their homage unto Yudhishthira clad in deerskin and seated in\r\ntheir midst. And all those kings then suggested to Yudhishthira that he\r\nshould take back the kingdom. And all of them desired to slay thee with\r\nall the followers. And hearing of all this, O bull of the Bharata race, I\r\naddressed Bhishma and Drona and Kripa, struck with fear, O king, at the\r\nprospect of the ruin that threatened our kindred. And I said unto them,\r\n'I think the Pandavas will not abide by the agreement made by them;\r\nVasudeva desireth our utter extinction. I think also that with the\r\nexception of Vidura all of you will be slain, although the chief of the\r\nKurus, Dhritarashtra, conversant with morality, will not be included in\r\nthe slaughter, O sire, effecting our complete destruction, Janardana\r\nwisheth to bestow upon Yudhishthira the entire kingdom of the Kurus. What\r\nshould be done? Shall we surrender, or fly, or shall we fight the foe\r\ngiving up every hope of life? If, indeed, we stand up against them, our\r\ndefeat is certain, for all the kings of the earth are under\r\nYudhishthira's command. The people of the realm are all annoyed with us,\r\nand all our friends also are angry with us. All the kings of the earth\r\nare speaking ill of us, and especially all our friends and relatives.\r\nThere can be no fault in our surrender, for from time immemorial, the\r\nweaker party is known to conclude peace. I grieve, however, for that lord\r\nof men, my, blind father, who may, on my account, be overtaken by woe and\r\nmisery that is endless. [It is known to thee, O king, even before this,\r\nthat thy other sons were all opposed to the foe for pleasing me only].\r\nThose mighty car-warriors, the sons of Pandu, will, indeed, avenge their\r\nwrongs by destroying the whole race of king Dhritarashtra with all his\r\ncounsellors.--(It was thus that I addressed them, and) seeing me\r\nafflicted by great anxiety and my senses tortured, Drona and Bhishma and\r\nKripa and Drona's son then addressed me, saying, 'Fear not, O represser\r\nof foes, for if the foe wage hostilities with us, they will not be able\r\nto vanquish us when we take the field. Every one of us is singly capable\r\nof vanquishing all the kings of the earth. Let them come. With keen-edged\r\narrows we will curb their pride. Inflamed with anger upon the death of\r\nhis father, this Bhishma (amongst us) in days of old had conquered all\r\nthe kings of the earth, on a single car. O Bharata, his wrath excited,\r\nthat best of the Kurus smote numberless ones amongst them, whereupon from\r\nfear, they are surrendered to this Devavrata seeking his protection. That\r\nBhishma, united with us, is still capable of vanquishing the foe in\r\nbattle. Let thy fears, therefore, O bull of the Bharata race, be all\r\ndispelled.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana continued, 'Even this was the resolve then formed by these\r\nheroes of immeasurable energy. The whole earth was formerly under the\r\nfoe's command. Now, however, they are incapable of vanquishing us in\r\nbattle, for our enemies, the sons of Pandu, are now without allies and\r\ndestitute of energy. O bull of the Bharata race, the sovereignty of the\r\nearth now resteth in me, and the kings also, assembled by me, are of the\r\nsame mind with me in weal or woe. Know thou, O best of the Kuru race,\r\nthat all these kings, O slayer of foes, can, for my sake, enter into the\r\nfire or the sea. They are all laughing at thee, beholding thee filled\r\nwith grief and including in these lamentations like one out of his wits,\r\nand affrighted at the praises of the foe. Every one amongst these kings\r\nis able to withstand the Pandavas. Indeed, sire, every one regardeth\r\nhimself; let thy fears, therefore, be dispelled. Even Vasava himself is\r\nnot capable of vanquishing my vast host. The Self-create Brahma himself,\r\nif desirous of slaying it, cannot annihilate it. Having given up all\r\nhopes of a city, Yudhishthira craveth only five villages, affrighted, O\r\nlord, at the army I have assembled and at my power. The belief thou\r\nentertainest in the prowess of Vrikodara, the son of Kunti, is unfounded.\r\nO Bharata, thou knowest not the extent of my prowess. There is none on\r\nearth equal to me in an encounter with the mace. None have ever surpassed\r\nme in such an encounter, nor will any surpass me. With devoted\r\napplication and undergoing many privations, I have lived in my\r\npreceptor's abode. I have completed my knowledge and exercises there. It\r\nis for this that I have no fear either of Bhima or of others. When I\r\nhumbly waited upon Sankarshana (my preceptor), blessed be thou, it was\r\nhis firm conviction that Duryodhana hath no equal in the mace. In battle\r\nI am Sankarshana's equal, and in might there is none superior to me on\r\nearth. Bhima will never be able to bear the blow of my mace in battle. A\r\nsingle blow, O king, that I may wrathfully deal unto Bhima will\r\ncertainly, O hero, carry him without delay to the abode of Yama. O king,\r\nI wish to see Vrikodara mace in hand. This hath been my long-cherished\r\ndesire. Struck in battle with my mace, Vrikodara, the son of Pritha, will\r\nfall dead on the ground, his limbs shattered. Smitten with a blow of my\r\nmace, the mountains of Himavat may split into a hundred thousands\r\nfragments. Vrikodra himself knoweth this truth, as also Vasudeva and\r\nArjuna, that there is no one equal to Duryodhana in the use of mace. Let\r\nthy fears, therefore, caused by Vrikodara. be dispelled, for I will\r\ncertainly slay him in fierce conflict. Do not, O king, give way to\r\nmelancholy. And after I have slain him, numerous car-warriors of equal or\r\nsuperior energy, will, O bull among the Bharatas, speedily throw Arjuna\r\ndown. Bhishma, Drona Kripa and Drona's son, Karna and, Bhurisravas,\r\nSalya, the king of Pragjyotish, and Jayadratha, the king of the\r\nSindhus,--every one of these, O Bharata, is singly capable of slaying the\r\nPandavas. When united together, they will, within a moment, send Arjuna\r\nto the abode of Yama. There, indeed, is no reason why the united army of\r\nall the kings will be incapable of vanquishing Dhananjaya singly. A\r\nhundred times shrouded by immeasurable arrows shot by Bhishma and Drona\r\nand Drona's son and Kripa, and deprived of strength, Partha will have to\r\ngo unto Yama's abode. Our grandsire born of Ganga is, O Bharata, superior\r\nto Santanu himself. Like unto a regenerate saint, and incapable of being\r\nwithstood by the very celestials, he took his birth amongst men. There is\r\nno slayer of Bhishma, O king, on earth, for his father, being gratified,\r\ngave him the boon,--Thou shalt not die except when it is thy own wish.\r\nAnd Drona took his birth in a water-pot from the regenerate saint\r\nBharadwaja. And from Drona hath taken birth his son, having a knowledge\r\nof the highest weapons. And this the foremost of preceptors. Kripa also,\r\nhath taken his birth from the great Rishi Gautama. Born in a clump of\r\nheath this illustrious one, I think, is incapable of being slain. Then\r\nagain, O king, the father, mother and maternal uncle of\r\nAswatthaman,--these three,--are not born of woman's womb. I have that\r\nhero also on my side. All these mighty car-warriors, O king, are like\r\nunto celestials, and can, O bull of the Bharata race, inflict pain on\r\nSakra himself in battle. Arjuna is incapable of even looking at any one\r\nof these singly. When united together, these tigers among men will\r\ncertainly slay Dhananjaya. Karna also, I suppose, is equal unto Bhishma\r\nand Drona and Kripa. O Bharata, Rama himself had told him,--Thou art\r\nequal unto me. Karna had two ear-rings born with him, of great brilliance\r\nand beauty; for Sachi's gratification Indra begged them of that repressor\r\nof foes, in exchange, O king, of an infallible and terrible shaft. How\r\nwould Dhananjaya, therefore, escape with life from Karna who is protected\r\nby that arrow? My success, therefore, O king, is as certain as a fruit\r\nheld fast in my own grasp. The utter defeat also of my foes is already\r\nbruited about on earth. This Bhishma, O Bharata, killeth every day ten\r\nthousand soldiers. Equal unto him are these bowmen, Drona, Drona's son\r\nand Kripa. Then, O repressor of foes, the ranks of the Samsaptaka\r\nwarriors have made this resolution,--Either we will slay Arjuna or that\r\nApe-bannered warrior will slay us. There are other kings also, who firm\r\nin their resolve of slaying Savyasachin, regard him as unequal to\r\nthemselves. Why dost thou then apprehend danger from the Pandavas? When\r\nBhimasena will be slain, O Bharata, who else (amongst them) will fight?\r\nTell me this, O repressor of foes, if thou knowest any amongst the foes.\r\nThe five brothers, with Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki,--these seven warriors\r\nof the enemy, O king, are regarded as their chief strength. Those,\r\nhowever, amongst us, that are our chief warriors, are Bhishma, Drona,\r\nKripa, Drona's son, Karna, Somadatta, Vahlika, and Salya, the king of\r\nPragjyotisha, the two kings (Vindha and Anuvinda) of Avanti, and\r\nJayadratha; and then, O king, thy sons Dussasana, Durmukha, Dussaha,\r\nSrutayu; Chitrasena, Purumitra, Vivingsati, Sala, Bhurisravas, and\r\nVikarna. O king, I have assembled one and ten Akshauhinis. The army of\r\nthe enemy is less than mine, amounting only to seven Akshauhinis. How\r\nthen can I be defeated? Vrihaspati hath said that an army which is less\r\nby a third ought to be encountered. My army, O king, exceedeth that of\r\nthe foe by a third. Besides, O Bharata, I know that the enemy hath many\r\ndefects, while mine, O lord, are endued with many good virtues. Knowing\r\nall this, O Bharata, as also the superiority of my force and the\r\ninferiority of the Pandavas, it behoveth thee not to lose thy senses.\r\n\r\n'Having said this, O Bharata, that conqueror of hostile chiefs,\r\nDuryodhana, asked Sanjaya again, anxious to known more about the doings\r\nof the Pandavas.'\""

And displaying divine illusion they placed\r\non his flagstaff those celestial forms, large and small, of great value.\r\nAnd at Bhimasena's request, Hanumat, the son of the Wind-god, will also\r\nplace his own image on it. And Bhaumana has, in its creation, had\r\nrecourse to such illusion that that banner covers, both perpendicularly\r\nand laterally, an area of one yojana, and even if trees stand in its way,\r\nits course cannot be impeded. Indeed, even as Sakra's bow of diverse\r\ncolours is exhibited in the firmament, and nobody knows of what it is\r\nmade, so hath that banner been contrived by Bhaumana, for its form is\r\nvaried and ever varying. And as column of smoke mixed with fire riseth\r\nup, covering the sky and displaying many bright hues and elegant shapes,\r\nso doth that banner contrived by Bhaumana rear its head. Indeed, it hath\r\nno weight, nor is it capable of being obstructed. And unto that car are a\r\ncentury of excellent celestial steeds of white hue and endued with the\r\nspeed of the mind, all presented by Chitrasena (the king of the\r\nGandharvas). And neither on earth, O king, nor in the sky, nor in heaven,\r\ntheir course can be impeded. And formerly a boon hath been granted to the\r\neffect that their number would always remain full how often so ever they\r\nmight be slain. And unto Yudhishthira's car are yoked large steeds of\r\nequal energy and white in colour like ivory. And unto Bhimasena's car are\r\nyoked courses endued with the speed of the wind and the splendour of the\r\nseven Rishis. And steeds of sable bodies and backs variegated like the\r\nwings of the Tittri bird, all presented by his gratified brother Falguna,\r\nand superior to those of the heroic Falguna himself, cheerfully carry\r\nSahadeva. And Nakula of Ajamida's race, the son of Madri, is borne, like\r\nIndra the slayer of Vritra, by excellent steeds, presented by the great\r\nIndra himself, all mighty as the wind and endued with great speed. And\r\nexcellent steed of large size, equal unto those of the Pandavas\r\nthemselves in years and strength, endued with great swiftness and of\r\nhandsome make, and all presented by the celestials, carry those youthful\r\nprinces, the sons of Subhadra and Draupadi.'\""

And those two mighty car-warriors, proud of their strength and\r\nfamed over all the world, have joined the Pandavas, each with a separate\r\nAkshauhini of troops.

O king, Bhishma,\r\nthe son of Santanu, has been assigned to Sikhandin as his share; and\r\nVirata with all his Matsya warriors will support Sikhandin. The mighty\r\nking of the Madras hath been assigned to the eldest son of Pandu as his\r\nshare, though some are of opinion that those two are not well-matched.\r\nDuryodhana with his sons and his ninety-nine brothers, as also the rulers\r\nof the east and the south, have been assigned to Bhimasena as his share.\r\nKarna, the son of Vikartana, and Jayadratha the king of the Sindhus, have\r\nbeen assigned to Arjuna as his share. And those heroes also on the earth\r\nwho are incapable of being withstood and who are proud of their might,\r\nhave been accepted by Arjuna as his share. And those mighty bowmen, the\r\nfive royal brothers of Kekaya, will put forth their strength in battle,\r\naccepting the Kekaya warriors (on Dhritarashtra's side) as antagonists.\r\nAnd in their share are included the Malavas also, and the Salwakas, as\r\nalso, the two famous warriors of the Trigarta host who have sworn to\r\nconquer or die.

As for all the other kings of the\r\nearth, O Monarch, who will go to battle, the sons of Pandu have, by\r\nnaming them, distributed them in their own respective shares.

Ali these noble and heroic kings of the\r\nearth, bearing weapons, O father, are quite capable, for my sake, of\r\nwithstanding the Pandavas, while the latter are not capable of even\r\ngazing at my troops. I am powerful enough to encounter in battle the\r\nPandavas with their sons. O Bharata, all those rulers of the earth, who\r\nare anxious for my welfare, will certainly seize all the Pandavas like a\r\nherd of young deer by means of net. I tell thee, in consequence of our\r\ncrowds of cars and snares of arrows, the Panchalas and the Pandavas will\r\nall be routed.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Sanjaya, this my son speaketh like a mad man, for\r\nhe is incapable of vanquishing in battle Yudhishthira the just. This\r\nBhishma truly knoweth the might of the famous, powerful, virtuous, and\r\nhigh-souled Pandavas and their sons, for he doth not wish a battle with\r\nthose illustrious ones. But tell me again O Sanjaya, of their movements.\r\nTell me, who are inciting those illustrious and mighty bowmen endued with\r\ngreat activity, like priests enkindling (Homa) fires with libations of\r\nclarified butter?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'O Bharata, Dhrishtadyumna is always urging the Pandavas\r\nto war, saying, 'Fight ye, best among the Bharatas. Do not entertain the\r\nleast fear. All those rulers of the earth, who, courted by\r\nDhritarashtra's son, will become in that fierce encounter target of\r\nshowers of weapons,--indeed, I alone will encounter all those angry kings\r\nassembled together with their relatives, like a whale seizing little\r\nfishes from the water. Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Karna and Drona's\r\nson and Salya and Suyodhana,--them all I withstand, like the bank\r\nresisting the swelling sea.' Unto him saying thus, the virtuous king\r\nYudhishthira said, 'The Panchalas and the Pandavas wholly depend upon thy\r\nprowess and steadiness. Rescue us safely from the war. I know, O\r\nmighty-armed one, that thou art firm in the duties of the Kshatriya\r\norder. Thou art, indeed, quite competent to smite alone the Kauravas.\r\nWhen the latter, eager for fight, will stand before us, what thou, O\r\nrepressor of foes, wilt arrange, will certainly be for our good. Even\r\nthis is the opinion of those acquainted with the scriptures, that the\r\nhero, who, displaying his prowess, relieth those that after the rout run\r\naway from the battle-field, seeking for protection, is to be bought with\r\na thousand. Thou, O bull among men, art brave, mighty, and powerful.\r\nWithout doubt, thou art that deliverer of those that are over-powered\r\nwith fear on the field of battle.' And when the righteous Yudhishthira\r\nthe son of Kunti said this, Dhrishtadyumna fearlessly addressed me in\r\nthese words, 'Go thou, O Suta, without delay, and say unto all those that\r\nhave come to fight for Duryodhana, say unto the Kurus of the Pratipa\r\ndynasty with the Vahlikas, the son of Saradwata and Karna and Drona, and\r\nDrona's son, and Jayadratha, and Dussasana, and Vikarna and king\r\nDuryodhana, and Bhishma,--Do not suffer yourselves to be slain by Arjuna,\r\nwho is protected by the celestials. Before that happens, let some good\r\nman approach Yudhishthira and entreat that son of Pandu, that best of\r\nmen, to accept the kingdom (surrendered by them) without delay. There is\r\nno warrior on the earth like unto Savyasachin, son of Pandu, of prowess\r\nincapable of being baffled. The celestial car of the holder of Gandiva is\r\nprotected by the very gods. He is incapable of being vanquished by human\r\nbeings. Do not, therefore, bend your mind to war!'\""

Alas, with him these foolish sons of mine desire to fight,\r\ndisregarding me that am thus bewailing. I ask thee, O Duryodhana, O\r\nforemost of the Bharata race, desist from hostility. O chastiser of foes,\r\nunder any circumstances, war is never applauded. Half the earth is quite\r\nenough for the maintenance of thyself and all thy followers. Give back\r\nunto the sons of Pandu, O chastiser of foes, their proper share. All the\r\nKauravas deem just this to be consistent with justice, that thou shouldst\r\nmake peace with the high-souled sons of Pandu. Reflect thus, O son, and\r\nthou wilt find that this thy army is for thy own death. Thou\r\nunderstandest not this from thy own folly. I myself do not desire war,\r\nnor Vahlika, nor Bhishma, nor Drona, nor Aswatthaman, nor Sanjaya, nor\r\nSomadatta, nor Salya, nor Kripa, nor Satyavrata, nor Purumitra, nor\r\nBhurisravas,--in fact, none of these desireth war. Indeed, those warriors\r\nupon whom the Kauravas, when afflicted by the foe, will have to rely, do\r\nnot approve of the war. O child, let that be acceptable to thee. Alas,\r\nthou dost not seek it of thy own will, but it is Karna and the\r\nevil-minded Dussasana and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, that are leading\r\nthee to it.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'I challenge the Pandavas to battle, without depending\r\nupon thyself, Drona, or Aswatthaman, or Sanjaya, or Vikarna, or Kamvoja,\r\nor Kripa, or Vahlika, or Satyavrata, or Purumitra, or Bhurisravas, or\r\nothers of thy party. But, O bull among men, only myself and Karna, O\r\nsire, are prepared to celebrate the sacrifice of battle with all the\r\nnecessary rites, making Yudhishthira the victim. In that sacrifice, my\r\ncar will be the altar; my sword will be the smaller ladle, my mace, the\r\nlarge one, for pouring libations; my coat of mail will be assembly of\r\nspectators; my four steeds will be the officiating priests; my arrows\r\nwill be the blades of Kusa grass; and fame will be the clarified butter.\r\nO king, performing, in honour of Yama, such a sacrifice in battle, the\r\ningredients of which will all be furnished by ourselves, we will return\r\nvictoriously covered with glory, after having slain our foes. Three of\r\nus, O sire, viz., myself and Karna and my brother Dussasana,--will slay\r\nthe Pandavas in battle. Either I, slaying the Pandavas, will sway this\r\nEarth, or the sons of Pandu, having slain me, will enjoy this Earth. O\r\nking, O thou of unfading glory, I would sacrifice my life, kingdom,\r\nwealth, everything, but would not be able to live side by side with the\r\nPandavas. O venerable one, I will not surrender to the Pandavas even that\r\nmuch of land which may be covered by the sharp point of a needle.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I now abandon Duryodhana for ever. 'A nevertheless\r\ngrieve for you all, ye kings, that will follow this fool who is about to\r\nproceed to Yama's abode. Like tigers among a herd of deer, those foremost\r\nof smiters-the sons of Pandu,--will smite down your principal leaders\r\nassembled for battle. Methinks, the Bharata host, like a helpless woman,\r\nwill be afflicted and crushed and hurled to a distance by Yuyudhana of\r\nlong arms. Adding to the strength of Yudhishthira's army, which without\r\nhim was already sufficient, Sini's son will take up his stand on the\r\nfield of battle and scatter his arrows like seeds on a cultivated field.\r\nAnd Bhimasena will take up his position in the very van of the\r\ncombatants, and all his soldiers will fearlessly stand in his rear, as\r\nbehind a rampart. Indeed, when thou, O Duryodhana, wilt behold elephants,\r\nhuge as hills, prostrated on the ground with their tusks disabled, their\r\ntemples crushed and bodies dyed with gore,--in fact, when thou wilt see\r\nthem lying on the field of battle like riven hills, then, afraid of a\r\nclash with him, thou wilt remember these my words. Beholding thy host\r\nconsisting of cars, steeds, and elephants, consumed by Bhimasena, and\r\npresenting the spectacle of a wide-spread conflagration's track, thou\r\nwilt remember these my words. If ye do not make peace with the Pandavas,\r\noverwhelming calamity will be yours. Slain by Bhimasena with his mace, ye\r\nwill rest in peace.

I am anxious to hear from thee all about\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, as I tell thee the state in which I found\r\nKrishna and Dhananjaya. I will also, O Bharata, tell thee what those\r\nheroes said; O king, with looks bent down and hands joined together, and\r\nwith senses well restrained, I entered the inner apartments for\r\nconferring with those gods among men. Neither Abhimanyu nor the Twins can\r\nrepair to that place where are the two Krishnas and Draupadi and lady\r\nSatyabhama. There I beheld those chastisers of foes, exhilarated with\r\nBassia wine, their bodies adorned with garlands of flowers. Attired in\r\nexcellent robes and adorned with celestial ornaments, they sat on a\r\ngolden dais, decked with numerous gems, and covered over with carpets of\r\ndiverse texture and hue. And I beheld Kesava's feet resting upon Arjuna's\r\nlap while those of the high-souled Arjuna rested upon the laps of Krishna\r\nand Satyabhama. Partha then pointed out to me (for a seat) a foot-stool\r\nmade of gold. Touching it with my hand, I seated myself down on the\r\nground. And when he withdraw his feet from the foot-stool, I beheld\r\nauspicious marks on both his soles. Those consisted of two longitudinal\r\nlines running from heels to fore-toe, O sire, endued with black\r\ncomplexions, of high statures, and erect like Sala trunks, beholding\r\nthose youthful heroes, both seated on the same seat, a great fear seized\r\nme. They seemed to me to be Indra and Vishnu seated together, though\r\nDuryodhana of dull sense knoweth it no consequence of his reliance on\r\nDrona and Bhishma and on the loud vaunts of Karna. That very moment, I\r\nwas convinced that the wishes of Yudhishthira the just, who had those two\r\nfor obeying his orders, were certain to succeed. Being hospitably\r\nentertained with food and drink, and honoured with other courtesies, I\r\nconveyed to them thy message, placing my joined hands on my head. Then\r\nPartha, removing Kesava's auspicious foot from his lap, with his hand\r\nscarred by the flappings of the bow-string, urged him to speak. Sitting\r\nup erect like Indra's banner, adorned with every ornament, and resembling\r\nIndra himself in energy, Krishna then addressed me. And the words which\r\nthat best of speakers said were sweet, charming and mild, though awful\r\nand alarming to the son of Dhritarashtra. Indeed, the words uttered by\r\nKrishna, who alone is fit to speak, were of correct emphasis and accent,\r\nand pregnant with meaning, though heart-rending in the end. And Vasudeva\r\nsaid, 'O Sanjaya, say thou these words unto the wise Dhritarashtra and in\r\nthe hearing of that foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma, and also of Drona,\r\nhaving first saluted at our request, O Suta, all the aged ones and hawing\r\nenquired after the welfare of the younger ones, 'Do ye celebrate diverse\r\nsacrifices, making presents unto the Brahmanas, and rejoice with your\r\nsons and wives, for a great danger threatens ye? Do ye give away wealth\r\nunto deserving persons, beget desirable sons, and do agreeable offices to\r\nthose that are dear to thee, for king Yudhishthira is eager for victory?'\r\nWhile I was at a distance, Krishna with tears addressing me said, 'That\r\ndebt, accumulating with time, hath not yet been paid off by me. Ye have\r\nprovoked hostilities with that Savyasachin, who hath for his bow the\r\ninvincible Gandiva, of fiery energy, and who hath me for his helpmate.\r\nWho, even if he were Purandara himself, would challenge Partha having me\r\nfor his help-mate, unless, of course, his span of life were full? He that\r\nis capable of vanquishing Arjuna in battle is, indeed, able to uphold the\r\nEarth with his two arms, to consume all created things in anger and hurl\r\nthe celestials from Heaven. Among the celestials, Asuras, and men, among\r\nYakshas, Gandharvas, and Nagas, I do not find the person that can\r\nencounter Arjuna in battle. That wonderful story which is heard of an\r\nencounter in the city of Virata between a single person on one side and\r\ninnumerable warriors on the other, is sufficient proof of this. That ye\r\nall fled in all directions being routed in the city of Virata by that son\r\nof Pandu singly, is sufficient proof of this. Might, prowess, energy,\r\nspeed, lightness of hand, indefatiguableness, and patience are not to be\r\nfound in any one else save Partha.' Thus spoke Hrishikesa cheering up\r\nPartha by his words and roaring like rain-charged clouds in the\r\nfirmament. Having heard these words of Kesava, the diadem-decked Arjuna,\r\nof white steeds, also spoke to the same effect.'\""

Let this thy fear, O best of\r\nkings, be dispelled. The gods attained to their divinity for absence of\r\ndesire, covetousness, and of enmity, as also for their indifference to\r\nall worldly affairs. Formerly, Dwaipayana-Vyasa and Narada of great\r\nascetic austerities, and Rama, the son of Jamadagni, told us this. The\r\ngods never like human beings engage in work, O bull of the Bharata race,\r\nfrom desire, or wrath, or covetousness, or envy. Indeed, if Agni, or\r\nVayu, or Dharma, or Indra, or the Aswins had ever engaged themselves in\r\nworks from worldly desire, then the sons of Pritha could never have\r\nfallen into distress. Do not, therefore, by any means, indulge in such\r\nanxiety, because the gods, O Bharata, always set their eyes on affairs\r\nworthy of themselves. If, however, envy or lust become noticeable in the\r\ngods in consequence of their yielding to desire, then, according to what\r\nhas been ordained by the gods themselves, such envy or Just can never\r\nprevail. Charmed by me, Agni will be instantly extinguished, even if he\r\nblazes up all around for consuming all creatures. The energy with which\r\nthe gods are endued is, indeed, great, but know, O Bharata, that mine is\r\ngreater than that of the gods. If the Earth herself cleaves in twain, or\r\nmountain crests split, I can re-unite them, O king, by my incantations\r\nbefore the eyes of all. If for the destruction of this universe of\r\nanimate and inanimate, mobile and immobile creatures, there happeneth a\r\nterrific tempest or stony shower of loud roar, I can always, from\r\ncompassion for created beings, stop it before the eyes of all. When the\r\nwaters are solidified by me, even cars and infantry can move over them.\r\nIt is I who set agoing all the affairs of both gods and Asuras. Unto\r\nwhatever countries I go with my Akshauhinis on any mission, my steeds\r\nmove whithersoever I desire. Within my dominions there are no fearful\r\nsnakes, and protected by my incantations, creatures within my territories\r\nare never injured by others that are frightful. The very clouds, O king,\r\npour, as regards those dwelling in my dominions, showers as much as they\r\ndesire and when they desire. All my subjects, again, are devoted to\r\nreligion and are never subject to calamities of season. The Aswins, Vayu,\r\nAgni, Indra with the Maruts, and Dharma will not venture to protect my\r\nfoes. If these had been able to protect by their might my adversaries,\r\nnever would the sons of Pritha have fallen into such distress for three\r\nand ten years. I tell thee truly that neither gods, nor Gandharvas nor\r\nAsuras nor Rakshasas are capable of saving him who hath incurred my\r\ndispleasure; I have never before been baffled as regards the reward to\r\npunishment that I intended to bestow or inflict on friend or foe. If\r\never, O repressor of foes, I said this is to be,--that hath always been.\r\nPeople, therefore, have always known me as a speaker of truth. All\r\npersons can bear witness to my greatness, the fame of which hath spread\r\nall around. I mention this, O king, for thy information and not from\r\npride. Never had I, O king, praised myself before, for to praise one's\r\nown self is mean. Thou wilt hear of defeat of the Pandavas and the\r\nMatsyas, the Panchalas and the Kekayas, of Satyaki and Vasudeva, at my\r\nhands. Indeed, as rivers, on entering the ocean, are entirely lost in it,\r\nso the Pandavas with all their followers, on approaching me, will all be\r\nannihilated. My intelligence is superior, my energy is superior, my\r\nprowess is superior, my knowledge is superior, my resources are superior\r\nby far to those of the Pandavas. Whatever knowledge of weapons is in the\r\nGrandsire, in Drona, and Kripa, and Salya, and Shalya, exist in me as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n'Having said these words, O Bharata, Duryodhana, that repressor of foes,\r\nagain asked Sanjaya, in order to ascertain the proceedings of\r\nYudhishthira bent upon war.'\""

I regard those attributes as its indications which\r\nwoe their origin to self-restraint, Those indications are forgiveness,\r\nfirmness of mind, abstention from injury, an equal regard for all things,\r\ntruthfulness of speech, simplicity, control over the senses, patience,\r\ngentleness of speech, modesty, steadiness, liberality, mildness,\r\ncontentment, and faith, he that hath self-restraint casteth off Just,\r\navarice, pride, wrath, sleep, boastfulness, self-esteem, malice, and\r\nsorrow. Purity and absence of crookedness and fraud, are the distinctive\r\nmarks of a man of self-restraint. He that is not covetous, that is\r\nsatisfied with a little, that regardeth not objects provoking lust, and\r\nthat is as grave as the ocean, is known as a man of self-restraint. He\r\nthat is well-behaved, of good disposition and contented soul, that\r\nknoweth his own self is possessed of wisdom, winneth great regard here\r\nand attaineth to a blissful state hereafter. Possessed of mature wisdom,\r\nhe that hath no fear of other creatures and whom other creatures fear\r\nnot, is said to be the foremost of men. Seeking the good of all, he is a\r\nuniversal friend, and no one is made unhappy by him. Endued with gravity,\r\nlike that of the ocean and enjoying contentment in consequence of his\r\nwisdom, such a man is always calm and cheerful. Regulating their conduct\r\naccording to the acts practised by the righteous olden times and before\r\ntheir eyes, they that are self-restrained, being devoted to peace,\r\nrejoice in this world. Or, abandoning Action, because contented in\r\nconsequence of Knowledge, such a person, with his senses under control\r\nmoveth quickly in this world, waiting for the inevitable hour and\r\nabsorption into Brahma. And as the track of feathery creatures in the sky\r\nis incapable of being perceived, so the path of the sage enjoying\r\ncontentment in consequence of Knowledge is not visible. Abandoning, the\r\nworld he that betaketh himself, in pursuit of emancipation, to the\r\nSannyasa mode of life, hath bright and eternal regions assigned to him in\r\nheaven.'\""

And in that net were ensnared at the same time two birds that lived\r\ntogether. And taking the net up, the two winged creatures soared together\r\ninto the air. And seeing them soar into the sky, the fowler, without\r\ngiving way to despair, began to follow them in the direction they flew,\r\nJust then, an ascetic living in a hermitage (close by), who had finished\r\nhis morning prayers, saw the fowler running in that manner hoping still\r\nto secure the feathery creatures. And seeing that tenant of the earth\r\nquickly pursuing those tenants of the air, the ascetic, O Kaurava,\r\naddressed him in this Sloka,--O fowler, it appears very strange and\r\nwonderful to me that thou, that art a treader of the earth, pursuest yet\r\na couple of creatures that are tenants of the air. The fowler said,\r\n'These two, united together, are taking away my snare. There, however,\r\nwhere they will quarrel they will come under my control.'\r\n\r\n\"Vidura continued, 'The two birds, doomed to death, soon after\r\nquarrelled. And when the foolish pair quarrelled, they both fell on the\r\nearth. And when, ensnared in the meshes of death, they began to contend\r\nangrily against each other, the fowler approached unperceived and sized\r\nthem both. Even thus those kinsmen who fall out with one another for the\r\nsake of wealth fall into the hands of the enemy like the birds I have\r\ncited, in consequence of their quarrel. Eating together, talking\r\ntogether,--these are the duties of kinsmen, and not contention under any\r\ncircumstances. Those kinsmen, that with loving hearts wait on the old,\r\nbecome unconquerable like a forest guarded by lions. While those, O bull\r\nof the Bharata race, that having won enormous riches nevertheless, behave\r\nlike mean-minded men, always contribute to the prosperity of their foes.\r\nKinsmen, O Dhritarashtra, O bull of the Bharata race, are like charred\r\nbrands, which blaze up when united but only smoke when disunited. I will\r\nnow tell thee something else that I saw on a mountain-breast. Having\r\nlistened to that also, do, O Kaurava, what is for thy best. Once on a\r\ntime we repaired to the northern mountain, accompanied by some hunters\r\nand a number of Brahmanas, fond of discoursing on charms and medicinal\r\nplants. That northern mountain, Gandhamadana, looked like a grove. As its\r\nbreast was overgrown on all sides with trees and diverse kinds of\r\nluminous medicinal herbs, it was inhabited by Siddhas and Gandharvas. And\r\nthere we all saw a quantity of honey, of a bright yellow colour and of\r\nthe measure of a jar, placed on an inaccessible precipice of the\r\nmountain. That honey, which was Kuvera's favourite drink, was guarded by\r\nsnakes of virulent poison. And it was such that a mortal, drinking of it\r\nwould win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight, and an old man would\r\nbecome a youth. It was that those Brahmanas conversant with sorcery spoke\r\nabout that honey. And the hunters' seeing that honey, desired, O king, to\r\nobtain it. And they all perished in that inaccessible mountain-cave\r\nabounding with snakes. In the same way, this thy son desireth to enjoy\r\nthe whole earth without a rival. He beholdeth the honey, but seeth not,\r\nfrom folly, the terrible fall. It is true, Duryodhana desireth an\r\nencounter in battle with Savyasachin, but I do not see that energy or\r\nprowess in him which may carry him safe through it. On a single car\r\nArjuna conquered the whole earth. At the head of their hosts Bhishma and\r\nDrona and others were frightened by Arjuna and utterly routed at the city\r\nof Virata. Remember what took place on that occasion. He forgiveth still,\r\nlooking up to thy face and waiting to know what thou wouldst do. Drupada,\r\nand the king of Matsyas, and Dhananjaya, when angry, will, like flames of\r\nfire urged by the wind, leave no remnant (of thy army). O Dhritarashtra,\r\ntake king Yudhishthira on thy lap since both parties can, under no\r\ncircumstances, have victory when thy will be engaged in battle.'\""

Tell me what thou\r\ndesirest to say, for I will, O Bharata, accomplish whatever thou wilt\r\ntell me.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast heard what the intention is of\r\nDhritarashtra and his own. All that Sanjaya, O Krishna, said unto me hath\r\ncertainly the assent of Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's soul,\r\nand spoke out his mind. An envoy speaketh according to his instructions,\r\nfor if he speaketh otherwise he deserveth to be slain. Without looking\r\nequally on all that are his, moved by avarice and a sinful heart,\r\nDhritarashtra seeketh to make peace with us without giving us back our\r\nkingdom. Indeed, at Dhritarashtra's command we spent twelve years in the\r\nwoods and one additional year in concealment, well-believing, O lord,\r\nthat Dhritarashtra would abide firmly by that pledge of ours. That we did\r\nnot deviate from our promise is well-known to the Brahmanas who were with\r\nus. The covetous king Dhritarashtra, is now unwilling to observe\r\nKshatriya virtues. Owing to affection for his son, he is listening to the\r\ncounsels of wicked men. Abiding by counsels of Suyodhana, the king, O\r\nJanardana, actuated by avarice and seeking his own good, behaveth\r\nuntruthfully towards us. What can be more sorrowful, O Janardana, than\r\nthis, that I am unable to maintain my mother and my friends? Having the\r\nKasis, the Panchalas, the Chedis, and the Matsyas, for my allies and with\r\nthee, O slayer of Madhu, for my protector, I prayed for only five\r\nvillages, etc., Avishthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, with any\r\nother, O Govinda, as the fifth;--Grant us, we said, five villages or\r\ntowns, O sire, where we five may dwell in union, for we do not desire the\r\ndestruction of the Bharatas.--The wicked-minded son of Dhritarashtra,\r\nhowever, regarding the lordship of the world to be; in him, doth not\r\nagree to even that. What can be more sorrowful than this? When a man born\r\nand brought up in a respectable family, covereth the possessions of\r\nothers, that avarice of his destroyeth his intelligence; and intelligence\r\nbeing destroyed, shame is lost; and loss of shame leadeth to diminution\r\nof virtue; and loss of virtue bringeth on loss of prosperity, Destruction\r\nof prosperity, in its turn, ruineth a person, for poverty is a person's\r\ndeath. Kinsmen and friends and Brahmanas shun a poor man as birds avoid,\r\nO Krishna, a tree that beareth neither Rower nor fruits. Even this, O\r\nsire, is death to me that kinsmen shun me, as if I were a fallen one like\r\nthe breath of life quitting 'a dead body. Samvara said that no condition\r\nof life could be more distressful than that in which one is always racked\r\nby the anxiety caused by the thought--I have no meat for today, what will\r\nbecome of me tomorrow?--It is said that wealth is the highest virtue, and\r\neverything depends on wealth. They that have wealth are said to live,\r\nwhereas those that are without wealth are more dead than alive. They that\r\nby violence rob a man of his wealth not only kill the robbed but destroy\r\nalso his virtue, profit and pleasure. Some men when overtaken by poverty\r\nchoose death; others remove from cities to hamlets others retire into the\r\nwood; while others, again, become religious mendicants to destroy their\r\nlives. Some for the sake of wealth are driven to madness; others for\r\nwealth, live under Subjection to their foes; while many others, again,\r\nfor the sake of wealth, betake themselves to the servitude of others. A\r\nman's poverty is even more distressful to him than death, for wealth is\r\nthe sole cause or virtue and pleasure. The natural death of a person is\r\nnot much regarded, for that is the eternal path of all creatures. Indeed,\r\nnone among created beings can transgress it. O Krishna, a man who is poor\r\nfrom birth is not so much distressed as one, who, having once possessed\r\ngreat prosperity and having been brought up in luxury, is deprived of\r\nthat prosperity. Having through his own fault fallen into distress, such\r\na person blameth the very gods with Indra and his own self. Indeed,\r\nknowledge of even the entire scriptures faileth to mitigate his pains.\r\nSometimes he getteth angry with his servants, and sometimes he cherisheth\r\nmalice towards even his well-wishers. Subject to constant anger, he\r\nloseth his very senses, and his senses being clouded, be practiseth evil\r\ndeeds. Through sinfulness such a person contributeth to a fusion of\r\ncastes. A fusion of castes leadeth to hell and is the foremost of all\r\nsinful acts. If he is not awakened in time, he goeth, certainly, O\r\nKrishna, to hell., and, indeed, wisdom is the only thing that can awaken\r\nhim, for if he obtaineth back the eye of wisdom, he is saved. When wisdom\r\nis regained, such a man turneth his attention to scriptures; and\r\nattention to scriptures aideth his virtue. Then shame becometh his best\r\nornament. He that hath shame hath an aversion against sin, and his\r\nprosperity also increaseth; and he that hath prosperity truly becometh a\r\nman. He that is ever devoted to virtue, and hath his mind under control,\r\nand always acteth after deliberation, never inclineth towards\r\nunrighteousness and never engageth in any act that is sinful. He that is\r\nwithout shame and sense is neither man nor woman. He is incapable of\r\nearning religious merit, and is like a Sudra. He that hath shame\r\ngratifieth the gods, the Pitris, and even his own self, and by this he\r\nobtaineth emancipation, which indeed, is the highest aim of all righteous\r\npersons.'\r\n\r\n'Thou hast, O slayer of Madhu, seen all this in me with thy own eyes. It\r\nis not unknown to thee, how, deprived of kingdom, we have lived these\r\nyears. We cannot lawfully abandon that prosperity (which had been ours).\r\nOur first-efforts will be such that, O Madhava, both ourselves and the\r\nKauravas, united in peace, will quietly enjoy our prosperity. Otherwise,\r\nwe shall, after slaying the worst of the Kauravas, regain those\r\nprovinces, although success through bloodshed by destruction of even\r\ndespicable foes that are related to us so dearly is the worst of all\r\nfierce deeds, O Krishna. We have numerous kinsmen, and numerous also are\r\nthe revered seniors that have taken this or that other side. The\r\nslaughter of these would be highly sinful. What good, therefore, can\r\nthere be in battle? Alas, such sinful practices are the duties of the\r\nKshatriya order! Ourselves have taken our births in that wretched order!\r\nWhether those practices be sinful or virtuous, any other than the\r\nprofession of arms would be censurable for us. A Sudra serveth; a Vaisya\r\nliveth by trade; the Brahmana have choosen the wooden bowl (for begging),\r\nwhile we are to live by slaughter! A Kshatriya, slayeth a Kshatriya;\r\nfishes live on fish; a dog preyeth upon a dog! Behold, O thou of the\r\nDasarha race, how each of these followeth his peculiar virtue. O Krishna,\r\nKali is ever present in battle-fields; lives are lost all around. It is\r\ntrue, force regulated by policy is invoked; yet success and defeat are\r\nindependent of the will of the combatants. The lives also of creatures\r\nare independent of their own wishes, and neither weal nor woe can be\r\none's when the time is not come for it, O best of the Yadu's race.\r\nSometimes one man killeth many, sometimes many and united together kill\r\none. A coward may slay a hero, and one unknown to fame may stay a hero of\r\ncelebrity. Both parties cannot win success, nor both be defeated. The\r\nloss, however, on both sides may be equal. If one flieth away, loss of\r\nboth life and fame is his. Under all circumstances, however, war is a\r\nsin. Who in striking another is not himself struck? As regard the person,\r\nhowever, who is struck, victory and defeat, O Hrishikesa, are the same.\r\nIt is true that defeat is not much removed from death, but his loss also,\r\nO Krishna, is not less who winneth victory. He himself may not be killed,\r\nbut his adversaries will kill at least some one that is dear to him, or\r\nsome others and thus the man, O sire, deprived of strength and not seeing\r\nbefore him his sons and brothers, becometh indifferent, O Krishna, to\r\nlife itself. Those that are quiet, modest, virtuous, and compassionate,\r\nare generally slain in battle, while they that are wicked escape. Even\r\nafter slaying one's foes, repentance, O Janardana, possesseth the heart.\r\nHe that surviveth among the foes giveth trouble, for the survivor,\r\ncollecting a force, seeketh to destroy the surviving victor. In hopes of\r\nterminating the dispute, one often seeketh to exterminate the foe. Thus\r\nvictory createth animosity, and he that is defeated liveth in sorrow. He\r\nthat is peaceful, sleepeth in happiness, giving up all thoughts of\r\nvictory and defeat, whereas he that hath provoked hostility always\r\nsleepeth in misery, with, indeed, an anxious heart, as if sleeping with a\r\nsnake in the same room. He that exterminates seldom winneth fame. On the\r\nother hand, such a person reapeth eternal infamy in the estimation of\r\nall. Hostilities, waged over so long, cease not; for if there is even one\r\nalive in the enemy's family, narrators are never wanted to remind him of\r\nthe past. Enmity, O Kesava, is never neutralised by enmity; on the other\r\nhand, it is fomented by enmity, like fire fed by clarified butter.\r\nTherefore, there can be no peace without the annihilation of one party,\r\nfor flaws may always be detected of which advantage may be taken by one\r\nside or other. They that are engaged in watching for flaws have this\r\nvice. Confidence in one's own prowess troubleth the core of one's heart\r\nlike an incurable disease. Without either renouncing that at once, or\r\ndeath, there can be no peace. It is true, O slayer of Madhu, that\r\nexterminating the foe by the very roots, may lead to good result in the\r\nshape of great prosperity, yet such an act is most cruel. The peace that\r\nmay be brought about by our renouncing the kingdom is hardly different\r\nfrom death, which is implied by the loss of kingdom, in consequence of\r\nthe design of the enemy and the utter ruin of ourselves. We do not wish\r\nto give u the kingdom, nor do we wish to see the extinction of our race.\r\nUnder these circumstances, therefore, the peace that is obtained through\r\neve humiliation is the best. When these that strive for peace by all\r\nmeans without of course wishing for war, find conciliation fail, war\r\nbecomes in evitable, and then is the time for the display of prowess.\r\nIndeed, when conciliation fails, frightful results follow. The learned\r\nhave noticed all this in a canine contest. First, there comes the wagging\r\nof tails, then the bark, then the bark in reply, then the\r\ncircumambulation, then the showing of teeth, then repeated roars, and\r\nthen at last the fight. In such a contest, O Krishna., the dog that is\r\nstronger, vanquishing his antagonist, taketh the latter's meat. The same\r\nis exactly the case with men. There is no difference whatever. They that\r\nare powerful should be indifferent to avoid disputes with the weak who\r\nalways bow down. The father, the king, and he that is venerable in year,\r\nalways deserve regard. Dhritarashtra, therefore, O Janardana, is worthy\r\nof our respect and worship. But, O Madhava, Dhritarashtra's affection for\r\nhis son is great. Obedient to his son, he will reject our submission.\r\nWhat dost thou, O Krishna, think best at this juncture? How may we, O\r\nMadhava, preserve both our interest and virtue? Whom also, besides thee,\r\nO slayer of Madhu, and foremost of men, shall we consult in this\r\ndifficult affair? What other friend have we, O Krishna, who like thee is\r\nso dear to us, who seeketh our welfare so, who is so conversant with the\r\ncourse of all actions, and who is so well-acquainted with truth?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Janardana replied unto\r\nYudhishthira the just, saying, 'I will go to the court of the Kurus for\r\nthe sake of both of You. If without sacrificing your interests I can\r\nobtain peace, O king, an act of great religious merit will be mine,\r\nproductive of great fruits. I shall then also save from the meshes of\r\ndeath the Kurus and the Srinjayas inflamed with wrath, the Pandavas and\r\nthe Dhritarashtras, and, in fact, this entire earth.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, It is not my wish, O Krishna, that thou wilt go to\r\nthe Kurus, for Suyodhana will never act according to thy words, even if\r\nthou advisest him well. All the Kshatriyas of the world, obedient to\r\nDuryodhana's command, are assembled there. I do not like that thou, O\r\nKrishna, shouldst proceed into their midst, If any mischief be done to\r\nthee, O Madhava, Jett alone happiness; nothing, not even divinity, nor\r\neven the sovereignty over all the gods will delight us.'\r\n\r\n\"The holy one said, 'I know, O monarch, the sinfulness of Dhritarashtra's\r\nson, but by going there we will escape the blame of all the kings of the\r\nearth. Like other animals before the lion, all the kings of the earth\r\nunited together are not competent to stand still before me in battle when\r\nI am enraged. If, after all, they do me any injury, then I will consume\r\nall the Kurus. Even this is my intention. My going thither, O Partha,\r\nwill not be fruitless, for if our object be not fulfilled, we shall at\r\nleast escape all blame.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Do, O Krishna, as it pleaseth thee. Blessed be thou,\r\ngo then to the Kurus. I hope to behold thee return successful and\r\nprosperous. Going unto the Kurus, make thou, O Lord, such a peace that\r\nall the sons of Bharata may live together with cheerful hearts and\r\ncontentedly. Thou art our brother and friend, dear to me as much as to\r\nVibhatsu. Such hath been our intimacy with thee that we apprehend no\r\nneglect of our interest from thee. Go thou, there for our good. Thou\r\nknowest us, thou knowest our antagonists, thou knowest what our purposes\r\nare, and thou knowest also what to say. Thou wilt, O Krishna, say unto\r\nSuyodhana such words as are for our benefit. Whether peace is to be\r\nestablished by (apparent) sin or by any other means, O Kesava, speak such\r\nwords as may prove beneficial to us.'"

Thy heart\r\ninclineth to righteousness, whereas their inclination is towards enmity.\r\nThat which is obtained without war is of great value to thee. A long-life\r\nBrahmacharya is not, O lord of earth, the duty of a Kshatriya. Indeed,\r\nmen of all the four orders have said that a Kshatriya should never\r\nsubsist on alms; victory or death in battle, hath been eternally ordained\r\nby the Creator; even that is the duty of a Kshatriya. Cowardice is not\r\napplauded (in a Kshatriya). Subsistence, O Yudhishthira, is not possible\r\nby Cowardice, O thou of mighty arms. Display thy prowess, and vanquish, O\r\nchastiser of foes, thy enemies. The covetous son of Dhritarashtra, O\r\nchastiser of foes, living for a long time (with many kings) has by\r\naffection and friendship become very powerful. Therefore, O king, there\r\nis no hope of making his peace with thee. They regard themselves strong,\r\nhaving Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others with them. As long, O king,\r\nas thou, O grinder of foes, wilt behave with them mildly, they will\r\nwithhold thy kingdom. Neither from compassion, nor from mildness, nor\r\nfrom a sense of righteousness, will the sons of Dhritarashtra, O\r\nchastiser of foes, fulfil thy wishes. This, O son of Pandu, is another\r\nproof that they will not make peace with thee. Having pained thee so\r\ndeeply by making thee put on a Kaupina, they were not stung with remorse.\r\nIn the very sight of the Grandsire (Bhishma) and Drona and the wise\r\nVidura, of many holy Brahmanas, the king, the citizens, and all the chief\r\nKauravas, the cruel Duryodhana, deceitfully defeating thee at dice,--thee\r\nthat are charitable, gentle, self-restrained, virtuous, and of rigid vows\r\nwas not, O king, ashamed of his vile act. Do not, O monarch, show any\r\ncompassion for that wretch of such disposition. They deserve death at the\r\nhands of all, how much more then of thee, O Bharata? O Bharata, with what\r\nimproper speeches did Duryodhana with his brothers, filled with gladness\r\nand indulging in many a boast, afflict thee with thy brothers! He said,\r\n'The Pandavas now have nothing of their own in this wide earth. Their\r\nvery names and lineage are extinct. In time, which is never-ending,\r\ndefeat will be theirs. All their virtues having merged in me, they will\r\nnow be reduced to the five elements.' While the match at dice was in\r\nprogress, the wretched Dussasana of most wicked soul, seizing that\r\nweeping lady by the hair dragged princess Draupadi, as if she had no\r\nprotectors, to the assembly of kings, and in the presence of Bhishma and\r\nDrona and others, repeatedly called her--cow, cow! Restrained by thee,\r\nthy brothers of terrible prowess, bound also by the bonds of virtue, did\r\nnothing to avenge it; and after thou hadst been exiled to the woods,\r\nDuryodhana having uttered such and other cruel words, boasted amid his\r\nkinsmen. Knowing thee innocent, they that were assembled sat silent in\r\nthe assembly-house, weeping with choked voice. The assembled kings with\r\nthe Brahmanas did not applaud him for this. Indeed, all the courtiers\r\npresent there censured him. To a man of noble descent, O grinder of foes,\r\neven censure is death. Death is even many times better than a life of\r\nblame. Even then, O king, he died when, upon being censured by all the\r\nkings of the earth, he felt no shame! He whose character is so abominable\r\nmay easily be destroyed even like a rootless tree standing erect on a\r\nsingle weak root. The sinful and evil-minded Duryodhana deserveth death\r\nat the hands of every one, even like a serpent. Slay him, therefore, O\r\nkiller of foes, and hesitate not in the least. It behoveth thee, O\r\nsinless one, and I like it too, that thou shouldst pay homage unto thy\r\nfather Dhritarashtra and also unto Bhishma. Going thither I will remove\r\nthe doubts of all men who are still undecided as to the wickedness of\r\nDuryodhana. Thither in the presence of all kings I will enumerate all\r\nthose virtues of thine that are not to be met in all men, as also all the\r\nvices of Duryodhana. And hearing me speak beneficial words, pregnant with\r\nvirtue and profit, the rulers of various realms will regard thee as\r\npossessed of a virtuous soul, and as a speaker of truth, while at the\r\nsame time, they will understand how Duryodhana is actuated by avarice. I\r\nwill also tell the vice of Duryodhana, before both the citizens and the\r\ninhabitants of the country, before both the young and the old, of all the\r\nfour orders that will be collected there. And as thou askest for peace no\r\none will charge thee sinful, while all the chiefs of the earth will\r\ncensure the Kurus and Dhritarashtra; and when Duryodhana will be dead in\r\nconsequence of his being forsaken by all men, there will be nothing left\r\nto do. Do then what should now be done. Going unto the Kurus, I shall\r\nstrive to make peace without sacrificing thy interests, and marking their\r\ninclination for war and all their proceedings, I will soon come back, O\r\nBharata, for thy victory. I think war with the enemy to be certain. All\r\nthe omens that are noticeable by me point to that. Birds and animals set\r\nup frightful screeches and howls at the approach of dusk. The foremost of\r\nelephants and steeds assume horrible shapes; the very fire exhibiteth\r\ndiverse kinds of terrible hues! This would never have been the case but\r\nfor the fact of the world-destroying Havoc's self coming into our midst!\r\nMaking ready their weapons, machines, coats of mail, and cars, elephants,\r\nand steeds, let all thy warriors be prepared for battle, and let them\r\ntake care of their elephants and horses and cars. And, O king, collect\r\neverything that thou needest for the impending war. As long as he liveth,\r\nDuryodhana will, by no means, be able to give back unto thee. O king,\r\nthat kingdom of thine which, abounding in prosperity, have before been\r\ntaken by him at dice!'\""

Resenting\r\neverything, his wrath always excited, hostile to his own good and\r\narrogant, Duryodhana should not be roughly addressed. Do thou behave\r\ntowards him with mildness. Duryodhana is by nature sinful of heart like\r\nthat of a robber, intoxicated with the pride of prosperity, hostile to\r\nthe Pandavas, without foresight, cruel in speech, always disposed to\r\ncensure others, of wicked prowess, of wrath not easily to be appeased,\r\nnot susceptible of being taught, of wicked soul, deceitful in behaviour,\r\ncapable of giving up his very life rather than break or give up his own\r\nopinion. Peace with such a one, O Krishna, is, I suppose, most difficult.\r\nRegardless of the words of even his well-wishers, destitute of virtue,\r\nloving falsehood, he always acts against the words of his counsellors and\r\nwounds their hearts. Like a serpent hid within reeds, he naturally\r\ncommits sinful acts, depending on his own wicked disposition, and\r\nobedient to the impulse of wrath. What army Duryodhana hath, what his\r\nconduct is, what his nature, what his might, and what his prowess, are\r\nall well-known to thee. Before this, the Kauravas with their son passed\r\ntheir days in cheerfulness, and we also with our friends rejoiced like\r\nthe younger brother of Indra, with Indra himself. Alas, by Duryodhana's\r\nwrath, O slayer of Madhu, the Bharatas will all be consumed, even like\r\nforests by fire at the end of the dewy seasons, and, O slayer of Madhu,\r\nwell-known are those eighteen kings that annihilated their kinsmen,\r\nfriends, and relatives. Even as, when Dharma became extinct, Kali was\r\nborn in the race of Asuras flourishing with prosperity and blazing with\r\nenergy, so was born Udavarta among the Haihayas. Janamejaya among the\r\nNepas, Vahula among the Talajanghas, proud Vasu among the Krimis,\r\nAjavindu among the Suviras, Rushardhik among the Surashtras, Arkaja among\r\nthe Valihas, Dhautamulaka among the Chinas, Hayagriva among the Videhas,\r\nVarayu among the Mahaujasas, Vahu among the Sundaras, Pururavas among the\r\nDiptakshas, Sahaja among the Chedis and Matsyas, Vrishaddhaja among the\r\nPraviras, Dharana among the Chandra-batsyas, Bigahana among the Mukutas\r\nand Sama among the Nandivegas. These vile individuals, O Krishna, spring\r\nup, at the end of each Yuga, in their respective races, for the\r\ndestruction of their kinsmen. So hath Duryodhana, the very embodiment of\r\nsin and the disgrace of his race, been born, at the end of the Yuga,\r\namongst us the Kurus. Therefore, O thou of fierce prowess, thou shouldst\r\naddress him slowly and mildly, not in bitter but sweet words fraught with\r\nvirtue and profit, and discourse fully on the subject so as to attract\r\nhis heart. All of us, O Krishna, would rather in humiliation follow\r\nDuryodhana submissively, but, oh, let not the Bharatas be annihilated. O\r\nVasudeva, act in such a way that we may rather live as strangers to the\r\nKurus than incurring the sin of bringing about the destruction of the\r\nwhole race should touch them, O Krishna, let the aged Grandsire and the\r\nother counsellors of the Kurus be asked to bring about brotherly feelings\r\nbetween brothers and to pacify the son of Dhritarashtra. Even this is\r\nwhat I say. King Yudhishthira also approveth of this, and Arjuna too is\r\naverse to war, for there is great compassion in him.'\""

O chastiser of foes, thou dost not steep\r\nbut wakest the whole night, sitting up face downwards. Thou often\r\nutterest frightful exclamation of wrath, indicative of the storm within\r\nthy heart. Inflamed with the fire of thy own fury, thou sighest, O Bhima\r\nwith an unquiet heart, like a flame of fire mixed with smoke. Withdrawing\r\nfrom company thou liest down breathing hot sighs, like a weak man pressed\r\ndown by a heavy load. They, who do not know the cause regard thee as\r\ninsane. As an elephant breaking into fragments uprooted trees lying on\r\nthe ground grunteth in rage while trampling them under his feet, so thou\r\nalso, O Bhima, runnest on, breathing deep sighs and shaking the earth\r\nunder the tread. Here in the region thou takest no delight in company but\r\npassest thy time in privacy. Night or day, Nothing pleases thee so much\r\nas seclusion. Sitting apart thou sometimes laughest aloud all on a\r\nsudden, and sometimes placing thy head between thy two knees, thou\r\ncontinuest in that posture for a long time with closed eyes. At the other\r\ntimes, O Bhima, contracting thy brows frequently and biting thy lips,\r\nthou starest fiercely before thee. All this is indicative of wrath. At\r\none time, thou hadst, in the midst of thy brothers, grasped the mace,\r\nuttering this oath, 'As the sun is seen rising in the east displaying his\r\nradiance, and as he truly setteth in the west journeying around the Meru,\r\nso do I swear that I will certainly slay insolent Duryodhana with this\r\nmace of mine, and this oath of mine will never be untrue.' How then doth\r\nthat same heart of thine, O chastiser of foes, now follow the counsels of\r\npeace? Alas, when fear entereth thy heart, O Bhima, it is certain that\r\nthe hearts of all who desire war are upset when war becometh actually\r\nimminent. Asleep or awake, thou beholdest, O son of Pritha, inauspicious\r\nomens. Perhaps, it is this for which thou desirest peace. Alas, like a\r\neunuch, thou dost not display any sign indicative of manliness in thee.\r\nThou art overwhelmed by panic, and it is for this that thy heart is\r\nupset. The heart trembleth, thy mind is overwhelmed by despair, thy\r\nthighs tremble, and it is for this that thou desirest peace. The hearts\r\nof mortals, O Partha, are surely as inconstant as the pods of the Salmali\r\nseed exposed to the force of the wind. This frame of thy mind is as\r\nstrange as articulate speech in kine. Indeed, the hearts of thy brothers\r\nare about to sink in an ocean of despair,--like swimmers in the sea\r\nwithout a raft to rescue them. That thou, O Bhimasena, shouldst utter\r\nwords so unexpected of thee is as strange as the shifting of a hill.\r\nRecollecting thy own deeds and the race also in which thou art born,\r\narise, O Bharata, yield not, to grief, O hero, and be firm. Such langour,\r\nO repressor of foes, is not worthy of thee, for a Kshatriya never\r\nenjoyeth that which he doth not acquire through prowess.'\""

That I take great delight in war and that my prowess is\r\nincapable of being baffled, must, O Krishna. be well-known to thee in\r\nconsequence of our having lived together for a long time. Or it may be,\r\nthou knowest me not, like one swimming in a lake ignorant of its depth.\r\nIt is for this that thou chidest me in such unbecoming words. Who else, O\r\nMadhava, knowing me to be Bhimasena, could address me with such\r\nunbecoming words as thou dost? Therefore, I shall tell thee, O delighter\r\nof the Vrishnis, about my own prowess and unrivalled might. Although to\r\nspeak of one's own prowess is always an ignoble act, yet, pierced as I am\r\nby thy unfriendly strictures, I will speak of my own might. Behold, O\r\nKrishna, these--the firmament and the earth--which are immovable,\r\nimmense, and infinite, and which are the refuge of, and in which are born\r\nthese countless creatures. If through anger these suddenly collide like\r\ntwo hills, just I, with my arms, can keep them asunder with all their\r\nmobile and immobile objects. Behold the joints of these my mace-like\r\narms. I find not the person who can extricate himself having once come\r\nwithin their grasp. The Himavat, the ocean, the mighty wielder of the\r\nthunderbolt himself, viz., the slayer of Vala,--even these three cannot,\r\nwith all their power extricate the person attacked by me. I will easily\r\ntrample on the ground under my feet all the Kshatriyas, who will come to\r\nbattle against the Pandavas. It is not known to thee, O Achyuta, with\r\nwhat prowess I vanquished the kings of the earth and brought them under\r\nsubjection. If, indeed, thou really knowest not my prowess which is like\r\nthe fierce energy of the midday sun thou wilt then know it, O Janardana,\r\nin the fierce melee of battle. Thou woundest me with thy cruel words,\r\npaining me with the pain of opening a foetid tumour. But know me to be\r\nmightier than what I have said of myself of my own accord. On that day,\r\nwhen the fierce and destructive havoc of battle will begin, thou will\r\nthen see me felling elephants and car-warriors combatants on steeds and\r\nthose on elephants, and slaying in rage the foremost of Kshatriya\r\nwarriors. Thou, as well as others, wilt see me doing all this and\r\ngrinding down the foremost of combatants. The marrow of my bones hath not\r\nyet decayed, nor doth my heart tremble. If the whole world rusheth\r\nagainst me in wrath, I do not yet feel the influence of fear. It is only\r\nfor the sake of compassion, O slayer of Madhu, that I am for displaying\r\ngoodwill to the foe. I am far quietly bearing all our injuries, lest the\r\nBharata race be extirpated.'\""

I know thy magnanimity of soul, and also thy strength, and thy\r\ndeeds. It is not for that reason that I reproached thee. O son of Pandu,\r\na thousand times greater will be the benefit conferred by thee on the\r\nPandava's cause than that which thou thinkest thyself to be capable of\r\nconferring on it. Thou, O Bhima, with thy kinsmen and friends, art\r\nexactly that which one should be that has taken his birth in a family\r\nlike thine, that is regarded by all the kings of the earth. The fact,\r\nhowever, is that they can never arrive at the truth, who under the\r\ninfluence of doubt proceed to enquire about the consequences hereafter of\r\nvirtue and vice, or about the strength and weakness of men. For it is\r\nseen that what is the cause of the success of a person's object becometh\r\nalso the cause of his ruin. Human acts, therefore, are doubtful in their\r\nconsequences. Learned men, capable of judging of the evils of actions\r\npronounce a particular course of action as worthy of being followed. It\r\nproduces, however, consequences, the very opposite of what were foreseen,\r\nvery much like the course of the wind. Indeed, even those acts of men\r\nthat are the results of deliberation and well-directed policy, and that\r\nare consistent with considerations of propriety, are baffled by the\r\ndispensations of Providence. Then, again, Providential dispensations,\r\nsuch as heat and cold and rain and hunger and thirst, that are not the\r\nconsequences of human acts, may be baffled by human exertion. Then again,\r\nbesides those acts which a person is pre-ordained (as the result of the\r\nact of past lives) to go through, one can always get rid of all other\r\nacts begun at his pleasure, as is testified by both the Smritis and the\r\nSrutis. Therefore, O son of Pandu, one cannot go on the world without\r\nacting. One should, hence, engage in work knowing that one's purpose\r\nwould be achieved by a combination of both Destiny and Exertion. He that\r\nengageth in acts under this belief is never pained by failure, nor\r\ndelighted by success. This, O Bhimasena, was the intended import of my\r\nspeech. It was not intended by me that victory would be certain in an\r\nencounter with the foe. A person, when his mind is upset should not lose\r\nhis cheerfulness and must yield neither to langour nor depression. It is\r\nfor this that I spoke to thee in the way I did. When the morrow comes, I\r\nwill go, O Pandava, to Dhritarashtra's presence. I will strive to make\r\npeace without sacrificing your interests. If the Kauravas make peace,\r\nthen boundless fame will be mine. Your purposes will be achieved, and\r\nthey also will reap great benefit. If, however, the Kauravas, without\r\nlistening to my words, resolve to maintain their opinion, then there will\r\nundoubtedly be a formidable war. In this war burthen resteth on thee, O\r\nBhimasena. That burthen should also be borne by Arjuna, while other\r\nwarriors should all be led by both of you. In case of war happening, I\r\nwill certainly be the driver of Vibhatsu's car, for that, indeed, is\r\nDhananjaya's wish and not that I myself am not desirous of fighting. It\r\nis for this that, hearing thee utter thy intention, I rekindled that thy\r\nenergy, O Vrikodara.'\""

Thou thinkest also that human prowess alone is fruitless, and\r\nalso that without putting forth one's prowess one's purposes cannot be\r\nachieved. What thou hast said may be true, but at the same time it may\r\nnot always be true. Nothing, however, should be regarded as\r\nimpracticable. It is true, peace seemeth to thee to be impossible in\r\nconsequence of our distressful condition, yet they are still acting\r\nagainst us without reaping the fruits of their acts. Peace, therefore, if\r\nproperly proposed, O lord, may be concluded. O Krishna, strive thou,\r\ntherefore, to bring about peace with the foe. Thou, O hero, art the\r\nforemost of all friends of both the Pandavas and the Kurus, even as\r\nPrajapati is of both the gods and the Asuras. Accomplish thou, therefore,\r\nthat which is for the good of both the Kurus and the Pandavas. The\r\naccomplishment of our good is not, I believe, difficult for thee. If thou\r\nstrivest, O Janardana, such is this act that it will be soon effected. As\r\nsoon as thou goest thither, it will be accomplished.

Doth not the\r\nevil-minded Duryodhana with his sons and kinsmen deserve destruction\r\nwhen, unable to bear the sight of Yudhishthira's prosperity and finding\r\nno other faultless expedient, that wretch, O slayer of Madhu, deprived us\r\nof our kingdom by the sinful expedient of deceitful dice?

Or, if thou deemest\r\ntheir immediate destruction to be preferable, let it be effected soon\r\nwithout further deliberation. Surely, thou knowest how Draupadi was\r\ninsulted in the midst of the assembly by Duryodhana of sinful soul and\r\nhow also we bore it with patience. That Duryodhana, O Madhava, will\r\nbehave with justice towards the Pandavas is what I cannot believe. Wise\r\ncounsels will be lost on him like seed sown in a barren soil.

Knowing, therefore, Duryodhana's heart and what my\r\nmost cherished wishes are, why then dost thou, O Arjuna, entertain such\r\napprehensions in respect of myself like one unacquainted with everything?\r\nThat grave act also which was ordained in heaven is known to thee, How\r\nthen, O Partha, can peace be concluded with the foe? What, however, O\r\nPandavas, is capable of being done by either speech or act, will all be\r\ndone by me. Do not, however, O Partha, expect peace to be possible with\r\nthe foe. About a year ago, on the occasion of attacking Virata's kine,\r\ndid not Bhishma, on their way back, solicit Duryodhana about this very\r\npeace so beneficial to all? Believe me, they have been defeated even then\r\nwhen their defeat was resolved by thee. Indeed, Suyodhana doth not\r\nconsent to part with the smallest portion of the kingdom for even the\r\nshortest period of time.

Thou knowest also,\r\nO thou of Dasarha's race, what message was privately delivered to Sanjaya\r\nby the king. Thou hast also heard all that was said unto Sanjaya. O thou\r\nof great effulgence, these words were even these, 'Let only five villages\r\nbe granted to us, viz., Avishthala, and Vrikasthala, and Makandi, and\r\nVaranavata, and for the fifth, any other,--O thou of mighty arms, O\r\nKesava, even this was the message that was to have been delivered to\r\nDuryodhana and his counsellors. But, O Krishna, O thou of Dasarha's race,\r\nhearing those words of Yudhishthira, endued with modesty and anxious for\r\npeace, Suyodhana hath not acted according to them. If, O Krishna,\r\nSuyodhana desireth to make peace without surrendering the kingdom, there\r\nis no necessity of going thither for making such a peace. The Pandavas\r\nwith the Srinjayas, O thou of mighty arms, are quite able to withstand\r\nthe fierce Dhritarashtra host inflamed with rage. When they are no longer\r\namenable to this arts of conciliation, it is not proper, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, that thou shouldst show them mercy. Those enemies, O Krishna, with\r\nwhom peace cannot be established by either conciliation or presents,\r\nshould be treated with severity by one desirous of saving his life.\r\nTherefore, O mighty-armed Achyuta, heavy should be the punishment that\r\ndeserves to be speedily inflicted upon them by thyself aided by the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas. Indeed, even this would become the son of\r\nPritha, and add to thy glory, and if accomplished, will, O Krishna, be a\r\nsource of great happiness to the whole Kshatriya race. He that is\r\ncovetous, whether belonging to the Kshatriya or any other order, save of\r\ncourse a Brahmana, even if most sinful, ought surely to be slain by a\r\nKshatriya, who is true to the duties of his own order. The exception in\r\nthe case of a Brahmana, O sire, is due to a Brahmana's being the\r\npreceptor of all the other orders, as also the first sharer of\r\neverything. Persons conversant with the scriptures declare, O Janardana,\r\nthat sin is incurred in slaying one that deserveth not to be slain. So\r\nthere is equal sin in not slaying one that deserveth to be slain. Act\r\nthou, therefore, O Krishna, in such a way with the forces of the Pandavas\r\nand the Srinjayas, that sin may not touch thee. From excess of confidence\r\nin thee, O Janardana, I will repeat what hath been said again and again.\r\nWhatever woman, O Kesava, is there on earth like me? I am the daughter of\r\nking Drupada, risen from the sacrificial alter. I am the sister of\r\nDhrishtadyumna, thy dear friend, O Krishna. I have by marriage become a\r\nlady of Ajamida's race,--the daughter-in-law of the illustrious Pandu. I\r\nam the queen of Pandu's sons, who resemble five Indras in splendour. I\r\nhave, by these five heroes, five sons that are all mighty car-warriors,\r\nand that are morally bound to thee, O Krishna, as Abhimanyu himself.\r\nBeing such, O Krishna, I was seized by the hair, dragged into the\r\nassembly and insulted in the very sight of the sons of Pandu and in thy\r\nlife-time. O Kesava, the sons of Pandu, the Panchalas, and the Vrishnis\r\nbeing all alive, exposed to the gaze of the assembly I was treated as a\r\nslave by those sinful wretches. And when the Pandavas beholding it all\r\nsat silent without giving way to wrath, in my heart I called upon thee. O\r\nGovinda, saying,--Save me, O save me!--Then the illustrious king\r\nDhritarashtra, my father-in-law, said unto me, 'Ask thou any boon, O\r\nprincess of Panchala. Thou deservest boons and even honour at my hands.'\r\nThus addressed I said, 'Let the Pandavas be free men with their cars and\r\nweapons.' Upon this the Pandavas, O Kesava, were freed but only to be\r\nexiled into the woods. O Janardana, thou knowest all these sorrows of\r\nmine. Rescue me, O lotus-eyed one, with my husbands, kinsmen, and\r\nrelatives, from that grief. Morally, O Krishna, I am the daughter-in-law\r\nof both Bhishma and Dhritarashtra. Though such, I was yet forcibly made a\r\nslave. Fie to Partha's bowmanship, oh, fie to Bhimasena's might since\r\nDuryodhana, O Krishna, liveth for even a moment. If I deserve any favour\r\nat thy hands, if thou hast any compassion for me, let thy wrath, O\r\nKrishna, be directed towards the sons of Dhritarashtra.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the beautiful Krishna of eyes\r\nthat were black in hue and large like lotus leaves, bathed in tears, and\r\nwalking like a cow-elephant, approached the lotus-eyed Krishna, and\r\ntaking with her left hand her own beautiful tresses of curly ends,\r\ndeep-blue in hue and scented with every perfume, endued with every\r\nauspicious mark, and though gathered into a braid, yet soft and glossy\r\nlike a mighty snake, spake these words, 'Lotus-eyed one that art anxious\r\nfor peace with the enemy, thou shouldst, in all thy acts, call to thy\r\nmind these tresses of mine seized by Dussasana's rude hands! If Bhima and\r\nArjuna, O Krishna, have become so low as to long for peace, my aged\r\nfather then with his war like sons will avenge for me in battle. My five\r\nsons also that are endued with great energy, with Abhimanyu, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, at their head, will fight with the Kauravas. What peace can this\r\nheart of mine know unless I behold Dussasana's dark arm severed from his\r\ntrunk and pulverised to atoms? Thirteen long years have I passed in\r\nexpectation of better times, hiding in my heart my wrath like a\r\nsmouldering fire. And now pierced by Bhima's wordy darts that heart cf\r\nmine is about to break, for the mighty-armed Bhima now casteth his eye on\r\nmorality. Uttering these words with voice choked in tears, the large-eyed\r\nKrishna began to weep aloud, with convulsive sobs, and tears gushed down\r\nher cheeks. And that lady, with hips full and round, began to drench her\r\nclose and deep bosom by the tears she shed which were hot as liquid fire.\r\nThe mighty-armed Kesava then spoke, comforting her in these words, 'Soon\r\nwilt thou, O Krishna, behold the ladies of Bharata's race weep as thou\r\ndost. Even they, O timid one, will weep like thee, their kinsmen and\r\nfriends being slain. They with whom, O lady, thou art angry, have their\r\nkinsmen and warriors already slain. With Bhima and Arjuna and the twins,\r\nat Yudhishthira's command, and agreeably to fate, and what hath been\r\nordained by the Ordainer, I will accomplish all this. Their hour having\r\narrived, the sons of Dhritarashtra, if they do not listen to my words,\r\nwill surely lie down on the earth turned as morsels of dogs and jackals.\r\nThe mountains of Himavat might shift their site, the Earth herself might\r\nspilt into a hundred fragments, the firmament itself with its myriads of\r\nstars might fall down, still my words can never be futile. Stop thy\r\ntears, I swear to thee, O Krishna, soon wilt thou see thy husbands, with\r\ntheir enemies slain, and with prosperity crowning them.'\""

And having\r\ntouched the tail of a bull and reverently bowed to the Brahmanas, walked\r\nround the sacred fire, and cast his eyes on the (usual) auspicious\r\narticles placed in view, Janardana recollected Yudhishthira's word and\r\naddressed Sini's grandson Satyaki, seated near, saying, 'Let my car be\r\nmade ready and let my conch and discus along with my mace, and quivers\r\nand darts and all kinds of weapons, offensive and defensive, be placed on\r\nit, for Duryodhana and Karna and Suvala's son are all of wicked souls,\r\nand foes, however contemptible, should never be disregarded by even a\r\npowerful person. Understanding the wishes of Kesava, the wielder of the\r\ndiscus and the mace, his attendants immediately addressed themselves to\r\nyoke his car. And that car resembled in effulgence the fire that shows\r\nitself at the time of the universal dissolution, and itself in speed. And\r\nit was provided with two wheels that resembled the sun and the moon in\r\nlustre. And it bore emblazonments of moons, both crescent and full, and\r\nof fishes, animals, and birds and it was adorned with garlands of diverse\r\nflowers and with pearls and gems of various kinds all around. And endued\r\nwith the splendour of the rising sun, it was large and handsome. And\r\nvariegated with gems and gold, it was furnished with an excellent\r\nflag-staff bearing beautiful pennons. And well-supplied with every\r\nnecessary article, and incapable of being resisted by the foe, it was\r\ncovered with tiger-skins, and capable of robbing the fame of every foe,\r\nit enhanced the joy of the Yadavas. And they yoked unto it those\r\nexcellent steeds named Saivya and Sugriva and Meghapushpa and Valahaka,\r\nafter these had been bathed and attired in beautiful harness. And\r\nenhancing the dignity of Krishna still further, Garuda, the lord of the\r\nfeathery creation, came and perched on the flag-staff of that car\r\nproducing a terrible rattle. And Saurin then mounted on that car, high as\r\nthe summit of the Meru, and producing a rattle, deep and loud as the\r\nsound of the kettle-drum or the clouds and which resembled the celestial\r\ncar coursing at the will of the rider. And taking Satyaki also upon it,\r\nthat best of male beings set out, filling the earth and the welkin with\r\nthe rattle of his chariot-wheels. And the sky became cloudless, and\r\nauspicious winds began to blow around, and the atmosphere freed from the\r\ndust became pure. Indeed, as Vasudeva set out, auspicious animals and\r\nbirds, whirling by the right side, began to follow him, and cranes and\r\npeacocks and swans all followed the slayer of Madhu, uttering cries of\r\ngood omens. The very fire, fed with Homa libations in accompaniment with\r\nMantras, freed from smoke blazed up cheerfully, sending forth its flames\r\ntowards the right. And Vasishtha and Vamadeva, and Bhuridyumna and Gaya,\r\nand Kratha and Sukra and Kusika and Bhrigu, and other Brahmarshis and\r\ncelestial Rishis united together, all stood on the right side of Krishna,\r\nthat delighter of the Yadavas, that younger brother of Vasava. And thus\r\nworshipped by those and other illustrious Rishis and holy men, Krishna\r\nset out for the residence of the Kurus. And while Krishna was proceeding,\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, followed him, as also Bhima and Arjuna\r\nand those other Pandavas, viz., the twin sons of Madri. And the valiant\r\nChekitana and Dhrishtaketu, the ruler of the Chedis, and Drupada and the\r\nking of Kasi and that mighty car-warrior Sikhandin, and Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nand Virata with his sons, and the princes of Kekaya also,--all these\r\nKshatriyas followed that bull of the Kshatriya race to honour him. And\r\nthe illustrious king Yudhishthira the just, having followed Govinda to\r\nsome distance, addressed him in these words in the presence of all those\r\nkings. And the son of Kunti embraced that foremost of all persons, who\r\nnever, from desire, or anger, or fear, or purpose of gain committed the\r\nleast wrong, whose mind was ever steady, who was a stranger to\r\ncovetousness, who was conversant with morality and endued with great\r\nintelligence and wisdom, who knew the hearts of all creatures and was the\r\nlord of all, who was the God of gods, who was eternal, who was possessed\r\nof every virtue, and who bore the auspicious mark on his breast. And\r\nembracing him the king began to indicate what he was to do.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'That lady who hath brought us from our infancy; who\r\nis ever engaged in facts and ascetic penances and propitiatory rites and\r\nceremonies; who is devoted to the worship of the gods and guests; who is\r\nalways engaged in waiting upon her superiors who is fond of her sons,\r\nbearing for them an affection that knows no bounds; who, O Janardana, is\r\ndearly loved by us; who, O grinder of foes, repeatedly saved us from the\r\nsnares of Suyodhana, like a boat saving a ship-wrecked crew from the\r\nfrightful terrors of the sea; and who, O Madhava, however undeserving of\r\nwoe herself, hath on our account endured countless sufferings,--should be\r\nasked about her welfare-Salute and embrace, and, oh, comfort her over and\r\nover, overwhelmed with grief as she is on account of her sons by talking\r\nof the Pandavas. Ever since her marriage she hath been the victim,\r\nhowever undeserving, of sorrow and griefs due to the conduct of her\r\nfather-in-law, and suffering hath been her position. Shall I, O Krishna,\r\never see the time when, O chastiser of foes, my afflictions being over, I\r\nshall be able to make my sorrowing mother happy? On the eve of our exile,\r\nfrom affection for her children, she ran after us in anguish, crying\r\nbitterly. But leaving her behind, we went into the woods. Sorrow doth not\r\nnecessarily kill. It is possible, therefore, that she is alive, being\r\nhospitably entertained by the Anartas, though afflicted with sorrow on\r\naccount of her sons. O glorious Krishna, salute her for me, the Kuru king\r\nDhritarashtra also, and all those monarchs who are senior to us in age,\r\nand Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and king Vahlika, and Drona's son and\r\nSomadatta, and in fact, every one of the Bharata race, and also Vidura\r\nendued with great wisdom, that counsellor of the Kurus, of profound\r\nintellect and intimate acquaintance with morality,--should all, O slayer\r\nof Madhu, be embraced by thee!' Having in the presence of the kings, said\r\nthese words unto Kesava, Yudhishthira, with Krishna's permission, came\r\nback having at first walked round him. Then Arjuna, proceeding a few\r\nsteps, further said unto his friend, that bull among men, that slayer of\r\nhostile heroes, that invincible warrior of Dasarha's race, 'It is known\r\nto all the kings, O illustrious Govinda, that at our consultation it was\r\nsettled that we should ask back the kingdom. If without insulting us, if\r\nhonouring thee, they honestly give us what we demand, then, O mighty\r\narmed one, they would please me greatly and would themselves escape a\r\nterrible danger. If, however, Dhritarashtra's son, who always adopts\r\nimproper means, acts otherwise, then I shall surely, O Janardana,\r\nannihilate the Kshatriya race.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When Arjuna said these words, Vrikodara was\r\nfilled with delight. And that son of Pandu continually quivered with\r\nrage; and while still quivering with rage and the delight that filled his\r\nheart upon hearing Dhananjaya's words, he set forth a terrible shout. And\r\nhearing that shout of his, all the bowmen trembled in fear and steeds and\r\nelephants were seen to pass urine and excreta. And having addressed\r\nKesava then and informed him of his resolution. Arjuna with Janardana's\r\npermission, came back, having first embraced him. And after all the kings\r\nhad desisted following him, Janardana set out with a cheerful heart on\r\nhis car drawn by Saivya, Sugriva, and others. And those steeds of\r\nVasudeva, urged by Daruka, coursed onwards, devouring the sky and\r\ndrinking the road. And on his way Kesava of mighty arms met with some\r\nRishis blazing with Brahmic lustre, standing on both sides of the road,\r\nAnd soon alighting from his car, Janardana saluted them reverently. And\r\nworshipping them duly, he enquired of them, saying, 'Is there peace in\r\nall the world? Is virtue being duly practised? And the other three orders\r\nobedient to the Brahmanas? And having duly worshipped them, the slayer of\r\nMadhu again said, 'Where have ye been crowned with success? Whither would\r\nye go, and for what object? What also shall I do for yourselves? What has\r\nbrought your illustrious selves down on the earth?' Thus addressed,\r\nJamadagni's son, the friend of Brahma--that lord of both gods and\r\nAsuras,--approached Govinda the slayer of Madhu, embraced him, and said,\r\n'The celestial Rishis of pious deeds, and Brahmanas of extensive\r\nacquaintance with the scriptures, and royal sages, O Dasarha, and\r\nvenerable ascetic,--these witnesses, O illustrious one, of the former\r\nfeats of gods and Asuras,--are desirous of beholding all the Kshatriyas\r\nof the earth assembled from every side as also the counsellors sitting in\r\nthe assembly, the kings, and thyself the embodiment of truth, O\r\nJanardana. O Kesava, we will go thither for beholding that grand sight.\r\nWe are also anxious, O Madhava, to listen to those words fraught with\r\nvirtue and profit, which will be spoken by thee, O chastiser of foes,\r\nunto the Kurus in the presence of all the kings. Indeed, Bhishma, and\r\nDrona, and others, as also the illustrious Vidura and thyself, O tiger\r\namong the Yadavas,--Ye all will be assembled together in conclave! We\r\ndesire, O Madhava, to hear the excellent, truthful, and beneficial words\r\nthat thou wilt utter and they also, O Govinda. Thou art now informed of\r\nour purpose, O thou of mighty arms. We will meet thee again. Go thither\r\nsafely, O hero. We hope to see thee in the midst of the conclave, seated\r\non an excellent seat mustering all thy energy and might.'\""

And what omens were seen when that hero set\r\nout?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Listen to me as I narrate all those natural and\r\nunnatural omens that were noticed at the time when the illustrious\r\nKrishna departed (for Hastinapura). Though there were no clouds in the\r\nsky, yet the roll of thunder accompanied by flashes of lightning was\r\nheard. And fleecy clouds in a clear sky rained incessantly in the rear!\r\nThe seven large rivers including the Sindhu (Indus) though flowing\r\neastwards then flowed in opposite directions. The very directions seemed\r\nto be reversed and nothing could be distinguished. Fires blazed up\r\neverywhere, O monarch, and the earth trembled repeatedly. The contents of\r\nwells and water-vessels by hundreds swelled up and ran out. The whole\r\nuniverse was enveloped in darkness. The atmosphere being filled with\r\ndust, neither the cardinal nor the subsidiary points of the horizon\r\ncould, O king, be distinguished. Loud roars were heard in the sky without\r\nany being being visible from whom these could emanate. This wonderful\r\nphenomenon, O king, was noticed all over the country. A south-westerly\r\nwind, with the harsh rattle of the thunder, uprooting trees by the\r\nthousands, crushed the city of Hastinapura. In those places, however, O\r\nBharata, through which he of Vrishni's race passed, delicious breezes\r\nblew and everything became auspicious. Showers of lotuses and fragrant\r\nflowers fell there. The very road became delightful, being free from\r\nprickly grass and thorns. At those places where he stayed, Brahmanas by\r\nthousands glorified that giver of wealth with (laudation) and worshipped\r\nhim with dishes of curds, ghee, honey, and presents of wealth. The very\r\nwomen, coming out on the road, strewed wild flowers of great fragrance on\r\nthe person of that illustrious hero, devoted to the welfare of all\r\ncreatures. He then came upon a delightful spot called Salibhavana which\r\nwas filled with every kind of crops, a spot that was delicious and\r\nsacred, after having, O bull of the Bharata race, seen various villages\r\nabounding in bees, and picturesque to the eye, and delightful to the\r\nheart, and after having passed through diverse cities and kingdoms.\r\nAlways cheerful and of good hearts, well-protected by the Bharatas and\r\ntherefore free from all anxieties on account of the designs of invaders,\r\nand unacquainted with calamities of any kind, many of the citizens of\r\nUpaplavya, coming out of their town, stood together on the way, desirous\r\nof beholding Krishna. And beholding that illustrious one resembling a\r\nblazing fire arrived at the spot, they worshipped him who deserved their\r\nworship with all the honours of a guest arrived in their abode. When at\r\nlast that slayer of hostile heroes, Kesava, came to Vrikasthala, the sun\r\nseemed to redden the sky by his straggling rays of light. Alighting from\r\nhis car, he duly went through the usual purificatory rites, and ordering\r\nthe steeds to be unharnessed, he set himself to say his evening prayers.\r\nAnd Daruka also, setting the steeds free, tended them according to the\r\nrules of equine science, and taking off the yokes and traces, let them\r\nloose. After this was done, the slayer of Madhu said, 'Here must we pass\r\nthe night for the sake of Yudhishthira's mission. Ascertaining that to be\r\nhis intention, the attendants soon set a temporary abode and prepared in\r\na trice excellent food and drink. Amongst the Brahmanas, O king, that\r\nresided in the village, they that were of noble and high descent, modest,\r\nand obedient to the injunctions of the Vedas in their conduct, approached\r\nthat illustrious chastiser of foes, Hrishikesa, and honoured him with\r\ntheir benedictions and auspicious speeches. And having honoured him of\r\nDasarha's race that deserveth honour from every one, they placed at the\r\ndisposal of that illustrious person their houses, abounding in wealth.\r\nSaying unto them--'Enough'--the illustrious Krishna paid them proper\r\nhomage, each according to his rank, and wending with them to their house,\r\nhe returned in their company to his own (tent). And feeding all the\r\nBrahmanas with sweet-meats and himself taking his meals with them, Kesava\r\npassed the night happily there.'\""

And all the Dhartarashtras except\r\nDuryodhana, attired in excellent robes, and with Bhishma, Drona, Kripa,\r\nand others, went out to meet him. And the citizens by thousands, O king,\r\non cars of diverse kinds, and many on foot, also came out, desirous of\r\nbeholding Hrishikesa. And meeting on the way Bhishma of spotless deed,\r\nand Drona, and Dhritarashtra's sons, he entered the city, surrounded by\r\nthem all. And in honour of Krishna, the city was beautifully adorned, and\r\nthe principal streets were decorated with diverse jewels and gems. And, O\r\nking, O bull of the Bharata race, on that occasion no one,--man, woman,\r\nor child,--remained in doors, so eager were the citizens for beholding\r\nVasudeva. And all the citizens came out and lined the streets and bent\r\ntheir heads down to the ground singing eulogies in his honour, O king,\r\nwhen Hrishikesa entered the city and passed through it. And substantial\r\nmansions, filled with high-born ladies, seemed to be on the point of\r\nfalling down on the ground in consequence of their living weight. And\r\nalthough Vasudeva's steeds were endued with great speed, yet they moved\r\nvery slowly through that dense mass of human beings. And that lotus-eyed\r\ngrinder of foes then entered Dhritarashtra's ash-coloured palace which\r\nwas enriched with numerous buildings. And having passed through the first\r\nthree chambers of the palace, that chastiser of foes, Kesava, came upon\r\nthe royal son of Vichitravirya. And upon that son of Dasarha's race\r\napproaching his presence, the blind monarch of great fame stood up along\r\nwith Drona and Bhishma, Kripa and Somadatta, and king Vahlika also,--all\r\nstood up for honouring Janardana. And the Vrishni hero, having approached\r\nking Dhritarashtra of great fame, worshipped him and Bhishma with proper\r\nwords and without losing any time. And having offered that worship unto\r\nthem according to established usage, Madhava the slayer of Madhu, greeted\r\nthe other kings according to their seniority in years. And Janardana then\r\naccosted the illustrious Drona and his son, and Vahlika, and Kripa, and\r\nSomadatta. And there in that chamber Jay a spacious seat of beautiful\r\nworkmanship, made of gold and set with jewels. And at Dhritarashtra's\r\nrequest, Achyuta took that seat; and the priests of Dhritarashtra duly\r\noffered Janardana a cow, honey and curds and water. And after the rites\r\nof hospitality were over, Govinda remained there for a while, surrounded\r\nby the Kurus, laughing and jesting with them according to their\r\nrelationship with him. And that illustrious grinder of foes, honoured and\r\nworshipped by Dhritarashtra, came out with the king's permission. And\r\nMadhava having duly greeted all the Kurus in their assembly, then went to\r\nthe delightful abode of Vidura; and Vidura, having approached Janardana\r\nof Dasarha's race thus arrived at his abode, worshipped him with every\r\nauspicious and desirable offering. And he said, 'What use, O lotus-eyed\r\none, in telling thee of the joy I feel at this advent of thine, for thou\r\nart the inner Soul of all embodied creatures.' And after the hospitable\r\nreception was over, Vidura, conversant with all the principles of\r\nmorality, enquired of Govinda, the slayer of Madhu, about the welfare of\r\nPandavas. And that scion of Dasarha's race, that chief of the Vrishnis,\r\nunto whom the past and the future were as the present, knowing that\r\nVidura was loved by the Pandavas and friendly towards them, and learned,\r\nand firm in morality, and honest, and harbouring no wrath (against the\r\nPandavas), and wise, began to tell him everything in detail about the\r\ndoings of the sons of Pandu.'\""

And\r\nbeholding Krishna whose countenance beamed with the effulgence of the\r\nradiant sun arrived at her abode, she encircled his neck with her arms\r\nand began to pour forth her lamentations remembering her sons. And at the\r\nsight, after a long time, of Govinda of Vrishni's race, the companion of\r\nthose mighty children of hers, the tears of Pritha flowed fast. And after\r\nKrishna, that foremost of warriors, had taken his seat having first\r\nreceived the rites of hospitality, Pritha, with a woe-begone face and\r\nvoice choked with tears addressed him, saying. They, who, from their\r\nearliest years have always waited with reverence on their superiors;\r\nthey, who, in friendship are attached to one another; they, who, deprived\r\ndeceitfully of their kingdom had gone to seclusion, however worthy of\r\nliving in the midst of friends and attendants,--they, who have subjugated\r\nboth wrath and joy, are devoted to Brahman's, and truthful in\r\nspeech,--those children of mine, who, abandoning kingdom and enjoyments\r\nand leaving my miserable self behind, had gone to the woods, plucking the\r\nvery roots of my heart,--those illustrious sons of Pandu, O Kesava, who\r\nhave suffered woe however undeserving of it,--how, alas, did they live in\r\nthe deep forest abounding with lions and tigers and elephants? Deprived\r\nin their infancy of their father, they were all tenderly brought up by\r\nme. How, also, did they live in the mighty forest, without seeing both\r\ntheir parents? From their infancy, O Kesava, the Pandavas were aroused\r\nfrom their beds by the music of conchs and drums and flutes. That they\r\nwho while at home, used to sleep in high palatial chambers on soft\r\nblankets and skins of the Runku deer and were waked up in the morning by\r\nthe grunt of elephants, the neighing of steeds, the clatter of car-wheels\r\nand the music of conchs and cymbals in accompaniment with the notes of\r\nflutes and lyres,--who, adored at early dawn with sacred sounding hymns\r\nuttered by Brahmanas, worshipped those amongst them that deserved such\r\nworship with robes and jewels and ornaments, and who were blessed with\r\nthe auspicious benedictions of those illustrious members of the\r\nregenerate order, as a return for the homage the latter received,--that\r\nthey, O Janardana, could sleep in the deep woods resounding with the\r\nshrill and dissonant cries of beasts of prey can hardly be believed,\r\nundeserving as they were of so much woe. How could they, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, who were roused from their beds by music of cymbals and drums and\r\nconchs and flutes, with the honeyed strains of songstresses and the\r\neulogies chanted by bards and professional reciters,--alas, how could\r\nthey be waked in the deep woods by the yells of wild beasts? He that is\r\nendued with modesty, is firm in truth, with senses under control and\r\ncompassions for all creatures,--he that hath vanquished both lust and\r\nmalice and always treadeth the path of the righteous, he that ably bore\r\nthe heavy burthen borne by Amvarisha and Mandhatri Yayati and Nahusha and\r\nBharata and Dilip and Sivi the son of Usinara and other royal sages of\r\nold, he that is endued with an excellent character and disposition, he\r\nthat is conversant with virtue, and whose prowess is incapable of being\r\nbaffled, he that is fit to become the monarch of the three worlds in\r\nconsequence of his possession of every accomplishment, he that is the\r\nforemost of all the Kurus lawfully and in respect of learning and\r\ndisposition, who is handsome and mighty-armed and hath no enemy,--Oh, how\r\nis that Yudhishthira of virtuous soul, and of complexion like that of\r\npure gold? He that hath the strength of ten thousand elephants and the\r\nspeed of the wind, he that is mighty and ever wrathful amongst the sons\r\nof Pandu, he that always doth good to his brothers and is, therefore,\r\ndear to them all, he, O slayer of Madhu, that slew Kichaka with all his\r\nrelatives, he that is the slayer of the Krodhavasas, of Hidimva, and of\r\nVaka, he that in prowess is equal unto Sakra, and in might unto the\r\nWind-god, he that is terrible, and in wrath is equal unto Madhava\r\nhimself, he that is the foremost of all smiters,--that wrathful son of\r\nPandu and chastiser of foes, who, restraining his rage, might,\r\nimpatience, and controlling his soul, is obedient to the commands of his\r\nelder brother,--speak to me, O Janardana, tell me how is that smiter of\r\nimmeasurable valour, that Bhimasena, who in aspect also justifies his\r\nname--that Vrikodara possessing arms like maces, that mighty second son\r\nof Pandu? O Krishna, that Arjuna of two arms who always regardeth himself\r\nas superior to his namesake of old with thousand arms, and who at one\r\nstretch shooteth five hundred arrows, that son of Pandu who in the use of\r\nweapons is equal unto king Kartavirya, in energy unto Aditya, in\r\nrestraint of senses unto a great sage, in forgiveness unto the Earth, and\r\nin prowess unto Indra himself,--he, by whose prowess, O slayer of Madhu,\r\nthe Kurus amongst all the kings of the earth have obtained this extensive\r\nempire, blazing with effulgence,--he, whose strength of arms is always\r\nadored by the Pandavas,--that son of Pandu, who is the foremost of all\r\ncar-warriors and whose prowess is incapable of being frustrated,--he,\r\nfrom an encounter with whom in battle no foe ever escapeth with\r\nlife,--he, O Achyuta, who is the conqueror of all, but who is incapable\r\nof being conquered by any,--he, who is the refuge of the Pandavas like\r\nVasava of the celestials,--how, O Kesava, is that Dhananjaya now, that\r\nbrother and friend of thine? He that is compassionate to all creatures,\r\nis endued with modesty and acquainted with mighty weapons, is soft and\r\ndelicate and virtuous,--he that is dear to me,--that mighty bowman\r\nSahadeva, that hero and ornament of assemblies,--he, O Krishna, who is\r\nyouthful in years, is devoted to the service of his brothers, and is\r\nconversant with both virtue and profit, whose brothers, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, always applaud the disposition of that high-souled and\r\nwell-behaved son of mine,--tell me, O thou of the Vrishni race, of that\r\nheroic Sahadeva, that foremost of warriors, that son of Madri, who always\r\nwaiteth submissively on his elder brothers and so reverentially on me. He\r\nthat is delicate and youthful in years, he that is brave and handsome in\r\nperson,--that son of Pandu who is dear unto his brothers as also unto\r\nall, and who, indeed, is their very life though walking with a separate\r\nbody,--he that is conversant with various modes of warfare,--he that is\r\nendued with great strength and is a mighty bowman,--tell me, O Krishna,\r\nwhether that dear child of mine, Nakula, who was brought up in luxury, is\r\nnow well in body and mind? O thou of mighty arms, shall I ever behold\r\nagain Nakula of mine, that mighty car-warrior, that delicate youth\r\nbrought up in every luxury and undeserving of woe? Behold, O hero, I am\r\nalive today, even I, who could know peace by losing sight of Nakula for\r\nthe short space of time taken up by a wink of the eye. More than all my\r\nsons, O Janardana, is the daughter of Drupada dear to me. High-born and\r\npossessed of great beauty, she is endued with every accomplishment.\r\nTruthful in speech, she chose the company of her lords, giving up that of\r\nher sons, Indeed, leaving her dear children behind, she followeth the\r\nsons of Pandu. Waited upon at one time by a large train of servants, and\r\nadored by her husbands with every object of enjoyment, the possessor of\r\nevery auspicious mark and accomplishment, how, O Achyuta, is that\r\nDraupadi now? Having five heroic husbands who are all smiters of foes and\r\nall mighty bowmen, each equal unto Agni in energy, alas, woe hath yet\r\nbeen the lot of Drupada's daughter. I have not for fourteen long years, O\r\nchastiser of foes, beheld the princess of Panchala, that daughter-in-law\r\nof mine' who herself hath been a prey to constant anxiety on account of\r\nher children, whom she hath not seen for that period. When Drupada's\r\ndaughter endued with such a disposition, doth not enjoy uninterrupted\r\nhappiness, it seemeth, O Govinda, that the happiness one enjoyeth is\r\nnever the fruit of one's acts. When I remember the forcible dragging of\r\nDraupadi to the assembly, then neither Vibhatsu nor Yudhishthira, nor\r\nBhima, nor Nakula, nor Sahadeva, becometh an object of affection to me.\r\nNever before had a heavier grief been mine than what pierced my heart\r\nwhen that wretch Dussasana, moved by wrath and covetousness, dragged\r\nDraupadi, then in her flow, and therefore clad in a single raiment, into\r\nthe presence of her father-in-law in the assembly and exposed her to the\r\ngaze of all the Kurus. It is known that amongst those that were present,\r\nking Vahlika, Kripa, Somadatta, were pierced with grief at this sight,\r\nbut of all present in that assembly, it was Vidura whom I worship.\r\nNeither by learning, nor by wealth doth one become worthy of homage. It\r\nis by disposition alone that one becomes respectable, O Krishna, endued\r\nwith great intelligence and profound wisdom, the character of the\r\nillustrious Vidura, like unto an ornament (that he wears) adorns the\r\nwhole world.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Filled with delight at the advent of Govinda,\r\nand afflicted with sorrow (on account of her sons) Pritha gave expression\r\nto all her diverse griefs. And she said, 'Can gambling and the slaughter\r\nof deer, which, O chastiser of foes, occupied all wicked kings of old, be\r\na pleasant occupation for the Pandavas? The thought consumeth, O Kesava,\r\nthat being dragged into the presence of all the Kurus in their assembly\r\nby Dhritarashtra's sons, insults worse than death were heaped on Krishna,\r\nO chastiser of foes, the banishment of my sons from their capital and\r\ntheir wanderings in the wilderness,--these and various other griefs, O\r\nJanardana, have been mine. Nothing could be more painful to me or to my\r\nsons themselves, O Madhava, than that they should have had to pass a\r\nperiod of concealment, shut up in a stranger's house. Full fourteen years\r\nhave passed since the day when Duryodhana first exited my sons. If misery\r\nis destructive of fruits of sins, and happiness is dependent on the\r\nfruits of religious merit, then it seems that happiness may still be ours\r\nafter so much misery. I never made any distinction between\r\nDhritarashtra's sons and mine (so far as maternal affection is\r\nconcerned). By that truth, O Krishna, I shall surely behold thee along\r\nwith the Pandavas safely come out of the present strife with their foes\r\nslain, and the kingdom recovered by them. The Pandavas themselves have\r\nobserved their vow with such truthfulness sticking to Dharma that they\r\nare incapable of being defeated by their enemies. In the matter of my\r\npresent sorrows, however, I blame neither myself nor Suyodhana, but my\r\nfather alone. Like a wealthy man giving away a sum of money in gift, my\r\nfather gave me away to Kuntibhoja. While a child playing with a ball in\r\nmy hands, thy grandfather, O Kesava, gave me away to his friend, the\r\nillustrious Kuntibhoja. Abandoned, O chastiser of foes, by my own father,\r\nand my father-in law, and afflicted with insufferable woes, what use, O\r\nMadhava, is there in my being alive? On the night of Savyasachin's birth,\r\nin the lying-in-room, an invisible voice told me, 'This son of thine will\r\nconquer the whole world, and his fame will reach the very heavens.\r\nSlaying the Kurus in a great battle and recovering the kingdom, thy son\r\nDhanajaya will, with his brothers, perform three grand sacrifices.' I do\r\nnot doubt the truth of that announcement. I bow unto Dharma that upholds\r\nthe creation. If Dharma be not a myth, then, O Krishna, thou wilt surely\r\nachieve all that the invisible voice said. Neither the loss of my\r\nhusband, O Madhava, nor loss of wealth, nor our hostility with the Kurus\r\never inflicted such rending pains on me as that separation from my\r\nchildren. What peace can my heart know when I do not see before me that\r\nwielder of Gandiva, viz., Dhananjaya, that foremost of all bearers of\r\narms? I have not, for fourteen years, O Govinda, seen Yudhishthira, and\r\nDhananjaya, and Vrikodara. Men perform the obsequies of those that are\r\nmissed for a long time, taking them for dead. Practically, O Janardana,\r\nmy children are all dead to me and I am dead to them.\r\n\r\n'Say unto the virtuous king Yudhishthira, O Madhava, that-Thy virtue, O\r\nson, is daily decreasing. Act thou, therefore, in such a way that thy\r\nreligious merit may not diminish. Fie to them that live, O Janardana, by\r\ndependence on others. Even death is better than a livelihood gained by\r\nmeanness. Thou must also say unto Dhananjaya and the ever-ready Vrikodara\r\nthat--The time for that event is come in view of which a Kshatriya woman\r\nbringeth forth a son. If you allow the time slip without your achieving\r\nanything, then, though at present ye are respected by all the world, ye\r\nwill be only doing that which would be regarded as contemptible. And if\r\ncontempt touches you, I will abandon you for ever. When the time cometh,\r\neven life, which is so dear, should be laid down, O foremost of men, thou\r\nmust also say unto Madri's sons that are always devoted to Kshatriya\r\ncustoms.--More than life itself, strive ye to win objects of enjoyment,\r\nprocurable by prowess, since objects won by prowess alone can please the\r\nheart of a person desirous of living according to Kshatriya customs.\r\nRepairing thither, O mighty-armed one, say unto that foremost of all\r\nbearers of arms, Arjuna the heroic son of Pandu,--Tread thou the path\r\nthat may be pointed out to thee by Draupadi. It is known to thee, O\r\nKesava, that when inflamed with rage, Bhima and Arjuna, each like unto\r\nthe universal Destroyer himself, can slay the very gods. That was a great\r\ninsult offered unto them, viz., that their wife Krishna, having been\r\ndragged into the assembly was addressed in such humiliating terms by\r\nDussasana and Karna. Duryodhana himself hath insulted Bhima of mighty\r\nenergy in the very presence of the Kuru chiefs. I am sure he will reap\r\nthe fruit of that behaviour, for Vrikodara, provoked by a foe, knoweth no\r\npeace. Indeed, once provoked, Bhima forgets it not for a long while, even\r\nuntil that grinder of foes exterminates the enemy and his allies. The\r\nloss of kingdom did not grieve me; the defeat at dice did not grieve me.\r\nThat the illustrious and beautiful princess of Panchala was dragged into\r\nthe assembly while clad in a single raiment and made to hear bitter words\r\ngrieved me most. What, O Krishna, could be a greater grief to me? Alas,\r\never devoted to Kshatriya customs and endued with great beauty, the\r\nprincess, while ill, underwent that cruel treatment, and though\r\npossessing powerful protectors was then as helpless as if she had none. O\r\nslayer of Madhu, having thee and that foremost of all mighty persons,\r\nRama, and that mighty car-warrior Pradyumna for me and my children's\r\nprotectors and having, O foremost of men, my sons the invincible Bhima\r\nand the unretreating Vijaya both alive, that I had still such grief to\r\nbear is certainly strange!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by her, Sauri the friend of\r\nPartha, then comforted his paternal aunt, Pritha, afflicted with grief on\r\naccount of her sons. And Vasudeva said, 'What woman is there, O aunt, in\r\nthe world who is like thee? The daughter of king Surasena, thou art, by\r\nmarriage, admitted into Ajamida's race. High-born and highly married,\r\nthou art like a lotus transplanted from one mighty lake into another.\r\nEndued with every prosperity and great good fortune, thou wert adored by\r\nthy husband. The wife of hero, thou hast again given birth to heroic\r\nsons. Possessed of every virtue, and endued with great wisdom, it\r\nbehoveth thee to bear with patience, both happiness and misery.\r\nOvercoming sleep and langour, and wrath and joy, and hunger and thirst,\r\nand cold and heat, thy children are always in the enjoyment of that\r\nhappiness, which, as heroes, should by theirs. Endued with great exertion\r\nand great might, thy sons, without affecting the comforts derivable from\r\nthe senses such as satisfy only the low and the mean, always pursue that\r\nhappiness which as heroes they should. Nor are they satisfied like little\r\nmen having mean desires. They that are wise enjoy or suffer the same of\r\nwhatever enjoyable or sufferable, Indeed, ordinary persons, affecting\r\ncomforts that satisfy the low and the mean, desire an equable state of\r\ndullness, without excitement of any kind. They, however, that are\r\nsuperior, desire either the acutest of human suffering or the highest of\r\nall enjoyments that is given to man. The wise always delight in extremes.\r\nThey find no pleasure betwixt; they regard the extreme to be happiness,\r\nwhile that which lies between is regarded by them as misery. The Pandavas\r\nwith Krishna saluteth thee through me. Representing themselves to be\r\nwell, they have enquired after thy welfare. Thou wilt soon behold them\r\nbecome the lords of the whole world, with their foe slain, and themselves\r\ninvested with prosperity.'\r\n\r\n'Thus consoled by Krishna, Kunti, afflicted with grief on account of her\r\nsons, but soon dispelling the darkness caused by her temporary loss of\r\nunderstanding, replied unto Janardana, saying, 'Whatever, O mighty-armed\r\none, thou, O slayer of Madhu, regardest as proper to be done, let that be\r\ndone without sacrificing righteousness, O chastiser of foes, and without\r\nthe least guile. I know, O Krishna, what the power of thy truth and of\r\nthy lineage is. I know also what judgment and what prowess thou bringest\r\nto bear upon the accomplishment of whatever concerns thy friends. In our\r\nrace, thou art Virtue's self, thou art Truth, and thou art the embodiment\r\nof ascetic austerities. Thou art the great Brahma, and everything rests\r\non thee. What, therefore, thou hast said must be true.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Bidding her farewell and respectfully walking\r\nround her, the mighty-armed Govinda then departed for Duryodhana's\r\nmansion.'\""

Unobstructed by\r\nthe orderlies-in-waiting, that hero of great fame crossed three spacious\r\nyards in succession and then entered that mansion looking like a mass of\r\nclouds, high as the summit of a hill, and blazing forth in splendour. And\r\nhe there beheld Dhritarashtra's son of mighty arms seated on his throne\r\nin the midst of a thousand kings and surrounded by all the Kurus. And he\r\nalso beheld there Dussasana and Karna and Sakuni, the son of Suvala,\r\nseated on their respective seats by the side of Duryodhana. And on that\r\nscion of Dasarha's race entering the court, Dhritarashtra's son of great\r\nfame rose up from his seat with his counsellors for honouring the slayer\r\nof Madhu. And Kesava then greeted Dhritarashtra's sons and all his\r\ncounsellors as also all the kings that were present there, according to\r\ntheir respective ages. And Achyuta of Vrishni's race then took his seat\r\non a beautiful seat made of gold and overlaid with carpet embroidered\r\nwith gold. And the Kuru king then offered unto Janardana a cow, and honey\r\nand curds and water, and placed at his service palaces and mansions and\r\nthe whole kingdom. And then the Kauravas, with all the kings there\r\npresent, worshipped Govinda on his seat and resembling the sun himself in\r\nsplendour. The worship being over, king Duryodhana invited him of\r\nVrishni's race--that foremost of victors--to eat at his house, Kesava,\r\nhowever did not accept the invitation. The Kuru king Duryodhana seated in\r\nthe midst of the Kurus, in a gentle voice but with deception lurking\r\nbehind his words, eyeing Karna, and addressing Kesava, then said, 'Why, O\r\nJanardana, dost thou not accept the diverse kinds of viands and drinks,\r\nrobes and beds that have all been prepared and kept ready for thee? Thou\r\nhast granted aid to both sides; thou art engaged in the good of both\r\nparties. Thou art again the foremost of Dhritarashtra's relations and\r\nmuch loved by him. Thou, O Govinda, also knowest fully, and all things in\r\ndetails, both religion and profit. I, therefore, desire to hear, O bearer\r\nof the discus and the mace, what the true reason is of this thy refusal.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'The high-souled Govinda, of eyes like lotus\r\nleaves, then raising his mighty (right) arm, and in a voice deep as that\r\nof the clouds, replied unto the king in excellent words fraught with\r\nreasons,--words that were clear, distinct, correctly pronounced, and\r\nwithout a single letter dropped, saying, 'Envoys, O king, eat and accept\r\nworship only after the success of their missions. Therefore, O Bharata,\r\nafter my mission becomes successful, thou mayest entertain me and my\r\nattendants.' Thus answered, Dhritarashtra's son again said unto\r\nJanardana, It behoveth thee not, O Kesava, to behave towards us in this\r\nway, Whether thou becomest successful, or unsuccessful, we are\r\nendeavouring to please thee, O slayer of Madhu, because of thy\r\nrelationship with us. It seems, however, that all our efforts. O thou of\r\nDasarha's race, are fruitless. Nor do we see the reason, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, in consequence of which, O foremost of men, thou acceptest not the\r\nworship offered by us from love and friendship. With thee, O Govinda, we\r\nhave no hostility, no war. Therefore, on reflection, it will seem to thee\r\nthat words such as these scarcely become thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the king, Janardana of\r\nDasarha's race, casting his eyes on Dhritarashtra's son and ah his\r\ncounsellors, replied, saying, 'Not from desire, nor from wrath, nor from\r\nmalice, nor for gain, nor for the sake of argument, nor from temptation,\r\nwould I abandon virtue. One taketh another's food when one is in\r\ndistress. At present, however, O king, thou hast not inspired love in me\r\nby any act of thine, nor have I myself been plunged into distress.\r\nWithout any reason, O king, thou hatest, from the moment of their birth,\r\nthy dear and gentle brothers,--the Pandavas--endued with every virtue.\r\nThis unreasonable hatred of thine for the sons of Pritha ill becometh\r\nthee. The sons of Pandu are all devoted to virtue. Who, indeed, can do\r\nthem the least injury? He that hateth them, hateth me; he that loveth\r\nthem, loveth me. Know that the virtuous Pandavas and my own self have but\r\na common soul. He, who, following the impulses of lust and wrath, and\r\nfrom darkness of soul, hateth and seeketh to injure one that is possessed\r\nof every good quality, is regarded as the vilest of men. That wrathful\r\nwretch of every good quality, is regarded as the vilest of men. That\r\nwrathful wretch of uncontrolled soul, who, from ignorance and avarice\r\nhateth his kinsmen endued with every auspicious quality, can never enjoy\r\nhis prosperity long. He, on the other hand, who, by good offices, winneth\r\nover persons endued with good qualities, even if he beareth aversion of\r\nthem within his heart, enjoyeth prosperity and fame for ever and ever.\r\nDefiled by wickedness, all this food, therefore, deserveth not to be\r\neaten by me. The food supplied by Vidura alone, should, I think, be eaten\r\nby me.'\r\n\r\n'Having said this unto Duryodhana who was ever incapable of bearing\r\nanything against his own wishes, Kesava of mighty arms then came out of\r\nthat blazing palace of Dhritarashtra's son. And the high-souled Vasudeva\r\nof mighty arms, coming out of that mansion, directed his steps towards\r\nthe abode of the illustrious Vidura. And while that mighty-armed one\r\nstaying within Vidura's abode, thither came unto him Drona, and Kripa,\r\nand Bhishma, and Vahlika, and many of the Kauravas. And the Kauravas that\r\ncame there addressed Madhava, the heroic slayer of Madhu, saying, 'O thou\r\nof Vrishni's race, we place at thy disposal our houses with all the\r\nwealth within them.'\r\n\r\n'The slayer of Madhu, of mighty energy, answered them saying, 'Ye may go\r\naway. I am much honoured by these your offers.' And after all the Kurus\r\nhad gone away, Vidura, with great care entertained that unvanquished hero\r\nof Dasarha's race with every object of desire. And Kunti then placed\r\nbefore the illustrious Kesava clean and savoury food in abundance.\r\nTherewith the slayer of Madhu first gratified the Brahmanas. Indeed, from\r\nthat food he first gave a portion, along with much wealth, unto a number\r\nof Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas, and then with his attendants,\r\nlike Vasava in the midst of the Marutas, he dined on what remained of the\r\nclean and savoury food supplied by Vidura.'\""

He is, O Madhava, a transgressor of\r\nthe scriptures, ignorant, and of wicked soul, already overtaken by fate,\r\nuntractable, and disposed to do evil to those that seek his good. His\r\nsoul is possessed by desire and lust. He foolishly regardeth himself as\r\nvery wise. He is the enemy of all his true friends. Ever-suspicious,\r\nwithout any control over his soul, and ungrateful, he hath abandoned all\r\nvirtue and is in love with sin. He is foolish, with understanding\r\nuncultivated, a slave of his senses, ever obedient to the impulses of\r\nlust and avarice, and irresolute in every act that should be done. He is\r\nendued with these and many other vices. Although thou wilt point out to\r\nhim what is for his good, he will yet disregard it all, moved by pride\r\nand anger. He hath great faith in Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and\r\nKarna, and Drona's son, and Jayadratha, and, therefore, he never setteth\r\nhis heart on peace, O Janardana. Dhritarashtra's sons, with Karna, firmly\r\nbelieve that the Pandavas are incapable of even looking at Bhishma,\r\nDrona, and other heroes, not to speak of fighting against them. The\r\nfoolish Duryodhana of limited sight, having assembled a huge army\r\nregardeth, O slayer of Madhu, that his purposes are already achieved. The\r\nfoolish son of Dhritarashtra hath arrived at the conclusion that Karna,\r\nsingle-handed, is competent to vanquish his foes. He will, therefore,\r\nnever make peace. Thou, O Kesava, desirest to establish peace and\r\nbrotherly feelings between the two parties. But know that all the sons of\r\nDhritarashtra have come to the conclusion that they would not give unto\r\nthe Pandavas what, indeed, the latter have a right to. With those that\r\nare so resolved thy words will certainly prove vain. Where, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, words, good or bad, are of the same effect, no wise man would\r\nspend his breath for nothing, like a singer before the deaf. As a\r\nBrahmana before a conclave of Chandalas, thy words, O Madhava, would\r\ncommand no respect among those ignorant and wicked wretches that have no\r\nreverence for all that deserveth reverence. Foolish, as long as he hath\r\nstrength, he will never obey thy counsels. Whatever words thou mayest\r\nspeak to him will be perfectly futile. It doth not seem proper to me, O\r\nKrishna, that thou shouldst go into the midst of these wicked-minded\r\nwretches seated together. It doth not seem proper to me, O Krishna, that\r\ngoing thither thou shouldst utter words against those wicked-souled,\r\nfoolish, unrighteous wights, strong in number. In consequence of their\r\nhaving never worshipped the aged, in consequence of their having been\r\nblinded by prosperity and pride, and owing to the pride of youth and\r\nwrath, they will never accept the good advice thou mayest place before\r\nthem. He hath mustered a strong force, O Madhava, and he hath his\r\nsuspicions of thyself. He will, therefore, never obey any counsel that\r\nthou mayest offer. The sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana, are inspired\r\nwith the firm belief that at present Indra himself, at the head of all\r\nthe celestials, is incapable of defeating them in battle. Efficacious as\r\nthy words always are, they will prove to be of no efficacy with persons\r\nimpressed with such a conviction and who always follow the impulses of\r\nlust and wrath. Staying in the midst of his ranks of elephants and his\r\narmy consisting of cars and heroic infantry, the foolish and wicked\r\nDuryodhana, with all fears dispelled, regardeth the whole earth to have\r\nalready been subjugated by him. Indeed, Dhritarashtra's son coveteth\r\nextensive empire on the earth without any rivals. Peace, therefore, with\r\nhim is unattainable. That which he hath in his possession he regardeth as\r\nunalterably his. Alas, the destruction on the earth seems to be at hand\r\nfor the sake of Duryodhana, for, impelled by fate, the kings of the\r\nearth, with all the Kshatriya warriors, have assembled together, desirous\r\nof battling with the Pandavas? All those kings, O Krishna, are in enmity\r\nwith thee and have all been deprived of their possessions before this by\r\nthee. Through fear of thee those heroic monarchs have joined together\r\nwith Karna and made an alliance with Dhritarashtra's sons. Reckless of\r\ntheir very lives, all those warriors have united with Duryodhana and are\r\nfilled with delight at the prospect of fighting the Pandavas. O hero of\r\nDasarha's race, it doth not commend itself to me that thou shouldst enter\r\ninto their midst. How, O grinder of foes, wilt thou repair into the midst\r\nof those numerous enemies of thine, of wicked souls, and seated together?\r\nO thou of mighty arms, thou art, indeed, incapable of being vanquished by\r\nthe very gods, and I know, O slayer of foes, thy manliness and\r\nintelligence. O Madhava, the love I bear to thee is equal to that I bear\r\nto the sons of Pandu. I say, therefore, these words to thee from my\r\naffection, regard, and friendship for thee. What need is there in\r\nexpressing to thee the delight that has been mine at sight of thy\r\npersons, for, thou, O thou of eyes like lotus, art the inner Soul of all\r\nembodied creatures.'\""

That which thou hast told me is\r\ncertainly true, worthy of approbation and consistent with reason. Listen,\r\nhowever, with attention, O Vidura, to the reason of my coming. Well\r\nknowing the wickedness of Dhritarashtra's son and the hostility of the\r\nKshatriyas that have sided with him. I have still, O Vidura, come to the\r\nKurus. Great will be the merit earned by him who will liberate from the\r\nmeshes of death the whole earth, with her elephants, cars and steeds,\r\noverwhelmed with a dreadful calamity. If a man striving to the best of\r\nhis abilities to perform a virtuous act meets with failure, I have not\r\nthe least doubt that the merit of that act becomes his, notwithstanding\r\nsuch failure. This also is known to those that are conversant with\r\nreligion and scripture, that if a person having intended mentally to\r\ncommit a sinful act does not actually commit it, the demerit of that act\r\ncan never be his. I will sincerely endeavour, O Vidura, to bring about\r\npeace between the Kurus and the Srinjayas who are about to be slaughtered\r\nin battle. That terrible calamity (which hangs over them all) hath its\r\norigin in the conduct of the Kurus, for it is directly due to the action\r\nof Duryodhana and Karna, the other Kshatriyas only following the lead of\r\nthese two. The learned regard him to be a wretch who doth not by his\r\nsolicitation seek to save a friend who is about to sink in calamity.\r\nStriving to the best of his might, even to the extent of seizing him by\r\nthe hair, one should seek to dissuade a friend from an improper act. In\r\nthat case, he that acteth so, instead of incurring blame, reapeth praise.\r\nIt behoveth Dhritarashtra's son, therefore, O Vidura, with his\r\ncounsellors, to accept my good and beneficial counsels that are\r\nconsistent with virtue and profit and competent to dispel the present\r\ncalamity. I will, therefore, sincerely endeavour to bring about the good\r\nof Dhritarashtra's sons and of the Pandavas, as also of all the\r\nKshatriyas on the face of the earth. If while endeavouring to bring about\r\nthe good (of my friends), Duryodhana judgeth me wrongly, I shall have the\r\nsatisfaction of my own conscience, and a true friend is one who assumeth\r\nthe functions of an intercessor when dissensions break out between\r\nkinsmen. In order, again, that unrighteous, foolish, and inimical persons\r\nmay not afterwards say that though competent, still Krishna did not make\r\nany attempt to restrain the angry Kurus and the Pandavas from\r\nslaughtering one another I have come here. Indeed, it is to serve both\r\nparties that I have come hither. Having striven to bring about peace, I\r\nwill escape the censure of all the kings. If after listening to my\r\nauspicious words, fraught with virtue and profit, the foolish Duryodhana\r\naccept them not, he will only invite his fate. If without sacrificing the\r\ninterests of the Pandavas I can bring about peace among the Kurus, my\r\nconduct will be regarded as highly meritorious, O high-souled one, and\r\nthe Kauravas themselves will be liberated from the meshes of death. If\r\nthe sons of Dhritarashtra reflect coolly on the words I shall\r\nutter--words fraught with wisdom, consistent with righteousness, and\r\npossessed of grave import,--then that peace which is my object will be\r\nbrought about and the Kauravas will also worship me (as the agent\r\nthereof). If, on the other hand, they seek to injure me, I tell thee that\r\nall the kings of the earth; united together, are no match for me, like a\r\nherd of deer incapable of standing before an enraged lion.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, that bull of the\r\nVrishni race and delighter of Yadavas, then laid himself down on his soft\r\nbed for sleep.'\""

Indeed, the night passed away against\r\nthe wishes of the illustrious Vidura, who had been listening to the\r\nvaried conversation of Krishna fraught with virtue, profit, and desire,\r\nand made up of delightful words and syllables of agreeable import; and\r\nalso those of Krishna himself, of 'immeasurable prowess, listening to\r\ndiscourses equal in style and character. Then, at early dawn a band of\r\nchoristers and bards gifted with melodious voices, awoke Kesava with\r\nsweet sounds of conchs and cymbals. And rising from bed, Janardana of\r\nDasarha's race, that bull amongst all the Sattwatas, went through all the\r\ncustomary acts of the morning. And having cleansed himself by a bath,\r\nrecited the sacred Mantras and poured libations of clarified butter on\r\nthe sacrificial fire. Madhava decked his person and began to worship the\r\nrising sun. And while the unvanquished Krishna of Dasarha's race was\r\nstill engaged in his morning devotions, Duryodhana and Suvala's son\r\nSakuni came to him and said, 'Dhritarashtra is seated in his court, with\r\nall the Kurus headed by Bhishma and with all the kings of the earth. They\r\nare all soliciting thy presence, O Govinda, like the celestials in heaven\r\ndesiring the presence of Sakra himself,--thus addressed, Govinda greeted\r\nthem both with sweet and courteous enquiries. And when the sun had risen\r\na little higher, Janardana, that chastiser of foes, summoning a number of\r\nBrahmanas, made them presents of gold and robes and kine and steeds.\r\n\r\nAnd after he had thus given away much wealth and taken his seat, his\r\ndriver (Daruka) came and saluted that unvanquished hero of Dasarha's\r\nrace. And Daruka soon returned with his master's large and blazing car\r\nfurnished with rows of tinkling bells and harnessed with excellent\r\nsteeds. And understanding that his handsome car adorned with every\r\nornament and producing a rattle, deep as the rumbling of the mighty\r\nmasses of clouds, was ready, the high-souled Janardana, that delighter of\r\nall the Yadavas, walking round the sacred fire and a band of Brahmanas,\r\nand putting on the gem known by the name of Kaustubha, and blazing with\r\nbeauty, surrounded by the Kurus, and well-protected by the Vrishnis,\r\nmounted on it. And Vidura, conversant with all the precepts of religion,\r\nfollowed on his own car that scion of Dasarha's race, that foremost of\r\nall living creatures, that first of all persons gifted with intelligence.\r\nAnd Duryodhana and Suvala's son Sakuni also, on one car followed Krishna,\r\nthat chastiser of foes. And Satyaki and Kritavarman and the other mighty\r\ncar-warriors of the Vrishni race, all rode behind Krishna on cars and\r\nsteeds and elephants. And, O king, the handsome cars of those heroes,\r\nadorned with gold and drawn by excellent steeds and each producing a loud\r\nrattle, as they moved forward, shone brilliantly. And Kesava, endued with\r\ngreat intelligence, and beaming with beauty, soon came upon a broad\r\nstreet that had previously been swept and watered, and that was fit to be\r\nused by the highest of kings. And when that scion of Dasarha's race set\r\nout, cymbals began to play, and conchs began to be blown, and other\r\ninstruments also to pour forth their music. And great number of youthful\r\nheroes, foremost in the world for heroism, and possessed of lion-like\r\nprowess, proceeded, surrounding Sauri's car. And many thousands of\r\nsoldiers, attired in a variegated dresses, bearing swords and lances and\r\naxes, marched in advance of Kesava. And there were full five hundred\r\nelephants, and cars by thousands, that followed that unvanquished hero of\r\nDasarha's race while he proceeded. And, O chastiser of foes, all the\r\ncitizens of the capital, of all ages and both sexes, desirous of\r\nbeholding Janardana came out into the streets. And the terraces and\r\nbalconies of the houses were so thronged by ladies that the houses were\r\non the point of falling down with the weight. And worshipped by the\r\nKurus, and listening to various sweet speeches, and returning the\r\ngreetings of all as each deserved, Kesava went along the street, casting\r\nhis eyes on all. And at last, when Kesava reached the Kuru court, his\r\nattendants loudly blew their conchs and trumpets and filled the welkin\r\nwith that blare. And, thereupon, that whole assembly of kings, of\r\nimmeasurable prowess, trembled with delight at the expectation of soon\r\nsetting their eyes on Krishna. And hearing the rattle of his car, that\r\nrumbled like the deep roll of rain-charged clouds, the monarchs\r\nunderstood Krishna to be near, and the hair of their bodies stood erect\r\nwith delight. And having reached the gate of the court, Sauri, that bull\r\namong the Satwatas, alighting from his car, that resembled the summit of\r\nKailasa, entered the court which looked like a mass of newly-risen\r\nclouds, and blazed forth with beauty, and resembled the very abode of the\r\ngreat Indra. And that illustrious hero entered the court, arm-in-arm with\r\nVidura and Satyaki on either side, and overshadowing with his own the\r\nsplendour of all the Kurus, like the sun overshadowing the radiance of\r\nlesser lights in the firmament. And before Vasudeva sat Karna and\r\nDuryodhana, while behind him were seated the Vrishnis with Kritavarman.\r\nAnd Bhishma and Drona, and others with Dhritarashtra were on the point of\r\nrising up from their seats for honouring Janardana. Indeed, as soon as\r\nhe, of Dasarha's race, came, the illustrious blind monarch, Drona and\r\nBhishma, all rose up from their seats. And when that mighty ruler of men,\r\nking Dhritarashtra, rose up from his seat, those kings by thousands\r\naround him all rose up also. And at Dhritarashtra's command, a seat\r\nbeautiful all over, and adorned with gold, had been kept there for\r\nKrishna, And after taking his seat, Madhava smilingly greeted the king,\r\nand Bhishma, and Drona, and all other rulers, each according to his age.\r\nAnd all the kings of the earth, and all the Kurus also, beholding Kesava\r\narrived in that assembly, worshipped him duly. And as that chastiser of\r\nfoes, that vanquisher of hostile cities, that hero of Dasarha's race, was\r\nseated there, he beheld the Rishis whom he had seen while proceeding to\r\nHastinapur, staying in the firmament. And beholding those Rishis with\r\nNarada at their head, he of Dasarha's race, slowly addressed Bhishma the\r\nson of Santanu, saying, 'O king, the Rishis have come to see this earthly\r\nconclave of ours. Invite them with offer of seats and abundant courtesy,\r\nfor if they are not seated, no one here is capable of taking his seat.\r\nLet proper worship, therefore, be speedily offered unto these Rishis with\r\nsouls under proper control. And beholding the Rishis then at the gate of\r\nthe palace, Santanu's son quickly ordered the servants to bring seats for\r\nthem. And soon enough they brought large and beautiful seats embroidered\r\nwith gold and set with gems. And after the Rishis. O Bharata, had taken\r\ntheir seats and accepted the Arghyas offered to them, Krishna took his\r\nseat, so also all the kings. And Dussasana gave an excellent seat to\r\nSatyaki, while Vivingsati gave another golden one to Kritavarman. And not\r\nfar from where Krishna sat, that illustrious and wrathful pair, Karna and\r\nDuryodhana, sat together on the same seat. And Sakuni, the king of\r\nGandhara, surrounded by the chiefs of his country, sat there, O king,\r\nwith his son beside him. And the high-souled Vidura sat on a begemmed\r\nseat covered with a white deer-skin that almost touched Krishna's seat.\r\nAnd all the kings in the assembly, although they gazed at Janardana of\r\nDasarha's race for a long while, were not, however, gratified with their\r\ngaze, like drinkers of the Amrita, that are never satiated with quaffing\r\nmeasure after measure. And Janardana attired in yellow robes having the\r\ncomplexion of the Atasi flower, sat in the midst of that assembly like a\r\nsapphire mounted on gold. And after Govinda had taken his seat, a perfect\r\nsilence ensued, for none present there spoke a single word.'\""

And Madhava although he addressed\r\nDhritarashtra, spoke in a voice deep as the roll of clouds in the rainy\r\nseason, making the whole assembly hear. And he said, 'In order that, O\r\nBharata, peace may be established between the Kurus and the Pandavas\r\nwithout a slaughter of the heroes, I have come hither. Besides this, O\r\nking, I have no other beneficial words to utter, O chastiser of foes,\r\neverything that should be learnt in this world is already known to thee.\r\nThis thy race, O king, owing to its learning and behaviour, and owing\r\nalso to its being adorned with every accomplishment, is most\r\ndistinguished among all royal dynasties. Joy in the happiness of others,\r\ngrief at sight of other people's misery, desire to alleviate distress,\r\nabstention from injury, sincerity, forgiveness, and truth,--these, O\r\nBharata, prevail amongst the Kurus. Then thy race, therefore, O king, is\r\nso noble, it would be a pity if anything improper were done by any one\r\nbelonging to it, and greater pity still if it were done by thee. O chief\r\nof the Kurus, thou art the first of those that should restrain the Kurus\r\nif they behave deceitfully towards strangers or those numbering with\r\nthemselves. Know, O thou of Kuru's race, that those wicked sons of thine,\r\nheaded by Duryodhana, abandoning both virtue and profit, disregarding\r\nmorality, and deprived of their senses by avarice, are now acting most\r\nunrighteously towards, O bull of men, their foremost of kinsmen. That\r\nterrible danger (which threatens all) hath its origin in the conduct of\r\nthe Kurus. If thou becomest indifferent to it, it will then produce a\r\nuniversal slaughter. If, O Bharata, thou art willing, thou mayest be able\r\nto allay that danger even yet, for, O bull of Bharata's race, peace, I\r\nthink, is not difficult of acquisition. The establishment of peace, O\r\nking, depends on thee and myself, O monarch. Set right thy sons, O thou\r\nof Kuru's race, and I will set the Pandavas right. Whatever be thy\r\ncommand, O king, it behoveth thy sons with their followers to obey it. If\r\nagain they live in obedience to thee, that would be the very best they\r\ncould do. If thou strivest for peace by restraining thy sons, it will be\r\nto thy profit, O king, as also to the benefit of the Pandavas. Having\r\nreflected carefully, act thou thyself, O king. Let those sons of Bharata\r\n(the Pandavas), be, O ruler of men, thy allies. Supported by the\r\nPandavas, O king, seek thou both religion and profit. By every exertion\r\nin thy power, thou canst not have, O king, such allies as they who are\r\nsuch. Protected by the illustrious sons of Pandu, Indra himself at the\r\nhead of the celestials will not be able to vanquish thee. How would it be\r\npossible then for mere earthly kings to withstand thy prowess? If with\r\nBhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and Vivingsati, and\r\nAswatthaman, Vikarna, and Somadatta, and Vahlika and the chief of the\r\nSindhus, and the ruler of the Kalingas, and Sudakshina, the king of the\r\nKamvojas, there were Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena and Savyasachin, and the\r\ntwins, and if Satyaki of mighty energy, and Yuyutsu, that mighty car\r\nwarrior, are stationed, who is there, O bull of Bharata's race, of such\r\nmisdirected intelligence that would fight these? If, O slayer of foes,\r\nthou hast both the Kurus and the Pandavas at thy back, the sovereignty of\r\nthe whole world and invincibility before all foes will be thine. All the\r\nrulers of the earth, O monarch, that are either equal to thee or\r\nsuperior, will then seek alliance with thee. Protected on all sides by\r\nsons, grandsons, fathers, brothers, and friends, thou wilt then be able\r\nto live in exceeding happiness. Keeping these before thee and treating\r\nthem with kindness as in days of yore, thou, O monarch, wilt enjoy the\r\nsovereignty of the whole earth. With these as thy supporters and with the\r\nsons of Pandu also, thou wilt, O Bharata, be able to conquer all thy\r\nfoes. Even this is thy best advantage. If, O chastiser of foes, thou art\r\nunited with thy sons and kinsmen and counsellors, thou wilt' enjoy\r\nsovereignty of the whole earth won for thee by them. In battle, O great\r\nking, nothing but wholesale destruction is visible. Indeed, in the\r\ndestruction of both the parties, what merit dost thou see? If the\r\nPandavas are slaughtered in battle, or if thy own mighty sons fall, tell\r\nme, O bull of Bharata's race, what happiness wilt thou enjoy? All of them\r\nare brave and skilled in weapons. All of them are desirous of battle, the\r\nPandavas as also thy sons. Oh, save them from the terrible danger that\r\nthreatens them. After the battle thou wilt not behold all the Kurus or\r\nall the Pandavas, Car-warriors slain by car-warriors, thou wilt behold\r\nthe heroes of both parties reduced in numbers and strength. All the\r\nrulers of the earth, O best of kings, have been assembled together.\r\nInflamed with wrath, they will certainly exterminate the population of\r\nthe earth. Save, O king, the world. Let not the population of the earth\r\nbe exterminated. O son of Kuru's race, if thou regainest thy natural\r\ndisposition, the earth may continue to be peopled as now. Save, O king,\r\nthese monarchs, who are all of pure descent, endued with modesty and\r\nliberality and piety, and connected with on another in bonds of\r\nrelationship or alliance, from the terrible danger that threatens them.\r\nAbandoning wrath and enmity, O chastiser of foes, let these kings,\r\nembracing one another in peace, eating and drinking with one another,\r\ndressed in excellent robes and decked with garlands, and doing courtesies\r\nto one another, return to their respective homes. Let the affection thou\r\nhadst for the Pandavas be revived in thy bosom, and let it, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, lead to the establishment of peace. Deprived of their\r\nfather while they were infants, they were brought up by thee. Cherish\r\nthem now as becomes thee, O bull of Bharata's race, as if they were thy\r\nown sons. It is thy duty to protect them. And especially it is so when\r\nthey are distressed. O bull of Bharata's race, let not thy virtue and\r\nprofit be both lost. Saluting and propitiating thee, the Pandavas have\r\nsaid unto thee, 'At thy command we have, with our followers, suffered\r\ngreat misery. For these twelve years have we lived in the woods, and for\r\nthe thirteenth year have we lived incognito in an uninhabited part of the\r\nworld. We broke not our pledge, firmly believing that our father also\r\nwould abide by his. That we violated not our word is well-known to the\r\nBrahman as who were with us. And as we, O bull of the Bharata race, have\r\nabided by our promise, also do thou abide by thine. Long have we suffered\r\nthe greatest misery, but let us now have our share of the kingdom. Fully\r\nconversant as thou art with virtue and profit, it behoveth thee to rescue\r\nus. Knowing that our obedience is due to thee, we have quietly undergone\r\nmuch misery. Behave thou then unto us like a father or brother. A\r\npreceptor should behave as a preceptor towards his disciples, and as\r\ndisciples we are willing to behave as such towards thee, our preceptor.\r\nAct thou, therefore, towards us as a preceptor should. If we go wrong, it\r\nis the duty of our father to set us right. Therefore, set us on the way\r\nand tread thou also the excellent path of righteousness.' Those sons of\r\nthine, O bull of the Bharata race, have also said unto these kings\r\nassembled in the court these words, 'If the members of an assembly are\r\nconversant with morality, nothing improper should be permitted by them to\r\nhappen. Where, in the presence of the virtuous members of an assembly,\r\nrighteousness is sought to be overpowered by unrighteousness, and truth\r\nby the untruth, it is those members themselves that are vanquished and\r\nslain. When righteousness, pierced by unrighteousness, seeketh the\r\nprotection of an assembly, if the arrow is not extracted, it is the\r\nmembers themselves that are pierced by that arrow. Indeed, in that case,\r\nrighteousness slayeth the members of that assembly, like a river eating\r\naway the roots of the trees on its bank.' Judge now, O bull of the\r\nBharata race. The Pandavas, with their eyes turned towards righteousness\r\nand reflecting on everything, are maintaining a calm attitude, and what\r\nthey have said is consistent with truth and virtue and justice. O ruler\r\nof men, what canst thou say unto them, but that thou art willing to give\r\nthem back their kingdom? Let these rulers of earth that are sitting here\r\nsay (what the answer should be)! If it appears to thee that what I have\r\nsaid after reflecting well on virtue to be true, save all these\r\nKshatriyas, O bull of the Bharata race, from the meshes of death. Effect\r\npeace, O chief of Bharata's race, and yield not to anger. Giving unto the\r\nPandavas their just share of the paternal kingdom, enjoy thou then, with\r\nthy sons, O chastiser of foes, happiness and luxury, thy wishes being all\r\ncrowned with success. Know that Yudhishthira always treadeth the path\r\nthat is trod by the righteous. Thou knowest also, O king, what the\r\nbehaviour of Yudhishthira is towards thee and thy sons. Although thou\r\nhadst sought to burn him to death and hadst exiled him from human\r\nhabitation, yet he came back and once more repose confidence in thee.\r\nAgain, didst thou with thy sons, banish him to Indraprastha? While there,\r\nhe brought all the kings of the earth to subjection and yet looked up to\r\nthy face, O king, without seeking to disregard thee. Although he behaved\r\nin this way, yet Suvala's son, desirous of robbing him of his dominions\r\nand wealth and possessions, applied the very efficacious means of dice.\r\nReduced to that condition and even beholding Krishna dragged into the\r\nassembly, Yudhishthira of immeasurable soul, did not yet swerve from the\r\nduties of a Kshatriya. As regards myself, I desire, O Bharata, thy good\r\nas also theirs. For the sake of virtue, of profit, of happiness, make\r\npeace, O king, and do not allow the Earth's population to be slaughtered,\r\nregarding evil as good and good as evil. Restrain thy sons, O monarch,\r\nwho have from covetousness proceeded too far. As regards the sons of\r\nPritha, they are equally ready to wait upon thee in dutiful service or to\r\nfight. That which, O chastiser of foes, seems to thee to be for thy good,\r\ndo thou adopt!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'All the rulers of earth there present highly\r\napplauded these words of Kesava within their hearts, but none of them\r\nventured to say anything in the presence of Duryodhana.'"

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words uttered by the high-souled\r\nKesava, all the persons who sat in that assembly remained silent, their\r\nhair standing on their ends. And all the kings thought within themselves\r\nthat there was no man who could dare reply to that speech. And seeing\r\nthat all the kings sat silent, Jamadagni's son (addressing Duryodhana)\r\nthen said these words in that assembly of Kurus, 'Listen confidingly to\r\nmy words illustrated by an example, and seek thy own good if my speech\r\nrecommends itself to thee. There was a king of yore named Dambhodbhava,\r\nwho was the Head of the earth. It hath been heard by us that his\r\nsovereignty extended over the whole world. And that mighty car-warrior,\r\nrising every morning after the night had passed away, called the\r\nBrahmanas and the Kshatriyas unto himself and asked them, saying, 'Be he\r\na Sudra, a Vaisya, a Kshatriya, or a Brahmana, is there any one who is\r\nsuperior or even equal to me in battle?' And uttering these words that\r\nking wandered over the earth, intoxicated with pride and thinking of\r\nnothing else. And it so happened that certain Brahmanas endued with high\r\nsouls, conversant with the Vedas, and fearing nothing on earth,\r\ncounselled the monarch, repeatedly boasting of his prowess, to curb his\r\npride. But though forbidden by those Brahmanas to boast in that way, the\r\nking continued to ask the Brahmanas as before the same question day after\r\nday. And some high-souled Brahmanas then, endued with ascetic merit and\r\nacquainted with the proofs furnished by the Vedas, were inflamed with\r\nanger, and addressing that proud and boastful king intoxicated with\r\nprosperity, told him, 'There are two persons who are foremost of all men\r\nand who are always victorious in battle. Thou, O king, wilt by no means\r\nbe equal to them if thou seekest an encounter with any one of them.' And\r\nthus addressed by them, the king asked those Brahmanas, saying, 'Where\r\nmay those two heroes be found? In what race are they born? What feats\r\nhave they achieved? And who are they? And the Brahmanas answered him,\r\nsaying, It had been heard by us that those two persons are ascetics\r\ncalled Nara and Narayana. They have both taken their births in the race\r\nof man. Go and fight with them, O king. It is that illustrious pair, Nara\r\nand Narayana, who are now practising the severest of penances in some\r\nhidden region of the mountains of Gandhamadana.' Hearing those words of\r\nthe Brahmanas, that king speedily mustered his large army consisting of\r\nsix kinds of forces,[7] and unable to bear their reputation, marched to\r\nthe spot where those unvanquished ascetics were, and arrived at the\r\nrugged and frightful mountains of Gandhamadana. He began to search after\r\nthose Rishis, and at last, came upon them concealed within the woods. And\r\nbeholding those two best of persons emaciated with hunger and thirst,\r\ntheir veins swollen and visible, and themselves much afflicted with cold\r\nwinds, and the hot rays of the sun, he approached them, and touching\r\ntheir feet, enquired after their welfare. And the two Rishis received the\r\nking hospitably, with fruits and roots, and a seat and water. And they\r\nthen enquired after the king's business, saying, 'Let it be done.' And\r\nthus addressed by them, the king said unto them the same words that he\r\nwas in the habit of saying unto all. And he said, 'The whole earth has\r\nbeen conquered by the might of my arms. All my foes have been slain.\r\nDesiring a battle with you both I have come to this mountain. Offer me\r\nthis hospitality. I have been cherishing this wish from a long time.'\r\nThus addressed, Nara and Narayana said, 'O best of kings, wrath and\r\ncovetousness have no place in this retreat. How can a battle, therefore,\r\nbe possible here? There are no weapons here, and nothing of\r\nunrighteousness and malice. Seek battle elsewhere. There are many\r\nKshatriyas on earth.'\r\n\r\n\"Rama continued, 'Although thus addressed, the king still pressed them\r\nfor giving him battle. The Rishis, however, continually soothed him and\r\noverlooked his importunity. King Dambhodbhava, still desirous of battle,\r\nrepeatedly summoned those Rishis to fight. Nara, then, O Bharata, taking\r\nup a handful of grass-blades, said, 'Desirous of battle as thou art,\r\ncome, O Kshatriya, and fight! Take up all thy arms, and array thy troops.\r\nI will curb thy eagerness for battle hereafter!' Dambhodbhava then said,\r\nIf, O ascetic, thou thinkest this weapon of thine fit to be used against\r\nus, I shall fight with thee though thou mayest use that weapon, for I\r\nhave come hither desirous of fighting.' Saying this, Dambhodbhava with\r\nall his troops, desirous of slaying that ascetic, covered all sides with\r\na shower of arrows. That ascetic, however, by means of those blades of\r\ngrass, baffled all those terrible shafts of the king that were capable of\r\nmangling the bodies of hostile warriors. The invincible Rishi then let\r\noff towards the king his own terrible weapon made of grass-blades and\r\nwhich was incapable of being counteracted. And highly wonderful was that\r\nwhich happened, for that ascetic, incapable of missing his aim, pierced\r\nand cut off, by those grass-blades alone, the eyes and ears and noses of\r\nthe hostile warriors, aided also by his power of illusion. And beholding\r\nthe entire welkin whitened by those grass-blades, the king fell at the\r\nfeet of the Rishi and said, 'Let me be blessed! Ever inclined to grant\r\nprotection unto those that sought it, Nara then, O king, said unto that\r\nmonarch, 'Be obedient to the Brahmanas and be virtuous. Never do so\r\nagain. O king, O tiger among monarchs, a conqueror of hostile towns, a\r\nKshatriya mindful of the duties of his own or, should never, within even\r\nhis heart, be as thou art. Filled with pride, never insult anybody on any\r\noccasion, be inferior or superior to thee. Even such conduct would befit\r\nthee. Acquiring wisdom, abandoning covetousness and pride, controlling\r\nthy soul, restraining thy passions, practising forgiveness and humility,\r\nand becoming amiable, O king, go, and cherish thy subjects. Without\r\nascertaining the strength and weakness of men, never insult any one under\r\nany circumstances. Blessed be thou, and with our leave, go hence, and\r\nnever again behave in this way. At our command, enquire thou always of\r\nthe Brahmanas as to what is for thy good! The king then, worshipping the\r\nfeet of those two illustrious Rishis, returned to his city, and from that\r\ntime began to practise righteousness. Great indeed, was that feat\r\nachieved of old by Nara. Narayana, again, became superior to Nara in\r\nconsequence of many more qualities. Therefore, O king, besides such\r\nweapons as Kakudika, Suka, Naka, Akshisantarjana, Santana, Nartana,\r\nGhora, and Asyamodaka, are placed on the string of that best of bows\r\ncalled Gandiva, go thou unto Dhananjaya, laying aside thy pride Struck\r\nwith these weapons, men always yield up their lives. Indeed, these\r\nweapons have other means corresponding with the eight passions, such as\r\nlust, wrath, covetousness, vanity, insolence, pride, malice, and\r\nselfishness. Struck with them, men are confounded, and move about\r\nfrantically deprived of their senses. Under their influence, persons\r\nalways sleep heavily, cut capers, vomit, pass urine and excreta, weep,\r\nand laugh incessantly. Indeed, that Arjuna is irresistible in fight, who\r\nhath for his friend Narayana--the Creator and Lord of all the\r\nworlds--fully acquainted with the course of everything. Who is there in\r\nthe three worlds, O Bharata, who would venture to vanquish that hero--the\r\nApe-bannered Jishnu--who hath no equal in battle? Countless are the\r\nvirtues that reside in Partha. Janardana again, is superior to him. Thou\r\nart thyself well-acquainted with Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti. They that\r\nwere Nara and Narayana in days of yore are now Arjuna and Kesava. Know\r\nthen, O great king, who those brave and foremost of persons are. If thou\r\nbelievest in this and dost not mistrust me adopt thou a virtuous\r\nresolution and make peace with the sons of Pandu. If thou regardest this\r\nas thy good, viz., that there should be no disunion in thy family, then\r\nmake peace, O foremost of Bharata's race, and do not set thy heart upon\r\nbattle. O thou, that are foremost of Kuru's line, the race to which thou\r\nbelongest is highly regarded on earth. Let that regard continue to be\r\npaid to it. Blessed be thou, think of what conduces to thy own welfare.'\""

Those illustrious Rishis, Nara and Narayana, are of the same\r\ncharacter. Of all the sons of Aditi, Vishnu alone is eternal. He alone is\r\nunconquerable and indestructible, existing for ever, the Lord of all, and\r\nthe possessor of divine attributes. All others, such as the sun and the\r\nmoon, earth and water, wind, fire and firmament, planets, and stars, are\r\nliable to destruction. All these, when the end of the universe cometh,\r\ntake leave of the three worlds. They are destroyed and created again and\r\nagain. Others also, such as men and animals and birds, and creatures\r\nbelonging to other orders of living existence,--indeed, all that move on\r\nthis world of men,--are endued with short lives. And as regards kings,\r\nall of them, having enjoyed great prosperity, reach, at last, the hour of\r\ndestruction and are reborn in order to enjoy the fruits of good and evil\r\ndeeds. It behoveth thee then to make peace with Yudhishthira. Let the\r\nPandavas and the Kauravas both rule this earth. O Suyodhana, one should\r\nnot think in this way, viz., I am strong!--for O bull among men, it is\r\nseen that there are persons stronger than those generally regarded\r\nstrong. O son of Kuru's race, physical strength is scarcely regarded as\r\nstrength by those that are really strong. As regards the Pandavas, endued\r\nas they all are with prowess equal to that of the celestials, they are\r\nalso regarded as strong. In this connection is cited an old story, as an\r\nexample, the story, viz., of Matali searching for a bridegroom upon whom\r\nto bestow his daughter. The king of the three worlds (Indra) had a\r\ncharioteer, named Matali, whom he dearly loved. Unto him was born a\r\ndaughter celebrated over the world for beauty. Endued with the celestial\r\nbeauty, that daughter of Matali was known by the name of Gunakesi. And,\r\nindeed, in both loveliness and symmetry of bodily figure, she far\r\nexcelled other members of her sex. Knowing that the time for giving her\r\nway had come, Matali with his wife became very anxious, thinking, O\r\nmonarch, of what he was to do next. And he thought within himself, 'Alas,\r\nthe birth of a daughter in the families of those that are well-behaved\r\nand high-born and possess reputation and humility of character, is always\r\nattended with evil results. Daughters, when born in respectable families,\r\nalways endanger the honour of three families, viz., their maternal and\r\npaternal families and the family into which they are adopted by marriage.\r\nGlancing in my mind's eye the worlds of gods and men, I have searched\r\nboth, but no eligible bridegroom have I found.'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'And it so happened that amongst the gods, the Daityas\r\nand Gandharvas, men and numerous Rishis, none was regarded by Matali as\r\nan eligible husband for his daughter. And having held a consultation then\r\nin the night with his wife Sudharma, Matali set his heart upon making a\r\njourney to the world of the Nagas. And he thought within himself,\r\n'Amongst both gods and men I have not found a husband fit, in respect of\r\nbeauty, for my Gunakesi. Surely, one may be found amongst the Nagas.' And\r\nsaying this, he took his wife's leave and sniffing the head of his\r\ndaughter, Matali entered the nether regions.'\""

      "content": "\"Kanwa said, 'When Matali was wending his way, he saw the great Rishi\r\nNarada proceeding at his pleasure to pay a visit to Varuna (the god of\r\nthe waters). And beholding Matali, Narada asked him, saying, 'Whither\r\ndost thou go? Is it, O charioteer, on any mission of thy own, or is it at\r\nSatakratu's command, that this journey of thine is undertaken?' Thus\r\naddressed on the way by Narada who was proceeding towards his\r\ndestination, Matali duly informed Narada, of his mission. And the Rishi,\r\ninformed of everything, then said unto Matali, 'We shall go together. As\r\nregards myself, it is to see the Lord of the waters that I am proceeding,\r\nhaving left the heavens, searching the nether regions, I shall tell you\r\neverything. After a good search there, we shall select a bridegroom, O\r\nMatali! And penetrating then into nether regions, that illustrious\r\ncouple, Matali and Narada, beheld that Regent of the world--the Lord of\r\nthe waters. And there Narada received worship due to a celestial Rishi,\r\nand Matali received that equal to what is offered to the great Indra. And\r\nboth of them skilful in business, informed Varuna of their purpose, and\r\nobtaining his leave they began to wander in that region of the Nagas. And\r\nNarada who knew all the residents of the nether regions then began to\r\ndescribe in detail unto his companion all about the dwellers of the Naga\r\nworld.'\r\n\r\n\"And Narada said, 'Thou hast, O charioteer, seen Varuna surrounded by his\r\nsons and grandsons. Behold the dominions of the Lord of the waters. It is\r\ndelightful all round, and full of riches. The son, endued with great\r\nwisdom, of Varuna, the Lord of the Ocean, is even much distinguished for\r\nhis conduct and disposition and for his holiness. Possessed of eyes like\r\nlotus leaves, this Pushkara is, indeed, Varuna's much-loved son, endued\r\nwith great beauty and delightful to behold. He has been chosen by Soma's\r\ndaughter as her husband. That daughter of Soma, equal in beauty unto a\r\nsecond Sree, is known by the name of Jyotsnakali. Indeed, it is said,\r\nthat she had once before chosen the eldest and foremost of Aditi's son as\r\nher lord. Behold now, O companion of the Lord of the celestials, that\r\nabode, made entirely of gold, and full of the wine called Varuni. Indeed,\r\nhaving obtained that wine, the gods acquired their god-heads. These\r\nblazing weapons also of every kind that thou seest, belonged, O Matali,\r\nto the Daityas who have been deprived of their sovereignty. These weapons\r\nare incapable of deterioration, and when hurled at the foe always return\r\ninto the hand that hurleth them. Obtained by the gods as the booty of\r\nwar, they require considerable mental energy to be used against foes.\r\nHere dwelt in days of yore many tribes of Rakshasas and Daityas,\r\npossessed of many kinds of celestial weapons, but they were all\r\nvanquished by the gods. Behold, there, in Varuna's lake is that fire of\r\nblazing flames, and that discus of Vishnu surrounded by the lustrous\r\nsplendour of mighty caloric. Behold, there lieth that knotty bow that was\r\ncreated for the destruction of the world. It is always protected with\r\ngreat vigilance by the gods, and it is from this bow that the one wielded\r\nby Arjuna hath taken its name. Endued with the strength of hundred\r\nthousand bows, the power it assumes at the hour of battle is\r\nindescribably great. It punishes all punishable wicked kings endued with\r\nthe nature of Rakshasas. This fierce weapon was first created by Brahman,\r\nthe utterer of the Vedas. The great preceptor Sukra hath said that this\r\nweapon is a terrible one in respect of all kings. Endued with great\r\nenergy, it is held by the sons of the Lord of waters. Behold, there in\r\nthe umbrella-room is the umbrella of the Lord of the waters. It droppeth\r\nrefreshing showers like the clouds. The water dropped from this umbrella,\r\nthough pure as the moon, is yet enveloped by such darkness that it cannot\r\nbe seen by anybody. There, in these regions, O Matali, innumerable are\r\nthe wonders to be seen. Your business, however, will suffer if we spend\r\nmore time here. We will, therefore, leave this region soon.'\""

Here the fire known by the name of\r\nthe Asura-fire[8] and which is fed by water, continually blazeth forth.\r\nHeld fast by the flat of the celestials, it moveth not, regarding itself\r\nas bound and confined. It was here that' the gods, having first\r\nvanquished and slain their foes, quaffed the Amrita and deposited the\r\nresidue. It is from this place that the waning and waxing of the moon are\r\nseen. It is here that son of Aditi, the Horse-headed (Vishnu), on the\r\nrecurrence of every auspicious occasion, riseth, filling at such times\r\nthe universe, otherwise called Suvarna,[9] with the sound of Vedic hymns\r\nand Mantras. And because all watery forms such as the Moon and others\r\nshower their water on the region, therefore hath this excellent region\r\nbeen called Patala.[10] It is from here that the celestial elephant\r\nAiravata, for the benefit of the universe, taketh up cool water in order\r\nto impart it to the clouds, and it is that water which Indra poureth down\r\nas rain. Here dwell diverse kinds of aquatic animals, of various shapes\r\nsuch as the Timi and others, which subsist on the rays of the moon. O\r\ncharioteer, here are many kinds of creatures that die during the day,\r\nbeing pierced by the rays of the sun, but all of whom revive in the\r\nnight, the reason being that the moon, rising here every day, laying\r\nthose deceased creatures with Amrita by means of rays, that constitute\r\nhis arms, resuscitate them by that touch. Deprived of their prosperity by\r\nVasava, it is here that many sinful Danavas live confined, defeated by\r\nhim and afflicted by Time. It was here that the Lord of creatures--that\r\ngreat Master of all created things--Mahadeva--had practised the severest\r\nof ascetic austerities for the benefit of all creatures. Here dwell many\r\nregenerate and great Rishis observant of vows called 'Go' and emaciated\r\nwith the recitation and study of the Vedas, and who, having suspended the\r\nvital air called Prana, have attained to heaven by force of their\r\nausterities. A man is said to adopt the vow called Go, when he sleepeth\r\nwherever he listeth, and when he subsisteth on anything that others place\r\nbefore him, and is clad with robes that others may supply. Here in the\r\nrace of the celebrated elephant Supratika were born those best of\r\nelephants known by the names of Airavata, Vamana, Kumuda and Anjana, the\r\nfirst being the king of his tribe. Look, O Matali, if there be any\r\nbridegroom here, that is distinguished by the possession of superior\r\nmerits, for then I will go to him for respectfully soliciting him to\r\naccept thy daughter. Behold, here lieth an egg in these waters, blazing\r\nwith beauty. From the commencement of the creation it is here. It moveth\r\nnot, nor doth it burst. I have never heard any body speaking of its birth\r\nor nature. Nobody knoweth who its father or mother is. It is said, O\r\nMatali, that when the end of the world cometh, mighty fire burst forth\r\nfrom within it, and spreading consumeth the three worlds with all their\r\nmobile and immobile objects.'

Here in these regions called Patala,\r\nit hath been built with great care by the divine artificer, and planned\r\nby the Danava Maya. Endued with great energy and heroism, many Danavas,\r\nhaving obtained boons (from Brahman) in days of old, lived here,\r\nexhibiting a thousand different kinds of illusion. They were incapable of\r\nbeing vanquished by Sakra or any other celestial, that is, by either\r\nYama, or Varuna, or the Lord of treasures (Kuvera). Here dwell, O Matali,\r\nthose Asuras called Kalakhanjas who sprang from Vishnu, and those\r\nRakshasas also called Yatudhanas who sprang from the feet of Brahman. All\r\nof them are endued with frightful teeth, terrible impetus, the speed and\r\nprowess of the wind, and great energy depending on powers of illusion.\r\nBesides these, another class of Danavas called Nivatakavachas, who are\r\ninvincible in battle, have their abode here.

Many times, O Matali, thou, with thy son\r\nGomukha, and the chief of the celestials and lord of Sachi, along with\r\nhis son, had to retreat before them. Behold their homes, O Matali, that\r\nare all made of silver and gold, and well-adorned with decorations done\r\naccording to the rules of art. All those mansions are decked with lapis\r\nlazuli and corals, and made effulgent with the lustre of the\r\nArkasphatika, and the radiance of gem called Vajrasara.

Of spacious proportions and great architectural\r\nbeauty, it is impossible to say of what material these mansions are built\r\nor to describe their style of beauty.

See, O Matali, if\r\nany bridegroom may be had here, acceptable to thee. If no one can be\r\nfound, we shalt, if thou likest, go hence to some other part of the\r\nworld.' Thus addressed, Matali answered Narada, saying, 'O celestial\r\nRishi, it behoveth me not to do anything that may be disagreeable to\r\ndwellers of heaven. The gods and the Danavas, though brothers, are ever\r\nat hostility with each other. How can I, therefore, make an alliance with\r\nthose that are our enemies?

These then are their names--Suvarnachuda,\r\nNagasin Daruna, Chandatundaka, Anala, Vaisalaksha, Kundalin, Pankajit,\r\nVajraviskambha, Vainateya, Vamana, Vatavega, Disachakshu, Nimisha,\r\nAnimisha, Trirava, Saptarava, Valmiki, Dipaka, Daityadwipa, Saridwipa,\r\n\r\nSarasa, Padmaketana, Sumukha, Chitraketu, Chitravara, Anagha, Meshahrit,\r\nKumuda, Daksha, Sarpanta, Somabhojana, Gurubhara, Kapota, Suryanetra,\r\nChirantaka, Vishnudharman, Kumara, Parivarha, Hari, Suswara, Madhuparka,\r\nHemavarna, Malaya, Matariswan, Nisakara and Divakara. These sons of\r\nGaruda that I name dwell in only a single province of this region. I have\r\nmentioned those only that have won distinction by might, fame and\r\nachievements.

Here dwelleth Surabhi, the mother of all\r\nkine, she, who was born of the Amrita. She always yieldeth milk which is\r\nthe essence of all the best things of the earth, and which, excellent as\r\nit is, and of one taste, springeth from the essence of the six different\r\nkinds of tastes (that are talked of). The faultless Surabhi herself\r\nsprang in days of old from the mouth of the Grandsire, gratified with\r\ndrinking the Amrita and vomiting the best things. A single jet only of\r\nher milk, falling on the earth, created what is known as the sacred and\r\nthe excellent \"Milky Ocean.\" The verge of that ocean all round is always\r\ncovered with white foam resembling a belt of flowers. Those best of\r\nascetics that are known by the name of the Foam-drinkers dwell around\r\nthis ocean, subsisting on that foam only. They are called Foam-drinkers\r\nbecause they live, O Matali, on nothing else save that foam. Engaged in\r\nthe practice of the severest of austerities, the very gods are known to\r\nfear them. From her are born four other kine, O Matali, supporting the\r\nfour quarters and therefore, are they called the supporters of the\r\nquarters (Dikpali). Born of Surabhi herself, she who supporteth the\r\neastern quarter is called Surupa. She, who supporteth the southern\r\nquarter is called Hansika. That illustrious cow, O Matali, of universal\r\nform, who supporteth the western quarter ruled by Varuna is known by the\r\nname of Subhadra. The northern quarter comprising the region of virtue,\r\nand called after Kuvera the Lord of treasures, is supported by the cow\r\nnamed Sarva-kamadugha. The gods, uniting with the Asuras, and making the\r\nMandara mountain their pole, churned the waters of the ocean and obtained\r\nthe wine called Varuni, and (the Goddess of Prosperity and Grace called)\r\nLakshmi, and Amrita, and that prince of steeds called Uchchhaisrava, and\r\nthat best of gems called Kaustubha. Those waters, O Matali, that yielded\r\nthese precious things had all been mixed with the milk of these tour\r\ncows. As regards Surabhi, the milk she yielded becometh Swaha unto those\r\nthat live on Swaha, Swadha unto those that live on Swadha, and Amrita\r\nunto those that live on Amrita. The couplet that was sung by the dwellers\r\nof Rasatala in day of old, is still heard to be recited in the world by\r\nthe persons of learning. That couplet is this,--Neither in the region of\r\nthe Nagas, nor in Swarga, nor in Vimana, nor in Tripishtapa is residence\r\nso happy as in Rasatala!'\""

It is ruled over by Vasuki, the king of the\r\nNagas. That Shesha dwelleth here, who, in consequence of his ascetic\r\nausterities of the foremost order, is able to support this earth with all\r\nher vastness. His body is like that of a white mountain. He is decked in\r\ncelestial ornaments. He hath a thousand heads. His tongues are blazing\r\nlike flames of fire, and he is endued with great strength. There dwell in\r\nhappiness innumerable Nagas--sons of Surasa--possessed of diverse forms,\r\nand decked on ornaments of diverse kinds, bearing the signs of gems,\r\nSwastika, circles and drinking vessels. All of them endued with great\r\nstrength are by nature fierce. Some have a thousand heads, some five\r\nhundred, and some three. And some have two heads, and some five, and some\r\nhave seven faces. And all of them are possessed of huge bodies that\r\nresemble the mountains stretching over the earth. Millions and tens of\r\nmillions are they, in fact, uncountable, even as regards those of' them\r\nthat belong to a single race. Listen, however, to me as I name a few of\r\nthe more famous ones amongst them.

These and many others there\r\nare amongst the sons of Kasyapa. See O Matali, if there is anybody here\r\nwhom thou canst elect.'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'Matali, meanwhile, had been looking attentively at a\r\nperson that stood by. And after Narada had ceased speaking, the celestial\r\ncharioteer with gratified mind asked the Rishi, saying, 'Of what race is\r\nhe the delighter--that comely youth of great radiance--who standeth\r\nbefore Aryaka of Kauravya's line? Who is his father, and who is his\r\nmother? Of what Naga's race is he? Indeed, of what line doth he stand as\r\na high flag-staff? In consequence of his intelligence, his patience, his\r\nbeauty, and his youth, my heart, O celestial Rishi, hath been attracted\r\ntowards him. That youth will make the best of husbands for my Gunakesi.'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'Beholding Matali's gratification at seeing the Naga\r\ncalled Sumukha, Narada informed him of the nobility of his parentage and\r\nof his feats. And he said, 'Born in the race of Airavata this prince of\r\nNagas is named Sumukha. He is the favourite grandson of Aryaka, and the\r\ndaughter's son of Vamana. The father of this youth was, O Matali, the\r\nNaga called Chikura. Not long before was he slain by Vinata's Son.'\r\nHearing this Matali became highly pleased, and addressing Narada, the\r\ncharioteer said, 'This best of Nagas is, O sire, very acceptable to me\r\nfor a son-in-law. Make an endeavour to secure him, for I am highly\r\npleased at the thought of bestowing on this Naga, O Muni, my dear\r\ndaughter.'\""

Pure in conduct, he hath an excellent\r\ndisposition and possesses numerous virtues. Endued with strength of mind,\r\nhe hath great energy and great might. He is the friend, counsellor, and\r\ncharioteer of Sakra. It has been seen in every battle that small is the\r\ndifference that exists between him and Vasava as regards prowess and\r\nstrength. In all the battles between the gods and Asuras, it is this\r\nMatali that driveth, by his mind alone, that ever-victorious and best of\r\ncars belonging to Indra, which is drawn by thousand steeds. Vanquished by\r\nhis management of the steeds, the enemies of the gods are subjugated by\r\nVasava by the use of his hands. Defeated before-hand by Matali, the\r\nAsuras are subsequently slain by Indra. Matali hath an excellent\r\ndaughter, who in beauty is unrivalled in the world. Truthful and\r\npossessed of every accomplishment, she is known by the name of Gunakesi.\r\nHe was searching the three worlds for an eligible bridegroom. O thou that\r\nart possessed of the splendour of a celestial, thy grandson, Sumukha,\r\nhath become acceptable to him as a husband for his daughter. If O best of\r\nserpents, his proposal be acceptable to thee, quickly make up thy mind, O\r\nAryaka, to take his daughter in gift for thy grandson. As Lakshmi in\r\nVishnu's house, or Swaha in that of Agni so let the slender-waisted\r\nGunakesi be a wife in thy race. Let Gunakesi, therefore be accepted by\r\nthee for thy grandson, like Sachi for Vasava who deserveth her. Although\r\nthis youth hath lost his father, yet we choose him for his virtues, and\r\nfor the respectability of Airavata and thy own. Indeed, it is in\r\nconsequence of Sumukha's merits, his disposition, purity, self-restraint\r\nand other qualifications that Matali hath become himself desirous of\r\ngiving away his daughter unto him. It behoveth thee, therefore, to honour\r\nMatali.'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'Thus addressed by Narada, Aryaka beholding his\r\ngrandson elected as a bridegroom and remembering the death of his son was\r\nfilled with delight and sorrow at the same time. And he then addressed\r\nNarada and said, 'How, O celestial Rishi, can I desire Gunakesi for a\r\ndaughter-in-law'! It cannot be, O great Rishi, that thy words are not\r\nhighly honoured by me, for who is there that would not desire an alliance\r\nwith the friend of Indra? I hesitate, however, O great Muni, in\r\nconsequence of the instability of the very cause that would not make that\r\nalliance lasting. O thou of great effulgence, the author of this youth,\r\nviz., my son, hath been devoured by Garuda. We are afflicted with sorrow\r\non that account. But worse still, O lord, Vinata's son, at the time of\r\nleaving these regions, said, 'After a month I will devour this Sumukha\r\nalso. Surely, it will happen as he hath said, for we know with whom we\r\nhave to deal. At these words, therefore, of Suparna we have become\r\ncheerless!'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'Matali then said unto Aryaka, 'I have formed a plan.\r\nThis thy grandson is elected by me as my son-in-law. Let this Naga then,\r\nproceeding with me and Narada, come to the Lord of heaven the chief of\r\nthe celestials, O best of Nagas. I shall then endeavour to place\r\nobstacles in the way of Suparna, and as a last resource, we will\r\nascertain the period of life that hath been vouchsafed to Sumukha.\r\nBlessed be thou, O Naga, let Sumukha, therefore, come with me to the\r\npresence of the Lord of the celestials.' Saying this, they took Sumukha\r\nwith them, and all the four, endued with great splendour, coming to\r\nheaven beheld Sakra the chief of the gods seated in all his glory. And it\r\nso happened that the illustrious Vishnu of four arms was also present\r\nthere. Narada then represented the whole story about Matali and his\r\nchoice.'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'Hearing all that Narada said, Vishnu directed\r\nPurandara, the Lord of the universe, saying, 'Let Amrita be given to this\r\nyouth, and let him be made immortal like gods themselves. Let Matali, and\r\nNarada, and Sumukha, O Vasava, all attain their cherished wish through\r\nthy grace.' Purandara, however, reflecting on the prowess of Vinata's\r\nson, said unto Vishnu, 'Let Amrita be given unto him by thee.' Thus\r\naddressed, Vishnu said, 'Thou art the Lord of all mobile and immobile\r\ncreatures. Who is there, O lord, that would refuse a gift that may be\r\nmade by thee'?' At these words Sakra gave unto that Naga length of days.\r\nThe slayer of Vala and Vritra did not make him a drinker of Amrita.\r\nSumukha, having obtained that boon, became Sumukha[11] (in reality) for\r\nhis face was suffused with marks of joy. And having married Matali's\r\ndaughter, he cheerfully returned home. And Narada and Aryaka also filled\r\nwith delight at the success of their object, went away, after having\r\nworshipped the glorious chief of the celestials.'\""

And inflamed with great anger, that ranger of the firmament,\r\nSuparna, smiting the three worlds by the hurricane caused by the\r\nflappings of his wings, quickly came to Vasava. And Garuda said, 'O\r\nillustrious one, disregarding me why hast thou interfered with my\r\nsustenance. Having granted me a boon of thy own will, why dost thou now\r\nwithdraw it? The Supreme Lord of all creatures hath, from the beginning,\r\nordained what my food is to be. Why dost thou then stand in the way of\r\nthat divine decree? I had selected this great Naga and had fixed time,\r\nfor O god, I had intended to offer the meat of his body, as sustenance to\r\nmy numerous progeny. When he, therefore, hath obtained a boon from thee\r\nand hath become indestructible by me, how can I henceforth dare kill\r\nanother of his species? Dost thou sport thus, O Vasava, as thou listest?\r\nI, however, shall have to die, as also the members of my family' and the\r\nservants whom I have engaged in my house. That will, I think, gratify\r\nthee, O Vasava! Indeed, O slayer of Vala and Vritra, I deserve all this,\r\nnay more, since being the lord of the three worlds in might. I yet\r\nconsented to become the servant of another. O monarch of the three\r\nworlds, Vishnu, however, is not the only cause of my inferiority, for\r\nthough, O Vasava, I am quite thy equal, yet the sovereignty of the three\r\nworlds resteth on thee, O chief of the celestials. Like thee, I also have\r\na daughter of Daksha for my mother and Kasyapa for my father. Like thee,\r\nI also can, without any fatigue, bear the weight of the three worlds. I\r\nhave strength that is immeasurable and incapable of being resisted by any\r\ncreature. In the war with the Daityas I also achieved grand feats.\r\nSrutasri and Srutasena and Vivaswat, and Rochanamukha, and Prasrura, and\r\nKalakaksha amongst the sons of Diti were slain by me. Perching yet on the\r\nflag-staff of thy younger brother's car I carefully protect it in battle,\r\nand sometimes also I bear that brother of thine on my back. It is,\r\nperhaps, for this that thou disregardest me. Who else in the universe is\r\nthere that is capable of bearing such heavy burthens? Who is there that\r\nis stronger than myself? Superior though I am, I yet bear on my back this\r\nyounger brother of thine with all his friends. When, however,\r\ndisregarding me thou hast interfered with my foods, thou hast, O Vasava,\r\ninflicted disgrace on me, like this younger brother of thine that had\r\nhitherto been disgracing me by making me bear him on my back. As regards\r\nthyself, O Vishnu, amongst all those endued with prowess and strength\r\nthat have been born of Aditi's womb, thou art superior in strength. Yet\r\nthee I bear without any fatigue, with only one of my feathers. Think\r\ncoolly then, O brother, who amongst us is stronger?'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'Hearing the proud words of that bird foreshadowing\r\ndanger the bearer of the discus, provoking Tarkshya still more, said unto\r\nhim, 'Though so very weak, why dost thou, O Garuda, yet regard thyself\r\nstrong, O oviparous creature, it ill behoveth thee to vaunt thus in our\r\npresence. The three worlds united together cannot bear the weight of my\r\nbody. I myself bear my own weight and thine also. Come now, bear thou the\r\nweight of this one right arm of mine. If thou canst bear even this, thy\r\nboast would be regarded as reasonable. Saying this, the holy one placed\r\nhis arms on Garuda's shoulders. Thereupon the latter fell down, afflicted\r\nwith its weight, confounded, and deprived of his senses. And Garuda, felt\r\nthat the weight of that one arm of Vishnu was as great as that of the\r\nentire Earth with her mountains. Endued with might infinitely greater,\r\nVishnu, however, did not afflict him much. Indeed, Achyuta did not take\r\nhis life. That ranger of the sky, afflicted then by that immense weight,\r\ngasped for breath, and began to cast off his feathers. With every limb\r\nweakened, and utterly confounded, Garuda was almost deprived of his\r\nsenses. The winged offspring of Vinata then, thus confounded and almost\r\ndeprived of his senses, and rendered utterly helpless, bowing unto Vishnu\r\nwith bent bead, feebly addressed him, saying, 'O illustrious Lord, the\r\nessence of that strength which sustains the universe dwelleth in this\r\nbody of thine. What wonder, therefore, that I should be crushed down to\r\nthe earth by a single arm of thine, stretched out at thy pleasure. It\r\nbehoveth thee, O divine Lord, to forgive this winged creature that\r\nperches on thy flag-staff--this fool intoxicated with pride of strength,\r\nbut now rendered utterly helpless. Thy great strength, O divine Lord, was\r\nnever known to me before. It was for this that I regarded my own might to\r\nbe unequalled.' Thus addressed, the illustrious Vishnu became gratified,\r\nand addressing Garuda with affection, said, 'Let not thy behaviour be\r\nsuch again.' And saying this, Upendra threw Sumukha with the toe of his\r\nfoot upon Garuda's breast. And from that time, O king, Garuda hath ever\r\nlived in friendship with that snake. It was thus, O king, that mighty and\r\nillustrious Garuda, the son of Vinata, afflicted by the might of Vishnu,\r\nwas cured of his pride.'\r\n\r\n\"Kanwa continued, 'In the same way, O son of Gandhari, thou livest, O\r\nson, as long as thou approachest not the heroic sons of Pandu in battle.\r\nWho is there whom Bhima, that foremost of smiters, that mighty son of\r\nVayu and Dhananjaya, the son of Indra, cannot slay in battle? Vishnu\r\nhimself, and Vayu and Dharma, and the Aswins,--these gods are thy\r\nenemies. Let alone an encounter with them, thou art not competent even to\r\nlook at them on the field. Therefore, O prince, do not set thy heart upon\r\nwar; let peace be made through the agency of Vasudeva. It behoveth thee\r\nto save thy race thus. This great ascetic Narada witnessed with his own\r\neyes the incident (I have related to thee) which shows the greatness of\r\nVishnu, and know that this Krishna is that bearer of the discus and the\r\nmace!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the Rishi, Duryodhana\r\ncontracted his eye-brows and began to breathe heavily. And casting his\r\neyes then on Radha's son, he burst out into a loud laughter. And setting\r\nat naught those words of the Rishi, that wicked wretch began to slap his\r\nthigh that resembled the trunk of an elephant. And addressing the Rishi,\r\nhe said, 'I am, O great Rishi, precisely what the Creator hath made me.\r\nWhat is to be, must be. What also hath been ordained in my case must\r\nhappen, I cannot act otherwise. What can these senseless declamations,\r\ntherefore, avail?'\""

Friends again are rare that offer\r\nbeneficial counsels, for a friend (in need of counsel) is never there\r\nwhere a friend (offering counsel) is. O son of Kuru's race, I think, the\r\nword of friends ought to be listened to. Obstinacy ought to be avoided;\r\nfor it is fraught with great evil. In this connection is cited an old\r\nstory regarding Galava's having met with disgrace through obstinacy. In\r\nancient times, in order to test Viswamitra, who was then engaged in\r\nascetic austerities Dharma personally came to him, having assumed the\r\nform of the Rishi, Vasishtha. Thus assuming, O Bharata, the form of the\r\none of the seven Rishis, and feigning himself hungry and desirous of\r\neating, he came, O king, to the hermitage of Kausika. Thereupon,\r\nViswamitra struck with awe, began to cook Charu (which was a preparation\r\nof rice and milk). And in consequence of the care he took in preparing\r\nthat excellent food, he could not properly wait upon his guest. And it\r\nwas not till after the guest had dined on the food offered by the other\r\nhermits that Viswamitra succeeded in approaching him with the Charu he\r\nhad cooked and which was still steaming. 'I have already dined; wait\r\nhere,'--were the words that the holy one said. And having said that the\r\nholy one went away. And thereupon, the illustrious Viswamitra, O king,\r\nwaited there. And bearing that food on his head and holding it with his\r\narms, that ascetic of rigid vow stood in his hermitage, still as a post,\r\nsubsisting on air. And as he stood there, an ascetic of the name of\r\nGalava, from motives of respect and reverence and from affection and\r\ndesire of doing what was agreeable, began to wait upon him. And after a\r\nhundred years had passed away, Dharma, again assuming the form of\r\nVasishtha, came to Kausika from desire of eating. And beholding the great\r\nRishi Viswamitra, who was endued with high wisdom, standing there with\r\nthat food on his head, himself subsisting all the while on air, Dharma\r\naccepted that food which was still warm and fresh. And having eaten that\r\nfood, the god said,--Gratified am I, O regenerate Rishi. And saying this,\r\nhe went away. And at those words of Dharma, Viswamitra divested of\r\nKshatriyahood because endued with the status of a Brahmana and was filled\r\nwith delight[12]. And pleased as he was with the services and devotion of\r\nhis discipline, the ascetic Galava, Viswamitra, addressed him and said,\r\n'With my leave, O Galava, go whithersoever thou mayest wish.' Thus\r\ncommanded by his preceptor, Galava, highly pleased, said in a sweet voice\r\nunto Viswamitra of great effulgence, What final gift shall I make thee in\r\nconsequence of thy services as preceptor? O giver of honours, it is in\r\nconsequence of the (final) present that a sacrifice becometh successful.\r\nThe giver of such gifts obtains emancipation. Indeed, these gifts\r\nconstitute the fruit (that one enjoys in heaven). They are regarded as\r\npeace and tranquillity personified. What, therefore, shall I procure for\r\nmy preceptor? Oh, let that be said. 'The illustrious Viswamitra knew that\r\nhe had really been conquered by Galava by means of the latter's services,\r\nand the Rishi, therefore, sought to dismiss him by repeatedly saying,\r\n'Go, Go.' But thou repeatedly commanded by Viswamitra to go away, Galava\r\nstill addressed him saying, 'What shall I give?' And seeing this\r\nobstinacy on the part of ascetic Galava, Viswamitra felt a slight rise of\r\nanger and at last said, 'Give me eight hundred steeds, every one of which\r\nshould be as white as the rays of the moon, and every one of which should\r\nhave one ear black. Go now, O Galava, and tarry not.'\""

And\r\nsmitten with sorrow, O Suyodhana, he indulged in these lamentations,\r\n'Where shall I find affluent friends? Where shall I find money? Have I\r\nany savings? Where shall I find eight hundred steeds of lunar whiteness?\r\nWhat pleasure can I have in eating? What happiness can be mine in objects\r\nof enjoyment? The very love of life is extinct in me.

Death is preferable to life as regards him who having enjoyed the\r\nwealth of friends through their friendship for himself, is unable to\r\nreturn their favour. The religious acts of that man lose their efficacy\r\nwho having promised to do an act fails to perform it and is thus stained\r\nwith falsehood.

Where,\r\nindeed, is his place, and where his happiness? An ungrateful person can\r\nnever win esteem and affection. Salvation also can never be his. He that\r\nis destitute of wealth is a wretch that can scarcely be said to live.\r\nSuch a wretch cannot support his kinsmen and friends. Unable to make any\r\nreturn for the benefits he receiveth, he certainly meeteth with\r\ndestruction. Even I am that wretch, ungrateful, destitute of resources,\r\nand stained with falsehood, for having obtained my objects from my\r\npreceptor, I am unable to do his bidding. Having first endeavoured to the\r\nutmost, I will lay down my life. Before this, I never craved for any\r\nthing from the very gods. The deities regard me for this in sacrificial\r\nplace.

And while Galava was\r\nthus lamenting, his friend Garuda, the son of Vinata, appeared in his\r\nsight. And Garuda, from desire of doing him good, cheerfully addressed\r\nhim, saying, Thou art a dear friend, of mine. It is the duty of a friend,\r\nwhen himself in prosperity, to look to the accomplishment of the wishes\r\nof his friends. The prosperity that I have, O Brahmana, is constituted by\r\nVasava's younger brother Vishnu. Before this, I spoke to him on thy\r\nbehalf and he hath been pleased to grant my wishes.

The eastern, the southern, the western, or\r\nthe northern, towards which, O best of regenerate persons, shall I go, O\r\nGalava? That quarter towards which Surya the illuminator of the universe\r\nfirst riseth; where, at eve, the Sadhyas engage in their ascetic\r\nausterities; where that Intelligence, which pervades the whole universe\r\nfirst springeth; where the two eyes of Dharma, as well as he himself, are\r\nstationed; where the clarified butter first poured in sacrifice\r\nsubsequently flowed all around; that quarter, O best of all regenerate\r\npersons, is the gate of Day and Time. There the daughters of Daksha, in\r\nprimeval times, gave birth to their children. There the sons of Kasyapa\r\nfirst multiplied. That quarter is the source of all the prosperity of the\r\ngods, for it was there that Sakra was first anointed as the king of the\r\ncelestials. It was there, O regenerate Rishi, that both Indra and the\r\ngods underwent their ascetic penances. It is for this, O Brahmana, that\r\nthis quarter is called Purva (the first). And because in the earliest of\r\ntimes this quarter was overspread by the Suras, it is for this that it is\r\ncalled Purva. The gods, desirous of prosperity, performed all their\r\nreligious ceremonies here. It was here that the divine Creator of the\r\nuniverse first sang the Vedas. It was here that the Gayatri was first\r\npreached by Surya unto the reciters of that sacred hymn. It was here, O\r\nbest of Brahmanas, that the Yajurvedas  were delivered by Surya (unto\r\nYajnavalkya). It was here that the Soma juice, sanctified by boons, was\r\nfirst drunk in sacrifices by Suras. It was here that the Homa-fires,\r\n(gratified by mantras), first drank articles of cognate origin.[13] It\r\nwas here that Varuna first repaired to the nether regions, and attained\r\nto all his prosperity. It was here, O bull among the twice-born, that the\r\nbirth, growth, and death of the ancient Vasishtha took place. Here first\r\ngrew the hundred different branches of Om![14] It was here that the\r\nsmoke-eating Munis are the smoke of sacrificial fires. It was in that\r\nregion that myriads of boars and other animals were killed by Sakra and\r\noffered as sacrificial portions unto the gods. It is here that the\r\nthousand-rayed sun, arising, consumeth, out of ire, all those that are\r\nwicked and ungrateful among men and the Asuras. This is the gate of the\r\nthree worlds. This is the path of heaven and felicity. This quarter is\r\ncalled Purva (east). We will go hither, if it pleaseth thee. I shall\r\nalways do what is agreeable to him who is my friend. Tell me, O Galava,\r\nif any other quarter pleaseth thee, for we will then go there. Listen now\r\nto what I say of another quarter.'\""

It is here that the Pitris of the three worlds have\r\ntheir habitation. And, O Brahmana, it is said that a class of celestials\r\nsubsisting upon smoke alone also live there. Those celestials also that\r\ngo by the name of Viswedevas always dwell in this region along with the\r\nPitris. Worshipped in sacrifices in all the worlds, they are equal\r\nsharers with the Pitris. This quarter is called the second door of Yama.\r\nIt is here that the periods allotted to men are calculated in Trutis and\r\nLavas.[15] In this region always dwell the celestial Rishis, the\r\nPitriloka Rishis, and the royal Rishis, in great happiness. Here are\r\nreligion and truth. It is here that the acts (of persons) exhibit their\r\nfruits. This region, O best of the twice-born, is the goal of the acts of\r\nthe dead. It is this region, O best of regenerate persons, whither all\r\nmust repair. And as creatures are all overwhelmed by darkness, they\r\ncannot, therefore, come hither in bliss. Here, O bull among regenerate\r\npersons, are many thousands of Malevolent Rakshasas in order to be seen\r\nby the sinful. Here, O Brahmana, in the bowers on the breast of Mandara\r\nand in the abodes of regenerate Rishis, the Gandharvas chant psalms,\r\nstealing away both the heart and the intellect. It was here that Raivata\r\n(a Daitya), hearing the Sama hymns sung in a sweet voice, retired to the\r\nwoods, leaving his wife and friends and kingdom. In this region, O\r\nBrahmana, Manu and Yavakrita's son together set a limit which Surya can\r\nnever overstep. It was here that the illustrious descendant of Pulastya,\r\nRavana, the king of the Rakshasas, undergoing ascetic austerities,\r\nsolicited (the boon of) immortality from the gods. It was here that (the\r\nAsura) Vritra, in consequence of his wicked conduct, incurred the enmity\r\nof Sakra. It is in this region that lives of diverse forms all come and\r\nare then dissociated into their five (constituent) elements. It is in\r\nthis region, O Galava, that men of wicked deeds rot (in tortures). It is\r\nhere that the river Vaitarani flows, filled with the bodies of persons\r\ncondemned to hell. Arrived here, persons attain to the extremes of\r\nhappiness and misery. Reaching this region, the sun droppeth sweet waters\r\nand thence proceeding again to the direction named after (Vasishtha),\r\nonce more droppeth dew, It was here that I once obtained (for food), a\r\nprodigious elephant battling with an enormous tortoise. It was here that\r\nthe great sage Chakradhanu took his birth from Surya. That divine sage\r\nafterwards came to be known by the name of Kapila, and it was by him that\r\nthe (sixty thousand) sons of Sagara were afflicted. It was here that a\r\nclass of Brahmanas named Sivas, fully mastering the Vedas, became crowned\r\nwith (ascetic) success. Having studied all the Vedas they at last\r\nattained eternal salvation. In this region is the city called Bhogavati\r\nthat is ruled by Vasuki, by the Naga Takshaka and also by Airavata.

Quaffing all the six juices of Varuna, the moon,\r\nthe dispeller of darkness, becometh young again in the beginning of the\r\nfortnight. It was in the quarter, O Brahmana, that the Daityas were\r\nrouted and bound fast by the wind-god.

Hither is that\r\nmountain called Asta which is the cause of the evening twilight, and\r\nwhich (daily) receiveth the sun lovingly turning towards it. It is from\r\nthis quarter that both Night and Sleep, issuing out at the close of day,\r\nspread themselves, as if, for robbing all living creatures of half their\r\nallotted periods of life. It was here that Sakra, beholding (his\r\nstepmother) the goddess Diti lying asleep in a state of pregnancy, cut\r\noff the foetus (into forty-nine parts), whence sprang the (forty-nine)\r\nMaruts. It is towards this direction that the roots of Himavat stretch\r\ntowards the eternal Mandara (sunk in the ocean).

And, O Galava, because the abode of\r\nall the treasures of the north stretches in a line towards the east and\r\nthe west, therefore is the north sometimes called the central region\r\n(madhyama). And, O bull among the twice-born, in this region that is\r\nsuperior to all, none can live that is unamiable, or of unbridled\r\npassions, or unrighteous. Hither, in the asylum, known by the name of\r\nVadari, eternally dwell Krishna who is Narayana's self, and Jishnu that\r\nmost exalted, of all male beings, and Brahman (the Creator). Hither, on\r\nthe breast of Himavat always dwelleth Maheswara endued with the\r\neffulgence of the fire that blazeth up at the end of the Yuga. As\r\nPurusha, he sporteth here with Prakriti (the universal mother). Except by\r\nNara and Narayana, he is incapable of being seen by the diverse classes\r\nof Munis, the gods with Vasava at their head, the Gandharvas, the\r\nYakshas, and the Siddhas. Though invested with Maya, him the eternal\r\nVishnu alone, of a thousand heads and thousand legs, can behold. It was\r\nin this region that Chandramas (the moon) was installed into the\r\nsovereignty of the entire regenerate order. It was in this region, O thou\r\nforemost of all acquainted with Brahma, that Mahadeva first receiving her\r\non his head, afterwards let (the sacred stream) Ganga fall from the\r\nheavens to the world of men. It was here that the Goddess (Uma) underwent\r\nher ascetic austerities from her desire of obtaining Maheswara (as her\r\nLord). It was in this region that Kama, the wrath (of Siva), Himavat, and\r\nUma, all together shone brilliantly. It was here, on the breast of\r\nKailasa, O Galava, that Kuvera, was installed on the sovereignty of the\r\nRakshasas, the Yakshas, and the Gandharvas.

It is here that the gardens called\r\nSaugandhi-kanaka are always guarded by the Rakshasas. Here are many\r\nplains covered with grassy verdure, as also the plantain forest, and\r\nthose celestial trees called the Sautanakas. It is in this, region, O\r\nGalava, that the Siddhas, with souls ever under control and always\r\nsporting at will, have their fit abodes, abounding with every object of\r\nenjoyment. It is here that the seven Rishis with Arundhati may be seen.\r\nIt is here that the constellation Swati is to be seen, and it is here\r\nthat it first rises to the view. It is in this region that the Grandsire\r\nBrahman dwelleth in the vicinity of Yajna (sacrifice embodied). It is in\r\nthis quarter that the sun, the moon, and the other luminaries are seen to\r\nrevolve regularly.\r\n\r\nIt is in this region, O foremost of Brahmanas, that those illustrious and\r\ntruth-speaking Munis called by the name of Dharma, guard the source of\r\nthe Ganges.

None else, O bull among Brahmanas, save the divine\r\nNarayana, and the eternal Nara called also Jishnu, succeeded in passing\r\nbeyond the point so guarded. It is in this region that the mountains of\r\nKailasa lie, the abode of Ailavila (Kuvera). It is here that the ten\r\nApsaras known by the name of Vidyutprabha had their origin. In covering,\r\nO Brahmana, the three worlds with three steps in the sacrifice of Vali\r\n(the Asura king), Vishnu had covered this whole northern region; and,\r\naccordingly, there is a spot here called Vishnupada. And it is so called\r\nafter the footprint of Vishnu caused on that occasion. Here, in this\r\nquarter, at a place called Usiravija, by the side of the golden lake,\r\nking Marutta performed, O foremost of Brahmanas, a sacrifice. It is here\r\nthat the brilliant and shining gold mines of Himavat exhibit themselves\r\nto the illustrious and regenerate Rishi Jimuta. And Jimuta gave away the\r\nwhole of that wealth to the Brahmanas. And having given it away, that\r\ngreat Rishi solicited them to call it after his own name.

And, O\r\nranger of the skies, thy speed is so great that the very trees, broken by\r\nthe storm caused by the flapping of thy wings, seem to pursue thee in the\r\ncourse.

Slacken\r\nthy speed, O ranger of the sky, remembering the risk to a Brahmana's\r\nlife. O sire, neither the sun, nor the cardinal points, nor the welkin\r\nitself, is any longer perceptible to me. I see only a thick gloom around\r\nme. The body is no longer visible to me. I see only thy two eyes, O\r\noviparous being, resembling two radiant gems. I cannot see either thy\r\nbody or my own. At every step, I behold sparks of fire emitted from thy\r\nframe. Stop without delay these sparks of fire and extinguish the\r\ndazzling radiance of thy eyes. O son of Vinata, slacken this exceeding\r\nspeed of thy course. O devourer of snakes, I have no business to go with\r\nthee. Desist, O blessed one, I am unable to bear this speed of thine. I\r\nhave promised to give my preceptor eight hundred white steeds of lunar\r\neffulgence, each having one ear black in hue. I see no way, O oviparous\r\nbeing, of fulfilling my pledge. There is but one way that I can see, and\r\nthat is to lay down my own life. I have no wealth of my own, nor any\r\nwealthy friend, nor can wealth, however immense, procure the\r\naccomplishment of my object.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada continued, 'Unto Galava uttering these and many other words of\r\nentreaty and sorrow, the son of Vinata, without slackening his speed,\r\nlaughingly replied, saying, 'Thou hast little wisdom, O regenerate Rishi,\r\nsince thou wishest to put an end to thy own life.

And Galava and Garuda both saluted her by bending\r\ntheir heads, and worshipped her. And thereupon, the lady enquired after\r\ntheir welfare and gave them seats. And having taken their seats, both of\r\nthem took the cooked food the lady offered them, after having first\r\ndedicated it to the gods with Mantras. And having taken that food, they\r\nlaid themselves down on the ground and fell into a profound sleep. And\r\nGaruda, from desire of leaving that place, upon awakening, found that his\r\nwings, had fallen off. Indeed, he had become like a ball of flesh, with\r\nonly his head and legs. And beholding him come to that plight, Galava\r\nsorrowfully enquired, saying, 'What is this condition that has overtaken\r\nthee as the consequence of thy sojourn here? Alas, how long shall we have\r\nto reside here? Hadst thou harboured any evil and sinful thought in thy\r\nmind? It cannot, I am sure, be any trivial sin of which thou hast been\r\nguilty.' Thus addressed, Garuda replied unto the Brahmana, saying,\r\n'Indeed, O regenerate one, I entertained the thought of carrying away\r\nthis lady crowned with ascetic success from this spot to where the\r\nCreator himself, the divine Mahadeva, the eternal Vishnu, and both Virtue\r\nand Sacrifice personified, live together, for as I thought this lady\r\nshould live there. I shall now, from desire of doing myself good,\r\nprostrate myself before this holy lady, and pray unto her, saying,--with\r\na heart full of pity, I had, indeed, entertained such a thought. Whether\r\nI acted rightly or wrongly, even this was the wish, evidently against thy\r\nown, that was cherished by me from my respect for thee. It behoveth thee,\r\ntherefore, to grant me forgiveness, from the nobility of thy heart.' That\r\nlady became gratified with that prince of birds and that bull of\r\nBrahmanas. And addressing Garuda, she said, 'Fear not, O thou of\r\nbeautiful feathers. Resume thy wings, and cast off thy fears. I was\r\ncontempted by thee, but know that I do not pardon contempt. That sinful\r\nbeing who entertains contempt for me, would speedily fall away from all\r\nblissful regions. Without a single inauspicious indication about me, and\r\nperfectly blameless as I am, I have, in consequence of the purity of my\r\nconduct, attained to high ascetic success. Purity of conduct beareth\r\nvirtue as its fruit. Purity of conduct beareth wealth as its fruit. It is\r\npurity of conduct that bringeth on prosperity. And it is purity of\r\nconduct that driveth away all inauspicious indications. Go thou, O\r\nblessed prince of birds, whithersoever thou wishest, from this place.\r\nNever entertain contempt for me, and take care that thou dost not\r\ncontempt women that may even be truly blamable. Thou shalt again be, as\r\nbefore, invested with both strength and energy.' At these words of that\r\nlady Garuda had his wings again, and they became even stronger than\r\nbefore. And then with Sandili's leave, Garuda with Galava on his back\r\ntook his departure. But they failed to find the kind of steeds they were\r\nin search of. And it so happened that Viswamitra met Galava on the way.\r\nAnd thereupon, that foremost of speakers addressed Galava in the presence\r\nof Vinata's son and said, 'O regenerate one, the time is already come\r\nwhen thou shouldst give me the wealth thou hadst promised me of thy own\r\naccord. I do not know what thou mayst. I have waited so long. I will wait\r\nfor some time more. Seek thou the way by which thou mayst succeed (in the\r\nmatter of thy promise).' Hearing these words, Garuda addressed cheerless\r\nGalava who was overwhelmed with sorrow, saying, 'What Viswamitra said\r\nunto thee before hath now been repeated in my presence. Come, therefore,\r\nO Galava, best of Brahmanas, we will deliberate on the matter. Without\r\ngiving thy preceptor the whole of the wealth (promised by thee), thou\r\ncanst not even sit down.'"

And because\r\nwealth supports the world and sustains life, therefore, is it called\r\nDhana. It is for serving these ends that Dhana (wealth) exists from the\r\nbeginning in the three worlds. On that Friday, when either of the two\r\nconstellations--the Purvabhadra or the Uttarabhadra--is ascendant, Agni,\r\ncreating wealth by a fiat of his will, bestoweth it on mankind for the\r\nincrease of Kuvera's stock. The wealth that is embowelled in the Earth is\r\nguarded by the deities called the Ajaikapats and the Ahivradnas, and also\r\nby Kuvera. Exceedingly difficult of attainment, that wealth, therefore, O\r\nbull among Brahmanas, is rarely attained. Without wealth there is no\r\nchance of thy acquisition of the promised steeds. Beg thou, therefore, of\r\nsome king born in the race of some royal sage, who may, without\r\noppressing his subjects, crown our suit with success. There is a king\r\nborn in the lunar race, that is my friend. We shall go to him, for he,\r\namongst all on Earth, hath great wealth. That royal sage is known by the\r\nname of Yayati, and he is the son of Nahusha. His prowess is incapable of\r\nbeing baffled. Solicited by thee in person, and urged by me, he will give\r\nwhat we seek, for he hath immense wealth, equal unto what belongeth to\r\nKuvera, the lord of treasures. Even thus, by accepting a gift, O learned\r\none, pay off thy debt to thy preceptor.' Talking thus, and thinking upon\r\nwhat was best to be done, Garuda and Galava together went to king Yayati,\r\nwho was then in his capital called Pratisthana. The king received them\r\nhospitably and gave them excellent Arghya and water to wash their feet.\r\nAnd the king then asked them the cause of their advent. And thereupon\r\nGaruda answered, saying, 'O son of Nahusha, this ocean of asceticism,\r\ncalled Galava, is my friend. He had been, O monarch, a disciple of\r\nViswamitra for many thousand years. This holy Brahmana, when commanded by\r\nViswamitra to go away whithersoever he chose, addressed his preceptor at\r\nthat time, saying,--I desire to give something as preceptor's fee.\r\nKnowing this one's resources to be poor, Viswamitra did not ask for\r\nanything. But when he was repeatedly addressed by this Brahmana on the\r\nsubject of the tutorial fee, the preceptor, under a slight accession of\r\nwrath, said, 'Give me eight hundred white steeds of good pedigree and of\r\nlunar radiance, and each having one ear black in hue. If, O Galava, thou\r\ndesirest to give anything to thy preceptor, let this then be given!' It\r\nwas thus that Viswamitra endued with wealth of asceticism said unto him\r\nin anger. And this bull among Brahmanas is on that account smarting with\r\ngreat grief. Unable to fulfil that command (of his preceptor), he hath\r\nnow come to take thy shelter.

This very province also of mine hath equally\r\nbeen blessed by thee, O sinless Tarkshya. There is one thing, however, O\r\nfriend, that I desire to say unto thee, and that is, I am not so rich now\r\nas thou thinkest, for my wealth hath suffered a great diminution. I\r\ncannot, however, O ranger of the skies, make thy advent here a fruitless\r\none. Nor can I venture to frustrate the hopes entertained by this\r\nregenerate Rishi. I shall, therefore, give him that which will accomplish\r\nhis purpose. If one having come for alms, returneth disappointed, he may\r\nconsume the (host's) race. O son of Vinata, it is said that there is no\r\nact more sinful than that of saying, 'I have nothing'--and thus\r\ndestroying the hope of one that cometh, saying, 'Give.' The disappointed\r\nman whose hopes have been killed and his object not accomplished, can\r\ndestroy the sons and grandsons of the person that faileth to do him good.\r\nTherefore, O Galava, take thou this daughter of mine, this perpetrator of\r\nfour families. In beauty, she resembleth a daughter of the celestials.\r\nShe is capable of prompting every virtue. Indeed, owing to her beauty,\r\nshe is always solicited (at my hands) by gods and men, and Asuras. Let\r\nalone twice four hundred steeds each with a black ear, the kings of the\r\nearth will give away their whole kingdoms as her dower. Take thou,\r\ntherefore, this daughter of mine, named Madhavi. My sole desire is that I\r\nmay have a daughter's son by her. Accepting that daughter in gift, Galava\r\nthen, with Garuda, went away, saying, 'We will again see thee'. And they\r\ntook that maiden with them. And Galava's oviparous friend addressed him,\r\nsaying, 'The means have at last been obtained whereby the steeds may be\r\nobtained.' And saying this, Garuda went away to his own abode, having\r\nobtained Galava's permission. And after the prince of birds had gone,\r\nGalava, with that maiden in his company, began to think of going to some\r\none among the kings who would be able to give (fit) dower for the maiden.\r\nAnd he first thought of that best of kings, Haryyaswa of Ikshaku's race,\r\nwho ruled at Ayodhya, was endued with great energy, possessed of a large\r\narmy consisting of four kinds of forces, had a well-filled treasury and\r\nabundance of corn, and who was dearly loved by his subjects, and who\r\nloved the Brahmanas well. Desirous of offspring, he was living in quiet\r\nand peace, and engaged in excellent austerities. And the Brahmana Galava,\r\nrepairing unto Haryyaswa, said, 'This maiden, O king of kings, will\r\nincrease the family of her husband by bringing forth offspring. Accept\r\nher from me, O Haryyaswa, as thy wife, by giving me a dower. I will tell\r\nthee what dower thou shalt have to give. Hearing it, settle what thou\r\nshalt do.'\""

Those seven, again, that ought to be slender are slender in\r\nher. Those three, again, which ought to be deep are deep in her. And\r\nlastly, those five that ought to be red are red in her. It seems that she\r\nis worth being looked at by even the gods and the Asuras, and is\r\naccomplished in all the arts and sciences. Possessed of all auspicious\r\nsigns, she will certainly bring forth many children. She is even capable\r\nof bringing forth a son who may become an emperor. Having regard to my\r\nwealth, tell me, O foremost of Brahmanas, what should be her dower.'\r\nGalava said, 'Give me eight hundred steeds, born in a good country, of\r\nlunar whiteness, and each with one ear black in hue.

Kindly grant this request of mine.'\r\nHearing these words of the king, that damsel said unto Galava, 'A reciter\r\nof Brahma granted me a boon that I would after each delivery, be a maiden\r\nagain. Give me away, therefore, to this king, accepting his excellent\r\nsteeds. In this way, full eight hundred steeds may be obtained by thee\r\nfrom four kings in succession, and I also may have four sons. Collect\r\nthou the wealth intended for thy preceptor, in this way. Even this is\r\nwhat I think. It depends, however, oil thee, O Brahmana, as to how thou\r\nshouldst act.'

Taking then that maiden and worshipping Galava, the\r\nking in due time and place had by her a son of the kind wished for. And\r\nthe son so born came to be called by the name of Vasumanas. Richer than\r\nall the wealthy kings of the earth, and resembling one of the Vasus\r\nthemselves he became a king and giver of great wealth.\r\n\r\n'After some time, intelligent Galava came back and approaching the\r\ndelighted Haryyaswa, said unto him, 'Thou hast, O king obtained a son.\r\nIndeed, this child is like the sun himself in splendour. The time hath\r\ncome, O foremost of men, for me to go to some other king for alms.'\r\nHearing these words, Haryyaswa who was even truthful in speech and steady\r\nin acts of manliness, and remembering that the balance of six hundred\r\nsteeds could not be made up by him, gave Madhavi back to Galava. And\r\nMadhavi also, abandoning that blazing, kingly prosperity, and once more\r\nbecoming a maiden, followed the footsteps of Galava.

Garuda then, that\r\nforemost of all speakers, said unto Galava, 'Do not make any endeavour\r\n(to obtain the remaining two hundred), for it will not succeed. In days\r\nof yore, Richika sought at Kanyakuyja Gadhi's daughter, Satyavati, for\r\nmaking her his wife.'

Performing a sacrifice then of the name of\r\nPundarika, that monarch gave away those steeds (as Dakshina) unto the\r\nBrahmanas. The three kings to whom thou hadst applied had purchased those\r\nhorses from the Brahmanas, each to the number of two hundred.

Galava then, saying, 'So be it,' and taking with him both the\r\nmaiden and the steeds, went with Garuda in his company unto Viswamitra.\r\nAnd arrived in his presence, Galava said, 'Here are six hundred steeds of\r\nthe kind demanded by thee. And this maiden is offered as an equivalent\r\nfor the remaining two hundred. Let all these be accepted by thee. Upon\r\nthis maiden have been begotten three virtuous sons by three royal sages.\r\nLet a fourth, foremost of all, be begotten upon her by thee.

Four sons then, sanctifiers of my race, would all\r\nhave been mine alone. I accept this maiden of thine for begetting upon\r\nher one son. As regards the steeds, let them graze in my asylum.' Saying\r\nthis, Viswamitra of great effulgence began to pass his time happily with\r\nher, And Madhavi bore him a son of the name of Ashtaka. And as soon as\r\nthat son was born, the great Muni Viswamitra addressed him to both virtue\r\nand profit, and gave him those six hundred steeds. Ashtaka then went to a\r\ncity, bright as the city of Soma. And Kusika's son Viswamitra also having\r\nmade over the damsel to his disciple, himself went into the Woods. And\r\nGalava also, with his friend Suparna, having in this way succeeded in\r\ngiving his preceptor the fee he had demanded, with a cheerful heart\r\naddressed that maiden and said, 'Thou hast borne a son who is exceedingly\r\ncharitable, and another who is exceedingly brave, and a third who is\r\ndevoted to truth and righteousness, and yet another who is a performer of\r\ngreat sacrifices. O beautiful maiden, thou hast, by these sons, saved not\r\nonly thy father, but four kings and myself, also. Go now, O thou of\r\nslender waist.'

And both Puru and Yadu followed their\r\nsister to that sacred asylum. And in that spot was assembled a vast\r\nconcourse of Nagas and Yakshas and human beings, of Gandharvas and\r\nanimals and birds, and of dwellers of mountains and trees and forests,\r\nand of many inhabitants of that particular province. And the woods all\r\naround that asylum were filled with numerous Rishis resembling Brahman\r\nhimself. And while the selection had commenced of husband, that maiden of\r\nthe fairest complexion, passing over all the bridegrooms there assembled,\r\nselected the forest as her lord. Descending from her chariot and saluting\r\nall her friends, the daughter of Yayati went into the forest which is\r\nalways sacred, and devoted herself to ascetic austerities. Reducing her\r\nbody by means of fasts of various kinds and religious rites and rigid\r\nvows, she adopted the deer's mode of life And subsisting upon soft and\r\ngreen grass-blades, resembling the sprouts of lapis lazuli and which were\r\nboth bitter and sweet to the taste, and drinking the sweet, pure, cool,\r\ncrystal, and very superior water of sacred mountain-streams, and\r\nwandering with the deer in forests destitute of lions and tigers, in\r\ndeserts free from forest-conflagration, and in thick woods, that maiden,\r\nleading the life of a wild doe, earned great religious merit by the\r\npractice of Brahmacharya austerities.\r\n\r\n'(Meanwhile) king Yayati, following the practice of kings before him,\r\nsubmitted to the influence of Time, after having lived for many thousands\r\nof years.

Where did he earn ascetic\r\nmerit? For what hath he been known here? Who knoweth him?

And before\r\nthe king fell down, he thought within himself, 'What inauspicious and\r\nsinful thought was entertained by me in consequence of which I am hurled\r\nfrom my place?' And all the kings there, as also the Siddhas and the\r\nApsaras, laughed at seeing Yayati losing his hold, and on the point of\r\nfalling down. And soon, O king, at the command of the king of the gods,\r\nthere came a person whose business it was to hurl down those whose merits\r\nwere exhausted.

And those monarchs were then engaged in gratifying the lord\r\nof the celestials by performance of the sacrifice known by the name of\r\nVajapeya. And the smoke arising from their sacrificial altar reached the\r\nvery gates of heaven. And the smoke that rose thus, looked like a river\r\nconnecting both the earth and the heaven.

And thus, in consequence of the exhaustion\r\nof his merits, the royal sage Yayati fell amongst them. And beholding him\r\nblazing with beauty, those kings asked him, saying, \"Who art thou? Of\r\nwhat race, country, or city art thou? Art thou a Yaksha, or a god, a\r\nGandharva, or a Rakshasa? Thou does not seem to be a human being. What\r\nobject hast thou in view?' Thus questioned, Yayati answered, 'I am the\r\nroyal sage Yayati. Fallen am I from heaven in consequence of the\r\nexpiration of my virtue. Having desired to fall amongst the righteous, I\r\nhave fallen amongst you.' The kings then said, 'O foremost of persons,\r\nmay that wish of thine, be realized. Accept thou our virtues and the\r\nfruits of all our sacrifices.' Yayati replied saying, 'I am not a\r\nBrahmana competent to accept a gift. On the other hand, I am a Kshatriya.\r\nNor is my heart inclined towards lessening the virtues of others.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada continued, 'About this time, Madhavi, in course of her\r\npurposeless wanderings, came there.

Hearing these\r\nwords of theirs, Madhavi was filled with delight and approaching then her\r\nfather, she reverentially saluted Yayati. And touching the heads of all\r\nher sons, that lady engaged in ascetic austerities said to her father,\r\n'Being my sons these all are thy daughter's sons, O king of kings. They\r\nare not strangers to thee. These will save thee. The practice is not new,\r\nits origin extends to antiquity. I am thy daughter Madhavi, O king,\r\nliving in the woods after the manner of the deer. I also have earned\r\nvirtue. Take thou a moiety. And because, O king, all men have a right to\r\nenjoy a portion of the merits earned by their offspring, it is for this\r\nthat they desire to have daughter's sons. Even this was the case with\r\nthyself, O king (when thou madest me over to Galava).'

Be it all thine, O king. The merit that one\r\nwinneth by liberality and forgiveness, the merit that is mine in\r\nconsequence of the sacrifices I have performed, let all that also be\r\nthine.' After this, Pratardana, that bull among Kshatriyas, said, 'Ever\r\ndevoted to virtue as also to war, the fame that hath here been mine as a\r\nKshatriya, in consequence of the appellation of hero (by which I am\r\nknown),--be that merit thine. After this, Sivi, the intelligent son of\r\nUsinara, said these sweet words, 'Unto children and women in jest,\r\ndanger, or calamity, in distress, or at dice, I have never spoken a\r\nfalsehood. By that truth which I never sacrificed ascend thou to heaven.\r\nI can, O king, give up all objects of desire and enjoyment, my kingdom,\r\nyea, life itself, but truth I cannot give up. By that truth, ascend thou\r\nto heaven; that truth for which Dharma, that truth for which agni, that\r\ntruth for which he of a hundred sacrifices, have each been gratified with\r\nme, by that truth ascend thou to heaven.' And lastly, the royal sage\r\nAshtaka, the offspring of Kusika's son and Madhavi, addressing Nahusha's\r\nson Yayati who had performed many hundreds of sacrifices, said, 'I have,\r\nO lord, performed hundreds of Pundarika, Gosava and Vajapeya sacrifices.\r\nTake thou the merit of these. Wealth, gems, robes, I have spared nothing\r\nfor the performance of sacrifices. By that truth ascend thou to heaven.'\r\nAnd that king thereupon leaving the earth, began to ascend towards\r\nheaven, higher and higher, as those daughter's sons of his, one after\r\nanother, said those words unto him. And it was thus that those kings by\r\ntheir good acts, speedily saved Yayati, who had been hurled from heaven.\r\nIt was thus that those daughter's sons born in four royal lines, those\r\nmultipliers of their races, by means of their virtues, sacrifices, and\r\ngifts, caused their wise maternal grandfather to ascend again to heaven.\r\nAnd those monarchs jointly said, 'Endued with the attributes of royalty\r\nand possessed of every virtue, we are, O king, thy daughter's sons! (By\r\nvirtue of our good deeds) ascend thou to heaven.'\""

      "content": "\"Narada said, 'Sent back to heaven by those righteous kings,\r\ndistinguished by the liberality of their sacrificial presents, Yayati\r\npossessed of daughter's sons, dismissed them and reached the celestial\r\nregions. Attaining to the eternal region obtained through the merit of\r\nhis daughter's sons, and adorned by his own deeds, Yayati, bathed in\r\nshower of fragrant flowers and hugged by perfumed and delicious breezes,\r\nblazed forth with great beauty. And cheerfully, received back into heaven\r\nwith sounds of cymbals, he was entertained with songs and dances by\r\nvarious tribes of Gandharvas and Asuras. And diverse celestial and royal\r\nRishis and Charanas began to pay their adorations to him. And deities\r\nworshipped him with an excellent Arghya and delighted him with other\r\nhonours. And after he had thus regained heaven and tranquillity of heart,\r\nand had once more become freed from anxiety, the Grandsire, gratifying\r\nhim by his words said, 'Thou hadst earned the full measure I of virtue by\r\nthy earthly deeds, and this region (that thou hadst won) is eternal, as\r\nthy deeds are in heaven. Thou hadst, however, O royal sage, destroyed thy\r\nacquisition by thy vanity alone, and thereby covered the hearts of all\r\nthe denizens of heaven with darkness in consequence of which none of them\r\ncould recognise thee. And since thou couldst not be recognised, thou wert\r\nhurled hence! Saved once more by the love and affection of thy daughter's\r\nsons, thou hast once more arrived here, and regained this unchangeable,\r\neternal, sacred, excellent, stable, and indestructible region won before\r\nby thy own deeds.' Thus addressed, Yayati said, 'O holy one, I have a\r\ndoubt, which, it behoveth thee, to dispel. O Grandsire of all the worlds,\r\nit behoveth me not to ask any one else. Great was my merit, augmented by\r\na (virtuous) rule over my subjects for many thousands of years and won by\r\ninnumerable sacrifices and gifts. How could merit (so great) be exhausted\r\nso soon in consequence of which I was hurled hence? Thou knowest, O holy\r\none, that the regions created for me were all eternal. Why were all those\r\nregions of mine destroyed, O thou of great effulgence? The Grandsire\r\nanswered, saying, 'Thy merit, augmented by a (virtuous) rule over thy\r\nsubjects for many thousands of years and won by innumerable sacrifices\r\nand gifts, was exhausted by only one fault, in consequence of which thou\r\nwert hurled (from this region). That fault, O king of kings, was thy\r\nvanity for which thou hadst become an object of contempt with all the\r\nresidents of heaven. O royal sage, this region can never be rendered\r\neternal by vanity, or pride of strength, or malice, or deceitfulness, or\r\ndeception. Never disregard those that are inferior, or superior, or in\r\nthe middle station. There is not a greater sinner than he who is consumed\r\nby the fire of vanity. Those men that will converse upon this fall and\r\nre-ascension of thine, will, without doubt, be protected even if\r\novertaken by calamity.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada continued, 'O monarch, even such was the distress into which\r\nYayati fell in consequence of vanity, and such was the distress into\r\nwhich Galava fell owing to his obstinacy. They that desire their own good\r\nshould listen to friends that wish them well. Obstinacy should never be\r\nentertained, for obstinacy is always the root of ruin. For this reason, O\r\nson of Gandhari, forsake vanity and wrath, O hero, make peace with the\r\nsons of Pandu. Avoid anger, O king, that which is given away, that which\r\nis done, the austerities that are practised, the libations that are\r\npoured on fire, nor one of these is ever destroyed or suffereth any\r\ndiminution. None else, again, enjoyeth the fruits of these save he that\r\nis their agent. He that succeedeth in understanding this truly superior\r\nand excellent history, that is approved by persons of great learning as\r\nwell as by those that are freed from anger and lust, and that is enforced\r\nby various references to scriptures and reason, obtaineth a knowledge of\r\nvirtue and profit and desire, and enjoyeth the sovereignty of the whole\r\nworld!'\""

My wish also is precisely such, but, O holy one, I have no power\r\n(to carry them out)!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Kuru king, having said these words unto\r\nNarada, then addressed Krishna and said, 'Thou hast, O Kesava, told me\r\nthat which leadeth to heaven, what is beneficial to the world, consistent\r\nwith virtue, and fraught with reason. I am not, however, O sire,\r\nindependent. Duryodhana never doth what is agreeable to me. Do thou,\r\ntherefore, O mighty-armed Krishna, O best of persons, strive to persuade\r\nthat foolish and wicked son of mine, who disobeyeth my commands. O\r\nmighty-armed one, he never listeneth to the beneficial words, O\r\nHrishikesa, of Gandhari, or of wise Vidura, or of other friends headed by\r\nBhishma, all of whom seek his good. Do thou, therefore, thyself counsel\r\nthat crooked, senseless, and wicked-souled prince, of evil disposition\r\nand sinful heart. By doing this, O Janardana, thou shalt have done that\r\nnoble act which a friend should ever do.' Thus addressed, he of Vrishni's\r\nrace, conversant with the truths of virtue and profit, approached nearer\r\nto the ever-wrathful Duryodhana and said unto him these sweet words, 'O\r\nDuryodhana, O best of the Kurus, listen to these words of mine, uttered\r\nespecially for thy good, as also, O Bharata, for that of thy followers,\r\nThou art born in a race that is distinguished for its great wisdom. It\r\nbehoveth thee to act righteously as I indicate. Possessed of learning and\r\nendued with excellent behaviour, thou art adorned with every excellent\r\nquality. They that are born in ignoble families, or are wicked-souled,\r\ncruel, and shameless, they only, O sire, act in the way that seemeth\r\nacceptable to thee. In this world, the inclinations of those only that\r\nare righteous seem to be consistent with the dictates of virtue and\r\nprofit. The inclinations, however, of those that are unrighteous seem to\r\nbe perverse. O bull of Bharata's race, the disposition that thou art\r\nrepeatedly manifesting is of that perverse kind. Persistence in such\r\nbehaviour is sinful, frightful, highly wicked, and capable of leading to\r\ndeath itself. It is besides, causeless, while, again, thou canst not, O\r\nBharata, adhere to it long. If by avoiding this which is productive only\r\nof woe, thou wilt achieve thy own good, if, O chastiser of foes, thou\r\nwilt escape from the sinful and disreputable deeds of thy brothers,\r\nfollowers, and counsellors, then, O tiger among men, make peace, O bull\r\namong the Bharatas, with the sons of Pandu who are all endued with great\r\nwisdom and great bravery with great exertion and great learning an all of\r\nwhom have their souls under complete control. Such conduct will be\r\nagreeable to and conducive to the happiness of Dhritarashtra who is\r\nendued with great wisdom, of grandsire (Bhishma), Drona, the high-souled\r\nKripa, Somadatta, wise Vahlika, Aswatthaman, Vikarna, Sanjaya,\r\nVivingsati, and of many of thy kinsmen, O chastiser of foes, and many of\r\nthy friends also. The whole world, O sire, will derive benefit from that\r\npeace. Thou art endued with modesty, born in a noble race, hast learning\r\nand kindness of heart. Be obedient, O sire, to the commands of thy\r\nfather, and also of thy mother, O bull of Bharata's race. They that are\r\ngood sons always regard that to be beneficial which their fathers\r\ncommand. Indeed, when overtaken by calamity, every one recollects the\r\ninjunctions of his father. Peace with the Pandavas, O sire, recommend\r\nitself to thy father. Let it, therefore, O chief of the Kurus recommend\r\nitself to thee also with thy counsellors. That mortal who having listened\r\nto the counsels of friends doth not act according to them, is consumed at\r\nthe end by the consequences of his disregard, like him who swalloweth the\r\nfruit called Kimpaka. He that from folly doth not accept beneficial\r\ncounsels, unnerved by procrastination and unable to attain his object, is\r\nobliged to repent at last. He, on the other hand, who having listened to\r\nbeneficial counsels accepteth them at once, abandoning his opinion,\r\nalways winneth happiness in the world. He that rejects the words of\r\nwell-meaning friends, regarding those words as opposed to his interest,\r\nbut accepts words that are really so opposed, is soon subjugated by his\r\nfoes. Disregarding the opinions of the righteous he that abideth by the\r\nopinions of the wicked, soon maketh his friends weep for him in\r\nconsequence of his being plunged into distress. Forsaking superior\r\ncounsellors he that seeketh the advice of inferior ones, soon falleth\r\ninto great distress and succeedeth not in saving himself. That companion\r\nof the sinful, who behaveth falsely and never listeneth to good friends,\r\nwho honoureth strangers but hateth those that are his own, is soon, O\r\nBharata, cast off by the Earth. O bull of Bharata's race, having\r\nquarrelled with those (the sons of Pandu), thou seekest protection from\r\nothers viz., those that are sinful, incapable, and foolish. What other\r\nman is there on earth besides thee, who, disregarding kinsmen, that are\r\nall mighty charioteers, and each of whom resembleth Sakra himself, would\r\nseek protection and aid from strangers? Thou hast persecuted the sons of\r\nKunti, from their very birth. They have not been angry with thee, for the\r\nsons of Pandu are indeed virtuous. Although thou hast behaved deceitfully\r\ntowards the Pandavas from their very birth, yet, O mighty-armed one,\r\nthose distinguished persons have acted generously towards thee. It\r\nbehoveth thee, therefore, O bull of Bharata's race, to act towards those\r\nprincipal kinsmen of thine with equal generosity. Do not yield thyself to\r\nthe influence of wrath. O bull of Bharata's race, the exertions of the\r\nwise are always associated with virtue, profit, and desire. If, indeed,\r\nall these three cannot be attained, men follow at least virtue and\r\nprofit. If, again, these three are pursued separately, it is seen that\r\nthey that have their hearts under control, choose virtue; they that are\r\nneither good nor bad but occupy a middle station, choose profit, which is\r\nalways the subject of dispute; while they that are fools choose the\r\ngratification of desire. The fool that from temptation giveth up virtue\r\nand pursueth profit and desire by unrighteous means, is soon destroyed by\r\nhis senses. He that speaketh profit and desire, should yet practise\r\nvirtue at the outset, for neither profit nor desire is (really)\r\ndissociated from virtue. O king, it hath been said that virtue alone is\r\nthe cause of the three, for he that seeketh the three, may, by the aid of\r\nvirtue alone, grow like fire when brought into contact with a heap of dry\r\ngrass. O bull of Bharata's race, thou seeketh, O sire, by unrighteous\r\nmeans this extensive empire, flourishing with prosperity and well-known\r\nto all the monarchs of the earth. O king, he that behaveth falsely\r\ntowards those that live and conduct themselves righteously, certainly\r\ncutteth down his own self, like a forest with an axe. One must not seek\r\nto confound his understanding whose overthrow one doth not like, for, if\r\none's understanding is confounded, one can never devote his attention to\r\nwhat is beneficial. One that hath his soul under control never, O\r\nBharata, disregardeth anybody in the three worlds,--no, not even the\r\ncommonest creature, far less those bulls among men, the sons of Pandu. He\r\nthat surrendereth himself to the influence of anger loseth his sense of\r\nright and wrong. Rank growth must always be cut off. Behold, O Bharata,\r\nthis is the proof. At present, O sire, union with the sons of Pandu is\r\nbetter for thee than thy union with the wicked. If thou makest peace with\r\nthem, thou mayst obtain the fruition of all thy wishes. O best of kings,\r\nwhile enjoying the kingdom that has been founded by the Pandavas, thou\r\nseekest protection from others, disregarding the Pandavas themselves.\r\nReposing the cares of thy state on Dussasana, Durvisaha, Karna, and\r\nSuvala's son, thou desirest the continuance of thy prosperity, O Bharata.\r\nThese, however, are far inferior to the Pandavas in knowledge, in virtue,\r\nin capacity for acquiring wealth, and in prowess. Indeed, O Bharata, (let\r\nalone the four I have mentioned) all these kings together, with thee at\r\ntheir head, are incapable of even looking at the face of Bhima, when\r\nangry, on the field of battle. O sire, this force consisting of all the\r\nkings of the earth is, indeed, at thy elbow. There are also Bhishma, and\r\nDrona, and this Karna, and Kripa, and Bhurisrava, and Somadatta, and\r\nAswatthaman, and Jayadratha. All these together are incapable of fighting\r\nagainst Dhananjaya. Indeed, Arjuna is incapable of being vanquished in\r\nbattle even by all the gods, Asuras, men, and Gandharvas. Do not set thy\r\nheart for battle. Seest thou the man in any of the royal races of the\r\nearth, who having encountered Arjuna in battle can return home safe and\r\nsound? O bull of Bharata's race, what advantage is there in a universal\r\nslaughter? Show me a single man who will defeat that Arjuna, by defeating\r\nwhom alone victory may be thine? Who will encounter that son of Pandu in\r\nbattle, who had vanquished all the celestials with the Gandharvas,\r\nYakshas and Pannagas at Khandavaprastha? Then also the marvellous account\r\nthat is heard of what happened at Virata's city, touching that encounter\r\nbetween one and many, is sufficient proof of this, Hopest thou to\r\nvanquish in battle Arjuna who when excited with rage is invincible,\r\nirresistible, ever-victorious, and undeteriorating Arjuna, that hero, who\r\ngratified the God of gods, Siva himself in fight? With myself again as\r\nhis second when that son of Pritha will rush to the field of battle\r\nagainst an enemy, who is there that is competent to challenge him then?\r\nCan Purandara himself do so? He that would vanquish Arjuna in battle\r\nwould support the Earth on his arms, consume in rage the whole population\r\nof the Earth, and hurl the very gods from heaven. Look at thy sons, thy\r\nbrothers, kinsmen, and other relatives. Let not these chiefs of Bharata's\r\nrace all perish on thy account. Let not the race of Kauravas be\r\nexterminated or reduced. O king, let not people say that thou art the\r\nexterminator of thy race and the destroyer of its achievements. Those\r\nmighty car-warriors, the Pandavas (if peace be made) will install thee as\r\nthe Yuvaraja, and thy father Dhritarashtra, that lord of men, as the\r\nsovereign of this extensive empire. Do not, O sire, disregard the\r\nprosperity that is awaiting thee and is sure to come. Giving to the sons\r\nof Pritha half the kingdom, win thou great prosperity. Making peace with\r\nthe Pandavas and acting according to the counsels of thy friends, and\r\nrejoicing with them, thou art sure to obtain what is for thy good for\r\never and ever.'\""

After this, king\r\nDhritarashtra, addressing Duryodhana, seated in the midst of his brothers\r\nand surrounded by all the kings, said, 'Listen, O Duryodhana, to what the\r\nhigh-souled Sauri hath said.

If, O Madhava, we are, in the\r\nobservance of the practices of our order, cut off with weapons in battle,\r\nwhen our end comes, even that will lead us to heaven. Even this, O\r\nJanardana, is our highest duty as Kshatriyas, viz., that we should lay\r\nourselves down on the field of battle on a bed of arrows. If, without\r\nbowing to our enemies, ours be the bed of arrows in battle, that, O\r\nMadhava, will never grieve us. Who is there, born in a noble race and\r\nconforming to Kshatriya practices, that would from fear bow to an enemy,\r\ndesirous only of saving his life? Those Kshatriyas that desire their own\r\ngood, accept regardfully this saying of Matanga, viz., that (as regards a\r\nKshatriya), one should always keep himself erect, and never bow down, for\r\nexertion alone is manliness; one should rather break at the knots than\r\nbend. A person like me should only bow down to the Brahmanas for the sake\r\nof piety, without regarding anybody else. (As regards persons other than\r\nBrahmanas), one should, as long as one lives, act according to Matanga's\r\nsaying. Even this is the duty of Kshatriyas; even this is ever my\r\nopinion. That share in the kingdom which was formerly given them by my\r\nfather shall never again, O Kesava, be obtainable by them as long as I\r\nlive. As long, O Janardana, as king Dhritarashtra liveth, both ourselves\r\nand they, sheathing our weapons, O Madhava, should live in dependence on\r\nhim. Given away formerly from ignorance or fear, when I was a child and\r\ndependent on others, the kingdom, O Janardana, incapable of being given\r\naway again, shall not, O delighter of Vrishni's race, be obtainable by\r\nthe Pandavas. At present, O Kesava of mighty arms, as long as I live,\r\neven that much of our land which may be covered by the point of a sharp\r\nneedle shall not, O Madhava, be given by us unto the Pandavas.'\""

Verily,\r\nthou shalt have it, with thy consellors. Wait (for a short while), a\r\ngreat slaughter will ensue. Thou thinkest, O thou of little\r\nunderstanding, that thou hast committed no offence against the Pandavas?\r\nLet the (assembled) monarchs judge. Grieved at the prosperity of the\r\nhigh-souled Pandavas, thou conspirest, O Bharata, with Suvala's son about\r\nthe gambling match. O sire, how could those virtuous, honest, and\r\nsuperior kinsmen of thine (otherwise) engage in such a wicked act with\r\nthe deceitful Sakuni? O thou that art endued with great wisdom, gambling\r\nrobs even the good of their understanding, and as regards the wicked,\r\ndisunion and dire consequence spring from it. It was thou who hadst\r\ndevised with thy wicked counsellors, that terrible source of calamity in\r\nthe form of the gambling match, without consulting with persons of\r\nrighteous behaviour. Who else is there, capable of insulting a brother's\r\nwife in the way thou didst or of dragging her into the assembly and\r\naddressing her in language thou hadst used towards Draupadi? Of noble\r\nparentage, and endued with excellent behaviour, and dearer to them than\r\ntheir very lives, the queen-consort of Pandu's sons was treated even thus\r\nby thee. All the Kauravas know what words were addressed in their\r\nassembly by Dussasana unto those chastisers of foes,--the sons of\r\nKunti,--when they were about to set out for the woods. Who is there\r\ncapable of behaving so wretchedly towards his own honest kinsmen, that\r\nare ever engaged in the practice of virtue, that are untainted by\r\navarice, and that are always correct in their behaviour? Language such as\r\nbecomes only those that are heartless and despicable, was frequently\r\nrepeated by Karna and Dussasana and also by thee. Thou hadst taken great\r\npains to burn to death, at Varanavata, the sons of Pandu with their\r\nmother, while they were children, although that effort of thine was not\r\ncrowned with success. After this, the Pandavas with their mother were\r\nobliged to live for a long while, concealed in the town of Ekachakra in\r\nthe abode of a Brahmana. With poison, with snakes and cords, thou hadst,\r\nby every means, sought the destruction of the Pandavas, although none of\r\nthy designs was successful. With such feelings when thou hadst always\r\nacted towards them so deceitfully, how canst thou say that thou hast not\r\noffended against the high-souled Pandavas? Thou art not, O sinful man,\r\nwilling to give them their paternal share in the kingdom, although they\r\nare begging it of thee. Thou shalt have to give it them, this, when\r\ndivested of prosperity, thou shalt be laid low. Having, like a heartless\r\nfellow, done innumerable wrongs to the Pandavas and behaved so\r\ndeceitfully towards them, thou seekest now to appear in a different garb.\r\nThough repeatedly solicited by thy parents, by Bhishma, Drona, and\r\nVidura, to make peace, thou dost not yet, O king, make peace. Great is\r\nthe advantage in peace, O king, both to thyself and Yudhishthira. Peace,\r\nhowever, does not recommend itself to thee. To what else can it be due,\r\nbut to thy loss of understanding? Transgressing the words of thy friends,\r\nthou canst never attain to what is for thy benefit. Sinful and\r\ndisreputable is that act, which thou, O king, art about to do.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'While he, of Dasarha's race, was saying this,\r\nDussasana addressed vindictive Duryodhana and said unto him these words\r\nin the midst of the Kurus, If, O king, thou dost not willingly make peace\r\nwith the Pandavas, verity the Kauravas will bind thee (hand and foot) and\r\nmake over thee to the son of Kunti. Bhishma, and Drona, and thy (own)\r\nfather, O bull amongst men, will make over us three, viz., Vikartana's\r\nson, thyself, and myself, to the Pandavas!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of his brother,\r\nDhritarashtra's son, wicked, shameless, disobedient, disrespectful, and\r\nvain Suyodhana, breathing heavily like a great snake rose up from his\r\nseat in anger, and disregarding Vidura, and Dhritarashtra and the great\r\nking Vahlika, and Kripa, and Somadatta, and Bhishma, and Drona, and\r\nJanardana, in fact, all of them, went out of the court, And beholding\r\nthat bull among men leave the court, his brother and all his counsellors,\r\nand all the kings, followed him. And seeing Duryodhana rise and leave the\r\ncourt in anger with his brothers, Santanu's son, Bhishma said, 'The\r\nenemies of that person, who, abandoning both virtue and profit, followeth\r\nthe impulses of wrath, rejoice on beholding him plunged into distress at\r\nno distant date. This wicked son of Dhritarashtra, this one unacquainted\r\nwith the true means (of accomplishing his objects), this fool that is\r\nwrongly vain of his sovereignty, obeyeth only the dictates of wrath and\r\navarice. I see also, O Janardana, that the hour of all those Kshatriyas\r\nis arrived, for all those kings, from delusion, have with their\r\ncounsellors followed Duryodhana.' Hearing these words of Bhishma, the\r\nlotus-eyed hero of Dasarha's race, possessed of great powers, addressing\r\nall those (that were still there) headed by Bhishma and Drona, said,\r\n'Even this is great transgression, of which all the elders of the Kuru\r\nrace are becoming guilty, for they do not forcibly seize and bind this\r\nwicked king in the enjoyment of sovereignty. Ye chastiser of foes, I\r\nthink the time hath come for doing this. If this is done, it may still be\r\nproductive of good. Listen to me, ye sinless ones. The words I will speak\r\nwill soon lead to beneficial results, if, indeed, ye Bharatas, ye accept\r\nwhat I say in consequence of its recommending itself to you. The wicked\r\nson, of ill-regulated soul, of the old Bhoja king, having usurped his\r\nfather's sovereignty during the latter's life-time, subjected himself to\r\ndeath. Indeed, Kansa, the son of Ugrasena, abandoned by his relatives,\r\nwas slain by me in a great encounter, from desire of benefiting my\r\nkinsmen. Ourselves with our kinsmen then, having paid due honours to\r\nUgrasena, the son of Ahuka, installed that extender of Bhoja's kingdom on\r\nthe throne. And all the Yadavas and Andhakas and the Vrishnis, abandoning\r\na single person, viz., Kansa for the sake of their whole race, have\r\nprospered and obtained happiness. O king, when the gods and Asuras were\r\narrayed for battle and weapons were upraised for striking, the lord of\r\nall creatures, Parameshthin said thus (something which applies to the\r\ncase at hand). Indeed, O Bharata, when the population of the worlds was\r\ndivided into two parties and was about to be slaughtered, the divine and\r\nholy Cause of the universe, viz., the Creator, said, 'The Asuras and the\r\nDaityas with the Danavas will be vanquished, and the Adityas, the Vasus,\r\nthe Rudras and other dwellers of heaven will be victorious. Indeed, the\r\ngods, and Asuras, and human beings, and Gandharvas, and Snakes, and\r\nRakshasas, will in rage slaughter one another in this battle.' Thinking\r\nso, the Lord of all creatures, Parameshthin, commanded Dharma, saying,\r\n'Binding fast, the Daityas and the Danavas, make them over to Varuna.'\r\nThus addressed, Dharma, at the command of Parameshthin, binding the\r\nDaityas and the Danavas, made them over to Varuna. And Varuna, the Lord\r\nof the waters, having bound those Danavas, with Dharma's noose, as also\r\nwith his own, keepeth them within the depths of the ocean, always\r\nguarding them carefully. Binding in the same way Duryodhana and Karna and\r\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, and Dussasana, make them over to the Pandavas.\r\nFor the sake of a family, an individual may be sacrificed. For a village,\r\na family may be sacrificed. For the sake of a province, a village may be\r\nsacrificed. And lastly, for the sake of one's self, the whole earth may\r\nbe sacrificed. O monarch, binding Duryodhana fast, make peace with the\r\nPandavas. O bull among Kshatriyas, let not the whole Kshatriya race be\r\nslaughtered on thy account.'\""

And the king said, 'Go, O child, unto Gandhari, possessed of\r\ngreat wisdom and foresight and bring her hither. With her I will solicit\r\nthis wicked-hearted (son of mine). If she can pacify this wicked wretch,\r\nof evil heart, we may yet be able to act according to the words of our\r\nfriend Krishna. It may be that speaking words in recommendation of peace,\r\nshe may yet succeed in pointing out the right path to this fool,\r\nafflicted by avarice and having wicked allies, If she can dispel this\r\ngreat and dreadful calamity (about to be) occasioned by Duryodhana, it\r\nwill then conduce to the attainment and preservation of happiness and\r\npeace for ever and ever.' Hearing these words of the king, Vidura, at\r\nDhritarashtra's command, brought (thither) Gandhari, possessed of great\r\nforesight. And Dhritarashtra then addressed Gandhari and said, 'Behold, O\r\nGandhari, this thy son of wicked soul, transgressing all my commands, is\r\nabout to sacrifice both sovereignty and life in consequence of his lust\r\nfor sovereignty. Of wicked soul and little understanding, he hath, like\r\none of uncultivated mind, left the court, with his sinful counsellors,\r\ndisregarding his superiors and setting at naught the words of his\r\nwell-wishers.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of her husband, that princess of\r\ngreat fame, Gandhari, desirous of what was highly beneficial, said these\r\nwords, 'Bring hither, without loss of time, that kingdom-coveting, sick\r\nson of mine. He that is of uncultivated heart and sacrificeth both virtue\r\nand profit, doth not deserve to govern a kingdom. For all that, however,\r\nDuryodhana, who is destitute of humility hath, by every means, obtained a\r\nkingdom. Indeed, O Dhritarashtra, thou so fond of thy son, art very much\r\nto be blamed for this, for knowing well his sinfulness, thou followest\r\nyet his counsel. That son of thine, completely possessed by lust and\r\nwrath is now the slave of delusion, and is, therefore, incapable, O king,\r\nof being now forcibly turned back by thee. Thou art now reaping the\r\nfruit, O Dhritarashtra, of having made over the kingdom to an ignorant\r\nfool of wicked soul, possessed by avarice and having wicked counsellors.\r\nWhy is the king indifferent (today) to that disunion, which is about to\r\ntake place between persons related so closely? Indeed, beholding thee\r\ndisunited with those that are thy own, thy enemies will laugh at thee.\r\nWho is there that would use force for getting over that calamity, O king,\r\nwhich can be overcome by conciliation and gift?'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Kshattri then, and at Dhritarashtra's command,\r\nand of his mother's also, once more caused vindictive Duryodhana to enter\r\nthe court. Expectant of his mother's words, the prince re-entered the\r\ncourt, with eyes red as copper from wrath, and breathing heavily as a\r\nsnake. And beholding her son, who was treading in a wrong path, enter the\r\ncourt, Gandhari rebuked him severely and said these words for bringing\r\nabout peace.'\r\n\r\n\"Gandhari said, 'O Duryodhana, attend, O dear son, to these words of mine\r\nthat are beneficial to thee as also to all thy followers,--words that\r\nthou art competent to obey and that will conduce to thy happiness. O\r\nDuryodhana, obey thou the words of thy well-wishers, those words, viz.,\r\nwhich that best of the Bharatas--thy father--and Bhishma, and Drona, and\r\nKripa, and Kshattri, have spoken. If thou makest peace, thou wouldst by\r\nthat render homage to Bhishma, to thy father, to me, and to all thy\r\nwell-wishers with Drona at their head. O thou of great wisdom, nobody, O\r\nbest of the Bharatas, succeedeth by his own desire alone in acquiring and\r\nkeeping or enjoying a kingdom. One that hath not his senses under\r\ncontrol, cannot enjoy sovereignty for any length of time. He that hath\r\nhis soul under control and is endued with great intelligence, can rule a\r\nkingdom. Lust and wrath wean away a man from his possessions and\r\nenjoyments. Conquering these foes first, a king bringeth the earth under\r\nhis subjection. Sovereignty over men is a great thing. Those that are of\r\nwicked souls may easily desire to win a kingdom, but they are not\r\ncompetent to retain a kingdom (when won). He that desireth to obtain\r\nextensive empire must bind his senses to both profit and virtue, for if\r\nthe senses are restrained, intelligence increaseth, like fire that\r\nincreaseth when fed with fuel. If not controlled, these can even slay\r\ntheir possessor, like unbroken and furious horses, capable of killing an\r\nunskilful driver. One that seeketh to conquer his counsellors without\r\nconquering his own self, and to conquer foes without conquering his\r\ncounsellors, is soon vanquished himself and is ruined. He who conquereth\r\nhis own self first, taking it for a foe, will not seek in vain to conquer\r\nhis counsellors and enemies afterwards. Prosperity worshippeth greatly\r\nthat person who hath conquered his senses and his counsellors, who\r\ninflicteth punishments on transgressors, who acteth after deliberation,\r\nand who is possessed of wisdom. Lust and wrath that dwell in the body are\r\ndeprived of their strength by wisdom, like a couple of fishes ensnared in\r\na net with close holes. Those two in consequence of which the gods shut\r\nthe gates of heaven against one, who freed from worldly propensities is\r\ndesirous of going thither, are excited by lust and wrath. That king who\r\nknoweth well how to conquer lust and wrath and avarice and boastfulness\r\nand pride, can own the sovereignty of the whole earth. That king who is\r\ndesirous of gaining wealth and virtue and vanquishing his enemies, should\r\nalways be engaged in controlling his passions. Influenced by lust, or\r\nfrom wrath, he that behaveth deceitfully towards his own kinsmen or\r\nothers, can never win many allies. Uniting thyself with those chastisers\r\nof foes--the heroic sons of Pandu--who are all endued with great wisdom,\r\nthou canst, O son, enjoy the earth in happiness. What Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu, and that mighty car-warrior, Drona, have told thee is, O son,\r\nquite true,--Krishna and Dhananjaya are invincible. Seek thou, therefore,\r\nthe protection of this mighty-armed one, this one that is not worried by\r\nexertion, for if Kesava becometh gracious, both sides will be happy. That\r\nmin, who is not obedient to the wishes of wise and learned friends,\r\nalways seeking his prosperity, only gladdeneth his enemies. O son, there\r\nis no good in battle, no virtue, no profit. How can it bring happiness\r\nthen? Even victory is not always certain. Do not set thy heart,\r\ntherefore, on battle. O thou of great wisdom, Bhishma and thy father and\r\nVahlika (formerly) gave unto the Pandavas their share (of the kingdom)\r\nfrom fear. O chastiser of foes, never think of disunion with them. Thou\r\nbeholdest today the fruit of that (peaceful) cession in the fact of thy\r\nsovereignty over the whole earth, with all its thorns removed by those\r\nheroes. Give, O chastiser of foes, unto the son of Pandu what is their\r\ndue. If thou wishest to enjoy, with the counsellors even half (the\r\nempire), let their share then be given unto them. Half the earth is\r\nsufficient to yield the means of support unto thee and thy counsellors.\r\nBy acting according to the words of thy well-wishers, thou wilt, O\r\nBharata, win great fame. A quarrel with the sons of Pandu who are all\r\nendued with prosperity, who have their souls under complete control, who\r\nare possessed of great intelligence and have conquered their passions,\r\nwill only divest thee of thy great prosperity. Dispelling the wrath of\r\nall thy well-wishers, rule thou thy kingdom as becometh thee, giving, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, unto the sons of Pandu the share that belongeth\r\nto them. O son, persecution of the sons of Pandu for full thirteen years\r\nhath been enough. Augmented by lust and wrath, quench (that fire) now, O\r\nthou of great wisdom. Thou that covetest the wealth of the Pandavas are\r\nnot a match for them, nor this Suta's son, who is exceedingly wrathful,\r\nnor this thy brother Dussasana. Indeed, when Bhishma and Drona and Kripa\r\nand Karna and Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and Dhrishtadyumna will be\r\nenraged, the population of the earth will be exterminated. Under the\r\ninfluence of wrath, do not, O son, exterminate the Kurus. Let not the\r\nwide earth be destroyed for thy sake. Of little understanding as thou\r\nart, thou thinkest that Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, all others will\r\nfight (for thee) with all their might. That will never happen, for as\r\nregards these, that are endued with self-knowledge, their affection\r\ntowards the Pandavas and yourselves is equal. If for the sake of the\r\nsustenance they have obtained from the king (Dhritarashtra), they consent\r\nto yield up their very lives, they will not yet be able to cast angry\r\nglances upon king Yudhishthira. It is never seen in this world that men\r\nacquire wealth by avarice. Give up thy avarice then, O son, and desist, O\r\nbull of Bharat's race.'\""

And wending away from the court, the Kuru\r\nprince began to consult with Suvala's royal son, Sakuni, most clever in\r\ndice. And this was the resolution which Duryodhana and Karna and Suvala's\r\nson Sakuni, with Dussasana as their fourth, arrived at, 'This Janardana,\r\nquick in action, seeketh, with the king Dhritarashtra and Santanu's son,\r\nto seize us first. We, however, shall forcibly seize this tiger among\r\nmen, Hrishikesa, first, like Indra forcibly seizing Virochana's son\r\n(Vali). Hearing that this one of Vrishni's race hath been seized, the\r\nPandavas will lose their heart and become incapable of exertion, like\r\nsnakes whose fangs have been broken. This mighty-armed one is, indeed,\r\nthe refuge and protection of them all. If this grantor of wishes, this\r\nbull of all the Satwatas, be confined, the Pandavas with the Somakas will\r\nbecome depressed and incapable of any exertion. Therefore, disregarding\r\nDhritarashtra's cries, we will seize even here this Kesava, who is quick\r\nin action, and then fight with the foe.' After those sinful men of wicked\r\nsouls had come to this sinful resolution, highly intelligent Satyaki,\r\ncapable of reading the heart by signs, soon came to know of it. And\r\nbecause of that knowledge, he soon issued out of the court, accompanied\r\nby Hridika's son (Kritavarman). And Satyaki addressed Kritavarman,\r\nsaying, 'Array the troops soon. And accoutred in mail and with thy troops\r\narrayed for battle, wait thou at the entrance of the court, till I\r\nrepresent this matter unto Krishna, unwearied by exertion.' Saying this,\r\nthat hero re-entered the court, like a lion entering a mountain-cave. And\r\nhe (first) informed the high-souled Kesava and then Dhritarashtra, and\r\nthen Vidura of that conspiracy. And having informed them of that\r\nresolution, he laughingly said, 'These wicked men intended to commit an\r\nact here, that is disapproved by the good from consideration of virtue,\r\nprofit, and desire. They will, however, never be able to actually achieve\r\nit. These fools of sinful souls assembled together, these wretches\r\noverwhelmed by lust, anger and yielding themselves up to wrath and\r\ncovetousness, are about to perpetrate a highly unbecoming deed. Those\r\nwretches of little understanding and desirous of seizing the lotus-eyed,\r\nare like idiots and children desiring to seize a blazing fire by means of\r\ntheir garments.' Hearing these words of Satyaki, Vidura, endued with\r\ngreat foresight, said these words unto the mighty-armed Dhritarashtra in\r\nthe midst of the Kurus, 'O king, O chastiser of foes, the hour of all thy\r\nsons is come, for they are endeavouring to perpetrate a highly infamous\r\nact, however incapable they may be of actually accomplishing it. Alas,\r\nunited together they desire to vanquish this younger brother of Vasava,\r\nand seize this lotus-eyed one. Indeed, encountering this tiger among men,\r\nthis invincible and irresistible one, they will all perish like insects\r\nin a blazing fire. If Janardana wisheth, he can send all of them, even if\r\nthey fight in a body, unto the abode of Yama, like an enraged lion\r\ndispatching a herd of elephants. He will, however, never do any such\r\nsinful and censurable act. This best of persons, of unfading glory, will\r\nnever deviate from virtue.' After Vidura had said these words, Kesava,\r\ncasting his eyes on Dhritarashtra, said in the midst of those\r\nwell-meaning persons, who listen to others' words, 'O king, if these\r\n(men) desire to chastise me by using violence, permit them to chastise\r\nme. O monarch, as regards my chastising them, for I dare chastise all of\r\nthem together that are so excited with rage, I will not, however,\r\nperpetrate any sinful and censurable act. Coveting the possessions of the\r\nPandavas, thy sons will lose their own. If they desire to perpetrate such\r\na deed, Yudhishthira's object will then be (easily) accomplished, for,\r\nthis very day, O Bharata, seizing these with all that follow them, I can\r\nmake them over to the sons of Pritha. What is there that is difficult of\r\nattainment by me? I will not, however, O Bharata, commit in thy presence,\r\nO great monarch, any such censurable deed, that can proceed only from\r\nwrath and a sinful understanding. Let it be, O king, as this Duryodhana\r\ndesireth. I give permission, O monarch, to all thy sons to do it.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words (of Kesava), Dhritarashtra addressed Vidura saying,\r\n'Quickly bring hither sinful Duryodhana, who is so covetous of\r\nsovereignty, with his friends, counsellors, brothers, and followers. I\r\nshall see if indeed, making one more effort I can bring him to the right\r\npath.\r\n\r\n'Thus addressed by Dhritarashtra, Kshattri once more caused unwilling\r\nDuryodhana to enter the court with his brothers, and surrounded by the\r\nkings (that followed him). King Dhritarashtra then addressed Duryodhana,\r\nsurrounded by Karna and Dussasana and all those kings, saying, 'O wretch\r\nof accumulated sins, having for thy allies men of despicable acts,\r\ninfamous is the deed that thou, uniting with sinful friends, seekest to\r\ndo. Of little understanding, thou, infamy of thy race, one like thee\r\nalone can seek to do an act so infamous and disapproved by the good,\r\nhowever impossible it may be of being actually achieved. Uniting with\r\nsinful allies, wishest thou to chastise this invincible and irresistible\r\none of eyes like lotus-leaves? Like a child wishing to have the moon,\r\nseekest thou, O fool, to do what cannot be done by the very gods, headed\r\nby Vasava with all their strength? Knowest thou not, that Kesava is\r\nincapable of being withstood in battle by gods and men and Gandharvas and\r\nAsuras and Uragas? Like the wind which none can seize of being seized\r\nwith his hands, like the moon which no hand can reach, like the Earth\r\nwhich none can support on his head, Kesava is incapable by force.'\r\n\r\n\"After Dhritarashtra had said these words, Vidura (casting) his eyes on\r\nDuryodhana, addressed that vindictive son of Dhritarashtra, saying, 'O\r\nDuryodhana, listen now to these words of mine. At the gates of Saubha,\r\nthat foremost of monkeys, known by the name of Dwivida, covered Kesava\r\nwith a mighty shower of stones. Desirous of seizing Madhava by putting\r\nforth all his prowess and exertion, he did not yet succeed in seizing\r\nhim. Seekest thou to apprehend that Kesava by force? When Sauri went to\r\nPragjyotisha, Naraka with all the Danavas succeeded not in seizing him\r\nthere. Seekest thou to seize him by force? Slaying that Naraka in battle,\r\nhe brought away (from his city) a thousand damsels and married them all,\r\naccording to the ordinance. In the city of Nirmochana, six thousand\r\nmighty Asuras failed to seize him with their nooses. Seekest thou to\r\nseize that Kesava by force? While only a child, he slew Putana and two\r\nAsuras assuming the shape of birds, and O bull of Bharata's race, he held\r\nup the mountains of Govardhana (on his little finger) for protecting the\r\nkine (from a continuous rain). He hath also slain Aristha, and Dhenuka\r\nand Chanura of great strength, and Aswaraja, and Kansa, the doer of evil.\r\nHe hath slain Jarasandha, and Vakra, and Sisupala of mighty energy, and\r\nVana in battle, and numerous other kings also have been slain by him. Of\r\nimmeasurable might, he vanquished king Varuna and also Pavaka (Agni), and\r\non the occasion of bringing (down from the celestial regions) the\r\n(heavenly flower called) Parijata, he defeated the lord of Sachi himself.\r\nWhile floating on the vast deep, he slew Madhu and Kaitabha, and in\r\nanother birth he slew Hayagriva (Horse-necked). He is the maker of\r\neverything but is himself made by none. He is the Cause of all power.\r\nWhatever Sauri wisheth, he accomplisheth without any effort. Knowest thou\r\nnot sinless Govinda, of terrible prowess and incapable of deterioration?\r\nThis one, resembling an angry snake of virulent poison, is the\r\nnever-ending source of energy. In seeking to use violence towards\r\nKrishna, endued with mighty arms and unwearied by exertion, thou wilt,\r\nwith all thy followers, perish like an insect failing into fire.'\""

Here,\r\nhowever, are all the Pandavas and all the Vrishnis and Andhakas. Here are\r\nall the Adityas, the Rudras, and the Vasus, with all the great Rishis.\r\nSaying this Kesava, that slayer of hostile heroes burst out into a loud\r\nlaughter. And as the high-souled Sauri laughed, from his body, that\r\nresembled a blazing fire, issued myriads of gods, each of lightning\r\neffulgence, and not bigger than the thumb. And on his forehead appeared\r\nBrahman, and on his breast Rudra. And on his arms appeared the regents of\r\nthe world, and from his mouth issued Agni, the Adityas, the Sadhyas, the\r\nVasus, the Aswins, the Marutas, with Indra, and the Viswedevas. And\r\nmyriads of Yakshas, and the Gandharvas, and Rakshasas also, of the same\r\nmeasure and form, issued thence. And from his two arms issued Sankarshana\r\nand Dhananjaya. And Arjuna stood on his right, bow in hand, and Rama\r\nstood on his left, armed with the plough. And behind him stood Bhima, and\r\nYudhishthira, and the two sons of Madri, and before him were all the\r\nAndhakas and the Vrishnis with Pradyumna and other chiefs bearing mighty\r\nweapons upraised. And on his diverse arms were seen the conch, the\r\ndiscus, the mace, the bow called Saranga, the plough, the javelin, the\r\nNandaka, and every other weapon, all shining with effulgence, and\r\nupraised for striking. And from his eyes and nose and ears and every part\r\nof his body, issued fierce sparks of fire mixed with smoke. And from the\r\npores of his body issued sparks of fire like unto the rays of the sun.\r\nAnd beholding that awful form of the high-souled Kesava, all the kings\r\nclosed their eyes with affrighted hearts, except Drona, and Bhishma, and\r\nVidura, endued with great intelligence, greatly blessed Sanjaya, and the\r\nRishis, possessed of wealth of asceticism, for the divine Janardana gave\r\nunto them this divine sight on the occasion. And beholding in the (Kuru)\r\ncourt that highly wonderful sight, celestial drums beat (in the sky) and\r\na floral shower fell (upon him). And the whole Earth trembled (at the\r\ntime) and the oceans were agitated. And, O bull of the Bharata's race,\r\nall the denizens of the earth were filled with great wonder. Then that\r\ntiger among men, that chastiser of foes, withdrew that divine and highly\r\nwonderful, and extremely varied and auspicious form. And arm-in-arm with\r\nSatyaki on one side and Hridika's son (Kritavarman) on the other, and\r\nobtaining permission of the Rishis, the slayer of Madhu went out. And\r\nduring the uproar that then took place, the Rishis, Narada and others\r\nvanquished, for repairing to their respective places. And this also was\r\nanother wonderful incident that happened. And seeing that tiger among men\r\nleave the court, the Kauravas with all the kings followed him, like the\r\ngods following Indra. Sauri, however, of immeasurable soul, without\r\nbestowing a single thought on those that followed him, issued from the\r\ncourt, like a blazing fire mixed with smoke. And he beheld (at the gate\r\nhis charioteer) Daruka waiting with his large white car, furnished with\r\nrows of tinkling bells, decked with golden ornaments, and endued with\r\ngreat speed, the clatter of whose wheels resounded like the rumbling of\r\nthe clouds, and which was covered all over with white tiger-skins, and\r\nunto which were harnessed his steeds Saivya (and others). And there also\r\nappeared, mounted on his car, that favourite hero of Vrishnis, the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Kritavarman, the son of Hridika. And that chastiser of foes,\r\nSauri, who had his car ready, was about to depart, king Dhritarashtra\r\naddressed him once more and said, 'O grinder of foes, thou hast seen, O\r\nJanardana, the power I wield over my sons! Thou hast, indeed, witnessed\r\nall with thy own eyes. Nothing now is unknown to thee. Seeing me\r\nendeavour to bring about peace between the Kurus, and the Pandavas, in\r\nfact, knowing the state (in which I am), it behoveth thee not to\r\nentertain any suspicion regarding me. O Kesava, I have no sinful feelings\r\ntowards the Pandavas. Thou knowest what words have been spoken by me to\r\nSuyodhana. The Kauravas and all the kings of the Earth, also know, O\r\nMadhava, that I have made every endeavour to bring about peace.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'The mighty-armed Janardana then addressed\r\nDhritarashtra, Drona, grandsire Bhishma, Kshattri, Vahlika, and Kripa and\r\nsaid, 'Ye have yourselves witnessed all that hath happened in the\r\nassembly of the Kurus, viz., how wicked Duryodhana, like an uneducated\r\nwretch, left the court from anger, and how king Dhritarashtra also\r\ndescribeth himself to be powerless. With the permission of you all, I\r\nshall now go back to Yudhishthira.' Saluting them, that bull amongst men,\r\nSauri then mounted his car and set out. And those heroic bulls amongst\r\nthe Bharatas, those mighty bowmen, viz., Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, and\r\nKshattri, and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and that mighty car-warrior\r\nYuyutsu, all began to follow him. And Kesava, on his large white car,\r\nfurnished with rows of tinkling bells, proceeded then, in the very sight\r\nof the Kurus, to the abode of his paternal aunt (Kunti).'\""

As regards Suyodhana and his followers,\r\ntheir hour is come. With thy leave now, I shall speedily repair unto the\r\nPandavas. What should I say unto the Pandavas as thy instructions to\r\nthem? Tell me that, O thou endued with great wisdom. I desire to hear thy\r\nwords.'\r\n\r\n\"Kunti said, 'O Kesava, say unto king Yudhishthira of virtuous soul these\r\nwords, 'Thy virtue, O son, is decreasing greatly. Do not act vainly. O\r\nking, like a reader of the Vedas incapable of catching their real\r\nmeaning, and, therefore, truly unlearned. Thy understanding, affected by\r\nonly the words of the Vedas, vieweth virtue alone. Cast thy eyes on the\r\nduties of thy own order, as ordained by the Self-create. For all ruthless\r\ndeeds and for the protection of the people, from his (Brahmana's) arms\r\nwas created the Kshatriya, who is to depend upon the prowess of his own\r\narms. Listen, an instance is cited in this connection, that hath been\r\nheard by me from the aged. In days of yore, Vaisravana, having been\r\ngratified, made a gift of this Earth to the royal sage Muchukunda. The\r\nlatter without accepting the gift, said, 'I desire to enjoy that\r\nsovereignty which is won by prowess of arms.' At this, Vaisravana was\r\nhighly delighted and filled with wonder. King Muchukunda then, fully\r\nobserving the duties of the Kshatriya order ruled this earth, having\r\nconquered it by the prowess of his arms. Then again, a sixth part of the\r\nvirtue, practised by subjects well-protected by the king, is obtained, 'O\r\nBharata, by the king. The virtue again that the king himself practiseth\r\nconferreth godhead on him, while if he perpetrateth sin, he goeth to\r\nhell. The penal code properly applied by the ruler, maketh the four\r\norders adhere to their respective duties, and leadeth to an acquisition\r\n(by the ruler himself) of virtue (profit, and salvation). When the king\r\nproperly abideth by the penal code, without making any portion of it a\r\ndead letter, then that best of periods called the Krita Yuga setteth in.\r\nLet not this doubt be thine, viz., whether the era is the cause of the\r\nking, or the king the cause of the era, for (know this to be certain\r\nthat) the king is the cause of the era. It is the king that createth the\r\nKrita, the Treta, or the Dwapara age. Indeed, it is the king that is the\r\ncause of also the fourth Yuga (viz., the Kali). That king who causeth the\r\nKrita age to set in, enjoyeth heaven exceedingly. That king who causeth\r\nthe Treta age to set in, doth enjoy heaven but not exceedingly. For thus\r\ncausing the Dwapara age to set in, a king enjoyeth heaven according to\r\nhis due. The king, however, who causeth the Kali age to set in, earneth\r\nsin exceedingly. Thereupon, that king of wicked deeds resideth in hell\r\nfor countless years. Indeed, the king's sins affect the world, and the\r\nworld's sins affect him. Observe thou those kingly duties of thine that\r\nbefit thy ancestry. That is not the conduct of a royal sage in which thou\r\nwishest to abide. Indeed, he that is stained by weakness of heart and\r\nadhereth to compassion, and is unsteady, never obtaineth the merit born\r\nof cherishing his subjects with love. That understanding according to\r\nwhich thou art now acting was never wished (to thee) by Pandu, or myself,\r\nor thy grandsire, while we uttered blessings on thee before; sacrifice,\r\ngift, merit, and bravery, subjects and children, greatness of soul, and\r\nmight, and energy, these were always prayed by me for thee. Well-wishing\r\nBrahmanas duly worshipped and gratified the gods and the Pitris for your\r\nlong life, wealth, and children, by adding Swaha and Swadha. The mother\r\nand the father, as also the gods always desire for their children\r\nliberality and gift and study and sacrifice and sway over subjects.\r\nWhether all this be righteous or unrighteous, you are to practise it, in\r\nconsequence of your very birth. (Behold, O Krishna, so far from doing all\r\nthis), though born in a high race, they are yet destitute of the very\r\nmeans of support, and are afflicted with misery. Hungry men, approaching\r\na brave and bountiful monarch, are gratified, and live by his side. What\r\nvirtue can be superior to this? A virtuous person, upon acquiring a\r\nkingdom, should in this world make all persons his own, attaching some by\r\ngift, some by force, and some by sweet words. A Brahmana should adopt\r\nmendicancy; a Kshatriya should protect (subjects); a Vaisya should earn\r\nwealth; and a Sudra should serve the other three. Mendicancy, therefore,\r\nis forbidden to thee. Nor is agriculture suited to thee. Thou art a\r\nKshatriya and therefore, the protector of all in distress. Thou art to\r\nlive by the prowess of thy arms. O thou of mighty arms, recover thy\r\npaternal share of the kingdom which thou hast lost, by conciliation, or\r\nby working disunion among thy foes, or by gift of money or violence, or\r\nwell-directed policy. What can be a matter of greater grief than that I,\r\ndeprived of friends, should live upon food supplied by others, after\r\nhaving brought thee forth, thou enhancer of the joys of friends? Fight,\r\naccording to the practices of kings. Do not sink thy ancestors (in\r\ninfamy). With thy merit worn out, do not, with thy younger brothers,\r\nobtain a sinful end.'\""

      "content": "\"Kunti said, 'In this connection, O chastiser of foes, is cited an old\r\nstory of the conversation between Vidula and her son. It behoveth thee to\r\nsay unto Yudhishthira anything that can be gathered from this or anything\r\nmore beneficial than that.\r\n\r\n'There was a high-born dame of great foresight, named Vidula. She was\r\nfamous, slightly wrathful, of crooked disposition, and devoted to\r\nKshatriya virtues. Well-educated, she was known to all the kings of the\r\nearth. Of great learning, she had listened to the speeches and\r\ninstructions of diverse mien. And the princess Vidula, one day, rebuked\r\nher own son, who, after his defeat by the king of the Sindhus, lay\r\nprostrate with heart depressed by despair. And she said, 'Thou art not my\r\nson, O enhancer of the joys of foes. Begotten thou hast not been by\r\nmyself and thy father! Whence hast thou come? Without wrath as thou art,\r\nthou canst not be counted as a man. Thy features betray thee to be a\r\neunuch. Sinkest thou in despair as long as thou livest? If thou art\r\ndesirous of thy own welfare, bear thou the burthen (of thy affairs on thy\r\nshoulders), Do not disgrace thy soul. Do not suffer it to be gratified\r\nwith a little. Set thy heart on thy welfare, and be not afraid. Abandon\r\nthy fears. Rise, O coward. Do not lie down thus, after thy defeat,\r\ndelighting all thy foes and grieving the friends, and reft of all sense\r\nof honour. Little streams are filled up with only a quantity of water.\r\nThe palms of a mouse are filled with only a small quantity. A coward is\r\nsoon gratified, with acquisitions that are small. Rather perish in\r\nplucking the fangs of a snake than die miserable like a dog. Put forth\r\nthy prowess even at the risk of thy life. Like a hawk that fearlessly\r\nrangeth the sky, do thou also wander fearlessly or put forth thy prowess,\r\nor silently watch thy foes for an opportunity. Why dost thou lie down\r\nlike a carcass or like one smitten by thunder? Rise, O coward, do not\r\nslumber after having been vanquished by the foe. Do not disappear from\r\nthe sight of all so miserably. Make thyself known by thy deeds. Never\r\noccupy the intermediate, the low, or the lowest station. Blaze up (like a\r\nwell-fed fire). Like a brand of Tinduka wood, blaze up even for a moment,\r\nbut never smoulder from desire, like a flameless fire of paddy chaff. It\r\nis better to blaze up for a moment than smoke for ever and ever. Let no\r\nson be born in a royal race, who is either exceedingly fierce or\r\nexceedingly mild. Repairing to the field of battle and achieving every\r\ngreat feat that is possible for man to achieve, a brave man is freed from\r\nthe debt he oweth to the duties of the Kshatriya order. Such a person\r\nnever disgraceth his own self. Whether he gaineth his object or not, he\r\nthat is possessed of sense never indulgeth in grief. On the other hand,\r\nsuch a person accomplisheth what should be next done, without caring for\r\neven his life. Therefore, O son, display thy prowess, or obtain that end\r\nwhich is inevitable. Why, Indeed, dost thou live, disregarding the duties\r\nof thy order? All thy religious rites, O eunuch, and all thy achievements\r\nare gone. The every root of all thy enjoyments is cut off. What for then\r\ndost thou live? If fall and sink one must, he should seize the foe by the\r\nhips (and thus fall with the foe). Even if one's roots are cut off, he\r\nshould not yet give way to despair. Horse of high mettle put forth all\r\ntheir prowess for dragging or bearing heavy weights. Remembering their\r\nbehaviour, muster, all thy strength and sense of honour. Know also in\r\nwhat thy manliness consists. Exert thyself in raising that race which\r\nhath sunk, in consequence of thee. He that hath not achieved a great feat\r\nforming the subject of men's conversation, only increaseth the number of\r\npopulation. He is neither man nor woman. He whose fame is not founded in\r\nrespect of charity, asceticism, truth, learning and acquisition of\r\nwealth, is only his mother's excreta. On the other hand, he that\r\nsurpasseth others in learning, asceticism, wealth, prowess, and deeds, is\r\n(truly) a man. It behoveth thee not to adopt the idle, wretched,\r\ninfamous, and miserable profession of mendicancy that is worthy only of a\r\ncoward. Friends never derive any happiness on obtaining that weak person\r\nfor a friend, at whose sight foes are delighted, who is despised by men,\r\nwho is without seats and robes, who is gratified with small acquisitions,\r\nwho is destitute, and who hath no courage, and is low. Alas, exiled from\r\nour kingdom, driven from home, deprived of all means of enjoyment and\r\npleasure, and destitute, of resources, we shall have to perish from want\r\nof the very means of life! Misbehaving in the midst of those that are\r\ngood, and the destroyer of thy race and family, by bringing thee forth, O\r\nSanjaya, I have brought forth Kali himself in the shape of a son. Oh, let\r\nno woman bring forth such a son (as thou) that art without wrath, without\r\nexertion, without energy, and that art the joy of foes. Do not smoulder.\r\nBlaze thou up, effectively displaying thy prowess. Slay thy foes. For but\r\na moment, for ever so small a space of time, blaze thou up on the heads\r\nof thy enemies. He is a man who cherisheth wrath and forgiveth not. He,\r\non the other hand, who is forgiving and without wrath, is neither a man\r\nnor woman. Contentment and softness of heart and these two, viz., want of\r\nexertion and fear, are destructive of prosperity. He that is without\r\nexertion never winneth what is great. Therefore, O son, free thyself, by\r\nthy own exertions, from these faults that lead to defeat and downfall.\r\nSteel thy heart and seek to recover thy own. A man is called Purusha\r\nbecause he is competent to trouble his foe (param). He, therefore, who\r\nliveth like a woman is misnamed Purusha (man). A brave king of mighty\r\nstrength, and who moveth like a lion, may go the way of all creatures.\r\nThe subjects, however, that reside in his dominions do not yet become\r\nunhappy. That king, who, disregarding his own happiness and pleasures,\r\nseeketh the prosperity of his kingdom, succeedeth soon in gladdening his\r\ncounsellors and friends.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words, the son said, 'If thou dost not behold me, of what\r\nuse would the whole earth be to thee, of what use thy ornaments, of what\r\nuse all the means of pleasure and even life itself?' The mother said,\r\n'Let those regions be obtained by our foes which belong to those that are\r\nlow. Let those again that are friends go to those regions which are\r\nobtainable by persons whose souls are held in respect. Do not adopt the\r\ncourse of life that is followed by those wretched persons, who, destitute\r\nof strength, and without servants and attendants (to do their bidding)\r\nlive upon the food supplied by others. Like the creatures of the earth\r\nthat depend on the clouds, or the gods depending on Indra, let the\r\nBrahmanas and thy friends all depend on thee for their sustenance. His\r\nlife, O Sanjaya, is not vain on whom all creatures depend for their\r\nsustenance, like birds repairing to a tree abounding with ripe fruits.\r\nThe life of that brave man is, indeed, praiseworthy, through whose\r\nprowess friends derive happiness, like the gods deriving happiness\r\nthrough the prowess of Sakra. That man who liveth in greatness depending\r\non the prowess of his own arms, succeedeth in winning fame in this world\r\nand blessed state in the next!'\""

That Kshatriya, who, from desire\r\nof life, displayeth not his energy according to the best of his might and\r\nprowess, is regarded as a thief. Alas, like medicine to a dying man,\r\nthese words that are fraught with grave import, and are proper and\r\nreasonable, do not make any impression on thee! It is true, the king of\r\nthe Sindhus hath many followers. They are, however, all discounted. From\r\nweakness, and ignorance of proper means, they are waiting for the\r\ndistress of their master (without being able to effect a deliverance for\r\nthemselves by their own exertions). As regards others (his open enemies),\r\nthey will come to thee with their auxiliaries if they behold thee put\r\nforth thy prowess. Uniting with them, seek refuge now in mountain\r\nfastness, waiting for that season when calamity will overtake the foe, as\r\nit must, for he is not free from disease and death. By name thou art\r\nSanjaya (the victorious). I do not, however, behold any such indication\r\nin thee. Be true to thy name. Be my son. Oh, do not make thy name untrue.\r\nBeholding thee while a child, a Brahmana of great foresight and wisdom,\r\nsaid, 'This one falling into great distress will again win greatness.'\r\nRemembering his words, I hope for thy victory. It is for that, O son, I\r\ntell thee so, and shall tell thee again and again. That man who pursueth\r\nthe fruition of his objects according to the ways of policy and for the\r\nsuccess of whose objects other people strive cordially, is always sure to\r\nwin success. Whether what I have is gained or lost, I will not desist,\r\nwith such a resolve, O Sanjaya, O learned one, engage in war, without\r\nwithdrawing thyself from it. Samvara hath said, 'There is no more\r\nmiserable state than that in which one is anxious for his food from day\r\nto day.' A state such as his hath beer said to be more unhappy than the\r\ndeath of one's husband and sons. That which hath been called poverty is\r\nonly a form of death. As regards myself, born in a high race, I have been\r\ntransplanted from one take into another. Possessed of every auspicious\r\nthing, and worshipped by my husband, my power extended over all. Staying\r\nin the midst of friends, our friends formerly beheld me decked in costly\r\ngarlands and ornaments, with body well-washed, attired in excellent\r\nrobes, and myself always cheerful. When thou wilt behold both me and thy\r\nwife weakened (from want of food), thou wilt then, O Sanjaya, scarcely\r\ndesire to live. Of what use will life be to thee when thou wilt behold\r\nall our servants engaged in attending on us, our preceptors and our\r\nordinary and extraordinary priests, leaving us from want of sustenance?\r\nIf, again, I do not now see in thee those laudable and famous\r\nachievements in which thou wert formerly engaged, what peace can my heart\r\nknow? If I have to say--Nay--to a Brahmana, my heart will burst, for\r\nneither I nor my husband ever said--Nay--to a Brahmana before. We were\r\nthe refuge of others, without ourselves having ever taken refuge with\r\nothers. Having been such, if I have to support life by depending on\r\nanother, I will surely cast off my life. Be thou our means of crossing\r\nthe ocean that is difficult to cross. In the absence of boats, be thou\r\nour boat. Make for us a place where place there is none. Revive us that\r\nare dead. Thou art competent to encounter all foes if thou dost not\r\ncherish the desire of life. If, however, thou art for adopting this mode\r\nof life that is fit only for a eunuch, then with troubled soul and\r\ndepressed heart it would be better for thee to sacrifice thy life. A\r\nbrave man winneth fame by slaying even a single foe. By slaying Vritra,\r\nIndra became the great Indra and acquired the sovereignty of all the gods\r\nand the cup for drinking Soma, and the lordship of all the worlds.\r\nProclaiming his name in battle, challenging his foes accoutred in steel,\r\nand grinding or slaying the foremost warriors of hostile ranks, when a\r\nhero winneth far-extending fame in fair fight, his enemies then are\r\npained and bow down unto him. They that are cowards become helpless and\r\ncontribute by their own conduct to bestow every object of desire on those\r\nthat are skilled and brave and that fight reckless of their lives.\r\nWhether kingdoms be overtaken by mighty ruin, or whether life itself be\r\nendangered, they that are noble never desist till they exterminate the\r\nfoes within their reach. Sovereignty is either the door of heaven or\r\nAmrita. Regarding it as one of these, and bearing it in mind that is now\r\nshut against thee, fall thou like a burning brand in the midst of thy\r\nfoes. O king, slay thy foes in battle. Observe the duties of thy order.\r\nLet me not behold thee cheerless, O enhancer of the fears of thy foes.\r\nLet me not in dejection behold thee standing in misery, surrounded by our\r\nsorrowing selves and rejoicing foes. Rejoice, O son, and make thyself\r\nhappy in the possession of wealth in the company of the daughters of the\r\nSauviras and do not, in weakness of heart, be ruled over by the daughters\r\nof the Saindhavas. If a young man like thee, who is possessed of beauty\r\nof person, learning and high birth, and world-wide fame, acteth in such\r\nunbecoming a way, like a vicious bull in the matter of bearing its\r\nburthen, then that, I think, would be equal to death itself. What peace\r\ncan my heart know if I behold thee uttering laudatory speeches in honour\r\nof others or walking (submissively) behind them? Oh, never was one born\r\nin this race that walked behind another. O son, it behoveth thee not to\r\nlive as a dependant on another. I know what the eternal essence of\r\nKshatriya virtues is as spoken of by the old and the older ones and by\r\nthose coming late and later still. Eternal and unswerving, it hath been\r\nordained by the Creator himself. He that hath, in this world, been born\r\nas a Kshatriya in any high race and hath acquired a knowledge of the\r\nduties of that order, will never from fear or the sake of sustenance, bow\r\ndown to any body on earth. One should stand erect with courage and not\r\nbow down, for exertion is manliness. One should rather break in the\r\njoints than yield in this world here to any body. A high-souled Kshatriya\r\nshould always roam like an infuriated elephant. He should, O Sanjaya, bow\r\ndown unto Brahmanas only, for the sake of virtue. He should rule over all\r\nother orders, destroying all evil-doers. Possessed of allies, or\r\ndestitute of them, he should be so as long as he liveth.'\""

Eyeing these (virtue and\r\nprofit) only, I urge thee, O Sanjaya, to battle. The fit hour hath come\r\nfor exhibiting thy prowess. If at such a time thou dost not resort to\r\naction, then disrespected by the people thou wouldst do that which would\r\nbe most disagreeable to me. If, O Sanjaya, thou art about to be stained\r\nwith infamy and I do not (from affection) tell thee anything, then that\r\naffection, worthless and unreasonable, would be like that of the\r\nshe-ass's for her young. Do not tread the path that is disapproved by the\r\nwise and adopted by the fool. Great is the ignorance here. Innumerable\r\ncreatures of the world have taken refuge in it. If thou, however,\r\nadoptest the behaviour of the wise, thou wilt then be dear to me. Indeed,\r\nif thou hast recourse to virtue and profit, if with God above thou\r\nreliest upon human exertion, if thy conduct becometh like that of the\r\ngood, then it is by this and not by any other means that thou wilt become\r\ndear to me. He that taketh delight in sons and grandsons that are\r\nwell-instructed (enjoyeth a delight that is real). He, on the other hand,\r\nthat taketh delight in a son who is destitute of exertion, refractory,\r\nand wicked minded, hath not the very object accomplished for which a son\r\nis desired. Those worst of men that never do what is proper and always do\r\nwhat is censurable, do not obtain happiness here or hereafter. A\r\nKshatriya, O Sanjaya, hath been created for battle and victory. Whether\r\nhe winneth or perisheth, he obtaineth the region of Indra. The happiness\r\nthat a Kshatriya obtaineth by reducing his foes to subjection is such\r\nthat the like of it doth not exist in heaven in the sacred region of\r\nIndra. Burning with wrath, a Kshatriya of great energy, if vanquished\r\nmany times, should wait desiring to vanquish his foes. Without either\r\ncasting away his own life or slaying his foes, how can he obtain peace of\r\nmind by any other course? He that is possessed of wisdom regardeth\r\nanything little as disagreeable. Unto that person to whom anything little\r\nbecomes agreeable, that little (ultimately) becometh a source of pain.\r\nThe man that hath not what is desirable soon becometh wretched. Indeed,\r\nhe soon feeleth every want and is lost like the Ganga on entering the\r\nocean.'\r\n\r\n\"The son said, 'Thou shouldst not, O mother, give expression to such\r\nviews before thy son. Show him kindness now, staying by his side, like a\r\nsilent and dumb being.'\r\n\r\n\"The mother said, 'Great is my gratification since thou sayest so. I who\r\nmay be urged (by thee to what is my duty) am thus urged by thee. I shall,\r\ntherefore, urge thee more (for doing what thou shouldst do). I will,\r\nindeed, honour thee then when I will behold thee, crowned with complete\r\nsuccess after the slaughter of all the Saindhavas.'\r\n\r\n\"The son said, 'Without wealth, without allies, how can success and\r\nvictory be mine? Conscious of this exceedingly miserable state of mine, I\r\nhave myself abstained from desire of kingdom, like an evil-doer\r\nabstaining from desire of heaven. If, therefore, O thou of mature wisdom,\r\nthou seest any means (by which all this can be effected), speak fully of\r\nit to me as I ask thee, for I shall do all that thou mayst command me to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n\"The mother said, 'Do not disgrace thy soul, O son, by anticipations of\r\nfailure. Objects unattained have been attained; while those attained have\r\nbeen lost. The accomplishment of objects should never be sought with\r\nwrath and folly. In all acts, O son, the attainment of success is always\r\nuncertain. Knowing that success is uncertain, people still act, so that\r\nthey sometimes succeed, and sometimes do not. They, however, who abstain\r\nfrom action, never obtain success. In the absence of exertion, there is\r\nbut one result, viz., the absence of success. There are, however, two\r\nresults in the case of exertion, viz., the acquisition of success or its\r\nnon-acquisition. He, O prince, who hath settled beforehand that all acts\r\nare uncertain in respect of their results, maketh both success and\r\nprosperity unattainable by himself. This will be,--with such a belief\r\nshould one, casting off all sloth, exert and wake up and address himself\r\nto every act. That wise king, who, O son, engageth in acts, having\r\nperformed all auspicious rites and with the gods and the Brahmanas on his\r\nside, soon winneth success. Like the sun embracing the east, the goddess\r\nof prosperity embraceth him. I see thou hast shown thyself fit for the\r\nvarious suggestions and means and encouraging speeches thou hast had from\r\nme. Display (now) thy prowess. It behoveth thee to win, by every\r\nexertion, the object thou hast in view. Bring together to thy own side\r\nthose that are angry (with thy foes), those that are covetous, those that\r\nhave been weakened (by thy foes), those that are jealous (of thy foes),\r\nthose that have been humiliated (by them), those that always challenge\r\n(them) from excess of pride, and all others of this class. By this means\r\nthou wilt be able to break the mighty host (of thy enemy) like an\r\nimpetuous and fierce-rising tempest scattering the clouds. Give them (thy\r\nwould be allies) wealth before it is due, seek their food, be up and\r\ndoing, and speak sweetly unto them all. They will then do the good, and\r\nplace thee at their head. When the enemy cometh to know that his foe hath\r\nbecome reckless of his life, then is he troubled on the latter's account,\r\nfrom a snake living in his chamber? If, knowing one to be powerful, one's\r\nenemy doth not strive to subjugate him, he should at least make one\r\nfriendly by the application of the arts of conciliation, gift, and the\r\nlike. Even that would be tantamount to subjugation. Obtaining a respite\r\nby means of the art of conciliation, one's wealth may increase. And if\r\none's wealth increaseth, one is worshipped and sought as a refuge by\r\none's friends. If, again, one is deprived of wealth, one is abandoned by\r\nfriends and relatives, and more than that mistrusted and even despised by\r\nthem. It is perfectly impossible for him to ever regain his kingdom, who,\r\nhaving united himself with his foe, liveth confidently.'\""

Do not frighten\r\nthose friends, and do not suffer them to abandon thee on beholding thee\r\nafflicted with fear. Desiring to test thy might, manliness, and\r\nunderstanding, and wishing also to encourage thee, I have said all this\r\nfor enhancing thy energy.

This one\r\nwill vanquish in battle all the assembled Kurus. Aided by Bhima, he will\r\nconquer the whole Earth and his fame will touch the very heavens. With\r\nVasudeva as his ally, he will slay the Kurus in battle and recover his\r\nlost paternal share in the kingdom. Endued with great prosperity, he\r\nwill, with his brothers, perform three great sacrifices.' O thou of\r\nunfading glory, thou knowest how steady, in truth, is Vibhatsu, otherwise\r\ncalled Savyasachin, how irresistible he is. O thou of Dasarha's race, let\r\nit be as that (celestial) voice said. If, O thou of Vrishni's race, there\r\nis anything like righteousness, those words will be true, for then,\r\nKrishna, thou wilt thyself accomplish it all. I do not doubt what that\r\nvoice said. I bow to righteousness which is superior to all. It is\r\nrighteousness that supports all creatures. Thou shalt say these words\r\nunto Dhananjaya. Unto Vrikodara again, who is always ready for exertion,\r\nthou shalt say these words, 'The time hath come for that in view of which\r\nKshatriya lady bringeth forth a son! They that are foremost among men\r\nnever become cheerless when they have hostilities to wage--Thou knowest\r\nwhat the state of Bhima's mind is. That grinder of foes is never pacified\r\nuntil he exterminates his foes. Thou shalt, O Madhava, next say unto the\r\nauspicious Krishna of great fame, that daughter-in-law of the high-souled\r\nPandu, who is conversant with the details of every virtue, these words,\r\n'O thou that art highly blessed, O thou of noble parentage, O thou that\r\nart endued with great fame, that becoming behaviour which thou always\r\nshowest towards my sons is, indeed, worthy of thee.' Thou must also say\r\nunto the sons of Madri who are always devoted to Kshatriya virtues, these\r\nwords, 'Covet ye more than life itself, those enjoyments that are\r\nacquired by prowess. Objects won by prowess always please the heart of a\r\nperson that liveth according to Kshatriya practices. Engaged as ye are in\r\nacquiring every kind of virtue, before your eyes the princess of Panchala\r\nwas addressed in cruel and abusive epithets. Who is there that can\r\nforgive that insult? The deprivation of their kingdom grieved me not.\r\nTheir defeat at dice grieved me not. But that noble and fair Draupadi,\r\nhowever, while weeping in the midst of the assembly, had to hear those\r\ncruel and insulting words is what grieveth me most. Alas, exceedingly\r\nbeautiful Krishna, ever devoted to Kshatriya virtues, found no protector\r\non that occasion, though she was wedded to such powerful protectors. O\r\nthou of mighty arms, say unto that tiger among men, Arjuna, that foremost\r\nof all wielders of weapons, that he should always tread in the path that\r\nmay be pointed out by Draupadi. Thou knowest it very well, Kesava, that\r\nBhima and Arjuna,--that pair of fierce and all-destroying Yamas, are\r\ncapable of making the very gods go the way of all creatures. Is not this\r\nan insult to them that (their wife) Krishna was dragged into the\r\nassembly? O Kesava, recall to their remembrance all those cruel and harsh\r\nwords that Dussasana said unto Bhima in the very presence of all the\r\nwarriors of Kuru's race. Enquire (in my name) after the welfare of the\r\nPandavas with their children and Krishna. Say unto them, O Janardana,\r\nthat I am well.

And they said, 'Overcome with ignorance, the\r\nwhole earth hath been entangled in the meshes of death!' And they also\r\nsaid, 'Through Duryodhana's folly, all this is doomed to destruction.'\r\n\r\n'Having issued out of the (Kuru) city, that foremost of persons\r\nproceeded, deliberating with Karna for a long time.

On the occasion also of the tale of cattle,\r\nwhen captured by the Gandharvas, this Karna and all these thy counsellors\r\nand thyself accoutred in mail and on thy car, were all liberated from the\r\ngrasp of the Gandharvas by that Arjuna.

O repressor\r\nof foes, salute the king respectfully as before. And let Yudhishthira,\r\nthe son of Kunti, the elder brother of Bhima, hold from affection, thy\r\nsaluting self with his arms. And let that foremost of smiters, Bhima,\r\npossessed of leonine shoulders and thighs round, and long, and mighty\r\narms, embrace thee. And then let that son of Kunti, Dhananjaya, called\r\nalso Partha, of eyes like lotus-petals, and curly hair and conch-like\r\nneck salute thee respectfully. Then let those tigers among men, the twin\r\nAswins, unrivalled on earth for beauty, wait on thee with affection and\r\nreverence as on their preceptor. And let all the kings with him of\r\nDasarha's race at their head, shed tears of joy. Abandoning thy pride,\r\nunite thyself with thy brothers. Rule thou the whole earth, with thy\r\nbrothers.

Then Nakula and Sahadeva, and the five sons of Draupadi,\r\nand the Panchalas with that mighty car-warrior Sikhandin, will all\r\nproceed behind thee. I myself, with all the Andhakas and the Vrishnis,\r\nwill walk behind thee. Indeed, all the Dasarhas and the Dasarnas, will, O\r\nking, be numbered with thy relatives. Enjoy the sovereignty of the earth,\r\nO thou of mighty arms, with thy brothers the Pandavas, with yapas and\r\nhomas and auspicious rites of diverse kinds performed in thy honour. Let\r\nthe Dravidas, with the Kuntalas, the Andhras, and the Talacharas, and the\r\nShuchupas, and the Venupas, all walk before thee. Let chanters and\r\npanegyrists praise thee with innumerable laudatory hymns. Let the\r\nPandavas proclaim,--Victory to Vasusena. Surrounded by the Pandavas, like\r\nthe moon by the stars, rule thou the kingdom, O son of Kunti, and gladden\r\nKunti herself. Let thy friends rejoice, and thy enemies grieve. Let there\r\nbe, this day, a brotherly union between thee and thy brothers, the sons\r\nof Pandu.\""

I know all that thou\r\nhast said unto me. Morally, I am the son of Pandu, as also in consequence\r\nof the injunctions of the scriptures, as thou, O Krishna, thinkest. My\r\nmother, while a maiden, bore me in her womb, O Janardana, through her\r\nconnection with Surya. And at the command of Surya himself, she abandoned\r\nme as soon as I was born. Even thus, O Krishna, I came into the world.\r\nMorally, therefore, I am the son of Pandu. Kunti, however, abandoned me\r\nwithout thinking of my welfare. The Suta, Adhiratha, as soon as he beheld\r\nme, took me to his home, and from her affection for me, Radha's breasts\r\nwere filled with milk that very day, and she, O Madhava, cleansed my\r\nurine and evacuations. How can one like us, conversant with duties and\r\never engaged in listening to scriptures deprive her of her Pinda? So also\r\nAdhiratha of the Suta class regardeth me as a son, and I too, from\r\naffection, always regard him as (my) father. O Madhava, that Adhiratha, O\r\nJanardana, from paternal affection caused all the rites of infancy to be\r\nperformed on my person, according to the rules prescribed in the\r\nscriptures. It is that Adhiratha, again, who caused the name Vasusena to\r\nbe bestowed upon me by the Brahmanas. When also I attained to youth, I\r\nmarried wives according to his selections. Through them have been born my\r\nsons and grandsons, O Janardana. My heart also, O Krishna, and all the\r\nbonds of affection and love, are fixed on them. From joy or fear. O\r\nGovinda. I cannot venture to destroy those bonds even for the sake of the\r\nwhole earth or heaps of gold. In consequence also of my connection with\r\nDuryodhana of Dhritarashtra's race, I have, O Krishna, enjoyed\r\nsovereignty for thirteen years, without a thorn on my side. I have\r\nperformed many sacrifices, always however in connection with persons of\r\nthe Suta tribe. All my family rites and marriage rites have been\r\nperformed with the Sutas. Obtaining me, O Krishna, Duryodhana hath, O\r\nthou of Vrishni's race, made this preparations for an armed encounter and\r\nprovoked hostilities with the sons of Pandu. And it is for this, O\r\nAchyuta, that in the battle (that will ensue), I, O Krishna, have been\r\nchosen as the great antagonist of Arjuna to advance against him in a\r\nsingle combat. For the sake of death, or the ties of blood, or fear, or\r\ntemptation, I cannot venture, O Janardana, to behave falsely towards the\r\nintelligent son of Dhritarashtra. If I do not now engage in a single\r\ncombat with Arjuna, this will, O Hrishikesa, be inglorious for both\r\nmyself and Partha. Without doubt, O slayer of Madhu, thou hast told me\r\nall this for doing me good. The Pandavas also, obedient as they are to\r\nthee, will, without doubt, do all that thou hast said. Thou must,\r\nhowever, conceal this our discourse for the present, O slayer of Madhu.\r\nTherein lies our benefit, I think, O delighter of all the Yadavas. If\r\nking Yudhishthira, of virtuous soul and well-controlled senses, cometh to\r\nknow me as the firstborn son of Kunti, he will never accept the kingdom.\r\nIf, again, O slayer of Madhu, this mighty and swelling empire becometh\r\nmine. I shall, O repressor of foes, certainly make it over to Duryodhana\r\nonly. Let Yudhishthira of virtuous soul become king for ever. He that\r\nhath Hrishikesa for his guide, and Dhananjaya and that mighty car-warrior\r\nBhima for his combatants, as also Nakula and Sahadeva, and the sons of\r\nDraupadi, is fit, O Madhava, to rule over the whole earth.\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas, that mighty car-warrior\r\nSatyaki, Uttamaujas, Yudhamanyu, the prince of Somakas who is devoted to\r\ntruth, the ruler of the Chedis, Chekitana, the invincible Sikhandin, the\r\nKekaya brothers, all of the hue of Indragopaka insects, Bhimasena's uncle\r\nKuntibhoja of high soul and possessed of steeds endued with the colours\r\nof the rainbow, the mighty car-warrior Syenajit, Sanka the son of Virata,\r\nand thyself, O Janardana, like an ocean,--great is this assemblage, O\r\nKrishna, of Kshatriyas (that hath been made by Yudhishthira). This\r\nblazing kingdom, celebrated among all the kings of the earth, is already\r\nwon (by Yudhishthira). O thou of Vrishni's race, a great sacrifice of\r\narms is about to be celebrated by Dhritarashtra's son. Thou, O Janardana,\r\nwilt be the Upadrashtri of that sacrifice. The office of Adhyaryu also, O\r\nKrishna, in that sacrifice, will be thine. The ape-bannered Vibhatsu\r\naccoutred in mail will be the Hotri (his bow), Gandiva will be the\r\nsacrificial ladle, and the prowess of the warriors will be the clarified\r\nbutter (that is to be consumed). The weapons called Aindra, Pasupata,\r\nBrahma, and Sthunakarna, applied by Arjuna, will, O Madhava, be the\r\nmantras (of that sacrifice). Resembling his father, or perhaps, excelling\r\nhim in prowess, Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu) will be the chief Vedic hymn\r\nto be chanted. That destroyer of elephant ranks that utterer of fierce\r\nroars in battle, that tiger among men, the exceedingly mighty Bhima, will\r\nbe Udgatri and Prastotri in this sacrifice. King Yudhishthira of virtuous\r\nSoul, ever engaged in Yapa and Homa, will himself be the Brahma of that\r\nsacrifice. The sounds of conchs, tabors, and drums, and the leonine\r\nroaring rising high in the welkin, will be the calls upon the invited to\r\neat. The two sons of Madri, Nakula and Sahadeva, of great fame and\r\nprowess, will be the slayers of the sacrificial animals; rows of bright\r\ncars furnished with standards of variegated hue, will, O Govinda, be\r\nstakes (for tying the animals), O Janardana, in this sacrifice. Barbed\r\narrows and Nalikas, and long shafts, and arrows with heads like calf's\r\ntooth, will play the part of spoons (wherewith to distribute the Soma\r\njuice) while Tomaras will be the vessels of Soma, and bows will be\r\npavitras. The swords will be Kapalas, the heads (of slain warriors) the\r\nPurodasas and the blood of warriors the clarified butter. O Krishna, in\r\nthis sacrifice. The lances and bright maces (of the warriors) will be\r\npokers (for stirring the sacrificial fire) and the corner stakes (for\r\nkeeping the fire-wood from falling down). The disciples of Drona and\r\nKripa, the son of Saradwat, will be the Sadasyas (assisting priests). The\r\narrows shot by the wielder of Gandiva and by (other) mighty car-warriors,\r\nand by Drona and Drona's son, will play the part of ladles for\r\ndistributing the Soma. Satyaki will discharge the duties of the chief\r\nassistant of the Adhyaryu. Of this sacrifice, Dhritarashtra's son will be\r\ninstalled as the performer, while this vast army will be his wife. O thou\r\nof mighty arms, when the nocturnal rites of sacrifice will begin, the\r\nmighty Ghatotkacha will play the part of the slayer of (devoted) victims.\r\nThe mighty Dhrishtadyumna, who sprang into life from the sacrificial\r\nfire, having for its mouth the rites celebrated with mantras, will, O\r\nKrishna, be the Dakshina of that sacrifice. For those harsh words, O\r\nKrishna, that I said before unto the sons of Pandu for the gratification\r\nof Dhritarashtra's son,--for that wicked conduct of mine,--I am consumed\r\nwith repentance. When O Krishna, thou wilt behold me slain by Arjuna,\r\nthen will the Punachiti of this sacrifice commence. When the (second) son\r\nof Pandu will drink the blood of the loudly roaring Dussasana, then will\r\nthe Soma-drinking of this sacrifice have taken place! When the two\r\nprinces of Panchala (Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin) will overthrow Drona\r\nand Bhishma, then, O Janardana, will this sacrifice be suspended for an\r\ninterval. When mighty Bhimasena will slay Duryodhana, then, O Madhava,\r\nwill this sacrifice of Dhritarashtra's son be concluded. When the wives\r\nof Dhritarashtra's sons and grandsons assembled together, deprived, O\r\nKesava, of their husbands and sons and without protectors, will indulge\r\nin lamentations with Gandhari in their midst, on the field of battle\r\nhaunted by dogs and vultures and other carnivorous birds, then, O\r\nJanardana, will the final bath of this sacrifice take place.\r\n\r\n'I pray to thee, O bull of the Kshatriya race, let not the Kshatriyas,\r\nold in learning and old in years, perish miserably, O Janardana, for thy\r\nsake. Oh, let this swelling host of Kshatriyas perish by means of weapons\r\non that most sacred of all spots in the three worlds, viz. Kurukshetra, O\r\nKesava. O thou of eyes like lotus-leaves, accomplish on this spot what\r\nthou hast in thy mind, so that, O thou of Vrishni's race, the whole\r\nKshatriya order may attain to heaven. As long, O Janardana, as the hills\r\nand the rivers will last, so long will the fame of these achievements\r\nlast. The Brahmanas will recite this great war of the Bharatas. The fame,\r\nO thou of Vrishni's race, that they achieve in battles is the wealth that\r\nKshatriyas own. O Kesava, bring Kunti's son (Arjuna) before me for\r\nbattle, keeping for ever this our discourse a secret, O chastiser of\r\nfoes.'\""

O Karna? Wishest thou\r\nnot to rule over the whole earth given by me to thee? The victory of the\r\nPandavas, therefore, is very certain. There seems to be no doubt in this.\r\nThe triumphal banner of Pandu's son, with the fierce ape on it, seems to\r\nbe already set up. The divine artificer, Bhaumana, hath applied such\r\ncelestial illusion (in its construction) that it standeth high, displayed\r\nlike Indra's banner. Various celestial creatures of terrific shape,\r\nindicating victory, are seen on that standard. Extending for a yojana\r\nupwards and all around, that beautiful standard of Arjuna, resembling\r\nfire in radiance, is never, O Karna, when set up, obstructed by hills or\r\ntrees. When thou wilt behold in battle Arjuna, on his car drawn by white\r\nsteeds and driven by Krishna, applying Aindra, Agneya and Maruta weapons,\r\nand when thou wilt hear the twang of Gandiva piercing the welkin like the\r\nvery thunder, then all signs of the Krita, the Treta, and the Dwapara\r\nages will disappear (but, instead, Kali embodied will be present). When\r\nthou wilt behold in battle Kunti's son, invincible Yudhishthira, devoted\r\nto Yapa and Homa and resembling the very sun in brilliance, protecting\r\nhis own mighty army and burning the army of his foes, then all signs of\r\nthe Krita, the Treta, and the Dwapara ages will disappear. When thou wilt\r\nbehold in battle the mighty Bhimasena dancing, after having quaffed the\r\nblood of Dussasana, like a fierce elephant with rent temples after having\r\nkilled a mighty antagonist, then all signs of the Krita, the Treta, and\r\nthe Dwapara ages will disappear.

All plants and herbs are vigorous now, all\r\ntrees full of fruits, and flies there are none. The roads are free from\r\nmire, and the waters are of agreeable taste. The weather is neither very\r\nhot nor very cold and is, therefore, highly pleasant. Seven days after,\r\nwill be the day of the new moon.

The destruction of the whole earth that is at hand for its\r\ncause, Sakuni, and myself, and Dussasana, and king Duryodhana, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra. Without doubt, O Krishna, a great and fierce battle is at\r\nhand between the Pandavas and the Kurus which will cover the earth with\r\nbloody mire. All the kings and princes following the lead of Duryodhana,\r\nconsumed by the fire of weapons will proceed to the abode of Yama.\r\nDiverse frightful visions are seen, O slayer of Madhu, and many terrible\r\nportents, and fierce disturbances also. All these omens, making the hairs\r\n(of the spectators) stand on their ends, indicate, O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace, the defeat of Dhritarashtra's son and the victory of Yudhishthira.\r\nThat fierce planet of great effulgence, Sanaischara (Saturn), is\r\nafflicting the constellation called Rohini, in order to afflict greatly\r\nthe creatures of the earth. The planet Angaraka (Mars), wheeling, O\r\nslayer of Madhu, towards the constellation Jeshthya, approacheth towards\r\nAnuradhas, indicating a great slaughter of friends. Without doubt, O\r\nKrishna, a terrible calamity approacheth the Kurus when specially, O thou\r\nof Vrishni's race, the planet Mahapat afflicteth the constellation\r\nChitra. The spot on the lunar disc hath changed its position; and Rahu\r\nalso approacheth towards the sun. Meteors are falling from the sky with\r\nloud noise and trembling motion. The elephants are sending forth\r\nfrightful cries, while the steeds, O Madhava, are shedding tears, without\r\ntaking any delight in food and drink. They say, O thou of mighty arms,\r\nthat on the appearance of these portents, a terrible calamity\r\napproacheth, productive of a great slaughter. O Kesava, amongst the\r\nsteeds, elephants and soldiers, in all the divisions of Duryodhana's\r\narmy, it is seen, O slayer of Madhu, that while small is the food these\r\ntake, ample is the excreta they evacuate. The wise have said that this is\r\nan indication of defect. The elephants and steeds of the Pandavas, O\r\nKrishna, all seem to be cheerful, while all the animals wheel along their\r\nright. This also is an indication of their success. The same animal, O\r\nKesava, pass by the left side of Duryodhana's army, while incorporeal\r\nvoices are constantly heard (over their heads). All this is an indication\r\nof defeat. All auspicious birds, such as peacocks, swans, cranes,\r\nChatakas, Jivajivas, and large flights of Vakas, follow the Pandavas,\r\nwhile vultures, Kankas, hawks, Rakshasas, wolves and bees, in flights and\r\nherds, follow the Kauravas. The drums in the army of Dhritarashtra's son\r\nyield no sounds, while those of the Pandavas yield sounds without being\r\nstruck. The wells in the midst of Duryodhana's encampment send forth loud\r\nroars like those of huge bulls. All this is an indication of defeat. The\r\ngods are showering flesh and blood, O Madhava, on Duryodhana's soldiers.\r\nVapoury edifices of great effulgence with high walls, deep trenches, and\r\nhandsome porches, are suddenly appearing in the skies (over the Kuru\r\nencampment). A black circle surrounding the solar disc appears to the\r\nview. Both twilights at sunrise and sunset indicate great terrors. The\r\njackals yell hideously. All this is an indication of defeat. Diverse\r\nbirds, each having but one wing, one eye, and one leg, utter terrible\r\ncries. All this, O slayer of Madhu, indicates defeat. Fierce birds with\r\nblack wings and red legs hover over the Kuru encampment at nightfall. All\r\nthis is an indication of defeat. The soldiers of Duryodhana betray hatred\r\nfor Brahmanas first, and then for their preceptors, and then for all\r\ntheir affectionate servants. The, eastern horizon of (Duryodhana's\r\nencampment) appeareth red; the southern of the hue of weapons; and\r\nwestern, O slayer of Madhu, of an earthy hue. All the quarters around\r\nDuryodhana's encampment seem, O Madhava, to be ablaze. In the appearance\r\nof all these portents, great is the danger that is indicated.\r\n\r\n'I have in a vision, O Achyuta, beheld Yudhishthira ascending with his\r\nbrothers a palace supported by a thousand columns. All of them appeared\r\nwith white head-gears and in white robes. And all of them appeared to me\r\nto be seated on white seats. In the midst of the same vision, thou, O\r\nJanardana, wast beheld by me to be employed in enveloping the blood-dyed\r\nearth with weapons. Yudhishthira at the same time, of immeasurable\r\nenergy, ascending upon a heap of bones, was gladly eating buttered payasa\r\nof a golden cup. I further beheld Yudhishthira to be employed in\r\nswallowing the earth handed over to him by thee. This indicates that he\r\nwill verily rule the earth I beheld that tiger among men, Vrikodara, of\r\nfierce deeds, standing on the summit, mace in hand, and as if devouring\r\nthis earth. This plainly indicates that he will slay all of us in fierce\r\nbattle. It is known to me, O lord of the senses, that victory is there\r\nwhere righteousness is. I saw also Dhananjaya, the wielder of Gandiva,\r\nseated on the back of a white elephant, with thee, O lord of the senses,\r\nand blazing forth with great beauty. I have no doubt, O Krishna, that ye\r\nwill slay in battle all the kings headed by Duryodhana. I saw Nakula and\r\nSahadeva and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki, adorned with white\r\nbracelets, white cuirasses, white garlands, and white robes. This tiger\r\namong men were seated upon excellent vehicles borne on the shoulders of\r\nmen. And I saw that umbrellas were held over the heads of all the three.\r\nAmongst the soldiers of Dhritarashtra's son, these three, O Janardana,\r\nwere beheld by me decked with white head-gears. Know, O Kesava, that\r\nthose three were Aswatthaman, Kripa, and Kritavarman of Satwata's race.\r\nAll other kings, O Madhava, were seen by me to have blood-red head-ears.\r\nI saw also, O thou of mighty arms, that those mighty car-warriors Bhishma\r\nand Drona, ascending on a vehicle drawn by camels, and by myself, and\r\nDhritarashtra's son, proceeded, O lord, to the quarter, O Janardana,\r\nruled by Agastya. This indicates that we shall soon have to proceed to\r\nYama's abode. I have no doubt that myself and the other kings, indeed,\r\nthe entire assemblage of Kshatriyas shall have to enter into the Gandiva\r\nfire.'\r\n\r\n\"Krishna said, 'Indeed, the destruction of the earth is at hand when my\r\nwords, O Karna, do not become acceptable to thy heart. O sire, when the\r\ndestruction of all creatures approacheth, wrong assuming the semblance of\r\nright leaveth not the heart.'\r\n\r\n\"Karna said, 'If, O Krishna, we come out of this great battle that will\r\nbe so destructive of heroic Kshatriyas, with life, then, O thou of mighty\r\narms may we meet here again. Otherwise, O Krishna, we shall certainly\r\nmeet in heaven. O sinless one, it seemeth to me now that there only it is\r\npossible for us to meet.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having spoken these words, Karna closely pressed Madhava\r\nto his bosom. Dismissed by Kesava, he then descended from the car. And\r\nriding on his own car decked with gold, Radha's son greatly dejected,\r\ncame back with us!'\""

King Dhritarashtra here, though old in years, doth not effect\r\npeace, and intoxicated with pride of children, treadeth a sinful path. In\r\nconsequence of the wickedness of Jayadratha and Karna and Dussasana and\r\nSuvala's son, intestine dissensions will break out. They that behave\r\nunrighteously towards him that is righteous, verily that sin of theirs\r\nsoon produceth its consequences. Who is there that will not be filled\r\nwith sorrow at the sight of the Kurus persecuting righteousness in this\r\nway? When Kesava returneth without being able to bring about peace, the\r\nPandavas will certainly address themselves for battle. Thereupon, the sin\r\nof the Kurus will lead to a destruction of heroes. Reflecting on all\r\nthis, I do not get sleep by day or by night.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words uttered by Vidura, who always wished her sons the\r\naccomplishment of their objects, Kunti began to sigh heavily, afflicted\r\nwith grief, and began to think within herself, 'Fie to wealth, for the\r\nsake of which this great slaughter of kinsmen is about to take place.\r\nIndeed, in this war, they that are friends will sustain defeat. What can\r\nbe a greater grief than this that the Pandavas, the Chedis, the\r\nPanchalas, and the Yadavas, assembled together, will fight with the\r\nBharatas? Verily, I behold demerit in war. (On the other hand) if we do\r\nnot fight, poverty and humiliation would be ours. As regards the person\r\nthat is poor, even death is beneficial (to him). (On the other band) the\r\nextermination of one's kinsmen is not victory. As I reflect on this, my\r\nheart swelleth with sorrow. The grandsire (Bhishma), the son of Santanu,\r\nthe preceptor (Drona), who is the foremost of warriors, and Karna, having\r\nembraced Duryodhana's side, enhance my fears. The preceptor Drona, it\r\nseemeth to me, will never fight willingly against his pupils. As regards\r\nthe Grandsire, why will he not show some affection for the Pandavas?\r\nThere is only this sinful Karna then, of deluded understanding and ever\r\nfollowing the deluded lead of the wicked Duryodhana, that hateth the\r\nPandavas. Obstinately pursuing that which injureth the Pandavas, this\r\nKarna is, again, very powerful. It is this which burneth me at present.\r\nProceeding to gratify him. I will today disclose the truth and seek to\r\ndraw his heart towards the Pandavas. Pleased with me, while I was living\r\nin the inner apartments of the palace of my father, Kuntibhoja, the holy\r\nDurvasa gave me a boon in the form of an invocation consisting of\r\nmantras. Long reflecting with a trembling heart on the strength or\r\nweakness of those mantras and the power also of the Brahmana's words, and\r\nin consequence also of my disposition as a woman, and my nature as a girl\r\nof unripe years, deliberating repeatedly and while guarded by a\r\nconfidential nurse and surrounded by my waiting-maids, and thinking also\r\nof how not to incur any reproach, how to maintain the honour of my\r\nfather, and how I myself might have an accession of good fortune without\r\nbeing guilty of any transgression, I, at last, remembered that Brahmana\r\nand bowed to him, and having obtained that mantras from excess of\r\ncuriosity and from folly, I summoned, during my maidenhood, the god\r\nSurya. He, therefore, who was held in my womb during my maidenhood,--why\r\nshould he not obey my words that are certainly acceptable and beneficial\r\nto his brothers? And reflecting in this strain, Kunti formed an excellent\r\nresolution. And having formed that resolution, she went to the sacred\r\nstream called after Bhagiratha. And having reached the banks of Ganga,\r\nPritha heard the chanting of the Vedic hymns by her son, endued with\r\ngreat kindness and firmly devoted to truth. And as Karna stood with face\r\ndirected to the east and arms upraised, then helpless Kunti, for the sake\r\nof her interest stayed behind him, waiting the completion of prayers. And\r\nthe lady of Vrishni's race, that wife of Kuru's house, afflicted by the\r\nheat of the sun began to look like a faded garland of lotuses. And, at\r\nlast, she stood in the shade afforded by the upper garments of Karna. And\r\nKarna, of regulated vows, said his prayers until his back became heated\r\nby the rays of the sun. Then turning behind, he behold Kunti and was\r\nfilled with surprise. And saluting him in proper form and with joined\r\npalms that foremost of virtuous persons, endued with great energy and\r\npride, viz., Vrisha, the son of Vikartana, bowed to her and said (the\r\nfollowing words).\"'"

O irresistible\r\none, thou, O son, wert brought forth by me in my father's abode, decked\r\nwith (natural) ear-rings and accoutred in a (natural) coat of mail, and\r\nblazing forth in beauty. That thou, without knowing thy brothers,\r\nshouldst, therefore, from ignorance, wait upon Dhritarashtra's son, is\r\nnot proper. It is improper in thee especially, O son. The gratification\r\nof one's father and one's mother, who is the sole displayer of affection\r\n(for her child), hath, O son, in the matter of ascertaining the duties of\r\nmen, been declared to be the highest of all duties. Acquired formerly by\r\nArjuna, the prosperity of Yudhishthira hath, from avarice, been wrested\r\nby wicked persons. Snatching it back from Dhritarashtra's sons, do thou\r\nenjoy that prosperity. Let the Kurus behold today the union of Karna and\r\nArjuna. Beholding thee and thy brother united together in bonds of\r\nbrotherly love, let those wicked persons bow down unto ye. Let Karna and\r\nArjuna be named in the same breath as Rama and Janardana. If you two are\r\nunited together, what cannot be accomplished in the world? O Karna,\r\nsurrounded by thy brothers, thou wilt, without doubt, blaze forth like\r\nBrahma Himself, surrounded by the gods on the platform of a great\r\nsacrifice. Endued with every virtue, thou art the first of all my\r\nrelations. Let not the epithet Suta's son attach to thee. Thou art a\r\nPartha, endued with great energy.'\""

Coming from a great\r\ndistance, that voice was uttered by Surya himself with paternal\r\naffection. (And it said)--The words said by Pritha are true. O Karna, act\r\naccording to the words of thy mother. O tiger among men, great good will\r\nresult to thee if thou fully followest those words.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Though, thus addressed by his mother, and by\r\nalso his father Surya himself, Karna's heart did not yet waver, for he\r\nwas firmly devoted to truth. And he said, 'O Kshatriya lady, I cannot\r\nadmit what thou hast said, viz., that obedience to thy commands\r\nconstituteth (in my case) the highest of my duties. O mother, I was\r\nabandoned by thee as soon as I was born. This great injury, involving\r\nrisk to life itself, that thou didst me, hath been destructive of my\r\nachievements and fame. If, indeed, I am a Kshatriya, I have, for thee,\r\nbeen deprived of all the rites of a Kshatriya. What enemy would have done\r\nme a greater injury? Without showing me mercy, when thou shouldst have\r\nshown it, and having kept me divested of all the rites (that are\r\nobligatory in consequence of the order of my birth), thou wouldst\r\nhowever, lay thy command on me today! Thou hadst never before sought my\r\ngood as a mother should. Thou addressest me today, however, desiring to\r\ndo good to thyself. Who is there that would not be afraid of Dhananjaya\r\nhaving Krishna with him (for the driver of his car)? If, therefore, I go\r\ntoday unto the Parthas, who is there that would not regard me as doing so\r\nfrom fright? Hitherto, nobody knew me to be their brother. If, giving out\r\non the eve of battle that I am their brother, I go to the Pandavas, what\r\nwould all the Kshatriyas say? Furnished with every object of desire, and\r\nworshipped by them with a view to make me happy, how can I render that\r\nfriendship of Dhritarashtra's sons utterly futile? Having provoked\r\nhostilities with others, they always wait on me respectfully, and always\r\nbow down to me, as the Vasus bow down to Vasava. They think that aided by\r\nmy might, they are capable of encountering the foe. How can I then\r\nfrustrate that cherished hope of theirs? With me as their boat, they\r\ndesire to cross the impassable ocean of battle. How can I then abandon\r\nthem that are desirous of crossing that ocean which hath no other ferry?\r\nThis is the time when all those have been supported by Dhritarashtra's\r\nsons should exert themselves for their masters. I shall certainly act for\r\nthem, reckless of even my life. Those sinful men of unsteady heart, who,\r\nwell-fed and well-furnished (with every necessary) by their masters, undo\r\nthe benefit received by them when the time cometh for paying back, are\r\nthieves of their master's cakes, have neither this nor the other world\r\nfor them. I will not speak deceitfully unto thee. For the sake of\r\nDhritarashtra's son, I shall fight against thy sons to the best of my\r\nstrength and might. I must not, however, abandon kindness and the conduct\r\nthat becometh the good. Thy words, therefore, however beneficial cannot\r\nbe obeyed by me now. This thy solicitation to me will not yet be\r\nfruitless. Except Arjuna, thy other sons, Yudhishthira, Bhima, and the\r\ntwins, though capable of being withstood by me in tight and capable also\r\nof being slain, shall not yet be slain by me. It is with Arjuna alone,\r\namong all the combatants of Yudhishthira, that I will fight. Slaying\r\nArjuna in battle, I shall achieve great merit, or slain by Savyasachin, I\r\nshall be covered with glory. O famous lady, the number of thy sons will\r\nnever be less than five. Five it will always be,--either with me, or with\r\nArjuna, and myself slain.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Karna, Kunti who was trembling with grief,\r\nembraced her son who was unmoved in consequence of his fortitude, and\r\nsaid, 'Indeed, O Karna, even if what thou sayest seemeth to be possible,\r\nthe Kauravas will certainly be exterminated. Destiny is all. Thou hast,\r\nhowever, O grinder of foes, granted to four of thy brothers the pledge of\r\nsafety. Let that pledge be borne in thy remembrance at the time of\r\nshooting of weapons in battle.' And having told all this, Pritha also\r\naddressed Karna, saying, 'Blessed be thou, and let health be thine.' And\r\nKarna replied unto her, saying, 'Be it so!'

And\r\ndismissing all the kings, with Virata and others at their heads, the five\r\nbrothers--the Pandavas--when the sun had set, said their evening prayers.\r\nAnd with hearts ever fixed on Krishna they began to think of him. And, at\r\nlast, bringing Krishna of Dasarha's race into their midst, they began to\r\ndeliberate again about what they should do. And Yudhishthira said, 'O\r\nthou of eyes like lotus-petals, it behoveth thee to tell us all that thou\r\nsaidst unto Dhritarashtra's son in the assembly (of the Kurus), having\r\ngone to Nagapura.' Vasudeva said, 'Having gone to Nagapura, I addressed\r\nDhritarashtra's son in the assembly such words as were true, reasonable,\r\nand beneficial. That wicked minded fellow did not, however, accept them.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'When Duryodhana desired to tread along the wrong\r\npath, what did the aged Kuru grandsire say, O Hrishikesa, unto that\r\nvindictive prince? What also did the highly-blessed preceptor--the son of\r\nBharadwaja, say? And what did his parents Dhritarashtra and Gandhari say?\r\nWhat did our junior father Kshattri, who is the foremost of all persons\r\nconversant with virtue, and who is always afflicted with sorrow on\r\naccount of ourselves whom he regards as his sons, say unto\r\nDhritarashtra's son? What also did all the kings who sat in that assembly\r\nsay? O Janardana, say it all unto us, exactly as it happened. Thou hast\r\nalready told us all the disagreeable words that the Kuru chiefs (Bhishma\r\nand Dhritarashtra) and others in that assembly of the Kurus said unto the\r\nwicked Duryodhana who is overwhelmed with lust and covetousness, and who\r\nregardeth himself wise. Those words, however, O Kesava, have flitted away\r\nfrom my memory. O Govinda, I desire to hear, O lord, all those words\r\nagain. Act thou in such a way that the opportunity may not pass away.\r\nThou, O Krishna, art our refuge, thou art our lord, thou art our guide!'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'Hear, O king, the words that were addressed to king\r\nSuyodhana in the midst of the assembly of the Kurus, and, O king of\r\nkings, bear them in thy mind. After my words were ended, Dhritarashtra's\r\nson laughed aloud. Highly incensed at this, Bhishma then said, 'Hear, O\r\nDuryodhana, what I say for (the preservation of) our race, and having\r\nheard it, O tiger among kings, do what is beneficial to thy own house. O\r\nsire, O king, my father Santanu, was widely known in the world. I was, at\r\nfirst, his only son. A desire sprung up in his heart as to how he might\r\nobtain a second son, for the wise say that an only son is no son,--Let\r\nnot my race be extinct may my fame be spread. Even this was his desire.\r\nKnowing this to have been his desire, I procured Kali to become my\r\nmother, having myself made a promise highly difficult to observe, for the\r\nsake of my father as also for the sake of our race. How, in consequence\r\nof that promise I could not be king and have drawn up my vital seed, are,\r\nof course, well-known to thee. (I do not grieve for that). Observing that\r\nvow of mine, behold, I am living in happiness and joy. In her, O king,\r\nwas born my younger brother, that mighty-armed and handsome supporter of\r\nKuru's race, viz., Vichitravirya of virtuous soul. After my father's\r\nascension to heaven, I installed Vichitravirya as a ruler of the kingdom,\r\nthat was mine, while I placed myself under him as a servant of his. O\r\nking of kings, I then brought him suitable wives, having vanquished many\r\nassembled monarchs. Thou hast heard of it often. Sometime after, I was\r\nengaged in a single combat with the (great) Rama. From fear of Rama, my\r\nbrother fled, the more so as his subject deserted him. During this\r\nperiod, he became very much attached to his wives and accordingly had an\r\nattack of phthisis. Upon his death, there was anarchy in the kingdom and\r\nthe chief of the gods poured not a drop of rain (on the realm).' The\r\nsubjects then, afflicted by fear of hunger, hastened to me and said, 'Thy\r\nsubjects are on the point of being exterminated. Be thou our king for the\r\nsake of our good. Dispel this drought. Blessed be thou, O perpetuator of\r\nSantanu's race. Thy subjects are being greatly afflicted by severe and\r\nfrightful maladies. Very few of them are still alive. It behoveth thee, O\r\nson of Ganga, to save them. Dispel these tortures. O hero, cherish thy\r\nsubjects righteously. When thou art alive, let not the kingdom go to\r\ndestruction.' Hearing these words of theirs uttered in a weeping voice,\r\nmy heart was undisturbed. Remembering the behaviour of good, I desired to\r\nmaintain my vow. Then, O king, the citizens, my auspicious mother Kali\r\nherself, our servants, the priests and the preceptors (of our house), and\r\nmany Brahmanas of great learning, all afflicted with great woe, solicited\r\nme to occupy the throne.' And they said, 'When thou art alive, shall the\r\nkingdom, ruled by Pratipa (of old), go to ruin? O thou of magnanimous\r\nheart, be thou the king for our good.' Thus addressed by them, I joined\r\nmy hands together and, myself filled with grief and greatly afflicted, I\r\nrepresented to them the vow I had made from filial respect. I repeatedly\r\ninformed them that for the sake of our race, I had vowed to live with\r\nvital seed drawn up and foreswearing the throne. It was especially for my\r\nmother, again, that I did so. I, therefore, begged them not to put me to\r\nthe yoke. I again joined my hands and conciliated my mother, saying, 'O\r\nmother, begot by Santanu and being a member of Kuru's race, I cannot\r\nfalsify my promise.' I repeatedly told her this. And, O king, I said\r\nfurther, It is for thee especially, O mother, that I took this vow; I am\r\nverily thy servant and slave, O mother, thou that art distinguished for\r\nparental affection.' Having begged my mother and the people thus, I then\r\nsolicited the great sage Vyasa for begetting children upon the wives of\r\nmy brother. Indeed, O king, both myself and my mother gratified that\r\nRishi. At last, O king, the Rishi granted our prayers in the matter of\r\nthe children. And he begot three sons in all, O best of Bharata's race.\r\nThy father was born blind, and in consequence of this congenital defect\r\nof a sense, he could not become king. The high-souled and celebrated\r\nPandu became king. And when Pandu became king, his sons must obtain their\r\npaternal inheritance. O sire, do not quarrel, give them half the kingdom.\r\nWhen I am alive, what other man is competent to reign? Do not disregard\r\nmy words. I only wish that there should be peace amongst you. O sire, O\r\nking, I make no distinction between thee and then (but love all of you\r\nequally). What I have said unto thee represents also the opinion of thy\r\nfather, of Gandhari, and also of Vidura. The words of those that are old\r\nshould always be listened to. Do not disregard these words of mine. Do\r\nnot destroy all thou hast and the earth also.'\""

(Though king by right) that perpetuator of Kuru's race yet made\r\nover the sovereignty to his elder brother, Dhritarashtra, endued with\r\ngreat wisdom, and to his younger brother Kshattri (Vidura). And placing\r\nthis Dhritarashtra of unfading glory on the throne, that royal son of\r\nKuru's race went to the woods with his two wives. And that tiger among\r\nmen, Vidura, with great humility, placing himself in subjection to\r\nDhritarashtra, began to wait on him like a slave, fanning him with the\r\nbranch of a tender palm. And all the subjects then, O sire, duly tendered\r\ntheir submission to king Dhritarashtra just as they had done to king\r\nPandu himself. And having made over the kingdom to Dhritarashtra and\r\nVidura, that conqueror of hostile cities, Pandu, wandered over the whole\r\nearth. Always devoted to truth, Vidura then took charge of the finances,\r\ngifts, superintendence of the servants (of the state), and the feeding of\r\nall, while that conqueror of hostile cities, Bhishma, of mighty energy,\r\nsupervised the making of war and peace and the necessity of making or\r\nwithholding gifts to kings. When king Dhritarashtra of great strength was\r\non the throne, the high-souled Vidura was near him. Born in\r\nDhritarashtra's race how dost thou venture to bring about a disunion in\r\nthe family? Uniting with thy brothers (the Pandavas) enjoy all objects of\r\nenjoyment. O king, I do not say this to you from cowardice, nor for the\r\nsake of wealth. I am enjoying the wealth that Bhishma gave me, and not\r\nthou, O best of kings. I do not desire, O king, to have from thee my\r\nmeans of sustenance. Where Bhishma is, there Drona must be. Do what\r\nBhishma hath told thee. O grinder of foes, give unto the sons of Pandu\r\nhalf the kingdom. O sire, I acted as their preceptor as much as thine.\r\nIndeed, even as Aswatthaman is to me, so is Arjuna of white steeds. What\r\nuse is there of much declamation? Victory is there where righteousness\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva continued, 'After Drona, of immeasurable energy, had said this,\r\nthe virtuous Vidura then, O king, who is devoted to truth, said these\r\nwords, turning towards his uncle (Bhishma) and looking at his face. And\r\nVidura said, 'O Devavrata, attend to the words I speak. This race of\r\nKuru, when it became extinct, was revived by thee. It is for this that\r\nthou art indifferent to my lamentations now. In this our race, its stain\r\nis this Duryodhana, whose inclinations are followed by thee, although he\r\nis enslaved by avarice, and is wicked and ungrateful and deprived of his\r\nsenses by lust. The Kurus will certainly bear consequence of the acts of\r\nthat Duryodhana who transgresseth the command of his father, observant of\r\nvirtue and profit. O great king, act thou so that the Kurus may not\r\nperish. Like a painter producing a picture, it was thou, O king, who\r\nhadst caused me and Dhritarashtra to spring into life. The Creator,\r\nhaving created creatures, destroys them again. Do not act like him.\r\nSeeing before thy very eyes this extinction of thy race, be not\r\nindifferent to it. If, however, thy understanding is gone in consequence\r\nof the universal slaughter that is at hand, go then to the woods, taking\r\nme and Dhritarashtra with thee. Otherwise, binding this very day wicked\r\nDuryodhana that hath deceit for his wisdom, rule this kingdom with the\r\nsons of Pandu guarding it around. Relent, O tiger among kings. A great\r\nslaughter of the Pandavas, the Kurus, and of other kings of immeasurable\r\nenergy is before us.'\r\n\r\n'Having said this, Vidura ceased, his heart overflowing with sorrow. And\r\nreflecting on the matter, he began to draw repeated sighs. Then the\r\ndaughter of king Suvala, alarmed at the prospect of the destruction of a\r\nwhole race, said, from wrath, these words fraught with virtue and profit,\r\nto cruel Duryodhana of wicked heart, in the presence of the assembled\r\nmonarchs, 'Let all the kings present in this royal assembly and let the\r\nregenerate Rishis that form the other members of this conclave, listen\r\n(to me) as I proclaim the guilt of thy sinful self backed by all thy\r\ncounsellors. The kingdom of the Kurus is enjoyable in due order of\r\nsuccession. Even this hath always been the custom of our race. Of sinful\r\nsoul and exceedingly wicked in acts, thou seekest the destruction of the\r\nKuru kingdom by thy unrighteousness. Wise Dhritarashtra is in possession\r\nof the kingdom, having Vidura of great foresight under him (as his\r\nadviser). Passing over these two, why, O Duryodhana, dost thou, from\r\ndelusion, covet the sovereignty now? Even the high-souled king and\r\nKshattri, when Bhishma is alive, should both be subordinate to him.\r\nIndeed, this foremost of men, this offspring of Ganga, the high-souled\r\nBhishma, in consequence of his righteousness, doth not desire the\r\nsovereignty. It is for this reason that this invincible kingdom became\r\nPandu's. His sons, therefore, are masters today and no other. The\r\nextensive kingdom, then by paternal right, belongeth to the Pandavas, and\r\ntheir sons and grandsons in due order. Observing the customs of our race\r\nand the rule with respect to our kingdom, we all fully accomplish that\r\nwhich this high-souled and wise chief of the Kurus, Devavrata, firmly\r\nadhering to truth, sayeth, 'Let this king (Dhritarashtra) and Vidura\r\nalso, at the command of Bhishma of great vows, proclaim the same thing.\r\nEven that is an act that should be done by those that are well-wishers\r\n(of this race). Keeping virtue in front, let Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nDharma, guided by king Dhritarashtra and urged by Santanu's son, rule for\r\nmany long years this kingdom of the Kurus lawfully obtainable by him.'\""

The\r\nlord of creatures, Soma, was the original progenitor of the Kuru race.\r\nSixth in descent from Soma, was Yayati, the son of Nahusha. Yayati had\r\nfive best of royal sages as his sons. Amongst them, lord Yadu of mighty\r\nenergy was the eldest-born. Younger to Yadu was Puru, who, as our\r\nprogenitor, brought forth by Sarmistha the daughter of Vrishaparvan.\r\nYadu, O best of the Bharatas, was born of Devayani and, therefore, O\r\nsire, was the daughter's son of Sukra, otherwise called Kavya, of\r\nimmeasurable energy. Endued with great strength and prowess, that\r\nprogenitor of the Yadavas, filled with pride and possessed of wicked\r\nunderstanding, humiliated all the Kshatriyas. Intoxicated with pride of\r\nstrength, he obeyed not the injunctions of his father. Invincible in\r\nbattle, he insulted his father and brother. On this earth girt on four\r\nsides by the sea, Yadu became all-powerful, and reducing all to\r\nsubjection, he established himself in this city called after the\r\nelephant. His father Yayati, the son of Nahusha, enraged with him, cursed\r\nthat son of his, and, O son of Gandhari, even expelled him from the\r\nkingdom. Angry Yayati also cursed those brothers of Yadu who were\r\nobedient to that eldest brother of theirs, who was so proud of his\r\nstrength. And having cursed his these sons, that best of kings placed on\r\nhis throne his youngest son Puru who was docile and obedient to him. Thus\r\neven the eldest son may be passed over and deprived of the kingdom, and\r\nyounger sons may, in consequence of their respectful behaviour to the\r\naged, obtain the kingdom. So also, conversant with every virtue there was\r\nmy father's grandfather, king Pratipa, who was celebrated over the three\r\nworlds. Unto that lion among kings, who ruled his kingdom virtuously were\r\nborn three sons of great fame and resembling three gods. Of them, Devapi\r\nwas the eldest, Vahlika the next and Santanu of great intelligence, who,\r\nO sire, was my grandfather, was the youngest. Devapi, endued with great\r\nenergy, was virtuous, truthful in speech, and ever engaged in waiting\r\nupon his father. But that best of kings had a skin-disease. Popular with\r\nboth the citizens and the subjects of the provinces, respected by the\r\ngood, and dearly loved by the young and the old, Devapi was liberal\r\nfirmly adhering to truth, engaged in the good of all creatures, and\r\nobedient to the instructions of his father as also of the Brahmanas. He\r\nwas dearly loved by his brother Vahlika as also the high-souled Santanu.\r\nGreat, indeed, was the brotherly love that prevailed between him and his\r\nhigh-souled brothers. In course of time, the old and best of kings,\r\nPratipa, caused all preparations to be made according to the scriptures\r\nfor the installation of Devapi (on the throne). Indeed, the lord Pratipa\r\ncaused every auspicious preparation. The installation of Devapi, however,\r\nwas forbidden by the Brahmanas and all aged persons amongst the citizens\r\nand the inhabitants of the provinces. Hearing that the installation of\r\nhis son was forbidden, the voice of the old king became choked with tears\r\nand he began to grieve for his son. Thus, though Devapi was liberal,\r\nvirtuous, devoted to truth, and loved by the subjects, yet in consequence\r\nof his skin-disease, he was excluded from his inheritance. The gods do\r\nnot approve of a king that is defective of a limb. Thinking of this,\r\nthose bulls among Brahmanas forbade king Pratipa to install his eldest\r\nson. Devapi then, who was defective of one limb, beholding the king (his\r\nfather) prevented (from installing him on the throne) and filled with\r\nsorrow on his account, retired into the woods. As regards Vahlika,\r\nabandoning his (paternal) kingdom he dwelt with his maternal uncle.\r\nAbandoning his father and brother, he obtained the highly wealthy kingdom\r\nof his maternal grandfather. With Vahlika's permission, O prince, Santanu\r\nof world-wide fame, on the death of his father (Pratipa), became king and\r\nruled the kingdom. In this way also, O Bharata, though I am the eldest,\r\nyet being defective of a limb, I was excluded from the kingdom by\r\nintelligent Pandu, no doubt, after much reflection. And Pandu himself,\r\nthough younger to me in age, obtained the kingdom and became king. At his\r\ndeath, O chastiser of foes, that kingdom must pass to his sons. When I\r\ncould not obtain the kingdom, how canst thou covet it? Thou art not the\r\nson of a king, and, therefore, hast no right to this kingdom. Thou,\r\nhowever, desirest to appropriate the property of others. High-souled\r\nYudhishthira is the son of a king. This kingdom is lawfully his. Of\r\nmagnanimous soul, even he is the ruler and lord of this race of Kuru. He\r\nis devoted to truth, of clear perception, obedient to the counsels of\r\nfriends, honest, loved by the subjects, kind to all well-wishers, master\r\nof his passions, and the chastiser of all that are not good. Forgiveness,\r\nrenunciation, self-control, knowledge of the scriptures, mercy to all\r\ncreatures, competence to rule according to the dictates of virtue, of all\r\nthese attributes of royalty exist in Yudhishthira. Thou art not the son\r\nof a king, and art always sinfully inclined towards thy relatives. O\r\nwretch, how canst thou succeed in appropriating this kingdom that\r\nlawfully belongeth to others? Dispelling this delusion, give half the\r\nkingdom with (a share of the) animals and other possessions. Then, O\r\nking, mayest thou hope to live for some time with thy younger brothers.'\""

In view,\r\ntherefore, of What hath happened, do now, O monarch, that which seemeth\r\nto be proper. I have told thee, O king, everything that, O Bharata, that\r\nwas said by Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, Gandhari and Dhritarashtra, in my\r\npresence. The arts beginning with conciliation were all, O king, employed\r\nby me from desire of establishing brotherly feelings (between yourselves\r\nand your cousins), for the preservation of this race, and for the growth\r\nand prosperity of the (earth's) population. When conciliation failed, I\r\nemployed the art of (producing) dissensions and mentioned, ye Pandavas,\r\nall your ordinary and extraordinary feats. Indeed, when Suyodhana showed\r\nno respect for the conciliatory words, (I spoke), I caused all the kings\r\nto be assembled together and endeavoured to produce dissension (amongst\r\nthem). Extraordinary and awful and terrible and superhuman indications,\r\nO, Bharata, were then manifested by me. O lord, rebuking all the kings,\r\nmaking a straw of Suyodhana, terrifying Radha's son and repeatedly\r\ncensuring Suvala's son for the gambling match of Dhritarashtra's sons,\r\nand once again endeavouring to disunite all the kings by means of both\r\nwords and intrigues, I again had recourse to conciliation. For the unity\r\nof Kuru's race and in view of the special requirements of the business\r\n(at hand), I spoke also of gift. Indeed, I said, 'Those heroes, the sons\r\nof Pandu, sacrificing their pride, will live in dependence on\r\nDhritarashtra, Bhishma and Vidura. Let the kingdom be given to thee. Let\r\nthem have no power. Let: it all be as the king (Dhritarashtra), as\r\nGanga's son (Bhishma) and as Vidura say for thy good. Let the kingdom be\r\nthine. Relinquish but five villages (to the Pandavas). O best of kings,\r\nwithout doubt they deserve to be supported by thy father. Though\r\naddressed thus, that wicked soul do not still give you your share. I,\r\ntherefore, see that chastisement, and nothing else, is now the means that\r\nshould be employed against those sinful persons. Indeed, all those kings\r\nhave already marched to, Kurukshetra. I have now told thee everything\r\nthat had happened in the assembly of the Kurus. They will not, O son of\r\nPandu, give thee thy kingdom without battle. With death waiting before\r\nthem, they have all become the cause of a universal destruction.'\""

Ye have also understood the words uttered by Kesava. Ye,\r\nbest of men, draw up, therefore, my troops now in battle-array in which\r\nthey are to fight. Here are seven Akshauhinis of troops assembled for our\r\nvictory. Hear the names of those seven celebrated warriors that would\r\nlead those seven Akshauhinis. They are Drupada, and Virata, and\r\nDhristadyumna, and Sikhandin, and Satyaki, Chekitana, and Bhimasena of\r\ngreat energy. Those heroes will be the leaders of my troops. All of them\r\nare conversant with the Vedas. Endued with great bravery, all of them\r\nhave practised excellent vows. Possessed of modesty, all of them are\r\nconversant with policy, and accomplished in war. Well-skilled in arrows\r\nand weapons, all of them are competent in the use of every kind of\r\nweapon. Tell us now, O Sahadeva, O son of Kuru's race, who that warrior,\r\nis conversant with all kinds of battle-array, that may become the leader\r\nof these seven and may also withstand in battle Bhishma who is like unto\r\na fire having arrows for its flames. Give us thy own opinion, O tiger\r\namong men, as who is fit to be our generalissimo.'\r\n\r\n\"Sahadeva said, 'Closely related to us, sympathising with us in our\r\ndistress, endued with great might, conversant with every virtue, skilled\r\nin weapons, and irresistible in battle, the mighty king of the Matsyas,\r\nVirata, relying upon whom we hope to recover our share of the kingdom,\r\nwill be able to bear in battle both Bhishma and all those mighty\r\ncar-warriors.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Sahadeva had said this, eloquent Nakula\r\nthen said these words, 'He that in years, in knowledge of scriptures, in\r\nperseverance, in family and birth, is respectable; he that is endued with\r\nmodesty, strength, and prosperity; he that is well-versed in all branches\r\nof learning; he that studied the science of weapons (with the sage\r\nBharadwaja); he, who is irresistible and firmly devoted to truth; he that\r\nalways challenges Drona and mighty Bhishma; he that belongs to one of the\r\nforemost of royal houses; he that is a famous leader of hosts; he that\r\nresembles a tree of hundred branches in consequence of sons and grandsons\r\nthat surround him; that king, who, with his wife, performed, moved by\r\nwrath, the austerest of penances for the destruction of Drona; that hero,\r\nwho is an ornament of assemblies; that bull among monarchs who always\r\ncherishes us like a father; that father-in-law of ours, Drupada, should\r\nbe our generalissimo. It is my opinion that he will be able to withstand\r\nboth Drona and Bhishma rushing to battle, for that king is the friend of\r\nAngira's descendant Drona and is conversant with celestial weapons.'\r\n\r\n'After the two sons of Madri had thus expressed their individual\r\nopinions, Vasava's son, Savyasachin, who was equal to Vasava himself,\r\nsaid these words, 'This celestial person of the hue of fire and endued\r\nwith mighty arms, who sprang into life through the power of ascetic\r\npenances and the gratification of sages; who issued from the sacrificial\r\nfire-hole armed with bow and sword, accoutred in armour of steel, mounted\r\non a car unto which were yoked excellent steeds of the best breed, and\r\nthe clatter of whose car-wheels was as deep as the roar of mighty masses\r\nof clouds; this hero endued with that energy and strength and resembling\r\nthe very lion in his frame of body and prowess, and possessed of leonine\r\nshoulders, arms, chest, and voice like the lion's roar; this hero of\r\ngreat effulgence; this warrior of handsome brows, fine teeth, round\r\ncheeks, long arms, of stout make, excellent thighs, large expansive eyes,\r\nexcellent legs, and strong frame; this prince who is incapable of being\r\npenetrated by weapons of any kind, and who looks like an elephant with\r\nrent temples; this Dhrishtadyumna, truthful in speech, and with passions\r\nunder control, was born for the destruction of Drona. It is this\r\nDhrishtadyumna, I think, that will be able to bear Bhishma's arrows which\r\nstrike with the vehemence of the thunderbolt and look like snakes with\r\nblazing mouths, which resemble the messengers of Yama in speed, and fall\r\nlike flames of fire (consuming everything they touch), and which were\r\nborne before by Rama alone in battle. I do not, O king, see the man\r\nexcept Dhrishtadyumna, who is able to withstand Bhishma of great vows.\r\nThis is just what I think. Endued with great lightness of hand and\r\nconversant with all the modes of warfare, accoutred in coat of mail that\r\nis incapable of being penetrated by weapons, this handsome hero,\r\nresembling the leader of a herd of elephants, is according to my opinion,\r\nfit to be our generalissimo.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhima then said, 'That son of Drupada, Sikhandin, who is born for the\r\ndestruction of Bhishma, as is said, 'O king, by the sages and Siddhas\r\nassembled together, whose form on the field of battle, while displaying\r\ncelestial weapons, will be seen by men to resemble that of the\r\nillustrious Rama himself, I see not, O king, the person who is able to\r\npierce with weapons that Sikhandin, when he is stationed for battle on\r\nhis car, accoutred in mail. Except the heroic Sikhandin, there is no\r\nother warrior who is able to slay Bhishma in single combat. It is for\r\nthis, O king, that I think Sikhandin is fit to be our generalissimo.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'O sire, the strength and weakness, might and\r\nfeebleness, of everything in the universe, and the intentions of every\r\nperson here, are well-known to virtuous Kesava. Skilled or unskilled in\r\nweapons, old or young, let him be the leader of my forces, who may be\r\nindicated by Krishna of Dasarha's race. Even he is the root of our\r\nsuccess or defeat. In him are our lives, our kingdom, our prosperity and\r\nadversity, our happiness and misery. Even he is the Ordainer and Creator.\r\nIn him is established the fruition of our desires. Let him, therefore, be\r\nthe leader of our host, who may be named by Krishna. Let that foremost of\r\nspeakers say, for the night approacheth. Having selected our leader,\r\nworshipped our weapons with offerings of flowers and perfumes, we will,\r\nat day-break, under Krishna's orders march to the field of battle!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the intelligent king,\r\nYudhishthira the Just, the lotus-eyed Krishna said, eyeing Dhananjaya,\r\nthe white, O king, I fully approve of all those powerful warriors whom ye\r\nhave named for becoming the leaders of thy troops. All of them are\r\ncompetent to withstand thy foes. Indeed, they can frighten Indra himself\r\nin great battle, let alone the covetous and wicked-minded sons of\r\nDhritarashtra. O thou of mighty arms, for thy good I made great efforts\r\nto prevent the battle by bringing about peace. By that we have been freed\r\nfrom the debt we owed to virtue. Fault-finding persons will not be able\r\nto reproach us for anything. Foolish Duryodhana, destitute of\r\nunderstanding, regardeth himself as skilled in weapons, and though really\r\nweak thinketh himself to be possessed of strength. Array thy troops soon,\r\nfor slaughter is the only means by which they can be made to yield to our\r\ndemands. Indeed, the sons of Dhritarashtra will never be able to keep\r\ntheir ground when they will behold Dhananjaya with Yuyudhana as his\r\nsecond, and Abhimanyu, and the five sons of Draupadi, and Virata, and\r\nDrupada, and the other kings of fierce prowess,--all lords of\r\nAkshauhinis. Our army is possessed of great strength, and is invincible\r\nand incapable of being withstood. Without doubt, it will slay the\r\nDhartarashtra host. As regards our leader, I would name that chastiser of\r\nfoes, Dhrishtadyumna.'\""

And the troops began to move about with great speed,\r\nsaying, 'Draw up, Draw up.' And the neighing of steeds and roars of\r\nelephants and the clatter of car-wheels and the blare of conchs and the\r\nsound of drums, heard everywhere, produced a tremendous din. And teeming\r\nwith cars and foot-soldiers and steeds and elephants, that invincible\r\nhost of the marching Pandavas moving hither and thither, donning their\r\ncoats of mail, and uttering their war-cries, looked like the impetuous\r\ncurrent of the Ganga when at its full, agitated with fierce eddies and\r\nwaves. And in the van of that host marched Bhimasena, and the two sons of\r\nMadri encased in their coats of mail, and Subhadra's son and the five\r\nsons of Draupadi and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race. And the\r\nPrabhadrakas and the Panchalas marched behind Bhimasena. And the din made\r\nby the marching hosts, filled with joy, was like unto the roars of the\r\ndeep when the tide is highest on the day of the new moon. Indeed, the\r\ntumult was such that it seemed to reach the very heavens. And capable of\r\nbreaking hostile ranks, those warriors cased in armour marched thus,\r\nfilled with joy. And Kunti's son, king Yudhishthira, amongst them\r\nmarched, taking with him the cars and other vehicles for transport, the\r\nfood-stores and fodder, the tents, carriages, and draught-cattle, the\r\ncash-chests, the machines and weapons, the surgeons and physicians, the\r\ninvalids, and all the emaciated and weak soldiers, and all the attendants\r\nand camp-followers. And truthful Draupadi, the princess of Panchala,\r\naccompanied by the ladies of the household, and surrounded by servants\r\nand maids, remained at Upaplavya. And causing their treasure and ladies\r\nto be guarded by bodies of soldiers, some of whom were placed as\r\npermanent lines of circumvallation and some ordered to move about at a\r\ndistance from this line, the Pandavas set out with their mighty host. And\r\nhaving made presents of kine and gold to the Brahmanas, who walked around\r\nthem and uttered blessings, the sons of Pandu commenced the march on\r\ntheir cars decked with jewels. And the princes of Kekaya, and\r\nDhrishtaketu, and the son of the king of the Kasis, and Srenimat, and\r\nVasudana, and the invincible Sikhandin, all hale and hearty, cased in\r\narmour and armed with weapons and decked with ornaments, marched behind\r\nYudhishthira, keeping him in their centre. And in the rear, were Virata,\r\nYajnasena's son of the Somaka race (Dhrishtadyumna), Susarman,\r\nKuntibhoja, Dhrishtadyumna's sons, forty thousand cars, five times as\r\nmuch cavalry, infantry ten times more numerous (than the last), and sixty\r\nthousand elephants. And Anadhrishti, and Chekitana and Dhrishtaketu and\r\nSatyaki all marched, surrounding Vasudeva and Dhananjaya. And reaching\r\nthe field of Kurukshetra with their forces in battle-array, those\r\nsmiters, the sons of Pandu, looked like roaring bulls. And entering the\r\nfield, those chastisers of foes blew their conchs. And Vasudeva and\r\nDhananjaya also blew their conchs. And hearing the blare of the conch\r\ncalled Panchajanya, which resembled the roll of the thunder, all the\r\nwarriors (of the Pandava army) were filled with joy. And the leonine\r\nroars of those warriors, endued with lightness of hand and speed of\r\nmotion, mingling with the blare of conchs and beat of Drums, made the\r\nwhole earth, the welkin, and the oceans resound therewith.'\""

Kunti's\r\nhigh-souled son, Yudhishthira, pitched his camp on a delightful, fertile,\r\nopen and sacred part of the plain. And rising up, again, after his\r\nanimals had been given sufficient rest, the king set out joyously\r\nsurrounded by hundreds and thousands of monarchs. And Kesava accompanied\r\nby Partha began to move about, scattering numerous soldiers of\r\nDhritarashtra (kept as outposts). And Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race\r\nand that mighty car-warrior of great energy, viz., Yuyudhana, otherwise\r\ncalled Satyaki, measured the ground for the encampment. And arrived, O\r\nBharata, at the holy Hiranwati which flows through Kurukshetra, which was\r\nfilled with sacred water, and whose bed was divested of pointed pebbles\r\nand mire, and which was regarded as an excellent tirtha, Kesava caused a\r\nmoat to be excavated there, and for its protection stationed a sufficient\r\nnumber of troops with proper instructions. And the rules that were\r\nobserved in respect of the tents of the high-souled Pandavas, were\r\nfollowed by Kesava in the matter of the tents he caused to be set up for\r\nthe kings (that came as their allies). And, O monarch, costly tents,\r\nincapable of being attacked, apart from one another, were, by hundreds\r\nand thousands, set up for those kings on the surface of the earth, that\r\nlooked like palatial residences and abounded with fuels and edibles and\r\ndrinks. And there were assembled hundreds upon hundreds of skilled\r\nmechanics, in receipt of regular wages and surgeons and physicians,\r\nwell-versed in their own science, and furnished with every ingredient\r\nthey might need. And king Yudhishthira caused to be placed in every\r\npavilion large quantities, high as hills, of bow-strings and bows and\r\ncoats of mail and weapons, honey and clarified butter, pounded lac,\r\nwater, fodder of cattle, chaff and coals, heavy machines, long shafts,\r\nlances, battleaxes, bow-staffs, breast-plates, scimitars and quivers. And\r\ninnumerable elephants cased in plates of steel with prickles thereon,\r\nhuge as hills, and capable of fighting with hundreds and thousands, were\r\nseen there. And learning that the Pandavas had encamped on that field,\r\ntheir allies, O Bharata, with their forces and animals, began to march\r\nthither.

O thou of unfading glory,\r\nwhat should we do in view of the occasion that hath come? By acting in\r\nwhat way may we keep on the track of our duty? Thou, O Vasudeva, art\r\nacquainted with the views of Duryodhana, Karna, and Sakuni, the son of\r\nSuvala. Thou knowest also what views are entertained by myself and my\r\nbrothers. Thou hast heard the words uttered by both Vidura and Bhishma. O\r\nthou of great wisdom, thou hast also heard in their entirety the words of\r\nwisdom spoken by Kunti. Overlooking all these, tell us, O thou of mighty\r\narms, after reflection, and without hesitation, what is for our good.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the Just, that were fraught\r\nwith virtue and profit.

King Yudhishthira the Just, however, beholding the\r\n(impending) slaughter of those that deserved not to be slain, began to\r\nsigh deeply, and addressing Bhimasena and Vijaya, said, 'That for the\r\nsake of which I accepted an exile into the woods and for which I suffered\r\nso much misery, that great calamity overtaketh us of a set purpose.

What kind of victory\r\nshall we achieve by slaying our preceptors of venerable age?'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the Just, Savyasachin repeated\r\nto his elder brother all those words that Vasudeva had said. And\r\naddressing Yudhishthira, Arjuna continued, 'Thou hast, O king, certainly\r\nunderstood all the words spoken by Kunti and Vidura, that were repeated\r\nto thee by Devaki's son.

Besides this, O son of Kunti, we\r\ncannot withdraw without engaging in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing this speech of Savyasachin, Vasudeva also said unto Partha, 'It\r\nis even so (as thou hast said).

And furnished with timber and planks for repairing the damages\r\ntheir cars might sustain in the press of battle, with large quivers borne\r\non cars, with tiger-skins and other stiff leather for enveloping the\r\nsides of cars, with barbed javelins to be hurled by the hand, with\r\nquivers borne on the backs of steeds and elephants, with long-handled\r\nspears of iron and missiles, with quivers borne on the backs of\r\nfoot-soldiers with heavy clubs of woods, with flagstaffs and banners,\r\nwith long heavy shafts shot from bows, with diverse kinds of nooses and\r\nlassoes, with armour of various kinds, with short-pointed clubs of wood,\r\nwith oil, treacle, and sand, with earthen pots filled with poisonous\r\nsnakes, with pulverised lac and other inflammable matter, with short\r\nspears furnished with tinkling bells, with diverse weapons of iron, and\r\nmachines, for hurling hot treacle, water, and stones, with whistling\r\nclubs of hard wood, with wax and heavy mallets, with clubs of wood having\r\niron spikes, with plough-poles and poisoned darts, with long syringes for\r\npouring warm treacle and planks of cane, with battle-axes and forked\r\nlances with spiked gauntlets, with axes and pointed iron-spikes, with\r\ncars having their sides covered with skins of tigers, and leopards, with\r\nsharp-edged circular planks of wood, with horns, with javelins and\r\nvarious other weapons of attack, with axes of the kuthara species, and\r\nspades, with cloths steeped in oil, and with clarified butter, the\r\ndivisions of Duryodhana, glittering with robes embroidered with gold and\r\ndecked with various kinds of jewels and gems and consisting of warriors\r\nendued with handsome persons, blazed forth like fire. And cased in coats\r\nof mail and well-skilled in weapons, accomplished in horse-lore, brave\r\npersons of good birth were employed as car-drivers. And all the cars were\r\nfurnished with various drugs, and with horses having rows of bells and\r\npearls on their heads, and with banners and flagstaffs, and with\r\nornaments gracing their steeples and turrets and with shields, swords,\r\nand lances, and javelins and spiked maces. And unto each of those cars\r\nwere yoked four steeds of the best breed. And upon each of them were kept\r\na hundred bows. And each car had one driver in charge of the couple of\r\nsteeds in front, and two drivers in charge of the couple of steeds\r\nattached to the wheels on the two sides. And both of the last-mentioned\r\ndrivers were skilled car-warriors, while the car-warrior himself was also\r\nskilled in driving steeds. And thousands of cars thus furnished and\r\ndecked with gold, and protected like fortified town and incapable of\r\nbeing conquered by foes, were stationed on all sides. And the elephants\r\nalso were furnished with rows of bells and pearls and decked with diverse\r\nornaments. And on the back of each of those animals, mounted seven\r\nwarriors. And in consequence of such accoutrements those animals looked\r\nlike hills graced with jewels. And amongst the seven, two were armed with\r\nhooks, two were excellent bowmen, two were first-rate swords-men, and\r\none, O king, was armed with a lance and trident. And, O king, the army of\r\nthe illustrious Kuru king, teemed with innumerable infuriate elephants,\r\nbearing on their backs loads of weapons and quivers filled with arrows.\r\nAnd there were also thousands of steeds ridden by brave soldiers\r\naccoutred in mail, decked in ornaments, and furnished with flags. And\r\nnumbering in hundreds and thousands, all those steeds were free from the\r\nhabit of scratching the ground with their forehoofs. And they were all\r\nwell-trained, and decked with ornaments of gold, and exceedingly obedient\r\nto their riders. And of foot-soldiers, there were hundreds of thousands\r\nof diverse mien, accoutred in armours of diverse kinds and armed also\r\nwith weapons of diverse species, and decked with golden ornaments. And\r\nunto each car, were assigned ten elephants, and unto each elephant ten\r\nhorses, and unto each horse ten foot-soldiers, as protectors. Again, a\r\nlarge body of troops was kept as a reserve for rallying the ranks that\r\nwould be broken. And this reserve consisted of cars, unto each of which\r\nwere attached fifty elephants; and unto each elephant were attached a\r\nhundred horses; and unto each horse were attached seven foot-soldiers.\r\nFive hundred cars, as many elephants (fifteen hundred horses, and two\r\nthousand five hundred foot-soldiers) constitute a Sena. Ten Senas\r\nconstitute a Pritana; and ten Pritanas, a Vahini. In common parlance,\r\nhowever, the words Sena, Vahini, Pritana, Dhwajini, Chamu, Akshauhini,\r\nand Varuthini are used in the same sense.\r\n\r\n'It was thus that the intelligent Kaurava arrayed his force. Between the\r\ntwo sides, the total number was eighteen Akshauhinis. Of this, the\r\nPandava force consisted of seven Akshauhinis, while the Kaurava force\r\nconsisted of ten Akshauhinis and one more. Five times fifty men\r\nconstitute a Patti. Three Pattis make a Senamukha or Gulma. Three Gulmas\r\nmake a Gana. In Duryodhana's army, there were thousands and hundred of\r\nsuch Ganas consisting of warriors capable of smiting (the foe) and\r\nlonging for battle. And the mighty-armed king Duryodhana, selecting from\r\namong them brave and intelligent warriors, made them the leaders of his\r\ntroops. And placing an Akshauhini of troops under each of those best of\r\nmen, viz., Kripa, Drona, Salya, Jayadratha, the king of the Sindhus,\r\nSudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, Kritavarman, Drona's son\r\n(Aswatthaman), Karna, Bhurisravas, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and the\r\nmighty Vahlika, the king used to bring them daily before him and at all\r\nhours, and speak to them. And he repeatedly offered them worship before\r\nhis very eyes. And thus appointed, all warriors, with all their\r\nfollowers, became desirous of doing what was most agreeable to the king.'\""

The intelligence of two persons can never agree.\r\nDifferent commanders, again, are jealous of one another as regards their\r\nprowess. O thou of great wisdom, it is heard (by us) that (once on a\r\ntime) the Brahmanas, raising a standard of Kusa grass, encountered in\r\nbattle the Kshatriyas of the Haihaya clan endued with immeasurable\r\nenergy. O grandsire, the Vaisyas and the Sudras followed the Brahmanas,\r\nso that all the three orders were on one side, while those bulls among\r\nthe Kshatriyas were alone on the other. In the battles, however, that\r\nensued, the three orders repeatedly broke, while the Kshatriyas, though\r\nalone, vanquished large army that was opposed to them. Then those best of\r\nBrahmanas enquired of the Kshatriyas themselves (as to the cause of\r\nthis). O grandsire, those that were virtuous among the Kshatriyas\r\nreturned the true answer to the enquirers, saying, 'In battle we obey the\r\norders of one person endued with great intelligence, while ye are\r\ndisunited from one another and act according to your individual\r\nunderstanding.' The Brahmanas then appointed one amongst themselves as\r\ntheir commander, who was brave and conversant with the ways of policy.\r\nAnd they then succeeded in vanquishing the Kshatriyas. Thus people always\r\nconquer their foes in battle who appoint a skilled, brave, and sinless\r\ncommander, observing the good of the forces under him. As regards thee,\r\nthou art equal to Usanas himself, and always seekest my good. Incapable\r\nof being slain, thou art, again devoted to virtue. Be thou, therefore,\r\nour commander. Like the sun among all luminaries, like the moon unto all\r\ndelicious herbs, like Kuvera among the Yakshas, like Vasava among the\r\ngods, like Meru among mountains, Suparna among the birds, Kumara among\r\nthe gods, Havyavaha among Vasus, thou art amongst ourselves. Like the\r\ngods protected by Sakra, ourselves, protected by thee, will assuredly\r\nbecome invincible by the very gods. Like Agni's son (Kumara) at the head\r\nof the gods, march thou at our head, and let us follow thee like calves\r\nfollowing the lead of a mighty bull.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'O mighty-armed one, it is even so, 'O Bharata, as thou\r\nsayest. But the Pandavas are as dear to me as ye yourselves. Therefore, O\r\nking, I should certainly seek their good as well, although I shall\r\ncertainly fight for thee, having given thee a pledge (before) to that\r\neffect. I do not see the warrior on earth that is equal to me, except\r\nthat tiger among men, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti. Endued with great\r\nintelligence, he is conversant with innumerable celestial weapons. That\r\nson of Pandu, however, will never fight with me openly. With the power of\r\nmy weapons, I can, in a trice, destroy this universe consisting of gods,\r\nAsuras, Rakshasas, and human beings. The sons of Pandu, however, O king,\r\nare incapable of being exterminated by me. I shall, therefore, slay every\r\nday ten thousand warriors. If, indeed, they do not slay me in battle\r\nfirst, I will continue to slaughter their forces thus. There is another\r\nunderstanding on which I may willingly become the commander of thy\r\nforces. It behoveth thee to listen to that. O lord of earth, either Karna\r\nshould fight first, or I will fight first. The Suta's son always boasts\r\nof his prowess in battle, comparing it with mine.'\r\n\r\n\"Karna said, 'As long as Ganga's son liveth, O king, I shall never fight.\r\nAfter Bhishma is slain, I shall fight with the wielder of Gandiva.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, Dhritarashtra's son duly made\r\nBhishma the commander of his force, distributing large presents. And\r\nafter, his installation in the command, he blazed forth with beauty. And\r\nat the king's behest, musicians cheerfully played upon drums and blew\r\nconchs by hundreds and thousands. And numerous leonine roars were sent\r\nforth and all the animals in the camp uttered their cries together. And\r\nalthough the sky was cloudless, a bloody shower fell and made the ground\r\nmiry. And fierce whirl-winds, and earthquakes, and roars of elephants,\r\noccurring, depressed the hearts of all the warriors. Incorporeal voices\r\nand flashes of meteoric falls were heard and seen in the welkin. And\r\njackals, howling fiercely, foreboded great calamity. And, O monarch,\r\nthese and a hundred other kinds of fierce portents made their appearance\r\nwhen the king installed Ganga's son in the command of his troops. And\r\nafter making Bhishma--that grinder of hostile hosts--his general, and\r\nhaving also caused by abundant gifts of kine and gold to the Brahmanas to\r\npronounce benedictions on him, and glorified by those benedictions, and\r\nsurrounded by his troops, and with Ganga's son in the van, and\r\naccompanied by his brothers, Duryodhana marched to Kurukshetra with his\r\nlarge host. And the Kuru king, going over the plain with Karna in his\r\ncompany, caused his camp to be measured out on a level part, O monarch,\r\nof that plain. And the camp, pitched on a delightful and fertile spot\r\nabounding with grass and fuel, shone like Hastinapura itself.'\""

Even this, O mighty armed one, is what I also like.\r\nLet therefore, that be done which should be done next. Let, indeed, seven\r\nleaders be selected for thy army.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Summoning then those warriors eager for battle,\r\nviz., Drupada and Virata, and that bull of Sini's race, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna the prince of Panchala, and king Dhrishtaketu, and prince\r\nShikhandi of Panchala, and Sahadeva, the ruler of the Magadhas,\r\nYudhishthira duly appointed them in the command of his seven divisions.\r\nAnd above them all was placed in command of all the troops that\r\nDhrishtadyumna who had sprung from the blazing (sacrificial) fire for the\r\ndestruction of Drona. And Dhananjaya, of curly hair, was made the leader\r\nof all those high-souled leaders. And handsome Janardana endued with\r\ngreat intelligence, he who was the younger brother of Sankarshana, was\r\nchosen as the guide of Arjuna and the driver of his steeds.'\r\n\r\n\"And beholding that a very destructive battle was about to take place,\r\nthere came, O king, into the Pandava encampment, Halayudha, accompanied\r\nby Akrura, and Gada and Samva, and Uddhava, and Rukmini's son\r\n(Pradyumna), and Ahuka's sons, and Charudeshna, and others. And\r\nsurrounded and guarded by those foremost warriors of the Vrishni race,\r\nresembling a herd of mighty tigers, like Vasava in the midst of the\r\nMaruts, the mighty-armed and handsome Rama, attired in garments of blue\r\nsilk and resembling the peak of the Kailasa mountain, and endued with the\r\nsportive gait of the lion and possessed of eyes having their ends\r\nreddened with drink, came there (at such a time). And beholding him, king\r\nYudhishthira the Just, and Kesava of great effulgence, and Pritha's son\r\nVrikodara of terrible deeds, and (Arjuna) the wielder of Gandiva, and all\r\nthe other kings that were, rose from their seats. And they all offered\r\nworship unto Halayudha as he came to that place. And the Pandava king\r\ntouched Rama's hands with his own. And that chastiser of foes, Halayudha,\r\nin return, accosting them all with Vasudeva at their head, and saluting\r\n(respectfully) both Virata and Drupada who were senior in years, sat down\r\non the same seat with Yudhishthira. And after all the kings had taken\r\ntheir seats, Rohini's son, casting his eyes on Vasudeva, began to speak.\r\nAnd he said, 'This fierce and terrible slaughter is inevitable. It is,\r\nwithout doubt, a decree of fate, and I think that it cannot be averted.\r\nLet me hope, however, to behold all of you, with your friends, come\r\nsafely out of this strife, with sound bodies and perfectly hale. Without\r\ndoubt, all the Kshatriyas of the world that are assembled together have\r\ntheir hour come. A fierce melee covering with a mire of flesh and blood\r\nis sure to take place. I said unto Vasudeva repeatedly in private, 'O\r\nslayer of Madhu, unto those that bear equal relationship to us, observe\r\nthou an equal behaviour. As are the Pandavas to us, even so is king\r\nDuryodhana. Therefore, give him also the same aid. Indeed, he repeatedly\r\nsoliciteth it. For thy sake, however, the slayer of Madhu regarded not my\r\nwords. Looking at Dhananjaya, he hath with his whole heart, been devoted\r\nto your cause. Even this is what I certainly think, viz., that the\r\nvictory of the Pandavas is sure, for Vasudeva's wish, O Bharata, is even\r\nso. As regards myself, I dare not cast my eyes on the world without\r\nKrishna (on my side). It is for this that I follow whatever Krishna\r\nseeketh to achieve. Both of these heroes, well-skilled in encounter with\r\nthe mace, are my disciples. My affection, therefore, for Bhima is equal\r\nto that for king Duryodhana. For these reasons, I shall now repair to the\r\ntirtha of the Saraswati for ablutions, for I shall not be able to behold\r\nwith indifference the destruction of the Kauravas.\r\n\r\n\"Having said this, the mighty-armed Rama, obtaining the leave of the\r\nPandavas, and making the slayer of Madhu desist (from following him\r\nfarther), set out on his journey for the sacred waters.'\""

      "content": "\"Vaisampayana said, 'About this time, there came into the Pandava camp\r\nBhishmaka's son, foremost among all persons of truthful resolution, and\r\nknown widely by the name of Rukmi. The high-souled Bhishmaka, who was\r\notherwise called king Hiranyaroman, was the friend of Indra. And he was\r\nmost illustrious among the descendants of Bhoja and was the ruler of the\r\nwhole southern country. And Rukmi was a disciple of that lion among the\r\nKimpurushas who was known by the name of Drona, having his abode on the\r\nmountains of Gandhamadana. And he had learnt from his preceptor the whole\r\nscience of weapons with its four divisions. And that mighty-armed warrior\r\nhad obtained also the bow named Vijaya of celestial workmanship,\r\nbelonging to the great Indra, and which was equal to Gandiva in energy\r\nand to also Sarnga (held by Krishna). There were three celestial bows\r\nowned by the denizens of heaven, viz., Gandiva owned by Varuna, the bow\r\ncalled Vijaya owned by Indra, and that other celestial bow of great\r\nenergy said to have been owned by Vishnu. This last (Sarnga), capable of\r\nstriking fear into the hearts of hostile warriors, was held by Krishna.\r\nThe bow called Gandiva was obtained by Indra's son (Arjuna) from Agni on\r\nthe occasion of the burning of Khandava, while the bow called Vijaya was\r\nobtained from Drona by Rukmi of great energy. Baffling the nooses of Mura\r\nand slaying by his might that Asura, and vanquishing Naraka, the son of\r\nthe Earth, Hrishikesa, while recovering the begemmed ear-rings (of\r\nAditi), with sixteen thousand girls and various kinds of jewels and gems,\r\nobtained that excellent bow called Sarnga. And Rukmi having obtained the\r\nbow called Vijaya whose twang resembled the roar of the clouds came to\r\nthe Pandavas, as if inspiring the whole universe with dread. Formerly,\r\nproud of the might of his own arms, the heroic Rukmi could not tolerate\r\nthe ravishment of his sister Rukmini by wise Vasudeva. He had set out in\r\npursuit, having sworn that he would not return without having slain\r\nJanardana. And accompanied by a large army consisting of four kinds of\r\nforces that occupied (as it marched) a very large portion of the earth,\r\naccoutred in handsome coats of mail and armed with diverse weapons and\r\nresembling the swollen current of the Ganga, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of weapons set out in pursuit of Vasudeva of Vrishni's race. And\r\nhaving come up to him of Vrishni's race who was lord and master of\r\neverything obtainable by ascetic austerities, Rukmi, O king, was\r\nvanquished and covered with shame. And for this he returned not to (his\r\ncity) Kundina. And on the spot where that slayer of hostile heroes was\r\nvanquished by Krishna, he built an excellent city named Bhojakata. And, O\r\nking, that city filled with large forces and teeming with elephants,\r\nsteeds., is widely known on the earth by that name. Endued with great\r\nenergy, that hero, cased in mail and armed with bows, fences, swords and\r\nquivers, quickly entered the Pandava camp, surrounded by an Akshauhini of\r\ntroops. And Rukmi entered that vast army, under a standard effulgent as\r\nthe sun, and made himself known to the Pandavas, from desire of doing\r\nwhat was agreeable to Vasudeva. King Yudhishthira, advancing a few steps,\r\noffered him worship. And duly worshipped and eulogised by the Pandavas,\r\nRukmi saluted them in return and rested for a while with his troops. And\r\naddressing Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti in the midst of the heroes there\r\nassembled, he said, 'If, O son of Pandu, thou art afraid, I am here to\r\nrender thee assistance in the battle. The assistance I will give thee\r\nwill be unbearable by thy foes. There is no man in this world who is\r\nequal to me in prowess. I will slay those foes of thine whom thou, O son\r\nof Pandu, wilt assign to me. I will slay one of those heroes, viz., Drona\r\nand Kripa, and Bhishma, and Karna. Or, let all these kings of the earth\r\nstand aside. Slaying in battle thy foes myself, I will give thee Earth.'\r\nAnd he said this in the presence of king Yudhishthira the Just and of\r\nKesava and in the hearing of the (assembled) monarchs and all others (in\r\nthe camp). Then casting his eyes on Vasudeva and Pandu's son king\r\nYudhishthira the Just, Dhananjaya the intelligent son of Kunti smilingly\r\nbut in a friendly voice said these words, 'Born in the race of Kuru,\r\nbeing especially the son of Pandu, naming Drona as my preceptor, having\r\nVasudeva for my ally, and bearing, besides the bow called Gandiva, how\r\ncan I say that I am afraid? O hero, when on the occasion of the tale 'of\r\ncattle, I fought with the mighty Gandharvas, who was there to assist me?\r\nIn that terrific encounter also with the Gods and Danavas banded together\r\nin great numbers at Khandava, who was my ally when I fought? When, again,\r\nI fought with the Nivatakavachas and with those other Danavas called\r\nKalakeyas, who was my ally? When, again, at Virata's city I fought with\r\nthe numberless Kurus, who was my ally in that battle? Having paid my\r\nrespects, for battle's sake, to Rudra, Sakra, Vaisravana, Yama, Varuna,\r\nPavaka, Kripa, Drona, and Madhava, and wielding that tough celestial bow\r\nof great energy called Gandiva, and accoutred with inexhaustible arrows\r\nand armed with celestial weapons, how can a person like me, O tiger among\r\nmen, say, even unto Indra armed with the thunderbolt, such words as I am\r\nafraid!--words that rob one of all his fame? O thou of mighty arms, I am\r\nnot afraid, nor have I any need of thy assistance. Go therefore, or stay,\r\nas it pleaseth or suiteth thee.' Hearing these words of Arjuna, Rukmi\r\ntaking away with him his army vast as the sea, repaired then, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, to Duryodhana. And king Rukmi, repairing thither, said\r\nthe same words unto Duryodhana. But that king proud of his bravery,\r\nrejected him in the same way.\r\n\r\n'Thus, O king, two persons withdrew from the battle, viz., Rohini's son\r\n(Rama) of Vrishni's race and king Rukmi. And after Rama had set out on\r\nhis pilgrimage to the tirthas, and Bhishmaka's son Rukmi had departed\r\nthus, the sons of Pandu once more sat down for consulting with one\r\nanother. And that conclave presided over by king Yudhishthira the Just,\r\nabounding with numerous monarchs, blazed forth like the firmament\r\nbespangled with lesser luminaries with the moon in their midst.'\""

And king Duryodhana, O Bharata, having (first) consulted with\r\nKarna, and (next), O monarch, with Karna and his (own) brother Dussasana,\r\nand Suvala's son all together, then summoned, O bull among men, Uluka and\r\nbringing him into his presence in private, told him, O king, these words,\r\n'O Uluka, O son of an adept at dice, repair thou unto the Pandavas and\r\nthe Somakas. And repairing thither, repeat these my words (unto\r\nYudhishthira) in the hearing of Vasudeva. That terrible battle between\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas which had been expected from a long time back\r\nhas, at last come. Those boastful words which Sanjaya brought to me, in\r\nthe midst of the Kurus and which thou hadst, with Vasudeva and thy\r\nyounger brothers, uttered in deep roar,--the time, O son of Kunti, hath\r\nat last come for making them good. Do ye achieve, therefore, all which ye\r\nhave pledged yourselves to achieve. Unto the eldest son of Kunti thou\r\nmust say, as my words, the following, 'Virtuous as thou art, how canst\r\nthen, with all thy brothers, with the Somakas, and the Kekayas, set thy\r\nheart upon unrighteousness? How canst thou wish the destruction of the\r\nuniverse, when, as I think thou shouldst be the dispeller of the fears of\r\nall creatures. O bull of Bharata's race, this sloka sung of old by\r\nPrahlada when his kingdom had been wrested from him by the gods, hath\r\nbeen heard by us,--Ye gods, that person whose standard of righteousness\r\nis always up, but whose sins are always concealed is said to adopt the\r\nbehaviour of the cat (in the story).' I will here repeat to thee, O king,\r\nthis excellent story recited by Narada to my father. A wicked cat, O\r\nking, once on a time took up his abode on the banks of the Ganges,\r\nabandoning all work and with his hands upraised (after the manner of a\r\ndevotee). Pretending to have purified his heart, he said unto all\r\ncreatures these words, for inspiring confidence in them, viz.,--I am now\r\npractising virtue. After a long time, all oviparous creatures reposed\r\ntrust in him, and coming unto him all together, O monarch, they all\r\napplauded that cat. And worshipped by all feathery creatures, that\r\ndevourer of feathery creatures, regarded his purpose already\r\naccomplished, as also the purpose of his austerities. And after some more\r\ntime, the mice went to that place. And these also all beheld him to be a\r\nvirtuous person engaged in the observance of vows, and proudly exerting\r\nhimself in a grand act. And having arrived at that settled conviction,\r\nthey entertained the following wish, O king,--'Many foes we have. Let\r\nthis one, therefore, become our maternal uncle, and let him always\r\nprotect all the old and young ones of our race. And going at last to the\r\ncat, all of them said, 'Through thy grace we desire to roam in happiness.\r\nThou art our gracious shelter, thou art our great friend. For this, all\r\nof us place ourselves under thy protection. Thou art always devoted to\r\nvirtue, thou art always engaged in the acquisition of virtue. O thou of\r\ngreat wisdom, protect us, therefore, like the wielder of the thunderbolt\r\nprotecting the celestials.' Thus addressed, O king, by all the mice, the\r\ncat answered them, saying, 'I do not see the consistency of these two,\r\nviz., my ascetic pursuits and this protection (that I am called upon to\r\ngrant). I cannot avoid, however, doing good to you agreeably to your\r\nrequest. You all, at the same time, should always obey my words. Staying\r\nas I am in the observance of a severe vow, I am weakened by my ascetic\r\npractices. I do not, therefore, see the means of my moving from place to\r\nplace. Ye all should, therefore, bear me hence every day to the\r\nriver-side.' Saying, 'So be it,' the mice then, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nmade over all their old and young ones to that cat. Then that sinful\r\ncreature of wicked soul, feeding on mice, gradually became fat and of\r\ngood complexion and strong in his limbs. And thus while the mice began to\r\nbe reduced in number, the cat began to grow in vigour and strength. Then\r\nall the mice, coming together, said unto one another, 'Our uncle is daily\r\ngrowing stout, while we are being daily reduced (in number)!' Then a\r\ncertain mouse endued with wisdom, named Dindika, said, O king these words\r\nunto the large swarm of mice gathered there, 'Go all of ye to the\r\nriver-side together. I will follow ye, accompanying our uncle.'\r\n'Excellent, Excellent,' they said, and applauded that one of their\r\nnumber. And they all did just as those words of grave import spoken by\r\nDindika seemed to indicate. The cat, however, not knowing all this, ate\r\nup Dindika that day. All the mice then, without losing much time, began\r\nto take counsel of one another. Then a very old mouse, named Kilika, said\r\nthese just words, O king, in the presence of all his kinsfolk, 'Our uncle\r\nis not really desirous of earning virtue. He hath, like a hypocrite,\r\nbecome our friend when in reality he is our enemy. Indeed, the excreta of\r\na creature that liveth only upon fruits and roots never containeth hair\r\nof fur. Then again, while his limbs are growing, our number is decaying.\r\nBesides, Dindika cannot be seen for these eight days.' Hearing these\r\nwords, the mice ran away in all directions. And that cat also of wicked\r\nsoul returned to whence he came. O thou of wicked soul, thou too art a\r\npractiser of such feline behaviour. Thou behavest towards thy kinsmen\r\nafter the manner of the cat (in the story) towards the mice. Thy speech\r\nis of one kind, and thy conduct is of another. Thy (devotion to)\r\nscripture and thy peacefulness of behaviour are only for display before\r\nmen. Giving up this hypocrisy, O king, adopt the practices of a Kshatriya\r\nand do all that one should do as such. Art thou not virtuous, O bull\r\namong men? Acquiring the earth by means of the prowess of thy arms, make\r\ngifts, O best of the Bharatas, unto the Brahmanas and to the means of thy\r\ndeceased ancestors as one should. Seeking the good of that mother of\r\nthine who hath been afflicted with distress for a series of years, dry up\r\nher tears, and confer honours on her by vanquishing (thy foes) in battle.\r\nThou hadst with great abjectness, solicited only five villages. Even that\r\nwas rejected by us, for how could we bring about a battle, how could we\r\nsucceed in angering the Pandavas, was all that we sought. Remembering\r\nthat it was for thee that the wicked Vidura was driven (by us) and that\r\nwe had tried to burn you all in the house of lac, be a man now; at the\r\ntime of Krishna's setting out (from Upaplavya) for the Kuru court, thou\r\nhadst through him communicated this message (to us), viz.,--Hear, O king,\r\nI am prepared for either war or peace! Know, O monarch, that the hour\r\nhath come for battle. O Yudhishthira, I have made all these preparations\r\nin view of that. What doth a Kshatriya regard as a more estimable\r\naccession (of good fortune) than battle? Born thou hast beer in the\r\nKshatriya order. Known also thou art in the world. Having obtained\r\nweapons again from Drona and Kripa, why, O bull of the Bharata race, dost\r\nthou rely on Vasudeva who belongeth to the same order of life as thyself\r\nand who is, not superior to thee in might.'\r\n\r\n'Thou must also say unto Vasudeva in the presence of the Pandavas these\r\nwords,--For thy own sake, as also for the sake of the Pandavas, withstand\r\nme in battle to the best of thy power! Assuming once more that form which\r\nthou hadst assumed before in the Kuru court, rush thou with Arjuna\r\nagainst me (on the field)! A conjuror's tricks or illusions may\r\n(sometimes) inspire fright. But as regards the person that stands armed\r\nfor fight, such deceptions (instead of inspiring fight) only provoke\r\nanger! We also are competent, by our powers of illusion, to ascend to\r\nheaven or the firmament, or penetrate into the nether region, or the city\r\nof Indra! We also can display various forms in our own body! The great\r\nOrdainer bringeth all creatures to subjection by a flat of His will (and\r\nnever by such conjuror's tricks)! Thou always sayest, O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace, these words, viz.,--Causing the sons of Dhritarashtra to be slain\r\nin battle, I will confer undisputed sovereignty on the sons of\r\nPritha!--These words of thine were brought to me by Sanjaya. Thou hadst\r\nalso said, 'Know, ye Kauravas that it is with Arjuna, having me for his\r\nsecond, ye have provoked hostilities!' Truthfully adhering to that\r\npledge, put forth thy energy for the Pandavas and fight now in battle to\r\nthe best of thy power! Show us that thou canst be a man! He is said to be\r\ntruly alive, who, having ascertained (the wight of his) foes inspireth\r\ngrief in them by resorting to true manliness! Without any reason, O\r\nKrishna, great hath been thy fame spread in the world! It will, however,\r\npresently be known that there are many persons, in the world that are\r\nreally eunuchs though possessed of the signs of manhood. A slave of\r\nKansa, especially as thou art, a monarch like me should not cover himself\r\nin mail against thee!\r\n\r\n'Say (next) repeatedly, from me, O Uluka, unto that stupid, ignorant,\r\ngluttonous Bhimasena, who is even like a bull though divested of horns,\r\nthese words, viz.,--O son of Pritha, a cook thou hadst become, known by\r\nthe name of Vallabha, in the city of Virata! All this is evidence of thy\r\nmanliness! Let not the vow thou hadst made before in the midst of the\r\nKuru court be falsified! Let Dussasana's blood be drunk if thou art able!\r\nO son of Kunti, thou often sayest,--Speedily shall I slay Dhritarashtra's\r\nsons in battle!--The time for accomplishing it hath now come! O Bharata,\r\nthou deservest to be rewarded in cookery! The difference, however, is\r\nvery great between dressing food and fighting! Fight now, be a man!\r\nIndeed, thou shalt have to lie down, deprived of life, on the earth,\r\nembracing thy mace, O Bharata! The boast in which thou hadst indulged in\r\nthe midst of thy assembly is all vain, O Vrikodara!\r\n\r\n'Say, O Uluka, unto Nakula, from me, these words, viz.,--Fight now, O\r\nBharata, patiently! We desire, O Bharata, to behold thy manliness, thy\r\nreverence for Yudhishthira, and thy hatred of myself! Recall to mind the\r\nsufferings in their entirety that Krishna had suffered!\r\n\r\n'Next, thou must say these words of mine unto Sahadeva in the presence of\r\nthe (assembled) monarchs,--Fight in battle now, to the best of thy power!\r\nRemember all your woes!\r\n\r\n'Say next, from me, unto both Virata and Drupada, these words,\r\nviz.,--Since the beginning of the creation, slaves, endued even with\r\ngreat accomplishments, have never been able to fully understand their\r\nmasters. Nor have affluent kings been always able to understand their\r\nslaves! This king deserveth no praise,--possibly, under such a belief, ye\r\nhave come against me! United together, fight ye, therefore, against me\r\nfor achieving my death, and accomplish the objects ye have in view, as\r\nalso those that the Pandavas have!\r\n\r\nSay also, from me, unto Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of Panchalas, these\r\nwords, viz.,--The hour hath now come for thee, and thou also hast come\r\nfor thy hour! Approaching Drona in battle thou wilt know what is best for\r\nthee! Achieve thou the business of thy friend! Accomplish that feat which\r\nis difficult of accomplishment!\r\n\r\n'Tell, next, repeatedly from me, O Uluka, unto Sikhandin, these words,\r\nviz.,--The mighty-armed Kaurava, foremost of all bowmen, Ganga's son\r\n(Bhishma), will not slay thee, knowing thee to be only a female! Fight\r\nnow without any fear! Achieve in battle what canst to the best of thy\r\npower! We desire to behold thy prowess!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, king Duryodhana laughed\r\naloud. And addressing Uluka again, he said, 'Say once more unto\r\nDhananjaya in the bearing of Vasudeva these words, viz.,--O hero, either\r\nvanquishing us rule thou this world, or vanquished by us lie thou down on\r\nthe field (deprived of life)! Recalling to thy mind the sufferings\r\noccasioned by your banishment from the kingdom, the woes of your sojourn\r\nin the woods, and 'he affliction of Krishna, be a man, O son of Pandu!\r\nThat for which a Kshatriya lady bringeth forth a son is now arrived!\r\nDisplaying, therefore, in battle, thy might, energy, courage, manliness,\r\nand great dexterity and speed in the use of weapons, appease thy wrath!\r\nAfflicted with woe, and dispirited and exiled (from home) for a long\r\ntime, and driven from his kingdom, who is there whose heart would not\r\nbreak? Who is there, well-born, and brave, and uncovetous of other's\r\nwealth, that would not have his wrath excited when his kingdom descending\r\nfrom generation to generation is attacked? Realise in deeds those high\r\nwords that thou hadst said! One that only boasts without being able to do\r\nanything is regarded as a worthless man by those that are good. Recover\r\nthy kingdom and those possessions that are now owned by thy foes! Even\r\nthese two are the purposes which a person desirous of war hath in view.\r\nExert, therefore, thy manliness! Thou wert won (as a slave) at dice!\r\nKrishna was caused by us to be brought into the assembly! One that\r\nregardeth himself a man should certainly display his wrath at this! For\r\ntwelve long years hadst thou been exiled from home into the woods, and\r\none whole year hadst thou passed in Virata's service! Remembering the\r\npangs of banishment from the kingdom and of thy sojourn in the woods, as\r\nalso those which Krishna had suffered, be thou a man! Display thy wrath\r\ntowards those that repeatedly utter harsh words at thee and thy brothers!\r\nindeed, wrath (such as that) would consist in manliness! Let thy anger,\r\nthy might and prowess, and knowledge, and thy lightness of hand in the\r\nuse of weapons, be exhibited? Fight, O son of Pritha, and prove to be a\r\nman! The incantations in respect of all thy weapons have been performed.\r\nThe field of Kurukshetra is free from mire. Thy steeds are hale and\r\nstrong. Thy soldiers have received their pay. With Kesava, therefore, as\r\n(thy) second, fight (with us)! Without encountering Bhishma as yet, why\r\ndost thou indulge in such boasts? Like a fool, who, without having\r\nascended the Gandhamadana mountains, boasts (of his would-be feat), thou,\r\nO son of Kunti, art indulging in a similar bragging, be a man! Without\r\nhaving vanquished in battle the invincible Karna of the Suta race, or\r\nSalya, that foremost of persons, or Drona, the first of all mighty\r\nwarriors and equal unto the lord of Sachi in battle, how canst thou, O\r\nPartha, covet for thy kingdom? He that is a preceptor of both Vedic lore\r\nand bowmanship, he that hath crossed both those branches of learning, he\r\nthat is foremost in battle and imperturbable (as a tower), he whose might\r\nknoweth no diminution, that commander of armies, Drona of great\r\neffulgence,--him, O Partha, thou wishest in vain to conquer! It is never\r\nheard that the Sumeru peak hath been crushed by the wind. Yet even the\r\nwind will bear away Sumeru, heaven itself will fall down on the earth,\r\nthe very Yugas will be altered in respect of their course, if what thou\r\nhast said unto me becometh true! What man is there, desirous of life, be\r\nit Partha or any body else, who having approached that grinder of foes,\r\nwould be able to return home with sound body? What person is there,\r\ntreading upon the earth with his feet, who, encountered by Drona and\r\nBhishma and struck with their arrows, would escape from the battle with\r\nlife? Like a frog having its abode in a well, why art thou not able to\r\nrealise the might of this vast army of the assembled monarchs,\r\ninvincible, looking like the very celestial host, and protected by these\r\nlords of men, as the heavenly host by the gods themselves,--protected\r\nthat is, by the kings of the East, the West, the South and the North, by\r\nthe Kamvojas, the Sakas, the Khasas, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Kurus\r\nof the middle country, the Mlechchhas, the Pulindas, the Dravidas, the\r\nAndhras, and the Kanchis,--this host of many nations, ready for battle,\r\nand resembling the uncrossable current of the Ganga. O thou of little\r\nunderstanding, how canst thou, O fool, venture to fight with me when\r\nstationed in the midst of my elephant-host? Thy inexhaustible quivers,\r\nthy car given thee by Agni, and thy celestial banner, O Partha, will all,\r\nO Bharata, be tested by us in battle! Fight, O Arjuna, without bragging!\r\nWhy dost thou indulge in too much boast! Success in battle resulteth from\r\nthe method in which it is fought. A battle is never gained by bragging.\r\nIf, O Dhananjaya, acts in this world succeeded in consequence of\r\nvauntings, all persons would then have succeeded in their objects, for\r\nwho is there that is not competent to brag? I know that thou hast\r\nVasudeva for thy ally. I know that thy Gandiva is full six cubits long. I\r\nknow that there is no warrior equal to thee. Knowing all this, I retain\r\nthy kingdom yet! A man never winneth success in consequence of the\r\nattributes of lineage. It is the Supreme Ordainer alone who by his fiat\r\nof will maketh things (hostile) friendly subservient. For these thirteen\r\nyears, I have enjoyed sovereignty while ye were weeping. I shall continue\r\nto rule in the same way, slaying thee with thy kinsmen. Where was thy\r\nGandiva then, when thou wert made slave won at stake? Where, O Falguni,\r\nwas Bhima's might then? Your deliverance then came neither from\r\nBhimasena, armed with mace, nor from you armed with Gandiva, but from the\r\nfaultless Krishna. It was she, the daughter to Prishata's house, that\r\ndelivered you all, sunk in slavery, engaged in occupations worthy only of\r\nthe low, and working as servitors. I characterised you all as sesame\r\nseeds without kernel. That is true. For, did not Partha (some time after)\r\nbear a braid when living in Virata's city? In the cooking apartments of\r\nVirata, Bhimasena was fatigued with doing the work of a cook. Even this,\r\nO son of Pritha, is (evidence of) my manliness! Flying from an encounter\r\nwith hips and braids and waist-bands, thyself binding thy hair, wert\r\nengaged in teaching the girls to dance? It is thus that Kshatriyas always\r\ninflict punishment on Kshatriyas! From fear of Vasudeva, or from fear of\r\nthyself, O Falguni, I will not give up the kingdom! Fight with Kesava as\r\nthy ally! Neither deception, nor conjuror's tricks, nor jugglery, can\r\nterrify the armed man addressed for fight. On the other hand, these\r\nprovoke only his wrath. A thousand Vasudevas, a hundred Falgunis,\r\napproaching me whose arms and weapons never go for nothing, will surely\r\nfly away in all directions. Encounter Bhishma in combat, or strike the\r\nhill with thy head, or cross with the aid of thy two arms alone the vast\r\nand deep main! As regards my army, it is a veritable main with Saradwat's\r\nson as its large fish, Vivingsati as its huge snake, Bhishma as its\r\ncurrent of immeasurable might, Drona as its unconquerable alligator,\r\nKarna and Salwa and Salya its fishes and whirlpools, the ruler of the\r\nKamvojas its equine head emitting fire, Vrihadvala its fierce waves,\r\nSomadatta's son its whale, Yuyutsu and Durmarshana its waters, Bhagadatta\r\nits gale, Srutayus and Hridika's son its gulfs and bays, Dussasana its\r\ncurrent, Sushena and Chitrayuda its water-elephants (hippopotamus) and\r\ncrocodile, Jayadratha its (submarine) rock, Purumitra its depth, and\r\nSakuni its shores! When having plunged into this surging ocean with its\r\ninexhaustible waves of weapons, thou wilt, from fatigue, be deprived of\r\nsenses and have all thy relatives and friends slain, then will repentance\r\npossess thy heart! Then also will thy heart turn away from the thought of\r\nruling the earth, like the heart of a person of impure deeds turning away\r\nfrom (hope of) heaven. Indeed, for thee to win a kingdom to rule is as\r\nimpossible as for one not possessed of ascetic merit to obtain heaven!'\""

It\r\nbehoveth thee not, therefore, to be angry with me if I repeat those words\r\nonly which Duryodhana hath instructed me to tell!'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing this, Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast no fear., O Uluka!

Then in the midst and presence of the illustrious and\r\nhigh-souled Pandavas, of the Srinjayas, and Krishna possessed of great\r\nfame, of Drupada with his sons, of Virata, and of all monarchs, Uluka\r\nsaid these words.'\r\n\r\n\"Uluka said, 'Even this is what the high-souled king Duryodhana hath in\r\nthe presence of all the Kuru heroes, said unto thee! Listen to those\r\nwords, O Yudhishthira! Thou wert defeated at dice, and Krishna was\r\nbrought into the assembly! At this, a person who regardeth himself a man\r\nwould be justified in giving way to wrath! For twelve years wert thou\r\nbanished from home into the woods! For one whole year didst thou live in\r\nVirata's service. Remembering the reason there is for wrath, thy exile,\r\nand the persecution of Krishna, be a man, O son of Pandu! Though weak,\r\nBhima yet, O Pandava, made a vow! Let him, if able, drink the blood of\r\nDussasana! Thy weapons have been properly worshipped and their presiding\r\ndeities have been invoked! The field of Kurukshetra also is without mire.\r\nThe roads are even. Thy steeds are well-fed. Engage in battle, therefore,\r\non the morrow, with Kesava as thy ally! Without having yet approached\r\nBhishma in battle, why dost thou indulge in boasts? Like a fool that\r\nboasteth of his intention to ascend the mountains of Gandhamadana, thou,\r\nO son of Kunti, art indulging in a vain boast. Without having vanquished\r\nin battle the Suta's son (Karna) who is invincible, and Salya, that\r\nforemost of mighty persons, and that first of all warriors and equal unto\r\nSachi's lord himself in combat, why, O son of Pritha, dost thou wish for\r\nsovereignty? A preceptor in both the Vedas and the bow, he hath reached\r\nthe end of both these branches of learning. Thou desirest in vain, O son\r\nof Pritha, to vanquish that leader of troops, the illustrious Drona, who\r\nfightest in the van, is incapable of being agitated, and whose strength\r\nknows no diminution. Never have we heard that the mountains of Sumeru\r\nhave been crushed by the wind! But the wind will bear away Sumeru, heaven\r\nitself will fall down on the earth, the very Yugas will be reversed if\r\nwhat thou hast said unto me really taketh place! Who is there fond of\r\nlife, fighting from the back of an elephant or of a horse or from a car,\r\nthat would return home (safe and sound), after having encountered that\r\ngrinder of foes? What creature treading the earth with his feet, would\r\nescape with life from battle, having been attacked by Drona and Bhishma,\r\nor pierced with their terrible shafts? Like a frog within a well, why\r\ndost thou not realise the strength of this assembled host of monarchs,\r\nwhich resembleth the very celestial host, and which is protected by these\r\nkings like the gods protecting theirs in heaven, and which, swarming with\r\nthe kings of the East, West, South, and North, with Kamvojas, Sakas,\r\nKhasas, Salwas, Matsyas, Kurus of the middle country, Mlechchhas,\r\nPulindas, Dravidas, Andhras, and Kanchis, indeed, with many nations, all\r\naddressed for battle, is uncrossable like the swollen tide of Ganga? O\r\nfool of little understanding, how wilt thou fight with me while I am\r\nstationed in the midst of my elephant force?'\r\n\r\n'Having said these words unto king Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,\r\nUluka, turning his face then towards Jishnu, said unto him these words,\r\n'Fight without bragging, O Arjuna! Why dost thou brag so much? Success\r\nresulteth from the application of method. A battle is never won by\r\nbragging. If acts in this world, O Dhananjaya, succeeded in consequence\r\nonly of boasts, then all men would have succeeded in their objects, for\r\nwho is there that is not competent to brag? I know that thou hast\r\nVasudeva for thy ally. I know that thy Gandiva is full six cubits long. I\r\nknow that there is no warrior equal to thee. Knowing all this, I retain\r\nthy kingdom yet! A man never winneth success in consequence of the\r\nattribute of lineage. It is the Supreme Ordainer alone who by his fiat\r\nmaketh (things hostile) friendly and subservient. For these thirteen\r\nyears have I enjoyed sovereignty, while ye were weeping! I shall continue\r\nto rule in the same way, slaying thee with thy kinsmen! Where was thy\r\nGandiva then when thou wert made a slave won at dice? Where, O Falguni,\r\nwas Bhimasena's might then? Your deliverance then came neither from\r\nBhimasena armed with mace, nor from you armed with Gandiva, but from\r\nfaultless Krishna. It was she, the daughter of Prishata's house, that\r\ndelivered you all, sunk in slavery, engaged in occupations worthy only of\r\nthe low, and working as servitors! I characterised ye as sesame seeds\r\nwithout kernel. That is very true, for, did not Partha bear a braid while\r\nliving in Virata's city? In the cooking apartments of Virata, Bhimasena\r\nwas fatigued with doing the work of a cook. Even this, O son of Kunti, is\r\n(evidence of) thy manliness! Flying from an encounter with braids and\r\nwaist-bands thyself binding thy hair into a braid, thou wert employed in\r\nteaching the girls to dance! It is thus that Kshatriyas always inflict\r\npunishment on a Kshatriya! From fear of Vasudeva, or from fear of\r\nthyself, O Falguni, I will not give up the kingdom. Fight, with Kesava as\r\nthy ally! Neither deception, nor conjuror's tricks, nor jugglery can\r\nterrify an armed man ready for fight. On the other hand, all this\r\nprovokes only his wrath! A thousand Vasudevas, a hundred Falgunis,\r\napproaching me whose aim and weapons never go for nothing, will fly away\r\nin all directions, Encounter Bhishma in combat, or pierce the hills with\r\nthy head, or cross with the aid of thy two arms the vast and deep main!\r\nAs regards my army, it is a veritable ocean with Saradwat's son as its\r\nlarge fish; Vivingsati, its smaller fish; Vrihadvala its waves;\r\nSomadatta's son its whale; Bhishma its mighty force; Drona its\r\nunconquerable alligator; Karna and Salya, its fishes and whirlpools;\r\nKamvoja its equine head vomiting fire, Jayadratha its (submarine) rock,\r\nPurumitra its depth, Durmarshana its waters, and Sakuni its shores! When\r\nhaving plunged into this swelling ocean with its inexhaustible waves of\r\nweapons thou wilt from fatigue be deprived of thy senses, and have all\r\nthy relatives and friends slain, then will repentance possess thy heart!\r\nThen will thy heart turn away, O Partha, from the thought of ruling the\r\nearth like the heart of a person of impure deeds turning away from (hope\r\nof) heaven. Indeed, for thee to win a kingdom to rule is as impossible as\r\nfor one not possessed of ascetic merit to obtain heaven!'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'O monarch, provoking Arjuna still further who was like a\r\nsnake of virulent poison, by means of those wordy strokes of his Uluka\r\nonce more repeated the words he had once spoken. The Pandavas had before\r\nsuch repetition, been sufficiently provoked, but hearing these words (a\r\nsecond time) and receiving those censures through the gambler's son, they\r\nwere provoked beyond endurance. They all stood up, and began to stretch\r\ntheir arms. And looking like enraged snakes of virulent poison, they\r\nbegan to cast their eyes on one another. And Bhimasena, with face\r\ndownwards, and breathing heavily like a snake, began to glance obliquely\r\nat Kesava, directing the blood-red corners of his eyes towards him. And\r\nbeholding the Wind-god's son to be greatly afflicted and extremely\r\nprovoked with rage, he of Dasarha's race smilingly addressed the\r\ngambler's son and said, 'Depart hence without a moment's delay. O\r\ngambler's son, and say unto Suyodhana these words, viz.,--Thy words have\r\nbeen heard and sense understood. Let that take place which  thou\r\ndesirest.' Having said this, O best of monarchs, the mighty-armed Kesava\r\nlooked once more at Yudhishthira endued with great wisdom. Then in the\r\nmidst and presence of all the Srinjayas, of Krishna possessed of great\r\nfame, of Drupada with his sons, of Virata, and all the kings (there\r\nassembled), Uluka once more repeated unto Arjuna the words he had said,\r\nprovoking him still further thereby, like one annoying wrathful snake of\r\nvirulent poison by means of a stake. And he also said unto all of them,\r\nviz.,--Krishna and others, those words that Duryodhana had instructed him\r\nto say. And hearing those harsh and highly disagreeable words uttered by\r\nUluka, Partha was greatly excited and wiped the sweat off his forehead.\r\nAnd beholding Partha, O king, in that condition, that assembly of\r\nmonarchs could not bear it at all. And at that insult to Krishna and the\r\nhigh-souled Partha, the car-warriors of the Pandavas were greatly\r\nagitated. Though endued with great steadiness of mind, those tigers among\r\nmen began to burn with anger. And Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and that\r\nmighty car-warrior, Satyaki, and the five Kekaya brothers, and the\r\nRakshasa Ghatotkacha, the sons of Draupadi, and Abhimanyu, and king\r\nDhrishtaketu, and Bhimasena, endued with great prowess, and those mighty\r\ncar-warriors--the twins,--jumped up from their seats, their eyes red with\r\nanger, tossing their handsome arms decked with red sandal-paste and\r\nornaments of gold. Then Vrikodara, the son of Kunti, understanding their\r\ngestures and hearts, sprang up from his seat. And gnashing his teeth, and\r\nlicking with his tongue the corners of his mouth, and burning with rage,\r\nand squeezing his hands and turning his eyes fiercely, said these words\r\nunto Uluka, Ignorant fool, thy words have now been heard which Duryodhana\r\nsaid unto thee for the object of provoking us as if we were a set of\r\nimbeciles! Hear now the words which I say and which thou art to repeat\r\nunto the inaccessible Suyodhana in the midst of all the Kshatriyas and in\r\nthe hearing of the Suta's son and the wicked-hearted Sakuni. We always\r\nseek to gratify our elder brother! It was for this, O thou of wicked\r\nbehaviour, that we tolerated thy acts. Dost thou not regard this as\r\nhighly fortunate for thee? It was for only the good of our race that king\r\nYudhishthira the Just, endued with great intelligence, sent Hrishikesa to\r\nthe Kurus for bringing about a peace! Impelled by Fate, without doubt,\r\nthou art desirous of repairing unto Yama's abode! Come, fight with us.\r\nThat, however, is certainly to take place tomorrow! I have, indeed, vowed\r\nto slay thee with thy brothers! O sinful fool, do not entertain the\r\nslightest doubt, for it will be as I have vowed! The very ocean, the\r\nabode of Varuna-may all on a sudden transgress its continents. The very\r\nmountains may split, yet my words can never be false! If Yama himself, or\r\nKuvera, or Rudra, assisteth thee, the Pandavas will still accomplish what\r\nthey have vowed! I shall certainly drink Dussasana's blood according to\r\nmy pleasure! And I also vow that Kshatriya whatsoever may then angrily\r\napproach me, even if he cometh with Bhishma himself at the van, I will\r\nsend him to Yama's abode! That which I have said in the midst of a\r\nKshatriya assembly will certainly be true. I swear this by my soul!\r\n\r\n'Hearing these words of Bhimasena, the wrathful Sahadeva also, with eyes\r\nred in anger, said these words in the presence of the (assembled)\r\ntroops,--words that become that proud hero. And he said, 'Listen, O\r\nsinful one, to the words I utter and which must be repeated to thy\r\nfather! A difference would never have arisen between us and the Kurus, if\r\nDhritarashtra had no relationship with thee! Of sinful acts and the\r\nexterminator of thy own race, thou hast been born as an embodiment of\r\nquarrel for the destruction of the whole world as also for the\r\ndestruction of Dhritarashtra's race! From our very birth, O Uluka, that\r\nsinful father of thine hath always sought to do us injury and evil. I\r\ndesire to attain the opposite shore of that hostile relation. Slaying\r\nthee first before the very eyes of Sakuni, I shall then slay Sakuni\r\nhimself in the sight of all bowmen!'\r\n\r\n'Hearing these words of both Bhima and Sahadeva, Falguni smilingly\r\naddressed Bhima, saying, 'O Bhimasena, they that have provoked\r\nhostilities with thee, cannot live! Though they may dwell happily in\r\ntheir homes, those fools become yet entangled in the meshes of death! O\r\nbest of men, Uluka doth not deserve to be addressed harshly by thee! What\r\nfault do envoys commit, repeating as they only do what they are\r\ninstructed (to say)?' And having thus addressed Bhima of terrible prowess\r\nthat mighty-armed hero then addressed his heroic allies and well-wishers\r\nheaded by Dhrishtadyumna, saying, 'Ye have heard the words of the sinful\r\nson of Dhritarashtra in dispraise of Vasudeva and especially of myself!\r\nAnd hearing them ye have been filled with anger because ye wish us well!\r\nBut through Vasudeva's might and your endeavours, I do not reckon even\r\nall the Kshatriyas of the earth assembled together! With your permission\r\nI will now communicate to Uluka what the reply to those words is, what,\r\nindeed, he should say unto Duryodhana!--When the morrow cometh, stationed\r\nat the head of my division, the answer to these words shall I give\r\nthrough Gandiva! For they that are eunuchs, answer in words!'\r\n\r\n'Hearing this, all those best of kings applauded Dhananjaya, wondering at\r\nthe ingenuity of that reply. King Yudhishthira the Just, then, having\r\nspoken mildly unto all the kings each according to his age and as each\r\ndeserved said, at last, unto Uluka these words so that he might carry\r\nthem to Duryodhana. And Yudhishthira said, 'No good king should patiently\r\nbear an insult. Having so long heard what thou hadst to say, I shall now\r\ntell thee what my reply is!'\r\n\r\n'Having heard then, O best of Bharata's race, those words of Duryodhana,\r\nYudhishthira, that bull of the Bharata race, with eyes exceedingly red in\r\nanger and himself sighing like a snake of virulent poison, licking the\r\ncorners of his mouth with his tongue, as if swelling with wrath, and\r\ncasting his eyes on Janardana and his own brothers, said unto Uluka these\r\nwords that were fraught with both mildness and vigour. And tossing his\r\nmassive arms he said unto the gambler's son, 'Go, O Uluka, and say unto\r\nDuryodhana, that ungrateful, wicked-minded embodiment of hostilities,\r\nthat infamous wretch of his race, these words, viz.,--O sinful wretch,\r\nthou always behavest with crookedness towards the Pandavas! O sinful\r\nfool, he that displayeth his prowess relying on his own might and\r\nsummoneth his foes (to battle) and fulfilleth his own words, even he is a\r\nman of the Kshatriya order! Be thou a Kshatriya, O sinful wretch, and\r\nsummon us to battle! O infamous one of thy race, do not come to battle,\r\nplacing at thy head others for whom we profess respect! O Kaurava,\r\nrelying on thy own might and on that of thy servants, summon the sons of\r\nPritha to battle! Be Kshatriya in every way! He, who summoneth his foes,\r\nrelying on the might of others, and incapable of receiving them himself\r\nis, indeed, a eunuch! Thou, however, thinkest highly of thyself, relying\r\non the might of others! Being weak and unable thyself, why then dost thou\r\nroar so (in words) at us?'\r\n\r\n\"Krishna said, 'My words also, O gambler's son, should be communicated\r\nunto Suyodhana. Let that morrow come to thee on which the battle is to\r\ntake place. O thou of wicked soul, be a man! O fool, thou thinkest\r\nJanardana will not fight, since he hath been chosen by the Pandavas to\r\nact only as a charioteer, so thou art not alarmed. That, however, will\r\nnot be, even for a moment. If my wrath is excited, I may then consume all\r\nthe kings (assembled by thee) like a fire consuming a heap of straw. At\r\nYudhishthira's command, however, I shall only discharge the functions of\r\ncharioteer to the high-souled Falguni, of senses under complete control\r\nand who alone, (amongst us two) will fight! If thou fliest beyond the\r\nlimits of the three worlds, if thou sinkest into the depths of the earth,\r\nthou shalt, even at these places, behold Arjuna's car tomorrow morning.\r\nThou thinkest that Bhima's words have been spoken in vain! But know that\r\nDussasana's blood hath already been quaffed. Know this also that although\r\nthou hast uttered such cross and perverse words, yet neither Partha, nor\r\nking Yudhishthira, nor Bhimasena, nor any of the twins, regardeth thee as\r\nstraw!'\""

And\r\neyeing Kesava also and tossing his massive arms, he addressed the\r\ngambler's son, saying, 'He, who, relying on his own strength, summoneth\r\nhis foes and fighteth with them fearlessly, is spoken of as a man. He,\r\nhowever, who, relying on the strength of others, summoneth his foes, is\r\nan infamous Kshatriya. In consequence of his incapacity, such a one is\r\nregarded as the lowest of men. Relying on the strength of others, thou (O\r\nDuryodhana), being a coward thyself, desirest yet, O fool, to rebuke thy\r\nfoes. Having installed (Bhishma) the oldest of all the Kshatriyas, whose\r\nheart is ever bent in doing what is good, who hath all his passions under\r\ncontrol, and who is endued with great wisdom, in the command of thy\r\ntroops and made him liable to certain death, thou indulgest in brag! O\r\nthou of wicked understanding, thy object (in doing this) is fully known\r\nto us, O wretch of thy race! Thou hast done it, believing that sons of\r\nPandu will not, from kindness, slay the son of Ganga. Know, however, O\r\nDhritarashtra's son, that I will slay that Bhishma first in the sight of\r\nall the bowmen, relying upon whose strength thou indulgest in such\r\nboasts! O gambler's son, repairing (hence) unto the Bharatas and\r\napproaching Duryodhana the son of Dhritarashtra, say unto him that Arjuna\r\nhath said,--So be it! After this night will have passed away, the fierce\r\nencounter of arms will take place. Indeed, Bhishma of unfailing might and\r\nfirmly adhering to truth, hath told thee in the midst of the Kurus these\r\nwords, viz.,--I will slay the army of the Srinjayas and the Salweyas. Let\r\nthat be my task. Excepting Drona I can slay the whole world. Thou needest\r\nnot, therefore, entertain any fear oil the Pandavas! At this, thou, O\r\nDuryodhana, regardest the kingdom as thy own and thinkest that the\r\nPandavas have sunk into distress. Thou hast been filled with pride at\r\nthis. Thou seest not, however, danger that is in thy own self. I shall,\r\ntherefore, in battle, first slay before thy very eyes, Bhishma the eldest\r\nof the Kurus! At sunrise (tomorrow) at the head of the troops, with\r\nstandards and cars protect ye that leader of thy forces firm in his\r\npromises. I shall, with my arrows, throw him down who is your refuge from\r\nhis car before the eyes of you all! When the morrow cometh, Suyodhana\r\nwill know what it is to indulge in brag, beholding the grandsire covered\r\nwith my arrows! Thou shalt, O Suyodhana, very soon see the fulfilment of\r\nthat which Bhimasena in anger had said, in the midst of the assembly,\r\nunto thy brother, that man of limited sight, viz., Dussasana, wedded to\r\nunrighteousness, always quarrelsome, of wicked understanding, and cruel\r\nin behaviour. Thou shalt soon see the terrible effects of vanity and\r\npride, of wrath and arrogance, of bragging and heartlessness, cutting\r\nwords and acts, of aversion from righteousness, and sinfulness and\r\nspeaking ill of others, of transgressing the counsels of the aged, of\r\noblique sight, and of all kinds of vices! O scum of humanity, how canst\r\nthou, O fool, hope for either life or kingdom, if I, having Vasudeva for\r\nmy second, give way to anger? After Bhishma and Drona will have been\r\nquieted and after the Suta's son will have been overthrown, thou shalt be\r\nhopeless of life, kingdom and sons! Hearing of the slaughter of thy\r\nbrothers and sons, and struck mortally by Bhimasena, thou wilt, O\r\nSuyodhana, recollect all thy misdeeds!--Tell him, O gambler's son, that I\r\ndo not vow a second time. I tell thee truly that all this will be\r\ntrue!--Departing hence, O Uluka, say, O sire, these words of mine, unto\r\nSuyodhana! It behoveth thee not to apprehend my behaviour by the light of\r\nthy own! Know the difference there is between thy conduct and mine, which\r\nis even the difference between truth and falsehood! I do not wish harm to\r\neven insects and ants. What shall I say, therefore, of my ever wishing\r\nharm to my kinsmen? O sire, it was for this that five villages only were\r\nsolicited by me! Why, O thou of wicked understanding, dost thou not see\r\nthe dire calamity that threatens thee? Thy soul overwhelmed with lust,\r\nthou indulgest in vauntings from defectiveness of understanding. It is\r\nfor this also thou acceptest not the beneficial words of Vasudeva. What\r\nneed now of much talk? Fight (against us) with all thy friends! Say, O\r\ngambler's son, unto the Kuru prince who always doth what is injurious to\r\nme (these words also, viz.,)--Thy words have been heard; their sense also\r\nhath been understood. Let it be as thou wishest!'\r\n\r\n'O son of king, Bhimasena then once more said these words, 'O Uluka, say\r\nthose words of mine unto the wicked-minded, deceitful, and unrighteous\r\nSuyodhana, who is an embodiment of sin, who is wedded to guile, and whose\r\nbehaviour is exceedingly wicked. Thou shalt have to dwell in the stomach\r\nof a vulture or in Hastinapura. O scum of human kind, I shall assuredly\r\nfulfil the vow I have made in the midst of the assembly. I swear in the\r\nname of Truth, slaying Dussasana in battle, I shall quaff his life-blood!\r\nSlaying also thy (other) brothers, I shall smash thy own thighs. Without\r\ndoubt, O Suyodhana, I am the destroyer of all the sons of Dhritarashtra,\r\nas Abhimanyu is of all the (younger) princes! I shall by my deeds,\r\ngratify you all! Hearken once more to me. O Suyodhana, slaying thee, with\r\nall thy uterine brothers, I shall strike the crown of thy head with my\r\nfoot in the sight of the king Yudhishthira the Just!'\r\n\r\n'Nakula, then, O king, said these words, 'O Uluka, say unto\r\nDhritarashtra's son, Suyodhana, of Kuru's race that all the words uttered\r\nby him have now been heard and their sense understood. I shall, O\r\nKauravya, do all that thou hast commended me to do.'\r\n\r\n'And Sahadeva also, O monarch, said these words of grave import, 'O\r\nSuyodhana, it will all be as thou wishest! Thou shalt have to repent, O\r\ngreat king, along with thy children, kinsmen, and counsellors, even as\r\nthou art now bragging joyously in view of our sufferings.'\r\n\r\n'Then Virata and Drupada, both venerable in years, said these words unto\r\nUluka, It is even our wish that we become slaves of a virtuous person!\r\nWhether, however, we are slaves or masters, will be known tomorrow, as\r\nalso who owns what manliness!'\r\n\r\n'After them, Sikhandin said these words unto Uluka, 'Thou must say unto\r\nking Duryodhana who is always addicted to sinfulness, these words,\r\nviz.,--See, O king, what fierce deed is perpetrated by me in battle! I\r\nshall slay grandsire of thine from his car, relying upon whose prowess\r\nthou art certain of success in battle! Without doubt, I have been created\r\nby the high-souled Creator for the destruction of Bhishma. I shall\r\nassuredly slay Bhishma in the sight of all bowmen.'\r\n\r\n'After this, Dhrishtadyumna also said unto Uluka, the gambler's son,\r\nthese words, 'Say unto prince Suyodhana these my words, viz., I shall\r\nslay Drona with all his followers and friends. And I shall do a deed\r\nwhich none else will ever do.'\r\n\r\n'King Yudhishthira once more said these high words fraught with clemency,\r\nviz.,--O monarch, I never desire the slaughter of my kinsmen. O thou of\r\nwicked understanding, it is from thy fault that all this will assuredly\r\ntake place. I shall, of course, have to sanction the fulfilment of their\r\ngreat feats by all these (around me). Go hence, O Uluka, without delay or\r\nstay here, O sire, for, blessed be thou, we too are thy kinsmen.'\r\n\r\n'Uluka, then, O king, thinking permission of Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nDharma, went thither where king Suyodhana was. Thus addressed, the\r\ngambler's son carefully bearing in mind all he had heard, returned to the\r\nplace from which he had come. And arriving there, he fully represented\r\nunto the vindictive Duryodhana all that Arjuna had charged him with. And\r\nhe also faithfully communicated unto Dhritarashtra's son the words of\r\nVasudeva, of Bhima, of king Yudhishthira the Just, of Nakula and Virata\r\nand Drupada, O Bharata and the words of Sahadeva and Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nSikhandin, and the words also that were spoken (subsequently) by Kesava\r\nand Arjuna. And having listened to the words of the gambler's son,\r\nDuryodhana, that bull of Bharata's race, ordered Dussasana and Karna and\r\nSakuni, O Bharata, and their own troops and the troops of the allies, and\r\nall the (assembled) kings, to be arrayed in divisions and be ready for\r\nbattle before sunrise (next morrow). Messengers then, instructed by Karna\r\nand hastily mounting on cars and camels and mares and good steeds endued\r\nwith great fleetness, quickly rode through the encampment. And at Karna's\r\ncommand they promulgated the order--Array (yourselves) before sunrise\r\ntomorrow!'\""

I am\r\nwell-versed in all mighty affairs, as also in various kinds of array. I\r\nknow also how to make regular soldiers and volunteers act their parts. In\r\nthe matter of marching the troops and arraying them, in encounters and\r\nwithdrawing, I am as well-versed, O great king, as Vrihaspati (the\r\npreceptor of the celestials), is! I am acquainted with all the methods of\r\nmilitary array prevalent amongst the celestials, Gandharvas, and human\r\nbeings. With these I will confound the Pandavas. Let thy (heart's) fever\r\nbe dispelled. I will fight (the foe), duly protecting thy army and\r\naccording to the rules of (military) science!

I desire to hear this, with all these lords of earth!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O son of Gandhari, O king of kings, to the tale\r\nof Rathas in thy own army! Hear, O king, as to who are Rathas and who\r\nAtirathas! They are in thy army, many thousands, many millions, and many\r\nhundreds of millions of Rathas. Listen, however, to me as I name only the\r\nprincipal ones. Firstly, with thy country of brothers including Dussasana\r\nand others, thou art of the foremost of Rathas! All of you are skilled in\r\nstriking, and proficient in cutting chariots and piercing. All of you are\r\naccomplished drivers of chariots while seated in the driver's box, and\r\naccomplished managers of elephants while seated on the necks of those\r\nanimals. All of you are clever smiters with maces and bearded darts and\r\nswords and bucklers. You are accomplished in weapons and competent in\r\nbearing burthens of responsibility. Ye all are disciples of Drona and of\r\nKripa, the son of Saradwat, in arrows and other arms. Wronged by the sons\r\nof Pandu, these Dhartarashtras, endued with energy, will assuredly slay\r\nin the encounter the Panchalas irresistible in combat. Then, O foremost\r\nof the Bharatas, come I, the leader of all thy troops, who will\r\nexterminate thy foes, vanquishing the Pandavas! It behoveth me not to\r\nspeak of my own merits. I am known to thee. The foremost of all wielders\r\nof weapons, Bhoja (chief) Kritavarman is Atiratha. Without doubt, he will\r\naccomplish thy purpose in battle. Incapable of being humiliated by\r\npersons accomplished in arms, shooting or hurling his weapons to a great\r\ndistance, and a severe smiter, he will destroy the ranks of the foe, as\r\nthe great Indra destroying the Danavas. The ruler of the Madras, the\r\nmighty bowman Salya, is, as I think, an Atiratha. That warrior boasteth\r\nhimself as Vasudeva's equal, in every battle (that he fighteth). Having\r\nabandoned his own sister's sons, that best of kings, Salya, hath become\r\nthine. He will encounter in battle the Maharathas of the Pandava party,\r\nflooding the enemy with his arrows resembling the very surges of the sea.\r\nThe mighty bowman Bhurisravas, the son of Somadatta, who is accomplished\r\nin arms and is one of thy well-meaning friends, is a leader of leaders of\r\ncar-divisions. He will, certainly, make a great havoc among the\r\ncombatants of thy enemies. The king of the Sindhus, O monarch, is in my\r\njudgment, equal to two Rathas. That best of car-warriors will fight in\r\nbattle, displaying great prowess. Humiliated, O king, by the Pandavas on\r\nthe occasion of his, abducting Draupadi, and bearing that humiliation in\r\nmind, that slayer of hostile heroes will fight (for thee). Having\r\npractised after that, O king, the severest austerities, he obtained a\r\nboon, highly difficult of acquisition, for encountering the Pandavas in\r\nbattle. That tiger among car-warriors, therefore, remembering his old\r\nhostility, will, O sire, fight with the Pandavas in battle, reckless of\r\nhis very life which is so difficult to lay down.'\""

Desiring the success of thy object, he\r\nwill certainly fight with the enemy in battle. O best of kings, the\r\nKauravas will behold the prowess of this lion among car-warriors exerted\r\nfor thee, to be equal to that of Indra himself in battle. As regards the\r\ncar-army of this king, O monarch, those smiters of fierce impetus, the\r\nKamvojas, will cover a large area like a flight of locusts! Coming from\r\n(the province of) Mahishmati, Nila, accoutred in blue mail, is one of thy\r\nRathas. With his car-army he will cause a great havoc among thy foes, O\r\nchild, he had hostilities with Sahadeva. O king, he will continually\r\nfight for thee, O thou of Kuru's race. Accomplished in battle, and of\r\nfierce energy and prowess, (the princes) Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti are\r\nboth regarded as excellent Rathas. These two heroes among men will\r\nconsume the troops of thy foes, with maces and bearded darts, and swords\r\nand long shafts, and javelins hurled from their hands. Like a couple of\r\n(elephant) leaders sporting in the midst of their herds, these two\r\nprinces, O monarch, longing for battle, will range the field, each like\r\nYama himself. The five (royal) brothers of Trigarta are, in my judgment,\r\nall foremost of Rathas. The sons of Pritha provoked hostilities with them\r\nat Virata's city on that (well-known) occasion. Like huge Makaras, O\r\nking, agitating the stream of the Ganges crested with high waves, they\r\nwill agitate the ranks of the Parthas in battle. All the five, O king,\r\nare Rathas, having Satyaratha (amongst them) as their first. Remembering\r\nthe wrongs inflicted on them of old by that son of Pandu who is Bhima's\r\nyounger brother, when the latter, O Bharata, on his car drawn by white\r\nsteeds, was engaged, O monarch, in subjugating all the kings of the\r\nearth, they will certainly exert themselves bravely in battle.\r\nEncountering many Maharathas--chief of bowmen--leaders of Kshatriyas--on\r\nthe side of the Parthas, they will certainly slay them. Thy son Lakshmana\r\nand the son also of Dussasana--those tigers among men are both\r\nunretreating in battle. In prime of youth, of delicate limbs, endued with\r\ngreat activity, those two princes, well-versed with battles and capable\r\nof leading all, those tigers among Kurus, those car-warriors, are, I\r\nthink, two of our best Rathas. Devoted to the duties of the Kshatriya\r\norder, those two heroes will achieve great feats. Dandadhara, O monarch,\r\nis, O bull among men, equal to a single Ratha. Guarded by his own\r\nsoldiers, he will fight in battle for thee. Endued with great impetus and\r\nprowess, king Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, is, in my judgment, O\r\nsire, equal to one Ratha. Fierce in arms, this mighty bowman, devoted to\r\nthe good of the Dhartarashtras, will exert himself powerfully in battle,\r\ngladdening his own friends. Kripa, the son of Saradwat is, O king, a\r\nleader of leaders of car-ranks. Reckless even of life which is so dear,\r\nhe will consume thy foes. Born among a clump of heath as the son of that\r\ngreat sage, viz., the preceptor Gautama, otherwise called Saradwat, he is\r\ninvincible like Kartikeya himself. Consuming untold warriors armed with\r\nvarious weapons and bows, he will, O sire, roam forth on the field of\r\nbattle like a blazing fire.'\""

Having caused the (present) hostilities (to break out) with\r\nthe sons of Pandu, he will fight. There is no doubt in this. His troops\r\nare irresistible when rushing to battle. Armed with various kinds of\r\nweapons in abundance, in speed, they are equal to the very wind. The\r\nmighty bowman (Aswatthaman) who is Drona's son surpasseth all bowmen.\r\nAcquainted with all modes of warfare, and of unbaffled weapons, he is a\r\nMaharatha. Like the wielder of Gandiva, the shafts of this warrior, shot\r\nfrom his bow, proceed in a continuous line, touching one another. If he\r\nwishes it, this Maharatha is capable of consuming the three worlds.\r\nEngaged in austerities in his hermitage, he hath, by these, increased\r\nboth his fury and energy. Possessed of great intelligence, he hath been\r\nfavoured by Drona with (the gift of all) celestial weapons. There is,\r\nhowever, O bull of Bharata's race, one great defect in him, in\r\nconsequence of which, O best of kings, I do not regard him either as a\r\nRatha or a Maharatha. This regenerate man is exceedingly fond of living,\r\nlife being very dear to him. Amongst the warriors of both armies there is\r\nno one who can be regarded as his peer. On even a single car he can\r\nannihilate the very army of the celestials. Possessed of a strong frame,\r\nhe can split the very mountains by the flaps of his bow-string, striking\r\nagainst the leathern fence on his left arm. Endued with innumerable\r\nqualities, this smiter of fierce effulgence will wander (over the field\r\nof battle), incapable of being withstood like Yama himself, mace in hand.\r\nResembling the fire at the end of the Yuga as regards his fury, possessed\r\nof leonine neck, and endued with great lustre, Aswatthaman will\r\nextinguish the embers of this battle between the Bharata's. His father\r\n(Drona) is endued with great energy, and though aged, is still superior\r\nto many young men. He will achieve great feats in battle. I have no doubt\r\nof this. Staying immovably (on the field), he will consume Yudhishthira's\r\ntroops. The Pandava army will play the part of the dry grass and fuel in\r\nwhich that fire will originate, while the impetus of his own weapons will\r\nbe the wind for fanning it into a (mighty) flame. This bull among men, is\r\na leader of bands of car-warriors. The son of Bharadwaja will achieve\r\nfierce feats for thy good! The preceptor of all Kshatriyas of royal\r\nlineage, the venerable preceptor, will exterminate the Srinjayas.\r\nDhananjaya, however, is dear to him. This mighty bowman, therefore,\r\nremembering his own celebrated and highly meritorious services as\r\npreceptor, will never be able to slay Partha who is capable of achieving\r\ngreat feats without any trouble. O hero, Drona always boasteth of the\r\nnumerous accomplishments of Partha. Indeed, Bharadwaja looketh on him\r\nwith greater affection than on his own son. Endued with great prowess, he\r\ncan, on a single car, beat in battle, by means of his celestial weapons,\r\nall the gods, Gandharvas, and human beings united together. That tiger\r\namong kings, is, O monarch, one of thy Maharathas. Capable of breaking\r\nthe car-ranks of hostile heroes, he, in my judgment, is one of thy\r\nforemost of car-warriors. Afflicting the ranks of the enemy at the head\r\nof his own large force, he will consume the Panchalas like fire consuming\r\na heap of dry grass. Possessed of true fame, prince Vrihadvala is equal\r\nto single Ratha. He, O monarch, will roam amid thy enemy's troops like\r\nDeath himself. His troops, O king of kings, accoutred in various kinds of\r\nmail and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, will wander on the field,\r\nslaying all the warriors opposed to them. Vrishasena, the son of Karna,\r\nis one of thy foremost of car-warriors and is a Maharatha. That foremost\r\nof mighty men will consume the troops of thy enemy. Endued with great\r\nenergy, Jalasandha, O king, is one of thy foremost of Rathas. Born in\r\nMadhu's race, that slayer of hostile heroes, is prepared to cast away his\r\nvery life in battle. Skilled in battle, that mighty-armed warrior,\r\nscattering the enemy's ranks before him, will fight in battle mounted on\r\ncar or from the elephant's back. That best of kings, O monarch, is in my\r\njudgment, a Ratha. He will, in fierce battle, cast away for thy sake his\r\nvery life with all, his troops possessed of great prowess and acquainted\r\nwith all the modes of warfare, he will, O king, fight fearlessly with thy\r\nfoes in battle. Never retreating from battle, brave, and resembling Yama\r\nhimself, Vahlika, O king, is in my judgment, an Atiratha. Rushing to the\r\nencounter he never cometh back. Indeed, he will slay hostile warriors in\r\nbattle like the Wind-god himself. That router of hostile car-ranks, that\r\ncar-warrior of wonderful feats in battle, commander of thy forces,\r\nSatyavan is, O king, a Maharatha. He never cherisheth grief at the\r\nprospect of battle. Confounding those warriors that stand in the way of\r\nhis car, he falleth upon them. Always displaying his prowess against the\r\nenemy, that best of men will, for thy sake, in fierce press of battle,\r\nachieve all that a good Kshatriya should. Thai chief of Rakshasas,\r\nAlambhusha, of cruel deeds, is a Maharatha. Remembering his old\r\nhostilities (with the Pandavas), he will commit great execution among the\r\nfoe. He is the best of Rathas amongst all the Rakshasa-warriors.\r\nPossessing powers of illusion, and firm in enmity, he will wander\r\nfiercely on the field. The ruler of Pragjyotisha, the brave Bhagadatta of\r\nexceeding prowess, is the foremost of those holding the elephant hook,\r\nand is skilled also in fighting from a car. An encounter took place\r\nbetween him and the wielder of Gandiva for days together, O king, each\r\ndesirous of victory over the other. Then Bhagadatta, O son of Gandhari,\r\nwho regarded Indra as his friend, made friendship with (Indra's son) the\r\nhigh-souled Pandava. Skilled in fight from the elephant's neck, this king\r\nwill fight in battle, like Vasava among the celestials, fighting from his\r\nAiravata.'\""

As\r\nregards this thy ever dear friend, this one who is always boastful of his\r\nskill in battle, this one who always urgeth thee, O king, to fight with\r\nthe Pandavas, this vile braggart, Karna, the son of Surya, this one who\r\nis thy counsellor, guide, and friend, this vain wight who is destitute of\r\nsense, this Karna, is neither a Ratha nor an Atiratha. Without sense,\r\nthis one hath been deprived of his natural coat of mail. Always kind, he\r\nhath also been deprived of his celestial ear-rings. In consequence of the\r\ncurse of Rama (his preceptor in arms) as also of the words of a Brahmana\r\n(who cursed him on another occasion), owing also to his deprivation of\r\nthe accoutrements of battle, he, in my judgment, is only half a Ratha.\r\nHaving approached Falguni (in battle), he will not certainly escape with\r\nlife!' Hearing this, Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons,\r\nsaid, 'It is even so as thou hast said. That is not untrue! He boasteth\r\non the eve of every battle, but yet he is seen to retreat from every\r\nengagement. Kind (out of season) and blundering, it is for this that\r\nKarna, in my judgment, is only half a Ratha!'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words, Radha's son, expanding his eyes in rage, and\r\nafflicting Bhishma with words like sharp hooks, said unto Ganga's son\r\nthese words, 'O grandsire, though I am innocent yet from thy aversion to\r\nme, thou manglest me thus, according to thy pleasure, with thy wordy\r\narrows at every step. I tolerate, however, all this for the sake of\r\nDuryodhana. Indicating me as only half a Ratha, thou regardest me\r\nworthless, as if, indeed, I were a coward! What doubt is there in this? I\r\ndo not speak an untruth when I say that thou, O Ganga's son, art an enemy\r\nof the whole universe, and especially of all the Kurus! The king,\r\nhowever, doth not know this! Who else is there that would thus seek to\r\ndisunite and abate the energy of these kings that are all equal and that\r\nare all equally brave, as thou, from thy hatred of merit, seekest to do?\r\nO Kaurava, neither years, nor wrinkles, nor wealth, nor possession of\r\nfriends, would entitle a Kshatriya to be regarded as a Maharatha! It hath\r\nbeen said that a Kshatriya acquireth eminence only through might, as\r\nBrahmanas acquire eminence through superiority in mantras, as Vaisyas\r\nthrough wealth, and Sudras through age. Influenced, however, by lust and\r\nenvy, and acting from ignorance, thou hast indicated Rathas and Atirathas\r\naccording only to thy own caprice! Blessed be thou, O mighty-armed\r\nDuryodhana, judge properly! Let this wicked Bhishma, who only wrongeth\r\nthee, be abandoned by thee! Thy warriors, once disunited, can with\r\ndifficulty be united again. O tiger among men, thy main army, under such\r\ncircumstances, can with difficulty be united; far greater will the\r\ndifficulty be in uniting an army gathered from various provinces! Behold,\r\nO Bharata, doubt (of success) hath already arisen in the hearts of thy\r\nwarriors! This Bhishma weakeneth our energy in our very presence! Where\r\nis the task of ascertaining the merits of Rathas, and where is Bhishma of\r\nlittle understanding? I alone will withstand the army of Pandavas. Coming\r\nin contact with me, whose arrows never go for nothing, the Pandavas and\r\nthe Panchalas will fly away in all directions like oxen when they come in\r\ncontact with a tiger! Where, Oh, are battle, the press of armed\r\nencounter, good counsels and well-expressed words, and where is Bhishma,\r\nwho is superannuated and of wicked soul, and who is impelled by the very\r\nfates to become their victim? Alone he challengeth the whole universe! Of\r\nfalse vision he regardeth none else as a man. It is true the scriptures\r\nteach that the words of the old should be listened to. That, however,\r\ndoth not refer to those that are very old, for these, in my judgment,\r\nbecome children again. Alone I will exterminate the army of the Pandavas!\r\nThe fame, however, of such a feat will attach to Bhishma, O tiger among\r\nkings, for this Bhishma, O monarch, hath been made by thee the commander\r\nof thy forces, and the renown always attacheth to the leader and not to\r\nthose that fight under him. I will not, therefore, O king, fight as long\r\nas Ganga's son liveth! After Bhishma, however, hath been laid low, I will\r\nfight with all the Maharathas of the enemy united together!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma said, 'This burden, vast as the ocean, in the matter of\r\nDuryodhana's battle (with the Pandavas), is about to be taken up by me. I\r\nhave thought of it for many years. Now that the hour is come for that\r\nterrible encounter, dissensions amongst ourselves should not be created\r\nby me. It is for this, Suta's son, that thou livest! Else, superannuated\r\nthough I am and young in years thou art, I would quell thy desire for\r\nbattle and crush thy hope of life! (Thy preceptor) Rama, the son of\r\nJamadagni, shooting his great weapons, could not cause me the slightest\r\npain. What canst thou, therefore, do to me? They that are good, do not\r\napprove self-praise. Infamous wretch of thy race, know that I indulge in\r\nlittle boast because I am enraged. Vanquishing on a single car all the\r\nassembled Kshatriyas of the world at the Swayamvara of the daughters of\r\nthe ruler of Kasi, I abducted those maidens. Alone, I stopped on the\r\nfield of battle the rush of countless kings with their soldiers!\r\nObtaining thee as embodiment of strife, a great calamity is ready to\r\novertake the Kurus! Strive then for slaying our antagonists. Be a man,\r\nfight with that Partha, whom thou so often challengest. O thou of wicked\r\nunderstanding, I desire to see thee come out of that encounter with thy\r\nlife!'\r\n\r\n\"King Duryodhana then said unto Bhishma, of great prowess, 'Cast thy eyes\r\non me, O Ganga's son! Great is the business that is at hand! Think\r\nearnestly as how I may be most benefited! Both of you will render me\r\ngreat services!

O great king, intelligent Partha owneth that car which is\r\nfurnished with the banner bearing the device of the ape; the driver of\r\nthat car is Vasudeva!

Possessed of great might,\r\nthose two heroes will fight for the Pandavas. Both of them are endued\r\nwith great lightness of hand in the use of weapons. Both of them are\r\nconversant with all the modes of warfare, both are well-skilled and\r\npossessed of firm prowess. The five Kshatriya brothers, O king, who are\r\ndifficult of being vanquished, and all of whom have blood red banners,\r\nare foremost of the Rathas. Kasika, and Sukumara, and Nila, and that\r\nother one, viz., Suryadatta, and Sankha, otherwise called Madiraswa, are\r\nall in my judgment, the foremost of Rathas. Possessed of every\r\nqualification that renders them fit for battle, they are acquainted with\r\nall weapons, and all of them are endued with high souls. Vardhakshemi, O\r\nking, is in my judgment, a Maharatha. King Chitrayudha is, in my\r\njudgment, one of the best of Rathas. He is, besides, an asset in battle\r\nand devotedly attached to the diadem-decked (Arjuna). Those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, those tigers among men, Chekitana, and Satyadhriti, are two\r\nof the best Rathas of the Pandavas in my judgment. Vyaghradatta, O\r\nmonarch, and Chandrasena also, O Bharata, are without doubt two of the\r\nbest Rathas, as I think, of the Pandavas. Senavindu, O king, otherwise\r\ncalled Krodhahantri by name, who, O lord, is regarded as equal of\r\nVasudeva and of Bhimasena, will contend with great prowess in battle\r\nagainst your warriors. Indeed, that best of kings, ever boasting of his\r\nfeats in battle, should be regarded by thee, precisely as myself, Drona\r\nand Kripa are regarded by thee! That best of men, worthy of praise, viz.,\r\nKasya, is endued with great lightness of hand in the use of weapons.\r\nIndeed, that subjugator of hostile cities is known to me as equal to one\r\nRatha. Drupada's son, Satyajit, young in years and displaying great\r\nprowess in battle, should be regarded as equal to eight Rathas. Indeed\r\nbeing Dhrishtadyumna's equal, he is an Atiratha. Desirous of spreading\r\nthe fame of the Pandavas, he will achieve great feats. Devoted to the\r\nPandavas and endued with great bravery, there is another great Ratha of\r\nthe Pandavas, viz., king Pandya, that bowman of mighty energy. The mighty\r\nbowman Dhridadhanwan is another Maharatha of the Pandavas. O subjugator\r\nof hostile cities, that foremost of Kurus, viz., Srenimat and king\r\nVasudeva are both, in my judgment, Atirathas.'\""

That subjugator of foes, the mighty bowman Kuntibhoja\r\nof great strength, the maternal uncle of Bhimasena, is, in my judgment,\r\nan Atiratha. This mighty and heroic bowman is well-versed and highly\r\nskilled in fight. Acquainted with all modes of warfare, this bull among\r\ncar-warriors is regarded by me as exceedingly competent.

That prince of Rakshasas (Ghatotkacha), O\r\nking, born of Bhima and Hidimva, and endued with ample powers of\r\nillusion, is, in my judgment, a leader of the leaders of car-divisions.\r\nFond of battle, and endued with powers of illusion, he will, O sire,\r\nfight earnestly in battle.

It is with them (thus) endued with powers\r\nof illusion and fired by the desire of success that I shall contend in\r\nbattle, expectant of victory or death. I shall advance against these two\r\nforemost of car-warriors, Vasudeva and Arjuna, bearing (respectively)\r\nGandiva and the discus, and resembling the sun and the moon as seen\r\ntogether in the evening.

But, thou of mighty arms, I will not\r\nstrike or slay Sikhandin the prince of Panchalas, even if I behold him\r\nrushing against me in battle with weapons upraised. The world knows how\r\nfrom a desire of doing what was agreeable to my father, that I gave up\r\nthe kingdom that had become mine and lived in the observance of the\r\nBrahmacharya vow. I then installed Chitrangada in the sovereignty of the\r\nKauravas, making at the same time the child Vichitravirya the Yuvaraja.\r\nHaving notified my god-like vow among all the kings of the earth, I shall\r\nnever slay a woman or one that was formerly a woman. It may be known to\r\nyou, O king, that Sikhandin was formerly a woman. Having been born as a\r\ndaughter, she afterwards became metamorphosed into the male sex.

My father, Santanu, O king, was celebrated over all the world.\r\nO bull of the Bharata race, that king of virtuous soul paid his debt to\r\nnature in time, Observing my pledge, O chief of the Bharatas, I then\r\ninstalled my brother, Chitrangada, on the throne of the extensive kingdom\r\nof the Kurus. After Chitrangada's demise, obedient to the counsels of\r\nSatyavati, I installed, according to the ordinance, Vichitravirya as\r\nking. Although young in age, yet being installed duly by me, O monarch,\r\nthe virtuous Vichitravirya looked up to me in everything.

Amongst those maidens Amva was the eldest, Amvika the second,\r\nwhile the princess Amvalika, O monarch, was the youngest. Myself\r\nrepairing on a single car to the city of the ruler of Kasi, I beheld, O\r\nthou of mighty arms, the three maidens adorned with ornaments and also\r\nall the kings of the earth invited thither on the occasion. Then, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race, challenging to battle all those kings who were ready\r\nfor the encounter, I took up those maidens on my car and repeatedly said\r\nunto all the kings assembled there these words--Bhishma, the son of\r\nSantanu, is carrying away by force these maidens. Ye kings, strive ye all\r\nto the best of your power for rescuing them! By force do I take them\r\naway, ye bulls among men, making you spectators of my act!--At these\r\nwords of mine those rulers of the earth sprang up with weapons\r\nunsheathed. And they angrily urged the drivers of their cars, saying,\r\n'Make ready the cars,--Make ready the cars.' And those monarchs sprang up\r\nto the rescue, with weapons unsheathed; car-warriors on their cars\r\nresembling masses of clouds, those fighting from elephants, on their\r\nelephants, and others on their stout and plump steeds. Then all those\r\nkings, O monarch, surrounded me on all sides with a multitudinous number\r\nof cars. With a shower of arrows, I stopped their onrush on all sides and\r\nvanquished them like the chief of celestials vanquishing hordes of\r\nDanavas. Laughingly, with easiness I cut down the variegated standards,\r\ndecked with gold, of the advancing kings, with blazing shafts, O bull of\r\nBharata's race! In that combat I overthrew their steeds and elephants and\r\ncar-drivers, each with a single arrow. Beholding that lightness (of hand)\r\nof mine, they desisted (from the fight) and broke. And having vanquished\r\nall those rulers of the earth, I came back to Hastinapura, I then, O thou\r\nof mighty arms, made over those maidens, intending them for my brothers\r\nto Satyavati and represented unto her everything I had done.'\""

It hath been heard by me that his action (in this\r\nmatter) hath been for the sake of his brother. My two sisters Amvika and\r\nAmvalika, who were abducted with me at the same time, have, O king, been\r\nbestowed by Ganga's son on his younger brother Vichitravirya!

Go, therefore, unto that foremost one of\r\nBhrigu's race who resembleth the Yuga-fire itself in energy! That great\r\nascetic will place thee once more on the right track!' Hearing this, that\r\nmaiden, shedding tears all the while, saluted her maternal grandsire,\r\nHotravahana, with a bend of her head and addressed him, saying, 'Go I\r\nwill at thy command! But shall I succeed in obtaining a sight of that\r\nreverend sire celebrated over the world? How will he dispel this poignant\r\ngrief of mine? And how shall I go to that descendant of Bhrigu? I desire\r\nto know all this.'\r\n\r\n\"Hotravahana said, 'O blessed maiden, thou wilt behold Jamadagni's son,\r\nRama, who is devoted to truth and endued with great might and engaged in\r\naustere penances in the great forest. Rama always dwelleth in that\r\nforemost of the mountains called Mahendra. Many Rishis, learned in the\r\nVedas, and many Gandharvas and Apsaras also dwell there.

And while king Hotravahana, was saying all this unto\r\nthat maiden, thither appeared Akritavrana, a dear companion of Rama. And\r\non his advent those Munis by hundreds, and the Srinjaya king Hotravahana,\r\nold in years, all stood up. And those denizens of the forest, uniting\r\nwith one another, did him all the rites of hospitality. And they all took\r\ntheir seats surrounding him. And filled, O monarch, with gratification\r\nand joy, they then started various delightful, laudable, and charming\r\nsubjects of discourse.

Thou wilt see him even here when he cometh to\r\nbehold thee. As regards this maiden, for what, O royal sage, hath she\r\ncome to the wood? Whose is she, and what is she to thee? I desire to know\r\nall this.' Hotravahana. said, 'The favourite daughter of the ruler of\r\nKasi, she is, O lord, my daughter's child! The eldest daughter of the\r\nking of Kasi, she is known by the name of Amva. Along with her two\r\nyounger sisters, O sinless one, she was in the midst of her Swayamvara\r\nceremonies. The names of her two younger sisters are Amvika and Amvalika,\r\nO thou endued with wealth of asceticism! All the Kshatriya kings of the\r\nearth were assembled together at the city of Kasi. And, O regenerate\r\nRishi, great festivities were going on there on account of (the\r\nself-choice of) these maidens. In the midst of these, Santanu's son,\r\nBhishma, of mighty valour, disregarding all the kings, abducted the\r\ngirls. Vanquishing all the monarchs, the pure-souled prince Bhishma of\r\nBharata's race then reached Hastinapura, and representing everything unto\r\nSatyavati, ordered his brother Vichitravirya's marriage to take place\r\nwith the girls he had brought. Beholding the arrangements for those\r\nnuptials complete, this maiden, O bull among Brahmanas, then addressed\r\nGanga's son in the presence of his ministers and said,--I have, O hero,\r\nwithin my heart chosen the lord of the Salwas to be my husband.\r\nConversant as thou art with morality, it behoveth thee not to bestow me\r\non thy brother, whose heart is given away to another!--Hearing these\r\nwords of hers, Bhishma took counsel with his ministers. Deliberating on\r\nthe matter, he, at last, with Satyavati's consent, dismissed this maiden,\r\nPermitted thus by Bhishma, this girl gladly repaired to Salwa, the lord\r\nof Saubha, and approaching him said,--Dismissed I have been by Bhishma.\r\nSee that I do not fall off from righteousness! In my heart, I have chosen\r\nthee for my lord, O bull among kings. Salwa, however, rejected her,\r\nsuspecting the purity of her conduct. Even she hath come to these woods,\r\nsacred for asceticism, being ardently inclined to devote herself to\r\nascetic penances! She was recognised by me from the account that she gave\r\nof her parentage. As regards her sorrow, Bhishma is considered by her to\r\nbe its root!' After Hotravahana had ceased, Amva herself said, 'O holy\r\none, it is even so as this lord of earth, this author of my mother's\r\nbody, Hotravahana of the Srinjaya race hath said. I cannot venture to go\r\nback to my own city, O thou that art endued with wealth of asceticism,\r\nfor shame and fear of disgrace, O great Muni! At present, O holy one,\r\neven this is what hath been my determination, viz., that that would be my\r\nhighest duty which the holy Rama, O best of Brahmanas, might point out to\r\nme!'\""

Is it thy wish that\r\nthe lord of Saubha should be urged to wed thee, the high-souled Rama will\r\ncertainly urge him from desire of doing thee good? Or, if thou wishest to\r\nbehold Ganga's son, Bhishma, defeated in battle by intelligent Rama\r\nBhargava will gratify even that wish of thine. Hearing what Srinjaya has\r\nto say, and what thou also, O thou of sweet smiles, may have to say, let\r\nthat be settled this very day what should be done for thee.' Hearing\r\nthese words, Amva said, 'O holy one, abducted I was by Bhishma acting\r\nfrom ignorance, for, O regenerate one, Bhishma knew not that my heart had\r\nbeen given away to Salwa. Thinking of this in thy mind, let that be\r\nresolved upon by thee which is consistent with justice, and let steps be\r\ntaken for accomplishing that resolution. Do that, O Brahmana, which is\r\nproper to be done towards either that tiger among the Kurus, viz.,\r\nBhishma, singly, or towards the ruler of the Salwas, or towards both of\r\nthem! I have told thee truly about the root of my grief. It behoveth\r\nthee, O holy one, to do that which is consistent with reason.'\r\n\r\n\"Akritavrana said, 'This, O blessed lady, O thou of the fairest\r\ncomplexion, that thou sayest with eyes fixed upon virtue, is, indeed,\r\nworthy of thee. Listen, however, to what I say! If Ganga's son had never\r\ntaken thee to the city called after the elephant, then, O timid girl,\r\nSalwa would have, at Rama's behest, taken thee on his head! It is because\r\nBhishma bore thee away by force that king Salwa's suspicions have been\r\nawakened in respect of thee, O thou of slender-waist! Bhishma is proud of\r\nhis manliness and is crowned with success. Therefore, thou shouldst cause\r\nthy vengeance to fall upon Bhishma (and no other)!' Hearing these words\r\nof the sage, Amva said, 'O regenerate one, this desire hath been\r\ncherished by me also in my heart, viz., that, if possible. Bhishma should\r\nbe caused by me to be slain in battle! O thou of mighty arms, be it\r\nBhishma or be it king Salwa, punish that man whom thou thinkest to be\r\nguilty and through whose act I have been so miserable!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'In conversation such as this, that day passed and\r\nthe night also, O best of Bharata's race, with its delicious breeze which\r\nwas neither cold nor hot. Then Rama appeared there, beaming with energy.\r\nAnd that sage wearing matted-locks on his bead and attired in deer-skins\r\nwas surrounded by his disciples. And endued with magnanimous soul, he had\r\nhis bow in hand. And bearing also a sword and a battle-axe, that sinless\r\none, O tiger among kings, approached the Srinjaya king (Hotravahana) in\r\nthat forest. And the ascetics dwelling there and that king also who was\r\nendued with great ascetic merit, beholding him, all stood up and waited,\r\nO king, with joined hands. And that helpless maiden too did the same. And\r\nthey all cheerfully worshipped Bhargava with the offer of honey and\r\ncurds. Being worshipped duly by them, Rama sat with them seated round\r\nhim. Then, O Bharata, Jamadagni's son and Hotravahana, seated thus\r\ntogether, began to discourse. And after their discourse was over, the\r\nsage Hotravahana opportunately said in a sweet voice these words of grave\r\nimport unto that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, viz., Rama of mighty\r\nstrength, 'O Rama, this is my daughter's daughter, O lord, being the\r\ndaughter of the king of Kasi.\r\n\r\nShe hath something to be done for her! Oh, listen to it duly, O thou that\r\nart skilled in all tasks!' Hearing these words of his friend, Rama\r\naddressed that maiden saying. 'Tell me what thou hast to say.' At these\r\nwords, Amva approached Rama who resembled a blazing fire, and worshipping\r\nboth his feet with her bent head, touched them with her two hands that\r\nresembled, in radiance, a couple of lotuses and stood silently before\r\nhim. And filled with grief, she wept aloud, her eyes bathed in tears. And\r\nshe then sought the protection of that descendant of Bhrigu, who was the\r\nrefuge of all distressed persons. And Rama said, 'Tell me what grief is\r\nin thy heart. I will act according to thy words!' Thus encouraged, Amva\r\nsaid, 'O thou of great vows, O holy one, today I seek thy protection! O\r\nlord, raise me from this unfathomable ocean of sorrow.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'Beholding her beauty and her youthful body and its\r\ngreat delicacy, Rama began to think,--What will she say? And that\r\nperpetuator of Bhrigu's line, thinking inwardly of this, sat long in\r\nsilence, filled with pity. He then addressed that maiden of sweet smiles\r\nagain, saying, 'Tell us what thou hast to say!' Thus encouraged, she\r\nrepresented everything truly unto Bhargava. And Jamadagni's son, hearing\r\nthese words of the princess, and having first settled what he should do,\r\naddressed that damsel of the fairest complexion, saying, 'O beautiful\r\nlady, I will send word unto Bhishma, that foremost one of Kuru's race.\r\nHaving beard what my behest is, that king will certainly obey it. If,\r\nhowever, the son of Jahnavi do not act according to my words, I will then\r\nconsume him in battle, O blessed girl, with all his counsellors! Or, O\r\nprincess, if thou desirest it, I may even address the heroic ruler of the\r\nSalwas to the matter in hand.' Hearing these words of Rama, Amva said,\r\n'Dismissed I was by Bhishma, O son of Bhrigu's race, as soon as he heard\r\nthat my heart had previously been freely given away to the ruler of the\r\nSalwas. Approaching then the lord of Saubha, I addressed him in language\r\nthat was unbecoming. Doubtful of the purity of my conduct, he refused to\r\naccept me. Reflecting on all this, with the aid of thy own understanding,\r\nit behoveth thee, O son of Bhrigu's race, to do that which should be done\r\nin view of these circumstances. Bhishma, however, of great vows is the\r\nroot of my calamity, for he brought me under his power taking me up (on\r\nhis car) by violence! Slay that Bhishma, O thou of mighty arms, for whose\r\nsake, O tiger of Bhrigu's race, overwhelmed with such distress, I suffer\r\nsuch poignant misery! Bhishma, O thou of Bhrigu's race, is covetous, and\r\nmean, and proud of his victory. Therefore, O sinless one, thou shouldst\r\ngive him his deserts. While, of lord, I was being abducted by him, even\r\nthis was the desire that I cherished in my heart, viz., that I should\r\ncause that hero of great vows to be slain. Therefore, O sinless Rama,\r\ngratify this desire of mine! O thou of mighty arms, slay Bhishma, even as\r\nPurandara slew Vritra.'\""

Thou hadst further promised that as long as thou wouldst live\r\nthou wouldst not abandon those that would come to thee in fright and seek\r\nthy protection, and that thou wouldst, O Bhargava, slay that proud\r\nwarrior who would vanquish in battle all the assembled Kshatriyas of the\r\nearth! O Ram, even Bhishma, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, hath\r\nachieved such success (over all the Kshatriyas)!

That task which the daughter of Kasi hath in her mind is a\r\ngrave one, O Brahmana! Taking this maiden with me, I will repair myself\r\nto the place where Bhishma is. If Bhishma, proud of his achievements in\r\nbattle, do not obey my behest, I will then slay that arrogant wight. Even\r\nthis is my fixed resolve. The arrows shot by me do not stick to the\r\nbodies of embodied creatures (but pass them through). This is known to\r\nyou from what you saw in my encounters with the Kshatriyas!' Having said\r\nthis, Rama then, along with all those seekers of Brahma, resolved to\r\ndepart from that asylum! and the great ascetic then rose from his seat.\r\nThen all those ascetics passing that night there, performed (on the next\r\nmorning) their homa-rites and recited their prayers.

Hearing that Rama, of great might, had\r\ncome to the confines of our kingdom, I speedily went with a joyous heart\r\nto that master who was an ocean of energy. And I went to him, O king,\r\nwith a cow placed in the van of my train, and accompanied by many\r\nBrahmanas, and (ordinary) priests (of our family), and by others,\r\nresembling the very gods in splendour, employed by us on special\r\noccasions. And beholding me arrived at his presence, Jamadagni's son, of\r\ngreat prowess, accepted the worship I offered unto him and said these\r\nwords unto me.'\r\n\r\n\"Rama said, 'Thyself, divested of desire, with what mood of mind, O\r\n'Bhishma, didst thou abduct, on the occasion of her self-choice, his\r\ndaughter of the king of Kasi and again dismiss her subsequently? By thee\r\nhath this famous lady been dissociated from virtue! Contaminated by the\r\ntouch of thy hands before, who can marry her now? Rejected she hath been\r\nby Salwa, because thou, O Bharata, hadst abducted her. Take her\r\ntherefore, to thyself, O Bharata, at my command. Let this daughter of a\r\nking, O tiger among men, be charged with the duties of her sex! O king, O\r\nsinless one, it is not proper that this humiliation should be hers!\r\n\r\n'Seeing him plunged into sorrow (on account of the maiden) I said unto\r\nhim,--O Brahmana, I cannot, by any means, bestow this girl on my brother.\r\nO thou of Bhrigu's race, it was to myself that she said, I am Salwa's!\r\nAnd it was by me that she was permitted to go to Salwa's city. As regards\r\nmyself, even this is my firm vow that I cannot abandon Kshatriya\r\npractices from fear or pity, or avarice of wealth, or lust!--Hearing\r\nthese words of mine, Rama addressed me, with eyes rolling in anger,\r\nsaying, 'If, O bull among, men, thou dost not act according to my words,\r\nI will slay thee this very day along with all thy counsellors!' Indeed,\r\nwith eyes rolling in anger, Rama in great wrath told me these words\r\nrepeatedly. I, however, O chastiser of foes, then beseeched him in sweet\r\nwords. But though beseeched by me, he did not cool down. Bowing down with\r\nmy head unto that best of Brahmanas I then enquired of him the reason for\r\nwhich he sought battle with me. I also said,--O thou of mighty arms,\r\nwhile I was a child it was thou who instructed me in the four kinds of\r\narms.[18] I am, therefore, O thou of Bhrigu's race, thy disciple! Then\r\nRama answered me with eyes red in anger, 'Thou knowest me, O Bhishma, to\r\nbe thy preceptor, and yet, O Kauravya, thou acceptest not, for pleasing\r\nme, this daughter of the ruler of Kasi! O delighter of the Kurus, I\r\ncannot be gratified unless thou actest in this way! O mighty-armed one,\r\ntake this maiden and preserve thy race! Having been abducted by thee, she\r\nobtaineth not a husband. Unto Rama that subjugator of hostile cities, I\r\nreplied, saying.--This cannot be, O regenerate Rishi! All thy labour is\r\nvain, O son of Jamadagni, remembering thy old preceptorship, I am\r\nstriving, O holy one, to gratify thee! As regards this maiden, she hath\r\nbeen refused by me before knowing what the faults, productive of great\r\nevils, of the female sex are, who is there that would admit into his\r\nabode a woman whose heart is another's and who (on that account) is even\r\nlike a snake of virulent poison? O thou of high vows, I would not, even\r\nfrom fear of Vasava, forsake duty! Be gracious unto me, or do me without\r\ndelay that which thou hast thought proper. This sloka also, O thou of\r\npure soul, is heard in the Puranas, O lord, sung by the high-souled\r\nMarutta, O thou of great intelligence! The renunciation is sanctioned by\r\nthe ordinance of a preceptor who is filled with vanity, who is destitute\r\nof the knowledge of right and wrong, and who is treading in a devious\r\npath.--Thou art my preceptor and it is for this that I have from love\r\nreverenced thee greatly. Thou, however, knowest not the duty of a\r\npreceptor, and it is for this that I will fight with thee. I would not\r\nslay any preceptor in battle, especially again a Brahmana, and more\r\nspecially one endued with ascetic merit. It was for this that I forgive\r\nthee. It is well-known truth, gatherable from the scriptures, that he is\r\nnot guilty of slaying a Brahmana who killeth in battle a person of that\r\norder that taketh up weapons like Kshatriya and fighteth wrathfully\r\nwithout seeking to fly. I am a Kshatriya stationed in the practice of\r\nKshatriya duties. One doth not incur sin, nor doth one incur any harm by\r\nbehaving towards a person exactly as that person deserveth. When a person\r\nacquainted with the proprieties of time and place and well-versed in\r\nmatters affecting both profit and virtue, feels doubtful, as regards\r\nanything, he should without scruples of any kind, devote himself to the\r\nacquisition of virtue which would confer the highest benefit on him. And\r\nsince thou, O Rama, in a matter connected with profit of doubtful\r\npropriety, actest unrighteously, I would certainly fight with thee in a\r\ngreat battle. Behold the strength of my arms and my prowess that is\r\nsuperhuman! In view of such circumstances, I shall certainly do, O son of\r\nBhrigu, what I can. I shall fight with thee, O regenerate one, on the\r\nfield of Kurukshetra! O Rama of great effulgence, equip thyself as thou\r\nlistest for single combat! Come and station thyself on the field of\r\nKurukshetra where, afflicted with my shafts in great battle, and\r\nsanctified by my weapons, thou mayest obtain those regions that have been\r\nwon by thee (thought for thy austerities). O thou of mighty arms and\r\nwealth of asceticism, there I will approach thee for battle,--thee that\r\nart so fond of battle! There, O Rama, where in days of yore thou hadst\r\npropitiated thy (deceased) fathers (with oblations of Kshatriya blood),\r\nslaying thee there, O son of Bhrigu, I will propitiate the Kshatriya\r\nslain by thee! Come there, O Rama, without delay! There, O thou that art\r\ndifficult of being vanquished, I will curb thy old pride about which the\r\nBrahmanas speak! For many long years, O Rama, thou hast boasted,\r\nsaying,--I have, single-handed, vanquished all the Kshatriyas of the\r\nEarth!--Listen now to what enabled thee to indulge in that boast! In\r\nthose days no Bhishma was born, or no Kshatriyas like unto Bhishma!\r\nKshatriyas really endued with valour have taken their births later on! As\r\nregards thyself, thou hast consumed only heaps of straw! The person that\r\nwould easily quell thy pride of battle hath since been born! He, O\r\nmighty-armed one, is no other than myself, even Bhishma, that subjugator\r\nof hostile cities! Without doubt, O Rama, I shall just quell thy pride of\r\nbattle!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of mine. Rama addressed me,\r\nlaughingly saying, 'By good luck it is, O Bhishma, that thou desirest to\r\nfight with me in battle! O thou of Kuru's race, even now I go with thee\r\nto Kurukshetra! I will do what thou hast said! Come thither, O chastiser\r\nof foes! Let thy mother, Jahnavi, O Bhishma, behold thee dead on that\r\nplain, pierced with my shafts, and become the food of vultures, crows,\r\nand other carnivorous birds! Let that goddess worshipped by Siddhas and\r\nCharanas, that blessed daughter of Bhagiratha, in the form of a river,\r\nwho begat thy wicked self, weep today, O king, beholding thee slain by me\r\nand lying miserable on that plain, however undeserving she may be of\r\nseeing such a sight! Come, O Bhishma, and follow me, O proud wight,\r\nalways longing for battle! O thou of Kuru's race, take with thee, O bull\r\nof Bharatas' line, thy cars and all other equipments of battle!' Hearing\r\nthese words of Rama that subjugator of hostile towns, I worshipped him\r\nwith a bend of my head and answered him, saying,--So be it! Having said\r\nall this, Rama then went to Kurukshetra from desire of combat, and I\r\nalso, entering our city, represented everything unto Satyavati. Then\r\ncausing propitiatory ceremonies to be performed (for my victory), and\r\nbeing blessed also by my mother, and making the Brahmanas utter\r\nbenedictions on me, I mounted on a handsome car made of silver and unto\r\nwhich, O thou of great glory, were yoked steeds white in hue. And every\r\npart of that car was well-built, and it was exceedingly commodious and\r\ncovered on all sides with tiger-skin. And it was equipped with many great\r\nweapons and furnished with all necessaries. And it was ridden by\r\ncharioteer who was well-born and brave, who was versed in horse-lore,\r\ncareful in battle, and well-trained in his art, and who had seen many\r\nencounters. And I was accoutred in a coat of mail, white in hue, and had\r\nmy bow in hand. And the bow I took was also white in hue. And thus\r\nequipped, I set out, O best of Bharata's race! And an umbrella, white in\r\nhue, was held over my head. And, O king, I was fanned with fans that also\r\nwere white in colour. And clad in white, with also a white head-gear, all\r\nmy adornments were white. And eulogised (with laudatory hymns) by\r\nBrahmanas wishing me victory. I issued out of the city named after the\r\nelephant, and proceeded to Kurukshetra, which, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nwas to be the field of battle! And those steeds, fleet as the mind or the\r\nwind, urged by my charioteer, soon bore me, O king, to that great\r\nencounter. And arrived in the field of Kurukshetra, both myself and Rama,\r\neager for battle, became desirous of showing each other our prowess. And\r\narrived within view of the great ascetic Rama, I took up my excellent\r\nconch and blew a loud blast. And many Brahmanas, O king, and many\r\nascetics having their abodes in the forest, as also the gods with Indra\r\nat their head, were stationed there for beholding the great encounter.\r\nAnd many celestial garlands and diverse kinds of celestial music and many\r\ncloudy canopies could be noticed there. And all those ascetics who had\r\ncome with Rama, desiring to become spectators of the fight, stood all\r\naround the field. Just at this juncture, O king, my divine mother devoted\r\nto the good of all creatures, appeared before me in her own form and\r\nsaid, 'What is this that thou seekest to do? Repairing to Jamadagni's\r\nson, O son of Kuru's race, I will repeatedly solicit him saying,--Do not\r\nfight Bhishma who is thy disciple!--O son, being a Kshatriya do not\r\nobstinately set thy heart on an encounter in battle with Jamadagni's son\r\nwho is a Brahmana!' Indeed, it was thus that she reproved me. And she\r\nalso said, 'O son, Rama, equal in prowess unto Mahadeva himself, is the\r\nexterminator of the Kshatriya order! It is not known to thee, that thou\r\ndesirest an encounter with him.' Thus addressed by her, I saluted the\r\ngoddess reverentially and replied unto her with joined hands, giving her,\r\nO chief of the Bharatas, an account of all that had transpired in that\r\nself-choice (of the daughter of Kasi). I also told her every thing, O\r\nking of kings, about how I had urged Rama (to desist from the combat). I\r\nalso gave her a history of all the past acts of the (eldest) daughter of\r\nKasi. My mother then, the great River, wending to Rama, began, for my\r\nsake, to beseech the Rishi of Bhrigu's race. And she said unto him these\r\nwords, viz.,--Do not fight Bhishma who is thy disciple!--Rama, however,\r\nsaid unto her while she was beseeching him thus, 'Go and make Bhishma\r\ndesist! He doth not execute out my wish! It is for this that I have\r\nchallenged him!'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Rama, Ganga, from affection\r\nfor her son, came back to Bhishma. But Bhishma, with eyes rolling in\r\nanger, refused to do her bidding. Just at this time, the mighty ascetic\r\nRama, that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, appeared in Bhishma's sight. An\r\nthen that best of the twice-born ones challenged him to the encounter.'\""

And I then, myself,\r\nsingly obtained for my adversary that invincible and mighty exterminator\r\nof the Kshatriya race, viz., Rama risen like the sun himself in\r\nsplendour, desirous (on his part) of fighting singly! And after he had\r\npoured three showers of arrows on me curbing my steeds, I came down from\r\nmy car and placing my bow aside I proceeded on foot to that best of\r\nRishis. And arriving before him, I worshipped the best of Brahmanas with\r\nreverence. And having saluted him duly, I told him these excellent\r\nwords,--O Rama, whether thou art equal or superior to me, I will fight\r\nwith thee, my virtuous preceptor, in battle! O lord, bless me, wishing me\r\nvictory!'\r\n\r\n\"Rama, thus addressed, said, 'O foremost one of Kuru's race, he that\r\ndesires prosperity should act even thus! O thou of mighty arms, they that\r\nfight with warriors more eminent than themselves, have this duty to\r\nperform. O king, I would have cursed thee if thou hadst not approached me\r\nthus! Go, fight carefully and summoning all thy patience, O thou of\r\nKuru's race! I cannot, however, wish thee victory, for I myself stand\r\nhere to vanquish thee! Go, fight fairly! I am pleased with thy\r\nbehaviour!--Bowing unto him, I then speedily came back, and mounting on\r\nmy car, I once more blew my conch decked with gold, And then, O Bharata,\r\nthe combat commenced between him and me. And it lasted for many days.\r\neach of us, O king, having been desirous of vanquishing the other. And in\r\nthat battle, it was Rama who struck me first with nine hundred and sixty\r\nstraight arrows furnished with vulturine wings. And with that arrowy\r\nshower, O king, my four steeds and charioteer were completely covered!\r\nNotwithstanding all this, however, I remained quiet in that encounter,\r\naccoutred in my coat of mail! Bowing unto the gods, and especially unto\r\nthe Brahmanas, I then smilingly addressed Rama stationed for battle,\r\nsaying,--Although thou hast shown little regard for me, yet I have fully\r\nhonoured thy preceptorship! Listen again, O Brahmana, to some other\r\nauspicious duty that should be discharged if virtue is to be earned! The\r\nVedas that are in thy body, and the high status of Brahmana that is also\r\nin thee, and the ascetic merit thou hast earned by the severest of\r\nausterities, I do not strike at these! I strike, however, at that\r\nKshatriyahood which thou, O Rama, hast adopted! When a Brahmana taketh up\r\nweapons, he becometh a Kshatriya. Behold now the power of my bow and the\r\nenergy of my arms! Speedily shall I cut off that bow of thine with a\r\nsharp shaft!--Saying this I shot at him, O bull of Bharata's race, a\r\nsharp broad-headed arrow, And cutting off one of the horns of his bow\r\nwith it. I caused it to drop on the ground. I then shot at Jamadagni's\r\ncar a hundred straight arrows winged with vulturine feathers. Piercing\r\nthrough Rama's body and borne along by the wind, those arrows coursing\r\nthrough space seemed to vomit blood (from their mouths) and resembled\r\nveritable snakes. Covered all over with blood and with blood issuing out\r\nof his body. Rama, O king, shone in battle, like the Sumeru mountain with\r\nstreams of liquid metal rolling down its breast, or like the Asoka tree\r\nat the advent of spring, when covered with red bunches of flowers, or, O\r\nking, like the Kinsuka tree when clad in its flowery attire! Taking up\r\nthen another bow, Rama, filled with wrath, showered upon me numerous\r\narrows of excessive sharpness, furnished with golden wings. And those\r\nfierce arrows of tremendous impetus, resembling snakes, or fire, or\r\npoison, coming at me from all sides, pierced my very vitals and caused me\r\nto tremble. Summoning all my coolness then addressed myself for the\r\nencounter, and filled with rage I pierced Rama with a hundred arrows. And\r\nafflicted with those hundred blazing shafts resembling either fire, or\r\nthe sun or looking like snakes of virulent poison, Rama seemed to lose\r\nhis senses! Filled, O Bharata, with pity (at the sight), I stopped of my\r\nown accord and said,--Oh, fie on battle! Fie on Kshatriya practices! And\r\noverwhelmed, O king, with grief, I repeatedly said,--Alas, great is the\r\nsin committed by me through observance of Kshatriya practices, since I\r\nhave afflicted with arrows my preceptor who is a Brahmana endued with a\r\nvirtuous soul!--After that, O Bharata, I ceased striking Jamadagni's son\r\nany more. At this time, the thousand-rayed luminary, having heated the\r\nearth with his rays, proceeded at the close of day to his chambers in the\r\nwest and the battle also between us ceased.'\""

Next\r\nmorning, when the sun rose, the battle commenced again, my horses having\r\n(a little while before) been bathed and allowed to roll on the ground and\r\nhaving had their thirst slaked and thereby re-invigorated. And beholding\r\nme coming quickly to the encounter attired in a coat of mail and\r\nstationed on my car, the mighty Rama equipped his car with great care.\r\nAnd I myself also, beholding Rama coming towards me from desire of\r\nbattle, placed aside my bow and quickly descended from my car. Saluting\r\nRama I re-ascended it, O Bharata, and desirous of giving battle, stood\r\nfearlessly before that son of Jamadagni. I then overwhelmed him with a\r\nthick shower of arrows, and he too covered me with an arrowy shower in\r\nreturn. And filled with wrath. Jamadagni's son once more shot at me a\r\nnumber of fierce shafts of great force and blazing mouths looking like\r\nveritable snakes! And I too, O king, shooting sharp shafts by hundreds\r\nand thousands, repeatedly cut: off Rama's arrows in mid-air before they\r\ncould come at me. Then the mighty son of Jamadagni began to hurl\r\ncelestial weapons at me, all of which I repelled, desirous of achieving\r\nmightier feats, O thou of strong arms, with-my weapons. And loud was the\r\ndin that then arose in the welkin all around. At that time, I hurled at\r\nRama the weapon named Vayavya which Rama neutralised, O Bharata, by the\r\nweapon called Guhyaka. Then I applied, with proper mantras, the weapon\r\ncalled Agneya but the lord Rama neutralised that weapon of mine by one\r\n(of his) called Varuna. And it was in this way that I neutralised the\r\ncelestial weapons of Rama, and that chastiser of foes, Rama also, endued\r\nwith great energy and acquainted with celestial weapons, neutralised the\r\nweapons shot by me. Then, O monarch, that best of Brahmanas, the mighty\r\nson of Jamadagni, filled with wrath, suddenly wheeling to my right,\r\npierced me in the breast. At this, O best of the Bharatas, I swooned on\r\nmy best of cars. And beholding me, reft of consciousness, my charioteer\r\nquickly bore me away from the field. And seeing me afflicted and pierced\r\nwith Rama's weapons and borne away drooping and in a swoon, all the\r\nfollowers of Rama, including Akritavrana and others and the princess of\r\nKasi, filled with joy, O Bharata, began to shout aloud! Regaining\r\nconsciousness then, I addressed my charioteer, saying,--Go where Rama\r\nstayeth! My pains have left me, and I am ready for battle!--Thus\r\ninstructed, my charioteer soon took me where Rama was, with the aid of\r\nthose exceedingly handsome steeds of mine that seemed to dance as they\r\ncoursed (through the plain) and that were endued with the speed of the\r\nwind. And approaching Rama then, O thou of Kuru's race, and filled with\r\nwrath, from desire of vanquishing his angry self, I overwhelmed him with\r\nan arrowy shower! But Rama, shooting three for every single of mine, cut\r\ninto fragments every one of my straight-going arrows in mid air before\r\nany of them could reach him! And beholding those well-furnished arrows of\r\nmine by hundreds and thousands, each cut off in twain by Rama's arrows,\r\nall the followers of Rama were filled with joy. Impelled then by the\r\ndesire of slaying him, I shot at Rama, the son of Jamadagni, a\r\ngood-looking arrow of blazing effulgence with Death's self sitting at its\r\nhead. Struck very forcibly therewith and succumbing to its impetus, Rama\r\nfell into a swoon and dropped down on the ground. And when Rama thus\r\ndropped on the ground, exclamations of Oh and Alas arose on all sides,\r\nand the whole universe, O Bharata, was filled with confusion and alarm,\r\nsuch as may be witnessed if the sun himself were ever to fall down from\r\nthe firmament! Then all those ascetics together with the princess of\r\nKasi, quietly proceeded, O son of Kuru's race, with great anxiety towards\r\nRama. And embracing him, O Kaurava, they began to comfort him softly with\r\nthe touch of their hands, rendered cold by contact with water, and with\r\nassurances of victory. Thus comforted, Rama rose up and fixing an arrow\r\nto his bow he addressed me in an agitated voice, saying, 'Stay, O\r\nBhishma! Thou art already slain! And let off by him, that arrow quickly\r\npierced my left side in that fierce encounter. And struck therewith, I\r\nbegan to tremble like a tree shaken by the tempest. Slaying my horses\r\nthen in terrific combat, Rama, fighting with great coolness, covered me\r\nwith swarms of winged arrows, shot with remarkable lightness of hand. At\r\nthis, O mighty-armed one, I also began to shoot arrows with great\r\nlightness of hand for obstructing Rama's arrowy shower. Then those arrows\r\nshot by myself and Rama covering the welkin all around, stayed even there\r\n(without failing down). And, thereupon, enveloped by clouds of arrows the\r\nvery sun could not shed its rays through them. And the very wind,\r\nobstructed by those clouds, seemed to be unable to pass through them.\r\nThen, in consequence of the obstructed motion of the wind, the rays of\r\nthe sun, and the clash of the arrows against one another, a conflagration\r\nwas caused in the welkin. And then those arrows blazed forth in\r\nconsequence of the fire generated by themselves, and fell on the earth,\r\nconsumed into ashes! Then Rama, O Kaurava, filled with rage, covered me\r\nwith hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands and hundreds of\r\nmillions arrows! And I also, O king, with my arrows resembling snakes of\r\nvirulent poison, cut into fragments all those arrows of Rama and caused\r\nthem to fall down on the earth like snakes cut into pieces. And it was\r\nthus, O best of the Bharatas, that combat took place. When, however, the\r\nshades of evening approached, my preceptor withdrew from the fight.'\""

That hero of virtuous soul, conversant with celestial\r\nweapons,--the lord Rama, from day to day, began to use diverse kinds of\r\ncelestial weapons. Regardless of life itself, which is so difficult of\r\nbeing sacrificed, in that fierce combat, O Bharata, I baffled all those\r\nweapons with such of mine as are capable of baffling them. And, O\r\nBharata, when diverse weapons were in this way neutralised and baffled by\r\nmeans of counter-weapons, Rama, of mighty energy began to contend against\r\nme in that battle, reckless of his own life. Seeing all his weapons\r\nbaffled, the high-souled son of Jamadagni then hurled at me a fierce\r\nlance, blazing like a meteor, with flaming mouth, filling the whole\r\nworld, as it were, with its effulgence, and resembling the dart hurled by\r\nDeath himself! I, however, with my arrows cut into three fragments that\r\nblazing dart rushing against me, and resembling in effulgence the sun\r\nthat rises at end of the Yuga! At this, breezes charged with fragrant\r\nodours began to blow (around me). Beholding that dart of his cut off,\r\nRama, burning with anger, hurled a dozen other fierce darts. Their forms,\r\nO Bharata, I am incapable of describing in consequence of their great\r\neffulgence and speed. How, indeed, shall I describe their forms?\r\nBeholding those diverse-looking darts approach me from all sides, like\r\nlong tongues of fire and blazing forth with fierce energy like the dozen\r\nsuns that arise at the time of the destruction of the universe, I was\r\nfilled with fear. Seeing an arrowy net advancing against me, I baffled it\r\nwith an arrowy downpour of mine, and then sent a dozen shafts by which I\r\nconsumed those fierce-looking dozen darts of Rama. Then, O king, the\r\nhigh-souled son of Jamadagni showered on me numerous fierce-looking\r\ndarts, furnished with variegated handles decked with gold, possessed of\r\ngolden wings, and resembling flaming meteors! Baffling those fierce darts\r\nby means of my shield and sword, and causing them in that combat to fall\r\ndown on the ground, I then, with clouds of excellent arrows, covered\r\nRama's excellent steeds and his charioteer. Then that high-souled smiter\r\nof the lord of the Haihayas,[19] beholding those darts of mine equipped\r\nwith gold-decked handles and resembling snakes emerged out of their\r\nholes, and filled with wrath at the sight, had recourse once more to\r\ncelestial weapons! Then swarms of fierce arrows, looking like flights of\r\nlocusts fell upon me and overwhelmed me, my steeds, my charioteer, and my\r\ncar! Indeed, O king, my car, horses, and charioteer, were covered all\r\nover with those arrows! And the yoke, shaft, wheels, and the wheel-spokes\r\nof my car, overwhelmed with that arrowy shower, at once broke. After that\r\narrowy shower, however, was over, I also covered my preceptor with a\r\nthick shower of arrows. Thereupon, that mass of Brahmic merit, mangled\r\nwith that arrowy downpour, began to bleed copiously, and continuously.\r\nIndeed, like Rama afflicted with my clouds of arrows, I too was densely\r\npierced with his arrows. When at last in the evening, the sun set behind\r\nthe western hills, our combat came to an end.'\""

My beloved charioteer then, afflicted by that arrowy\r\nshower, swerved from his place in the car, filling me with grief on his\r\naccount. A total unconsciousness then came over him. And thus wounded by\r\nthat arrowy downpour he fell down upon the earth in a swoon. And\r\nafflicted as he had been by Rama's shafts, he soon gave up his life.\r\nThen, O great king, fear entered my heart. And when, on the death of my\r\ncharioteer, I was still lamenting for him with heart unhinged by sorrow,\r\nRama began to shoot at me many death-dealing shafts. Indeed, even when\r\nendangered at the death of my charioteer I was lamenting for him, he of\r\nBhrigu's race, drawing the bow with strength, pierced me deep with an\r\narrow! O king, that blood-drinking shaft, falling upon my breast, pierced\r\nme through and fell simultaneously with my person upon the earth! Then, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, thinking I was dead, Rama repeatedly roared aloud\r\nlike the clouds and rejoiced exceedingly! indeed, O king, when thus I\r\nfell down on the earth, Rama, filled with joy, sent forth loud shouts\r\nalong with his followers, while all the Kauravas who stood beside me and\r\nall those who came there to witness the combat were afflicted with great\r\nwoe on seeing me fall. While lying prostrate, O lion among kings, I\r\nbeheld eight Brahmanas endued with the effulgence of the sun or the fire.\r\nThey stood surrounding me on that field of battle and supporting me on\r\ntheir arms. Indeed, borne up by those Brahmanas I had not to touch the\r\nground. Like friends they supported me in mid-air while I was breathing\r\nheavily. And they were sprinkling me with drops of water. And bearing me\r\nup as they stood, they then, O king, repeatedly said unto me, 'Do not\r\nfear! Let prosperity be thine!' Comforted then by those words of theirs,\r\nI quickly rose up. I then beheld my mother Ganga--that foremost of the\r\nrivers, stationed on my car. Indeed, O king of the Kurus, it was that\r\ngreat river-goddess who had controlled my steeds in the combat (after my\r\ncharioteer's fall)! Worshipping then the feet of my mother and of the\r\nspirits of my ancestors, I ascended my car. My mother then protected my\r\ncar, steeds, and all the implements of battle. With joined bands I\r\nentreated her to go away. Having dismissed her, I myself restrained those\r\nsteeds endued with the speed of the wind, and fought with Jamadagni's\r\nson, O Bharata, till the close of the day! Then, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\nin course of that combat, I shot at Rama a powerful and heart-piercing\r\narrow endued with great speed. Afflicted with that shaft, Rama then, his\r\nbow loosened from his grasp, fell down upon the earth on his knees, reft\r\nof consciousness! And when Rama, that giver of many thousands (of golden\r\ncoins) fell, masses of clouds covered the firmament, pouring a copious\r\nshower of blood! And meteors by hundreds fell, and thunder-rolls were\r\nheard, causing everything to tremble! And suddenly Rahu enveloped the\r\nblazing sun, and rough winds began to blow! And the earth itself began to\r\ntremble. And vultures and crows and cranes began to alight in joy! And\r\nthe points of the horizon seemed to be ablaze and jackals began\r\nrepeatedly to yell fiercely! And drums, unstruck (by human hands), began\r\nto produce harsh sound! Indeed, when the high-souled Rama embraced the\r\nearth, reft of consciousness, all these frightful and alarming omens of\r\nevil were seen! Then all on a sudden rising up, Rama approached me once\r\nmore, O Kaurava, for battle, forgetting everything and deprived of his\r\nsenses by anger. And that mighty-armed one took up his bow endued with\r\ngreat strength and also a deadly arrow. I, however, resisted him\r\nsuccessfully. The great Rishis then (that stood there) were filled with\r\npity at the sight, while he, however, of Bhrigu's race, was filled with\r\ngreat wrath. I then took up a shaft, resembling the blazing fire that\r\nappears at the end of the Yuga, but Rama of immeasurable soul baffled\r\nthat weapon of mine. Then covered by clouds of dust, the splendour of the\r\nsolar disc was dimmed, and the sun went to the western mount. And night\r\ncame with its delicious and cool breezes, and then both of us desisted\r\nfrom the fight. In this way, O king, when evening came the fierce battle\r\nceased, and (next day) with the re-appearance of the sun it commenced\r\nagain. And it lasted for three and twenty days together.'\""

Asleep or dead we reckon it as the same, O king,\r\nRama will not surely die!

And\r\nBhargava poured on me an arrowy shower which I baffled with an arrowy\r\nshower of mine. Then filled with wrath at what he had seen the day before\r\nand what he saw that day, Rama hurled at me a dart, hard as Indra's\r\nthunderbolt and possessed of effulgence, resembling the Yama's mace! It\r\ncame towards me like a blazing flame of fire and drinking up, as it were,\r\nall the quarters of that field of battle! Then, O tiger among the Kurus,\r\nit fell, O perpetuator of Kuru's line, upon my shoulder, like the\r\nlightning's flame that ranges the sky.

Then earth, with\r\nher mountains and seas and trees began to tremble, and all creatures,\r\nheated with the energy of the weapons, were greatly afflicted.

Do not light\r\nwith Rama who is thy preceptor. It is not proper for thee, O perpetuator\r\nof Kuru's race, to vanquish Rama in battle! O son of Ganga, show this\r\nBrahmana every honour on the field of battle! As regards thee, we are thy\r\nsuperiors and therefore forbid thee! Bhishma is one of the foremost of\r\nVasus! O son, it is fortunate, that thou art still alive! Santanu's son\r\nby Ganga--a celebrated Vasu as he is,--how can he be defeated by thee?\r\nDesist, therefore, O Bhargava! That foremost of the Pandavas, Arjuna, the\r\nmighty son of Indra, hath been ordained by the Self-create to be the\r\nslayer of Bhishma!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his own ancestors, Rama answered\r\nthem, saying, 'I cannot give up the combat. Even this is the solemn vow I\r\nhave made. Before this, I never left the field, giving up battle! Ye\r\ngrandsires, if you please, cause Ganga's son to desist from the fight! As\r\nregards myself, I can, by no means, desist from the combat!' Hearing\r\nthese words of his, O king, those ascetics with Richika at their head,\r\ncoming to me with Narada in their company, told me, 'O sire, desist from\r\nbattle! Honour that foremost of Brahmanas!' For the sake of Kshatriya\r\nmorality, I replied unto them, saying. Even this is the vow I have taken\r\nin this world, viz., that I would never desist from battle turning my\r\nback, or suffer my back to be wounded with arrows! I cannot, from\r\ntemptation or distress, or fear, or for the sake of wealth, abandon my\r\neternal duty! Even this is my fixed resolution! Then all those ascetics\r\nwith Narada at their head, O king, and my mother Bhagirathi, occupied the\r\nfield of battle (before me). I, however, stayed quietly with arrows and\r\nbow as before, resolved to fight. They then once more turned towards Rama\r\nand addressed him, saying. 'The hearts of Brahmanas are made of butter.\r\nBe pacified, therefore, O son of Bhrigu's race! O Rama, O Rama, desist\r\nfrom this battle, O best of Brahmanas! Bhishma is incapable of being\r\nslain by thee, as indeed, thou, O Bhargava, art incapable of being slain\r\nby him!' Saying these words while they stood obstructing the field, the\r\nPitris caused that descendant of Bhrigu's race to place aside his\r\nweapons. Just at this time I once more beheld those eight utterers of\r\nBrahma, blazing with effulgence and resembling bright stars risen on the\r\nfirmament. Stationed for battle as I was, they said these words unto me\r\nwith great affection, 'O thou of mighty arms, go unto Rama who is thy\r\npreceptor! Do what is beneficial to all the worlds. Beholding then that\r\nRama had desisted owing to the words of his well-wishers, I also, for the\r\ngood of the worlds, accepted the words of my well-wishers. Though mangled\r\nexceedingly, I still approached Rama and worshipped him. The great\r\nascetic Rama then, smilingly, and with great affection, said unto me,\r\n'There is no Kshatriya equal to thee on the earth! Go now, O Bhishma, for\r\nin this combat thou hast pleased me highly'! Summoning then in my\r\npresence that maiden (the daughter of Kasi), Bhargava sorrowfully said\r\nunto her these words in the midst of all those high-souled persons.'\""

By\r\nusing even the very best of weapons I have not been able to obtain any\r\nadvantage over Bhishma, that foremost of all wielders of weapons! I have\r\nexerted now to the best of my power and might. O beautiful lady, go\r\nwithersoever thou wishest! What other business of thine can I accomplish?\r\nSeek the protection of Bhishma himself! Thou hast no other refuge now!\r\nShooting mighty weapons Bhishma hath vanquished me!' Having said this,\r\nthe high-souled Rama sighed and remained silent. That maiden then\r\naddressed him, saying, 'O holy one, it is even so as thy holy self hath\r\nsaid! This Bhishma of great intelligence is incapable of being vanquished\r\nin battle by even the gods! Thou hast done my business to the best of thy\r\nexertion and power. Thou hast displayed in this battle energy incapable\r\nof being baffled and weapons also of diverse kinds. Thou hast yet been\r\nunable to obtain any advantage over Bhishma in combat. As regards myself,\r\nI will not go a second time to Bhishma. I will, however, O perpetuator of\r\nBhrigu's race, go thither, O thou endued with wealth of asceticism, where\r\nI may (obtain the means to) myself slay Bhishma in battle!' Having said\r\nthe words, that maiden went away, with eyes agitated with wrath, and\r\nthinking to compass my death, she firmly resolved to devote herself to\r\nasceticism. Then that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, accompanied by those\r\nascetics, bidding me farewell, departed, O Bharata, for the mountains\r\nwhence he had come. I also, ascending my car, and praised by the\r\nBrahmanas, entered our city and represented, everything unto my mother\r\nSatyavati, everything that had transpired, and she, O great king, uttered\r\nbenedictions on me. I then appointed persons endued with intelligence to\r\nascertain the doings of that maiden. Devoted to the good of myself--their\r\nwell-wisher, those spies of mine, with great application brought to me\r\naccounts of her course of action, her words and actions, from day to day.\r\nWhen that maiden went to the woods, resolved on ascetic austerities, even\r\nthen I became melancholy, and afflicted with pain, I lost my heart's\r\ntenor. Except one acquainted with Brahma and observant of vows, that are\r\npraiseworthy owing to the austerities they involve, no Kshatriya hath\r\never by his prowess, vanquished me in battle! I then, O king, humbly\r\nrepresented to Narada as also to Vyasa all that the maiden did. They both\r\ntold me, 'O Bhishma, do not give way to sorrow on account of the daughter\r\nof Kasi. Who is there that would venture to baffle destiny by individual\r\nexertion?' Meanwhile, O great king, that maiden, entering a cluster of\r\nretreats practised austerities, that were beyond human powers (of\r\nendurance). Without food, emaciated, dry, with matted-locks and begrimed\r\nwith filth, for six months she lived on air only, and stood unmoved like\r\na street-post. And that lady, possessed of wealth of asceticism,\r\nforegoing all food in consequence of the fast she kept, passed a whole\r\nyear after this, standing in the waters of the Yamuna. Endued with great\r\nwrath, she passed the next whole year standing on her front toes and\r\nhaving eaten only one fallen leaf (of a tree). And thus for twelve years,\r\nshe made the heavens hot by her austerities. And though dissuaded by her\r\nrelatives, she could not by any means be weaned off (from that course of\r\naction). She then went unto Vatsabhumi resorted to by the Siddhas and\r\nCharanas, and which was the retreat of high-souled ascetics of pious\r\ndeeds. Bathing frequently in the sacred waters of that retreat, the\r\nprincess of Kasi roamed about according to her will. Proceeding next (one\r\nafter another) to the asylum, O king, of Narada, and to the auspicious\r\nasylum of Uluka and to that of Chyavana, and to the spot sacred to\r\nBrahmana, and to Prayaga the sacrificial platform of the gods, and to\r\nthat forest sacred to the gods, and to Bhogawati, and, O monarch, to the\r\nasylum of Kusika's son (Viswamitra), and to the asylum of Mandavya, and\r\nalso to the asylum of Dwilipa, and to Ramhrada, and, O Kaurava, to the\r\nasylum of Garga, the princess of Kasi, O king, performed ablutions in the\r\nsacred waters of all these, observing all the while the most difficult of\r\nvows. One day, my mother from the waters asked her, O Kauravya, saying,\r\n'O blessed lady, for what dost thou afflict thyself so? Tell me the\r\ntruth!' Thus asked, O monarch, that faultless damsel answered her with\r\njoined hands, saying, 'O thou of handsome eyes, Rama hath been vanquished\r\nin battle by Bhishma. What other (Kshatriya) king then would venture to\r\ndefeat the latter when ready with his weapons? As regards myself, I am\r\npractising the severest penances for the destruction of Bhishma. I wander\r\nover the earth, O goddess, so that I may slay that king! In every thing I\r\ndo, O goddess, even this is the great end of my vows!' Hearing these\r\nwords of hers, the Ocean-going (river Ganga) replied unto her, saying, 'O\r\nlady, thou art acting crookedly! O weak girl, this wish of thine thou\r\nshalt not be able to achieve, O faultless one? if, O princess of Kasi,\r\nthou observest these vows for destruction of Bhishma, and if thou takest\r\nleave of thy body while observing them, thou shalt (in thy next birth)\r\nbecome a river, crooked in her course and of water only during the rains!\r\nAll the bathing places along thy course will be difficult of approach,\r\nand filled only during the rains, thou shalt be dry for eight months\r\n(during the year)! Full of terrible alligators, and creatures of\r\nfrightful mien thou shalt inspire fear in all creatures! Addressing her\r\nthus, O king, my mother, that highly-blessed lady, in seeming smiles,\r\ndismissed the princess of Kasi. That highly fair damsel then once more\r\nbegan to practise vows, foregoing all food, aye, even water, sometimes\r\nfor eight months and sometimes for ten months! And the daughter of the\r\nking of Kasi, wandering hither and thither for her passionate desire of\r\ntirthas, once more came back, O Kauravya, to Vatsabhumi. And it is there,\r\nO Bharata, that she is known to have become a river, filled only during\r\nthe rainy seasons, abounding with crocodiles, crooked in her course, and\r\ndestitute of easy access to her water. And, O king, in consequence of her\r\nascetic merit only half her body became such a river in Vatsabhumi, while\r\nwith the other half, she remained a maiden as before!'"

My observance\r\nof this vow is for his destruction and not for the sake of regions of\r\nbliss, ye that are endued with wealth of asceticism!

Being asked to solicit the boon she wished, she begged of\r\nthe deity my defeat. Thou shalt slay him,--were the words the god said\r\nunto that lady of great force of mind.

Having said so, the god of gods, called also Kapardin, having\r\nthe bull for his symbol, disappeared then and there, in the very sight of\r\nthose Brahmanas. Upon this, that faultless maiden of the fairest\r\ncomplexion, the eldest daughter of the king of Kasi, procuring wood from\r\nthat forest in the very sight of those great Rishis, made a large funeral\r\npyre on the banks of the Yamuna, and having set fire to it herself,\r\nentered that blazing fire, O great king, with a heart burning with wrath,\r\nand uttering, O king, the words,--(I do so) for Bhishma's destruction!'\""

During those years, king\r\nDrupada, O monarch, paid his adoration to the god Sankara for the sake of\r\noffspring, resolving in his mind to compass my destruction and practising\r\nthe austerest of penances. And he begged Mahadeva, saying, 'Let a son,\r\nand not a daughter, be born unto me. I desire, O god, a son for revenging\r\nmyself upon Bhishma.' Thereupon, that god of gods said unto him, 'Thou\r\nshalt have a child who will be a female and male. Desist, O king, it will\r\nnot be otherwise.' Returning then to his capital, he addressed his wife,\r\nsaying, 'O great goddess, great hath been the exertion made by me.\r\nUndergoing ascetic austerities, I paid my adorations to Siva, and I was\r\ntold by Sambhu that my child becoming a daughter (first) would\r\nsubsequently become a male person.

And, O\r\nking, Drupada caused all the rites of infancy, prescribed for a son, to\r\nbe performed in respect of that child, and he bestowed the name of\r\nSikhandin on her.

While husband\r\nand wife were conversing with each other thus, both filled with grief,\r\ntheir helpless daughter, Sikhandini, was filled with shame. She then\r\nreflected, saying, 'It is for me that these two are plunged into grief!'\r\nThinking so, she resolved upon putting an end to her own life. Having\r\nformed this determination, she left home, filled with heavy sorrow, and\r\nwent into a dense and solitary forest that was the haunt, O king, of a\r\nvery formidable Yaksha called Sthunakarna.

Thereupon, the Yaksha named Sthuna, who\r\nwas endued with kindness, showed himself unto her. And he enquired of\r\nher, saying, 'For what object is this endeavour of thine? I will\r\naccomplish it, tell me without delay!' Thus asked, the maiden answered\r\nhim, repeatedly saying, 'Thou art unable to accomplish it!' The Guhyaka,\r\nhowever, rejoined, without a moment's delay, saying, 'Accomplish it I\r\nwill! I am a follower of the Lord of treasures, I can, O princess, grant\r\nboons! I will grant thee even that which cannot be given! Tell me what\r\nthou hast to say!' Thus assured, Sikhandini represented in detail\r\neverything that had happened, unto that chief of Yakshas called\r\nSthunakarna. And she said, 'My father, O Yaksha, will soon meet with\r\ndestruction. The ruler of the Dasarnakas marcheth against him in rage.\r\nThat king eased in golden mail is endued with great might and great\r\ncourage. Therefore, O Yaksha, save me, my mother, and my father! Indeed,\r\nthou hast already pledged thyself to relieve my distress! Through thy\r\ngrace, O Yaksha, I would become a perfect man! As long as that king may\r\nnot depart from my city, so long, O great Yaksha, show me grace, O\r\nGuhyaka!'\""

The Yaksha said, 'O Blessed lady, I will\r\ncertainly do what thou wishest! Listen, however, to the condition I make.\r\nFor a certain period I will give thee my manhood. Thou must, however,\r\ncome back to me in due time. Pledge thyself to do so! Possessed of\r\nimmense power, I am a ranger of the skies, wandering at my pleasure, and\r\ncapable of accomplishing whatever I intend. Through my grace, save the\r\ncity and thy kinsmen wholly! I will bear thy womanhood, O princess!\r\nPledge thy truth to me, I will do what is agreeable to thee!' Thus\r\naddressed, Sikhandini said unto him, 'O holy one of excellent vows, I\r\nwill give thee back thy manhood! O wanderer of the night, bear thou my\r\nwomanhood for a short time! After the ruler of the Dasarnakas who is\r\ncased in a golden mail will have departed (from my city) I will once more\r\nbecome a maiden and thou wilt become a man!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'Having said this (unto each other), they both. O\r\nking, made a covenant, and imparted unto each other's body their sexes.\r\nAnd the Yaksha Sthuna, O Bharata, became a female, while Sikhandini\r\nobtained the blazing form of the Yaksha. Then, O king, Sikhandini of\r\nPanchala's race, having obtained manhood, entered his city in great joy\r\nand approached his father. And he represented unto Drupada everything\r\nthat had happened. And Drupada, bearing it all became highly glad. And\r\nalong with his wife the king recollected the words of Maheswara. And he\r\nforthwith sent, O king, messenger unto the ruler of the Dasarnakas,\r\nsaying, 'This my child is a male. Let it be believed by thee!' The king\r\nof the Dasarnakas meanwhile, filled with sorrow and grief, suddenly\r\napproached Drupada, the ruler of the Panchalas. And arrived at Kampilya,\r\nthe Dasarnaka king despatched, after paying him proper honours, an envoy\r\nwho was one of the foremost of those conversant with the Vedas. And he\r\naddressed the envoy, saying, 'Instructed by me, O messenger, say unto\r\nthat worst of kings the ruler of the Panchalas, these words,--viz., O\r\nthou of wicked understanding, having selected my daughter as a wife for\r\none who is thy daughter, thou shalt today, without doubt, behold the\r\nfruit of that act of deception.' Thus addressed and despatched by him, O\r\nbest of kings, the Brahmana set out for Drupada's city as Dasarnaka's\r\nenvoy. And having arrived at the city, the priest went unto Drupada's\r\npresence. The king of the Panchalas then, with Sikhandin, offered the\r\nenvoy, O king, a cow and honey. The Brahmana, however, without accepting\r\nthat worship, said unto him these words that had been communicated\r\nthrough him by the brave ruler of the Dasarnakas who was cased in a\r\ngolden mail. And he said, 'O thou of vile behaviours, I have been\r\ndeceived by thee through thy daughter (as the means)! I will exterminate\r\nthee with thy counsellors and sons and kinsmen!' Having, in the midst of\r\nhis counsellors, been made by that priest to hear those words fraught\r\nwith censure and uttered by the ruler of the Dasarnakas, king Drupada\r\nthen, O chief of Bharata's race, assuming a mild behaviour from motives\r\nof friendship, 'said, The reply to these words of my brother that thou\r\nhast said unto me, O Brahmana, will be carried to that monarch by my\r\nenvoy!' And king Drupada then, sent unto the high-souled Hiranyavarman a\r\nBrahmana learned in the Vedas as his envoy. And that envoy, going unto\r\nking Hiranyavarman, the ruler of the Dasarnakas, said unto him, 'O\r\nmonarch, the word that Drupada had entrusted him with.' And he said,\r\n'This my child is really a male. Let it be made clear by means of\r\nwitness! Somebody has spoken falsely to thee. That should not be\r\nbelieved!' Then the king of the Dasarnakas, having heard the words of\r\nDrupada, was filled with sorrow and despatched a number of young ladies\r\nof great beauty for ascertaining whether Sikhandin was a male or female.\r\nDespatched by him, those ladies, having ascertained (the truth) joyfully\r\ntold the king of the Dasarnakas everything, viz., that Sikhandin, O chief\r\nof the Kurus, was a powerful person of the masculine sex. Hearing that\r\ntestimony, the ruler of the Dasarnakas was filled with great joy, and\r\nwending then unto his brother Drupada, passed a few days with him in joy.\r\nAnd the king, rejoiced as he was, gave unto Sikhandin much wealth, many\r\nelephants and steeds and kine. And worshipped by Drupada (as long as he\r\nstayed), the Dasarnaka king then departed, having rebuked his daughter.\r\nAnd after king Hiranyavarman, the ruler of the Dasarnakas had departed in\r\njoy and with his anger quelled, Sikhandin began to rejoice exceedingly.\r\nMeanwhile, sometime after (the exchange of sexes had taken place) Kuvera,\r\nwho was always borne on the shoulders of human beings, in course of a\r\njourney (through the earth), came to the abode of Sthuna. Staying (in the\r\nwelkin) above that mansion, the protector of all the treasures saw that\r\nthe excellent abode of the Yaksha Sthuna was well-adorned with beautiful\r\ngarland of flowers, and perfumed with fragrant roots of grass and many\r\nsweet scents. And it was decked with canopies, and scented incense. And\r\nit was also beautiful with standards and banners. And it was filled with\r\nedibles and drink of every kind. And beholding that beautiful abode of\r\nthe Yaksha decked all over, and filled also with garlands of jewels and\r\ngems and perfumed with the fragrance of diverse kinds of flowers, and\r\nwell-watered, and well-swept, the lord of the Yakshas addressed the\r\nYakshas that followed him, saying, 'Ye that are endued with immeasurable\r\nprowess, this mansion of Sthuna is well-adorned! Why, however, doth not\r\nthat wight of wicked understanding come to me? And since that\r\nwicked-souled one, knowing I am here, approacheth me not, therefore, some\r\nsevere punishment should be inflicted on him! Even this is my intention!'\r\nHearing these words of his, the Yakshas said, 'O king, the royal Drupada\r\nhad a daughter born unto him, of the name of Sikhandini! Unto her, for\r\nsome reason, Sthuna had given his own manhood, and having taken her\r\nwomanhood upon him, he stayeth within his abode having become a woman!\r\nBearing as he doth a feminine form, he doth not, therefore, approach thee\r\nin shame! It is for this reason, O king, that Sthuna cometh not to thee!\r\nHearing all this, do what may be proper!' Let the car be stopped here!\r\nLet Sthuna be brought to me,--were the words that the lord of the Yakshas\r\nuttered, and repeatedly said,--I will punish him!--Summoned then by the\r\nLord of Yakshas, Sthuna bearing a feminine form came thither, O king, and\r\nstood before him in shame. Then, O thou of Kuru's race, the giver of\r\nwealth cursed him in anger, saying, 'Ye Guhyakas, let the femininity of\r\nthe wretch remain as it is!' And the high-souled lord of the Yakshas also\r\nsaid, 'Since humiliating all the Yakshas, thou hast, O thou of sinful\r\ndeeds, given away thy own sex to Sikhandini and taken from her, O thou of\r\nwicked understanding, her femininity,--since, O wicked wretch, thou hast\r\ndone what hath never been done by anybody,--therefore from this day, thou\r\nshalt remain a woman and she shall remain a man!' At these words of his,\r\nall the Yakshas began to soften Vaisravana for the sake of Sthunakarna\r\nrepeatedly saying, 'Set a limit to thy curse!' The high-souled lord of\r\nthe Yakshas then said unto all these Yakshas that followed him, from\r\ndesire of setting a limit to his curse, these words, viz.,--After\r\nSikhandin's death, ye Yakshas, this one will regain his own form!\r\nTherefore, let this high-souled Yaksha Sthuna be freed from his anxiety!\r\nHaving said this, the illustrious and divine king of the Yakshas,\r\nreceiving due worship, departed with all his followers who were capable\r\nof traversing a great distance within the shortest space of time. And\r\nSthuna, with that curse pronounced on him, continued to live there. And\r\nwhen the time came, Sikhandin without losing a moment came unto that\r\nwanderer of the night. And approaching his presence he said, It have come\r\nto thee, O holy one!' Sthuna then repeatedly said unto him, 'I am pleased\r\nwith thee!' Indeed, beholding that prince return to him without guile,\r\nSthuna told Sikhandin everything that had happened. Indeed, the Yaksha\r\nsaid, 'O son of a king, for thee I have been cursed by Vaisravana. Go\r\nnow, and live happily amongst men as thou choosest. Thy coming here and\r\nthe arrival of Pulastya's son were, I think, both ordained from\r\nbeforehand. All this was incapable of being prevented!'\r\n\r\n\"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the Kaksha, Sthuna, Sikhandin, O\r\nBharata, came to his city, filled with great joy. And he worshipped with\r\ndiverse scents and garlands of flower and costly presents persons of the\r\nregenerate class, deities, big trees and crossways. And Drupada, the\r\nruler of the Panchalas, along with his son Sikhandin whose wishes had\r\nbeen crowned with success, and with also his kinsmen, became exceedingly\r\nglad. And the king then, O bull of Kuru's race, gave his son, Sikhandin,\r\nwho had been a woman, as a pupil, O monarch, to Drona. An prince\r\nSikhandin obtained, along with yourselves, the whole science of arms with\r\nits four divisions. And (his brother) Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race\r\nalso obtained the same. Indeed, all this way represented unto me, O sire,\r\nby the spies, disguised as idiots and as persons without the senses of\r\nvision, and hearing whom I had set upon Drupada. It is thus, O king, that\r\nthat best of Rathas. Sikhandin, the son of Drupada, having first been\r\nborn a female, subsequently became a person of the other sex. And it was\r\nthe eldest daughter of the ruler of Kasi, celebrated by the name of Amva,\r\nwho was, O bull of Bharata's race, born in Drupada's line as Sikhandin.\r\nIf he approacheth me bow in hand and desirous of fight, I will not look\r\nat him even for a moment nor smite him, O thou of unfading glory!\r\nEven--this is my vow, known over all the world, viz., that I will not, O\r\nson of Kuru's race, shoot weapons upon a woman, or one that was a woman\r\nbefore or one bearing a feminine name, or one whose form resembleth a\r\nwoman's. I will not, for this reason, slay Sikhandin. Even this, O sire,\r\nis the story that I have ascertained of Sikhandin's birth. I will not,\r\ntherefore, slay him in battle even if he approacheth me weapon in hand.\r\nIf Bhishma slayeth a woman the righteous will all speak ill of him. I\r\nwill not, therefore, slay him even if I behold him waiting for battle!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, king Duryodhana of\r\nKuru's race, reflecting for a moment, thought even that behaviour was\r\nproper for Bhishma.'\""

This, indeed, is\r\nworthy of thee. Listen, O king, as I tell thee the utmost limit of my\r\npower in battle, or of the energy of my weapons, or of the might of my\r\narms, O thou of mighty arms! As regards ordinary combatants, one should\r\nfight with them artlessly. As regards those that are possessed of powers\r\nof deception, one should fight with them aided by the ways of deception.\r\nEven this is what hath been laid down in respect of the duties of\r\nwarriors. I can annihilate the Pandava army, O blessed monarch, taking\r\nevery morning ten thousand (ordinary) warriors and one thousand\r\ncar-warriors as my share from day to day. Cased in mail and always\r\nexerting myself actively, I can, O Bharata, annihilate this large force,\r\naccording to this arrangement as regards both number and time. If,\r\nhowever, stationed in battle, I shoot my great weapons that slay hundreds\r\nand thousands at a time, then I can, O Bharata, finish the slaughter in a\r\nmonth.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, king Duryodhana then\r\nasked Drona, O monarch, that foremost one of Angira's race, saying, 'O\r\npreceptor, in what time canst thou annihilate the troops of Pandu's son?'\r\nThus addressed by him, Drona said smilingly, 'I am old, O mighty-armed\r\none! My energy and activity have both become weak. With the fire of my\r\nweapons I can consume the army of the Pandavas, like Santanu's son\r\nBhishma, I think, in a month's time.' Even this is the limit of my power,\r\neven this is the limit of my strength.' Then Saradwat's son Kripa said\r\nthat he could annihilate the foe in two month's time. Dron's son\r\n(Aswatthaman) pledged himself to annihilate the Pandava army in ten\r\nnights, Karna, however, acquainted as he was with weapons of high\r\nefficacy, pledged himself to achieve that feat in five days.

And there (in\r\nthe rear) were the waggons, stalls, uniforms, vehicles and draft animals.\r\nThere also were thousands of elephants and horses by tens of thousands.\r\nAnd taking all the invalids and women, and all that were emaciated and\r\nweak, and all the animals carrying his treasures, and all his granaries,\r\nwith the aid of his elephant-divisions, Yudhishthira marched slowly. And\r\nhe was followed by Sauchitti, who steadily adhered to truth and was\r\ninvincible in battle, and Srenimat, and Vasudeva and Vibhu, the son of\r\nthe ruler of Kasi, with twenty thousand cars, and hundred million steeds\r\nof high mettle, each bearing scores of bells on its limbs, and twenty\r\nthousand smiting elephants with tusks as long as plough-shares, all of\r\ngood breed and divided temples and all resembling moving masses of\r\nclouds. Indeed, these usually walked behind those monarchs. Besides\r\nthese, O Bharata, the elephants that Yudhishthira had in his seven\r\nAkshauhinis, numbering seventy thousand with humour trickling down their\r\ntrunks and from their mouths, and resembling (on that account) showering\r\nclouds, also followed the king, like moving hills.\r\n\r\n'Thus was arrayed that terrible force of the intelligent son of Kunti.\r\nAnd relying upon that force he battled with Suyodhana, the son of\r\nDhritarashtra. Besides those already named, other men by hundreds and\r\nthousands and tens of thousands, in divisions numbering by thousands,\r\nfollowed (the Pandava army), roaring loudly. And the warriors by\r\nthousands and ten thousands, filled with joy, beat their drums by\r\nthousands and blew conchs by tens of thousands!'\"\r\n\r\nThe End of Udyoga Parva\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1. i.e., passage of the sun from the winter to the summer solstice.\r\n\r\n2. Divination was practised by reference to the stars in the night.\r\n\r\n3. The question that Dhritarashtra asks is easy enough. The Rishi having\r\napplauded knowledge and its efficacy in procuring emancipation, the king\r\nasks, if knowledge is of such efficacy, what then is the value of Karma\r\nor acts, i.e. prayers and sacrifices as ordained in the Vedas? Ijyaya is\r\nthe instrumental form of Ijya, meaning sacrifices, religious rites, and\r\nceremonies. Parartham is explained by Nilakantha to mean\r\nMokshaprapakatwam, i.e., capacity to lead to emancipation. It should be\r\nnoted here that the Hindu idea of emancipation is not bliss enjoyed by a\r\nconscious Self, but freedom from the obligation of re-birth and Karma.\r\nMere Karma, as such, implies pain and misery and the Supreme Soul\r\n(Para-Brahman) is without action and attributes. Although other kinds of\r\nsalvation are spoken of in other systems of philosophy, the emancipation\r\nthat forms the subject of these queries and answers, is freedom from this\r\nKarma.\r\n\r\n4. The Rishi answers,--Yes, Karma or action does, indeed, lead to the\r\nemancipate state. In the regions, of which thou speakest, there are both\r\nbliss and emancipation (Arthajata) is explained by Nilakantha to mean\r\nBhoja-mokshakhya-prayojana samanyam. The second line is elliptical, the\r\nconstruction being Paratma aniha (san) param ayati; (anyatha-tu) margena\r\nmargan nihatya param (prayati). Paratma is explained by Nilakantha, to\r\nmean one who regards the material body to be Self. In the succeeding\r\nSlokas the Rishi uses the word dehin which, in this connection, is the\r\nsame as dehabhimanin. The Rishi's answer is,--The materialist, by\r\nrenouncing desire, attaineth to the state of the Supreme Soul, i.e.,\r\nemancipation. The sense seems to be that by renouncing desire, both\r\nactions and attributes are lost. The state, therefore, of such a soul is\r\none of inaction, or perfect quietude and the absence of attributes, which\r\nis exactly the nature of the Supreme Soul. If, again, emancipation be\r\nsought without extinguishing desire, i.e., by the aid of work (prayers\r\nand sacrifices), it is to be attained \"by extinguishing path by a path,\"\r\ni.e., the seeker is to proceed along a definite or prescribed or ordained\r\nroute, taking care that the portions of the route he once passes over may\r\nnot have to be re-trodden by him. Action, as explained in a subsequent\r\nSloka, leadeth, it is true to regions of bliss and emancipation, but that\r\nstate is transitory, for when the merit is extinguished, the state that\r\nwas attained in consequence of it, is extinguished, and the person\r\nfalling off, has to recommence action. If, therefore, permanent\r\nemancipation is to be attained, the obligation of re-commencing action\r\nmust be got rid of, i.e., care must be taken that the portions of the\r\nroute once passed over may not have to be re-trodden.\r\n\r\n5. Apparently this question of Dhritarashtra is not connected with what\r\nprecedes. The connection however, is intimate, and the question follows\r\nas a corollary from the Rishi's last answer. The Rishi having said that\r\nthe ordinary soul, by a certain process (i.e., renunciation of desire)\r\nattains to the state of the Supreme Soul, Dhritarashtra infers that vice\r\nversa, it is the Supreme Soul that becomes the ordinary soul, for (as\r\nNilakantha puts it in the phraseology of the Nyaya school) things\r\ndifferent cannot become what they are not and unless things are similar,\r\nthey cannot become of the same nature. Applying this maxim of the Nyaya\r\nit is seen that when the ordinary soul becomes the Supreme Soul, these\r\nare not different, and, therefore, it is the Supreme Soul that becomes\r\nthe ordinary soul. Under this impression Dhritarashtra asks,--Well, if it\r\nis the Supreme Soul that becomes the ordinary soul, who is it that urgeth\r\nthe Supreme Soul to become so? And if all this (universe) be indeed, that\r\nSoul, in consequence of the latter pervading and entering into\r\neverything, then divested of desire as the Supreme Soul is, where is the\r\npossibility of its action (action or work being the direct consequence of\r\ndesire)? If it is answered that the universe is the Deity's lila (mere\r\nsport, as some schools of philosophy assert), then, as every sport is\r\nascribable to some motive of happiness, what can be the happiness of the\r\nDeity, who, as presupposed, is without desire?\r\n\r\n6. The Rishi answers--There is a great objection in admitting the\r\ncomplete or essential identity of things different, i.e., the ordinary\r\nsoul and Supreme Soul being different, their identity cannot be admitted.\r\nAs regards creatures, they flow continually from Anadi-yoga, i.e., the\r\nunion of the Supreme Soul (which in itself is Unconditioned) with the\r\nconditions of space, time etc.; i.e., there is this much of identity,\r\ntherefore between the ordinary and the Supreme Soul, but not a complete\r\nor essential identity. It is also in consequence of this that the\r\nsuperiority of the Supreme Soul is not lost (the opposite theory would be\r\ndestructive of that superiority). The favourite analogy of the thinkers\r\nof this school for explaining the connection of the Supreme Soul with the\r\nuniverse is derived from the connection of Akasa with Ghatakasa, i.e.,\r\nspace absolute and unconditioned and space as confined by the limits of a\r\nvessel. The latter has a name, is moved when the vessel is moved, and is\r\nlimited in space; while space itself, of which the vessel's space forms a\r\npart, is absolute and unconditioned, immovable, and unlimited.\r\n\r\n7. Cars, elephants, horses, infantry, vehicles other than cars, and\r\nwarriors fighting from the backs of camels.\r\n\r\n8. Called also the Badava fire.\r\n\r\n9. The allusion is to the incarnation of Vishnu as the Horse-necked,\r\nNilakantha explains suvarnakhyam Jagat to be Veda prancha i.e., the whole\r\nVedas with all their contents, According to him, the sense of the passage\r\nis that Vishnu in that form swells with his own voice the Vedic notes\r\nchanted by the Brahmanas.\r\n\r\n10. Patauti Jalam sravantiti patalam. Thus Nilakantha.\r\n\r\n11. Literally, one that hath a beautiful or excellent face.\r\n\r\n12. The story of Viswamitra's promotion to the status of a Brahmana is\r\nhighly characteristic. Engaged in a dispute with the Brahmana Rishi\r\nVasishtha, Viswamitra who was a Kshatriya king (the son of Kusika) found,\r\nby bitter experience, that Kshatriya energy and might backed by the whole\r\nscience of arms, availed nothing against a Brahmana's might, for\r\nVasishtha by his ascetic powers created myriads and myriads of fierce\r\ntroops who inflicted a signal defeat on the great Kshatriya king. Baffled\r\nthus, Viswamitra retired to the breast of Himavat and paid court to Siva.\r\nThe great God appeared and Viswamitra begged him for the mastery of the\r\nwhole science of weapons. The god granted his prayer. Viswamitra then\r\ncame back and sought an encounter with Vasishtha, but the latter by the\r\naid only of his Brahmanical (bamboo) stick baffled the fiercest weapons\r\nof Viswamitra, of even celestial efficacy. Humiliated and disgraced,\r\nViswamitra set his heart on becoming a Brahmana. He gave up his kingdom\r\nand retiring into the woods with his queen began to practise to severest\r\nausterities. After the expiration of ten thousand years, the Creator\r\nBrahma appeared before him and addressed him as a royal Rishi. Dispirited\r\nat this, he devoted himself to still severer austerities. At last, at\r\nDharma's command (as here referred to) the great Kshatriya king became a\r\nBrahmana. This, in the Hindu scriptures, is the sole instance of a person\r\nbelonging to a lower order becoming a Brahmana by ascetic austerities.\r\n\r\n13. These articles of cognate origin are clarified butter, milk, and\r\nother things used as libations in sacrifices.\r\n\r\n14. i.e., the subdivisions of the Pranava, the mysterious Mantra, which\r\nis the beginning of everything, were first promulgated here. Nilakantha\r\nsupposes this to refer to the origin of the Vedas, the Upanishads, and\r\nthe various branches of the Srutis and the Smritis.\r\n\r\n15. Small divisions of time.\r\n\r\n16. The limbs that should be 'prominent' or 'elevated' in order to\r\nconstitute an indication of beauty or auspiciousness are variously\r\nmentioned. The general opinion seems to be that these six only, viz., the\r\nback of each palm, the two dorsa, and the two bosoms should be elevated.\r\nAnother opinion would seem to indicate that the two bosoms, the two hips,\r\nand the two eyes should be so. The seven that should be delicate or\r\nslender are unanimously mentioned as the skin, the hair, the teeth, the\r\nfingers of the hands, the fingers of the feet, the waist, and the neck.\r\nThe three that should be deep are the navel, the voice, and the\r\nunderstanding. The five that should be red are the two palms, the two\r\nouter corners of the eyes, the tongue, the nether and the upper-lips, and\r\nthe palate. These five also, are variously given.\r\n\r\n17. The latter half of this Sloka is variously read. The correct reading,\r\nI apprehend, is Niyamanani Santare Hritanyasan Vitastaya, i.e., 'while\r\ntransported across, were taken (down) by the (river) Vitasta'--the latter\r\nbeing one of the five rivers of the Punjab.\r\n\r\n18. The science of arms (Dhanurved) classes arms under four heads, viz.,\r\nMukta, Amukta, Muktamukta, and Yantramukta. A Mukta weapon is one that is\r\nhurled from the hand, as a discus. An Amukta is not hurled from the hand,\r\nas a sword. A Muktamukta is one that is sometimes hurled and sometimes\r\nnot, as a mace. A Yantramukta is one shot from a machine, as an arrow or\r\na ball. All Mukta weapons are Astras, while all Amukta ones are called\r\nsastras.\r\n\r\n19. The thousand-handed Arjuna, called also Kartaviryarjuna, the\r\nvanquisher of Ravana, the chief of Haihaya clan of Kshatriyas having his\r\ncapital at Mahishmati on the banks of the Narmada (Nerbuda), was slain by\r\nRama"
