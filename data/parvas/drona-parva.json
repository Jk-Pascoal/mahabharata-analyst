      "content": "(Dronabhisheka Parva)\r\n\r\nOM! HAVING BOWED down unto Narayan, and unto that most exalted of male\r\nbeings, viz., Nara, and unto the goddess Saraswati also, must the word\r\nJaya be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Janamejaya said, 'Hearing that his sire Devavrata of unrivalled vigour\r\nand sturdiness, and might, energy and prowess, had been slain by\r\nSikhandin, the prince of the Panchalas, what, indeed, O regenerate Rishi,\r\ndid the powerful king Dhritarashtra with eyes bathed in tears do? O\r\nillustrious one, his son (Duryodhana) wished for sovereignty after\r\nvanquishing those mighty bowmen, viz., the sons of Panda, through Bhishma\r\nand Drona and other great car-warriors. Tell me, O thou that hast wealth\r\nof asceticism, all that he, of Kura's race, did after that chief of all\r\nbowmen had been slain.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing that his sire had been slain, king\r\nDhritarashtra of Kura's race filled with anxiety and grief, obtained no\r\npeace of mind. And while he, of Kura's race, was thus continually\r\nbrooding over that sorrow, Gavalgana's son of pure soul once more came to\r\nhim. Then, O monarch, Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, addressed\r\nSanjaya, who had that night come back from the camp to the city called\r\nafter the elephant. With a heart rendered exceedingly cheerless in\r\nconsequence of his having heard of Bhishma's fall, and desirous of the\r\nvictory of his sons, he indulged in these lamentations in great distress.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After having wept for the high-souled Bhishma of\r\nterrible prowess, what, O son, did the Kauravas, urged by fate, next do?\r\nIndeed, when that high-souled and invincible hero was slain, what did the\r\nKauravas do, sunk as they were in an ocean of grief? Indeed, that\r\nswelling and highly efficient host of the high-souled Pandavas, would, O\r\nSanjaya, excite the keenest fears of even the three worlds. Tell me,\r\ntherefore, O Sanjaya, what the (assembled) kings did after Devavrata,\r\nthat bull of Kura's race, had fallen.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, with undivided attention, to me as I\r\nrecite what thy sons did after Devavrata had been killed in battle. When\r\nBhishma, O monarch, of prowess incapable of being baffled, was slain, thy\r\nwarriors as also the Pandavas both reflected by themselves (on the\r\nsituation). Reflecting on the duties of the Kshatriya order, they were\r\nfilled with wonder and joy; but acting according to those duties of their\r\nown order, they all bowed to that high-souled warrior. Then those tigers\r\namong men contrived for Bhishma of immeasurable prowess a bed with a\r\npillow made of straight shafts. And having made arrangements for\r\nBhishma's protection, they addressed one another (in pleasant converse).\r\nThen bidding Ganga's son their farewell and walking round him, and\r\nlooking at one another with eyes red in anger, those Kshatriyas, urged by\r\nfate, once more went out against one another for battle. Then by the\r\nblare of trumpets and the beat of drums, the divisions of thy army as\r\nalso those of the foe, marched out. After the fall of Ganga's son, O\r\nking, when the best part of the day had passed away, yielding to the\r\ninfluence of wrath, with hearts afflicted by fate, and disregarding the\r\nwords, worthy of acceptance, of the high-souled Bhishma, those foremost\r\nones of Bharata's race went out with great speed, armed with weapons. In\r\nconsequence of thy folly and of thy son's and of the slaughter of\r\nSantanu's son, the Kauravas with all the kings seemed to be summoned by\r\nDeath himself. The Kurus, deprived of Devavrata, were filled with great\r\nanxiety, and resembled a herd of goats and sheep without a herdsman, in a\r\nforest abounding with beasts of prey. Indeed, after the fall of that\r\nforemost one of Bharata's race, the Kuru host looked like the firmament\r\ndivested of stars, or like the sky without the atmosphere, or like the\r\nearth with blasted crops, or like an oration disfigured by bad\r\ngrammar,[1] or like the Asura host of old after Vali had been smitten\r\ndown, or like a beautiful damsel deprived of husband,[2] or like a river\r\nwhose waters have been dried up, or like a roe deprived of her mate and\r\nencompassed in the woods by wolves; or like a spacious mountain cave with\r\nits lion killed by a Sarabha.[3] Indeed, O chief of the Bharatas, the\r\nBharata host, on the fall of Ganga's son, became like a frail boat on the\r\nbosom of the ocean, tossed by a tempest blowing from every side.\r\nExceedingly afflicted by the mighty and heroic Pandavas of sure aim, the\r\nKaurava host, with its steeds, car-warriors and elephants much troubled,\r\nbecame exceedingly distressed, helpless, and panic-stricken. And the\r\nfrightened kings and the common soldiers, no longer relying upon one\r\nanother, of that army, deprived of Devavrata, seemed to sink into the\r\nnethermost region of the world. Then the Kauravas remembered Karna, who\r\nindeed, was equal to Devavrata himself. All hearts turned to that\r\nforemost of all wielders of arms, that one resembling a guest resplendent\r\n(with learning and ascetic austerities). And all hearts turned to him, as\r\nthe heart of a man in distress turneth to a friend capable of relieving\r\nthat distress. And, O Bharata, the kings then cried out saying, Karna!\r\nKarna! The son of Radha, our friend, the son of a Suta, that one who is\r\never prepared to lay down his life in battle! Endued with great fame,\r\nKarna, with his followers and friends, did not fight for these ten days.\r\nO, summon him soon!' The mighty-armed hero, in the presence of all the\r\nKshatriyas, during the mention of valiant and mighty car-warriors, was by\r\nBhishma classed as an Ardha-ratha, although that bull among men is equal\r\nto two Maharathas! Even thus was he classed during the counting of Rathas\r\nand Atirathas, he that is the foremost (of all Rathas and Atirathas), he\r\nthat is respected by all heroes, he that would venture to fight even with\r\nYama, Kuvera, Varuna, and Indra. Through anger caused by this, O king, he\r\nhad said unto Ganga's son these words: 'As long as thou livest, O thou of\r\nKuru's race, I will never fight! if thou, however, succeedest in slaying\r\nthe sons of Pandu in great battle, I shall, O Kaurava, with Duryodhana's\r\npermission, retire into the woods. If, on the other hand, thou, O\r\nBhishma, slain by the Pandavas, attainest to heaven, I shall then, on a\r\nsingle car, slay all of them, whom thou regardest as great car-warriors.'\r\nHaving said this, mighty-armed Karna of great fame, with thy son's\r\napproval, did not fight for the first ten days. Bhishma, of great prowess\r\nin battle and of immeasurable might, slew, O Bharata, a very large number\r\nof warriors belonging to Yudhishthira's army. When, however, that hero of\r\nsure aim and great energy was slain, thy sons thought of Karna, like\r\npersons desirous of crossing a river thinking, of a boat. Thy warriors\r\nand thy sons, together with all the kings, cried out, saying, Karna! And\r\nthey all said, 'Even this is the time for the display of his prowess.'\r\nOur hearts are turned to that Karna who derived his knowledge of weapons\r\nfrom Jamadagni's son, and whose prowess is incapable of being resisted!\r\nHe, indeed, O king, is competent to save us from great dangers, like\r\nGovinda always saving the celestials from great dangers.'\r\n\r\n\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto Sanjaya who was thus repeatedly applauding\r\nKarna, Dhritarashtra sighing like a snake, said those words.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, '[I understand] that the hearts of all of you are\r\nturned towards Vikartana's son Karna, and that all of you, saw that son\r\nof Radha, that hero of the Suta caste, ever prepared to lay down his life\r\nin battle. I hope that hero of prowess incapable of being baffled, did\r\nnot falsify the expectations of Duryodhana and his brothers, all of whom\r\nwere then afflicted with grief and fear, and desirous of being relieved\r\nfrom their danger. When Bhishma, that refuge of Kauravas, was slain,\r\ncould Karna, that foremost of bowmen, succeed in filling up the gap\r\ncaused? Filling up that gap, could Karna fill the foe with fear? Could he\r\nalso crown with fruit the hopes, entertained by my sons, of victory?'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Adhiratha's son of the Suta caste, knowing that\r\nBhishma had been slain, became desirous of rescuing, like a brother, thy\r\nson's army from the distress into which it had fallen, and which then\r\nresembled a boat sunk in the fathomless ocean. [Indeed], O king, having\r\nheard that that mighty car-warrior and foremost of men, that hero of\r\nunfading glory, viz., Santanu's son, had been thrown down (from his car),\r\nthat grinder of foes, that foremost of all wielders of bows, viz., Karna,\r\nsoon came (to the field of battle). When the best of car-warriors, viz.,\r\nBhishma, was slain by the foe, Karna speedily came there, desirous of\r\nrescuing the Kuru host which resembled a boat sunk in the ocean, like a\r\nsire desirous of rescuing his children.'\r\n\r\n\"And Karna (addressing the soldiers) said, 'That Bhishma who possessed\r\nfirmness, intelligence, prowess, vigour, truth, self-restraint, and all\r\nthe virtues of a hero, as also celestial weapons, and humidity, and\r\nmodesty, agreeable speech, and freedom from malice, that ever-grateful\r\nBhishma, that slayer of the foes of Brahmanas, in whom were these\r\nattributes as permanently as Lakshmi in the moon, alas, when that\r\nBhishma, that slayer of hostile heroes, hath received his quietus, I\r\nregard all other heroes as already slain. In consequence of the eternal\r\nconnection (of all things) with work, nothing exists in this world that\r\nis imperishable. When Bhisma of high vows hath been slain, who is there\r\nthat would take upon himself to say with certitude that tomorrow's sun\r\nwill rise? When he that was endued with prowess equal to that of the\r\nVasus, he that was born of the energy of the Vasus, when he, that ruler\r\nof the earth, hath once more been united with the Vasus, grieve ye,\r\ntherefore, for your possessions and children for this earth and the\r\nKurus, and this host.'[4]\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Upon the fall of that boon-giving hero of great\r\nmight, that lord of the world, viz., Santanu's son of great energy, and\r\nupon the (consequent) defeat of the Bharatas, Karna, with cheerless heart\r\nand eyes filled with tears, began to console (the Dhartarashtras).\r\nHearing these words of Radha's son, thy sons, O monarch, and thy troops,\r\nbegan to wail aloud and shed copious tears of grief corresponding with\r\nthe loudness of those wails.[5] When, however, the dreadful battle once\r\nmore took place and the Kaurava divisions, urged on by the Kings, once\r\nmore set up loud shouts, that bull among mighty car-warriors, viz.,\r\nKarna, then addressed the great car-warriors (of the Kaurava army) and\r\nsaid words which caused them great delight: In this transient world\r\neverything is continually flitting (towards the jaws of Death). Thinking\r\nof this, I regard everything as ephemeral. When, however, all of you were\r\nhere, how could Bhishma, that bull among the Kurus, immovable as a hill,\r\nbe thrown down from his car? When that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son\r\nof Santanu, hath been overthrown, who even now lieth on the ground like\r\nthe Sun himself dropped (from the firmament), the Kuru kings are scarcely\r\ncompetent to bear Dhananjaya, like trees incapable of bearing the\r\nmountain-wind. I shall, however, now protect, as that high-souled one\r\ndid, this helpless Kuru host of cheerless mien, whose foremost warriors\r\nhave already been slain by the foe. Let this burden now devolve on me. I\r\nsee that this universe is transient, since that foremost of heroes hath\r\nbeen slain in battle. Why shall I then cherish any fear of battle?\r\nCoursing, therefore, on the field I shall despatch those bulls of Kuru's\r\nrace (viz., the Pandavas) to Yama's abode by means of my straight shafts.\r\nRegarding fame as the highest object in the world, I shall slay them in\r\nbattle, or, slain by the foe, shall sleep on the field. Yudhishthira is\r\npossessed of firmness, intelligence, virtue, and might. Vrikodara is\r\nequal to a hundred elephant in prowess, Arjuna is young and is the son of\r\nthe chief of the celestials. The Pandava host, therefore, is not capable\r\nof being easily defeated by the very celestials. That force in which are\r\nthe twins, each resembling Yama himself, that force in which are Satyaki\r\nand the son of Devaki, that force is like the jaws of Death. No coward,\r\napproaching it, can come back with life. The wise oppose swelling ascetic\r\npower with ascetic austerities, so should force be opposed by force.\r\nVerily, my mind is firmly fixed upon opposing the foe and protecting my\r\nown party, O charioteer, I shall today certainly resist the might of the\r\nenemy, and vanquish him by repairing only to the field of battle. I will\r\nnot tolerate this intestine feud. When the troops are broken, he that\r\ncometh (for aiding) in the endeavour to rally is a friend. I shall either\r\nachieve this righteous feat worthy of an honest man, or casting off my\r\nlife shall follow Bhishma. I shall either slay all my foes united\r\ntogether, or slain by them proceed to the regions reserved for heroes. O\r\ncharioteer, I know that even this is what I should do, when women and\r\nchildren cry for help, or when Duryodhana's prowess sustains a check.\r\nTherefore, I shall today conquer the foe. Reckless of my very life in\r\nthis terrible battle, I shall protect the Kurus and slay the sons of\r\nPandu. Slaying in battle all my foes banded together, I shall bestow\r\n(undisputed) sovereignty on Dhritarashtra's son. Let my armour,\r\nbeautiful, made of gold, bright, and radiant with jewels and gems, be\r\ndonned; and my head-gear, of effulgence equal to that of the sun; and my\r\nbows and arrows that resemble fire, poison, or snakes. Let also sixteen\r\nquivers be tied (to my car) at the proper places, and let a number of\r\nexcellent bows be procured. Let also shafts, and darts and heavy maces,\r\nand my conch, variegated with gold, be got ready. Bring also my\r\nvariegated, beautiful, and excellent standard, made of gold, possessed of\r\nthe effulgence of the lotus, and bearing the device of the elephant's\r\ngirth, cleaning it with a delicate cloth, and decking it with excellent\r\ngarlands and a network of wires.[6] O charioteer's son, bring me also,\r\nwith speed, some fleet steeds of the hue of tawny clouds, not lean, and\r\nbathed in water sanctified with mantras, and furnished with trappings of\r\nbright gold. Bring me also, with speed, an excellent car decked with\r\ngarlands of gold, adorned gems, bright as the sun or the moon, furnished\r\nwith every necessary, as also with weapons, and unto which are yoked\r\nexcellent animals. Bring me also a number of excellent bows of great\r\ntoughness, and a number of excellent bow-strings capable of smitting (the\r\nfoe), and some quivers, large and full of shafts and some coats of mail\r\nfor my body. Bring me also, with speed, O hero, every (auspicious)\r\narticle needed for occasions of setting out (for battle), such as vessels\r\nof brass and gold, full of curds. Let garlands of flowers be brought, and\r\nlet them be put on the (proper) limbs of my body. Let drums also be\r\nbeaten for victory! Go, O charioteer, quickly to the spot where the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna), and Vrikodara, and Dharma's son (Yudhishthira),\r\nand the twins, are. Encountering them in battle, either I shall slay\r\nthem, or, being slain by them, my foes, I shall follow Bhishma. Arjuna,\r\nand Vasudeva, and Satyaki, and the Srinjayas, that force, I think, is\r\nincapable of being conquered by the kings. If all-destroying Death\r\nhimself with unremitting vigilance, were to protect Kiritin, still shall\r\nI slay him, encountering him in battle, or repair myself to Yama's abode\r\nby Bhishma's track. Verily, I say, that I will repair into the midst of\r\nthose heroes. Those (kings) that are my allies are not provokers of\r\nintestine feuds, or of weak attachment to me, or of unrighteous souls.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, Riding on an excellent and costly car of great\r\nstrength, with an excellent pole, decked with gold, auspicious, furnished\r\nwith a standard, and unto which were yoked excellent steeds that were\r\nfleet as the wind, Karna proceeded (to battle) for victory. Worshipped by\r\nthe foremost of Kuru car-warriors like Indra by the celestials, that\r\nhigh-souled and fierce bowman, endued with immeasurable energy like the\r\nSun himself, upon his car decked with gold and jewels and gems, furnished\r\nwith an excellent standard, unto which were yoked excellent steeds, and\r\nwhose rattle resembled the roll of the clouds, proceeded, accompanied by\r\na large force, to that field of battle where that bull of Bharata's race\r\n(Bhishma) had paid his debt to nature. Of beautiful person, and endued\r\nwith the splendour of fire, that great bowman and mighty car-warrior,\r\nviz., the son of Adhiratha, then mounted on his own beautiful car\r\npossessed of the effulgence of fire, and shone like the lord of the\r\ncelestials himself riding on his celestial car.'\""

Beholding him who was always an island unto persons sinking in\r\nthe fathomless ocean in their endeavours to cross it, beholding that hero\r\ncovered with arrows that had coursed in a stream as continuous as that of\r\nYamuna, that hero who looked like Mainaka of unbearable energy thrown\r\ndown on the earth by the great Indra, that warrior lying prostrate on the\r\nearth like the Sun dropped down from the firmament, that one who looked\r\nlike the inconceivable Indra himself after his defeat of old by Vritra,\r\nthat depriver of all warriors of their senses, that foremost of all\r\ncombatants, that signal of all bowmen, beholding that hero and bull among\r\nmen, viz., thy sire Bhishma of high vows, that grandsire of the Bharatas\r\nthrown down in battle and lying covered with Arjuna's shafts, on a hero's\r\nbed. Adhiratha's son (Karna) alighted from his car, in great affliction,\r\nfilled with grief, and almost senseless. Afflicted (with sorrow), and\r\nwith eyes troubled with tears, he proceeded on foot. Saluting him with\r\njoined palms, and addressing him reverentially, he said, 'I am Karna!\r\nBlessed be thou! Speak to me, O Bharata, in sacred and auspicious words,\r\nand look at me, opening thy eyes. No man certainly enjoyeth in this world\r\nthe fruits of his pious deeds, since thou, reverend in years and devoted\r\nto virtue, liest slain on the ground. O thou that art the foremost one\r\namongst the Kurus, I do not see that there is any one else among them,\r\nwho is competent (like thee) in filling the treasury, in counsels, in the\r\nmatter of disposing the troops in battle array, and in the use of\r\nweapons, Alas, he that was endued with a righteous understanding, he that\r\nalways protected the Kurus from every danger, alas, he, having slain\r\nnumberless warriors, proceedeth to the region of the Pitris. From this\r\nday, O chief of the Bharatas, the Pandavas, excited with wrath, will\r\nslaughter the Kurus like tigers slaying deer. Today the Kauravas,\r\nacquainted with the force of Gandiva's twang, will regard Savyasachin,\r\nlike the Asuras regarding the wielder of the thunder-bolt, with terror.\r\nToday the noise, resembling that of heaven's thunder, of the arrows shot\r\nfrom Gandiva, will inspire the Kurus and other kings with great terror.\r\nToday, O hero, like a raging conflagration of fierce flames consuming a\r\nforest, the shafts of Kiritin will consume the Dhartarashtras. In those\r\nparts of the forest through which fire and wind march together, they burn\r\nall plants and creepers and trees. Without doubt, Partha is even like a\r\nsurging fire, and, without doubt, O tiger among men, Krishna is like the\r\nwind. Hearing the blare of Panchajanya and the twang of Gandiva all the\r\nKaurava troops, O Bharata, will be filled with fear. O hero, without\r\nthee, the kings will never be able to bear the rattle of the ape-bannered\r\ncar belonging to that grinder of foes, when he will advance (upon them).\r\nWho amongst the kings, save thyself, is competent to battle with that\r\nArjuna whose feats, as described by the wise, are all superhuman?\r\nSuperhuman was the battle that he fought with the high-souled (Mahadeva)\r\nof three eyes. From him he obtained a boon that is unattainable by\r\npersons of unsanctified souls. Delighted in battle, that son of Pandu is\r\nprotected by Madhava. Who is there that is competent to vanquish him who\r\ncould not be vanquished by thee before, although thou, endued with great\r\nenergy, hadst vanquished Rama himself in battle, that fierce destroyer of\r\nthe Kshatriya race, worshipped, besides, by the gods and the Danavas?\r\nIncapable of putting up with that son of Pandu, that foremost of heroes\r\nin battle, even I, with thy permission, am competent to slay, with the\r\nforce of my weapons, that brave and fierce warrior who resembleth a snake\r\nof virulent poison and who slayeth his foes with his glances alone!'\""

All of them are conversant with noble genealogies and with\r\nthe art of smiting; all of them are endued with prowess and intelligence,\r\nall of them are attentive and acquainted with the scriptures, possessed\r\nof wisdom, and unretreating from battle.[8] All, however, cannot be\r\nleaders at the same time. Only one should be selected as leader, in whom\r\nare special merits. All of these regard one another as equals. If one\r\namongst them, therefore, be honoured, others will be dissatisfied, and,\r\nit is evident, will no longer fight for thee from a desire of benefiting\r\nthee. This one, however, is the Preceptor (in arms) of all these\r\nwarriors; is venerable in years, and worthy of respect. Therefore, Drona,\r\nthis foremost of all wielders of weapons, should be made the leader. Who\r\nis there worthy of becoming a leader, when the invincible Drona, that\r\nforemost of persons conversant with Brahma, is here, that one who is\r\nequal to Sukra or Vrihaspati himself? Amongst all the kings in thy army,\r\nO Bharata, there is not a single warrior who will not follow Drona when\r\nthe latter goeth to battle.[9] This Drona is the foremost of all leaders\r\nof forces, the foremost of all wielders of weapons, and the foremost of\r\nall intelligent persons. He is, besides, O king, thy preceptor (in arms).\r\nTherefore, O Duryodhana, make this one the leader of thy forces without\r\ndelay, as the celestials made Kartikeya their leader in battle for\r\nvanquishing the Asuras.'\""

'Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja's\r\nson, having obtained the command, arrayed the troops in order of battle,\r\nand went out with thy sons from desire of fighting the foe. And the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, and the chief of the Kalingas, and thy son Vikarna, clad\r\nin mail, took up their position on the right wing (of Drona). And Sakuni,\r\naccompanied by many foremost of horsemen battling with bright lances and\r\nbelonging to the Gandhara tribe, proceeded, acting as their support. And\r\nKripa, and Kritavarman, and Chitrasena, and Vivinsati headed by\r\nDuhsasana, strove vigorously for protecting the left wing. And the\r\nKamvojas headed by Sudakshina, and the Sakas, and the Yavanas, with\r\nsteeds of great fleetness, proceeded, as the latter's support. And the\r\nMadras, the Trigartas the Amvashthas, the Westerners, the Northerners,\r\nthe Malavas, the Surasenas, the Sudras the Maladas, the Sauviras, the\r\nKaitavas, the Easterners, and the Southerners placing thy son\r\n(Duryodhana) and the Suta's son (Karna) at their head, forming the rear\r\nguard, gladdened warriors of their own army, added to the strength of the\r\n(advancing) force, Vikartana's son Karna proceeded at the head of the\r\nbowmen.[10] And his blazing and large and tall standard bearing the\r\nadvice of the elephant's rope, shone with an effulgence like that of the\r\nSun, gladdening his own divisions. Beholding Karna, none regarded the\r\ncalamity caused by Bhishma's death. And the kings, along with the Kurus,\r\nall became freed from grief. And large numbers of warriors, banded\r\ntogether, said unto one another, 'Beholding Karna on the field, the\r\nPandavas will never be able to stand in battle. Indeed, Karna is quite\r\ncompetent to vanquish in battle the very gods with Vasava at their head.\r\nWhat need be said, therefore, for the sons of Pandu who are destitute of\r\nenergy and prowess? The mighty-armed Bhishma spared the Parthas in\r\nbattle. Karna, however, will slay them in the fight with his keen\r\nshafts.' Speaking unto one another thus and filled with joy, they\r\nproceeded, applauding and worshipping the son of Radha. As regards our\r\narmy, it was arrayed by Drona in the form of a Sakata (vehicle); while\r\nthe array of our illustrious foes, O king, was in the form of a Krauncha\r\n(crane), as disposed, O Bharata, by king Yudhishthira the just in great\r\ncheerfulness. At the head of their array were those two foremost of\r\npersons viz., Vishnu and Dhananjaya, with their banner set up, bearing\r\nthe device of the ape. The hump of the whole army and the refuge of all\r\nbowmen, that banner of Partha, endued with immeasurable energy, as it\r\nfloated in the, sky, seemed to illumine the entire host of the\r\nhigh-souled Yudhishthira. The banner of Partha, possessed of great\r\nintelligence, seemed to resemble the blazing Sun that riseth at the end\r\nof the Yuga for consuming the world. Amongst bowmen, Arjuna is the\r\nforemost; amongst bows, Gandiva is the foremost amongst creature Vasudeva\r\nis the first; and amongst all kinds of discs, Sudarsana is the first.\r\nBearing these four embodiments of energy, that car unto which were yoked\r\nwhite steeds, took up its position in the front of the (hostile) army,\r\nlike the fierce discus upraised (for striking). Thus did those two\r\nforemost of men stand at the very head of their respective forces, viz.,\r\nKarna at the head of thy army, and Dhananjaya at the head of the hostile\r\none. Both excited with wrath, and each desirous of slaying the other,\r\nKarna and Arjuna looked at each other in that battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Then when that mighty car-warrior, viz.. Bharadwaja's son, proceeded to\r\nbattle with great speed, the earth seemed to tremble with loud sounds of\r\nwailing. Then the thick dust, raised by the wind resembling a canopy of\r\ntawny silk, enveloped the sky and the sun. And though the firmament was\r\ncloudless, yet a shower fell of pieces of flesh, bones, and blood. And\r\nvultures and hawks and cranes and Kankas, and crows in thousands, began\r\ncontinually to fall upon the (Kaurava) troops. And jackals yelled aloud;\r\nand many fierce and terrible birds repeatedly wheeled to the left of thy\r\narmy, from desire of eating flesh and drinking blood,[11] and many\r\nblazing meteors, illuminating (the sky), and covering large areas with\r\ntheir tails, fell on the field with loud sound and trembling motion. And\r\nthe wide disc of the sun O monarch, seemed to emit flashes of lightning\r\nwith thundering noise, when commander of the (Kaurava) army set out.\r\nThese and many other portents, fierce and indicating a destruction of\r\nheroes, were seen during the battle. Then commenced the encounter between\r\nthe troops of the Kurus and the Pandavas, desirous of slaying each other.\r\nAnd so loud was the din that it seemed to fill the whole earth. And the\r\nPandavas and the Kauravas, enraged with each other and skilled in\r\nsmiting, began to strike each other with sharp weapons, from desire of\r\nvictory. 'Then that great bowman of blazing effulgence rushed towards the\r\ntroops of the Pandavas with great impetuosity, scattering hundreds of\r\nsharp arrows. Then the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, beholding Drona rush\r\ntowards them, received him, O king, with showers upon showers (in\r\ndistinct sets) of arrows. Agitated and broken by Drona, the large host of\r\nthe Pandavas and the Panchalas broke like rows of cranes by force of the\r\nwind. Invoking into existence many celestial weapons in that battle,\r\nDrona, within a very short time, afflicted the Pandavas and the\r\nSrinjayas. Slaughtered by Drona, like Danavas by Vasava, the Panchalas\r\nheaded by Dhrishtadyumna trembled in that battle. Then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Yajnasena's son (Dhrishtadyumna), that hero acquainted\r\nwith celestial weapons, broke, with his arrowy showers, the division of\r\nDrona in many places. And the mighty son of Prishata baffling with his\r\nown arrowy showers the showers of arrows shot by Drona, caused a great\r\nslaughter among the Kurus. The mighty-armed Drona then, rallying his men\r\nin battle and gathering them together, rushed towards the son of\r\nPrishata. He then shot at Prishata's son a thick shower of arrows, like\r\nMaghavat excited with rage showering his arrows with great force upon the\r\nDanavas, Then the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, shaken by Drona with his\r\nshafts, repeatedly broke like a herd of inferior animals attacked by a\r\nlion. And the mighty Drona coursed through the Pandava force like a\r\ncircle of fire. All this, O king, seemed highly wonderful. Mounted on his\r\nown excellent car which (then) resembled a city coursing through the\r\nskies, which was furnished with every necessary article according to\r\n(military) science, whose banner floated on the air, whose rattle\r\nresounded through the field, whose steeds were (well) urged, and the\r\nstaff of whose standard was bright as crystal, Drona struck terror into\r\nthe hearts of the enemy and caused a great slaughter among them.'\""

Then king Yudhishthira, addressing\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Dhananjaya, said unto them, 'Let the pot-born (Drona)\r\nbe checked, our men surrounding him on all sides with care.' Thus\r\naddressed those mighty car-warriors, viz., Arjuna and Prishata's son,\r\nalong with their followers, all received Drona as the latter came. And\r\nthe Kekaya princes, and Bhimasena, and Subhadra's son and Ghatotkacha and\r\nYudhishthira, and the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and the ruler of the\r\nMatsyas, and the son of Drupada, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, all\r\nfilled with joy, and Dhrishtaketu, and Satyaki, and the wrathful\r\nChitrasena, and the mighty car-warrior, Yuyutsu, and many other kings, O\r\nmonarch, who followed the sons of Pandu, all achieved diverse feats in\r\nkeeping with their lineage and prowess. Beholding then that host\r\nprotected in that battle by those Pandava warriors, Bharadwaja's son,\r\nturning his eyes in wrath, cast his looks upon it. Inflamed with rage,\r\nthat warrior, invincible in battle, consumed, as he stood upon his car,\r\nthe Pandava host like the tempest destroying vast masses of clouds.\r\nRushing on all sides at car-warriors and steeds and foot-soldiers and\r\nelephants, Drona furiously careered over the field like a young man,\r\nthough bearing the weight of years. His red steeds, fleet as the wind,\r\nand of excellent breed, covered with blood, O king, assumed a beautiful\r\nappearance. Beholding that hero of regulated vows, felling them like Yama\r\nhimself inflamed with wrath, the soldiers of Yudhishthira fled away on\r\nall sides. And as some fled away and other rallied, as some looked at him\r\nand others stayed on the field, the noise they made was fierce and\r\nterrible. And that noise causing delight to heroes and enhancing the\r\nfears of the timid, filled the whole sky and the earth. And once more\r\nDrona, uttering his own name in battle, made himself exceedingly fierce,\r\nscattering hundreds of arrows among the foes. Indeed, the mighty Drona,\r\nthough old, yet acting like a young man, careered like Death himself, O\r\nsire, amid the divisions of Pandu's son. That fierce warrior cutting off\r\nheads and arms decked with ornaments, made the terraces of many cars\r\nempty and uttered leonine roars. And in consequence of those joyous\r\nshouts of his, as also of the force of his shafts, the warriors, O lord,\r\n(of the hostile army) trembled like a herd of cows afflicted by cold. And\r\nin consequence of the rattle of his car and the stretching of his\r\nbow-string and the twang of his bow, the whole welkin resounded with a\r\nloud noise. And the shaft., of that hero, coursing in thousands from his\r\nbow, and enveloping all the points of the compass, fell upon the\r\nelephants and steeds and cars and foot-soldiers (of the enemy). Then the\r\nPanchalas and the Pandavas boldly approached Drona, who, armed with his\r\nbow of great force, resembled a fire having weapons for its flames. Then\r\nwith their elephants and foot-soldiers and steeds he began to despatch\r\nthem unto the abode of Yama. And Drona made the earth miry with blood.\r\nScattering his mighty weapons and shooting his shafts thick on every\r\nside, Drona soon so covered all the points of the compass, that nothing\r\ncould be seen except his showers of arrows. And among foot-soldiers and\r\ncars and steeds and elephants nothing could be seen save Drona's arrows.\r\nThe standard of his car was all that could be seen, moving like flashes\r\nof lightning amid the cars.[12] Of soul incapable of being depressed,\r\nDrona then, armed with bow and arrows, afflicted the five princes of\r\nKekaya and the ruler of the Panchalas and then rushed against the\r\ndivision of Yudhishthira. Then Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and the grandson\r\nof Sini, and the sons of Drupada, and the ruler of Kasi, viz., the son of\r\nSaivya, and Sivi himself, cheerfully and with loud roars covered him with\r\ntheir arrows. Shafts in thousands, decked with wings of gold, shot from\r\nDrona's bow, piercing through the bodies of the elephants and the young\r\nhorses of those warriors, entered the earth, their feathers dyed with\r\nblood. The field of battle, strewn with cars and the prostrate forms of\r\nlarge bands of warriors, and of elephants and steeds mangled with shafts,\r\nlooked like the welkin covered with masses of black clouds. Then Drona,\r\ndesirous of the prosperity of thy sons, having thus crushed the divisions\r\nof Satyaki, and Bhima, and Dhananjaya and Subhadra's son and Drupada, and\r\nthe ruler of the Kasi, and having ground many other heroes in battle,\r\nindeed, that high-souled warrior, having achieved these and many other\r\nfeats, and having, O chief of the Kurus, scorched the world like the Sun\r\nhimself as he rises at the end of the Yuga, proceeded hence, O monarch,\r\nto heaven. That hero possessed of golden car, that grinder of hostile\r\nhosts, having achieved mighty feats and slain in thousands the warriors\r\nof the Pandava host in battle, hath at last been himself slain by\r\nDhrishtadyumna. Having, in fact, slain more than two Akshauhinis of brave\r\nand unreturning warriors, that hero endued with intelligence, at last,\r\nattained to the highest state. Indeed, O king, having achieved the most\r\ndifficult feats, he hath, at last, been slain by the Pandavas and the\r\nPanchalas of cruel deeds. When the preceptor was slain in battle, there\r\narose in the welkin, O monarch, a loud uproar of all creatures, as also\r\nof all the troops. Resounding through heaven and earth and the\r\nintermediate space and through the cardinal and the subsidiary\r\ndirections, the loud cry 'O Fie!'--of creatures; was heard. And the gods,\r\nthe Pitris, and they that were his friends, all beheld that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, thus slain. The Pandavas,\r\nhaving won the victory, uttered leonine shouts. And the earth trembled\r\nwith those loud shouts of theirs.'\""

Did his car break (in course of the fight)? Did his bow\r\nbreak while he was striking (the foe)? Or, was Drona careless at the time\r\nwhen he met with his death-blow? How, indeed, O child, could Prishata's\r\nson, (viz., Dhrishtadyumna) the prince of the Panchalas, slay that hero\r\nincapable of being humiliated by enemies, who scattered thick showers of\r\nshafts furnished with wings of gold, and who was endued with great\r\nlightness of hand, that foremost of Brahmanas, who was accomplished in\r\neverything, acquainted with all modes of warfare, capable of shooting his\r\nshafts to a great distance, and self-restrained, who was possessed of\r\ngreat skill in the use of weapons and armed with celestial weapons, that\r\nmighty warrior, of unfading glory, who was always careful, and who\r\nachieved the fiercest feats in battle? It is plain, it seems to me, that\r\ndestiny is superior to exertion, since even brave Drona hath been slain\r\nby the high-souled son of Prishata, that hero in whom were the four kinds\r\nof weapons, alas, thou sayest that that Drona, that preceptor in\r\nbowmanship, is slain. Hearing of the slaughter of that hero who used to\r\nride his bright car covered with tiger skins and adorned with pure gold.\r\nI cannot drive away my grief. Without doubt, O Sanjaya, no one dies of\r\ngrief caused by another's calamity, since, wretch that I am, I am yet\r\nalive although I have heard of Drona's death. Destiny I regard to be all\r\npowerful, exertion is fruitless. Surely, my heart, hard as it is, is made\r\nof adamant, since it breaketh not into a hundred pieces, although I have\r\nheard of Drona's death. He who was waited up-on by Brahmanas and princes\r\ndesirous of instruction in the Vedas and divination and bowmanship, alas,\r\nhow could he be taken away by Death? I cannot brook the overthrow of\r\nDrona which is even like the drying up of the ocean, or the removal of\r\nMeru from its site, or the fall of the Run from the firmament. He was a\r\nrestrainer of the wicked and a protector of the righteous. That scorcher\r\nof foes who hath given up his life for the wretched Duryodhana, upon\r\nwhose prowess rested that hope of victory which my wicked sons\r\nentertained, who was equal to Vrihaspati or Usanas himself in\r\nintelligence, alas, how was he slain? His large steeds of red hue,\r\ncovered with net of gold, fleet as the wind and incapable of being struck\r\nwith any weapon in battle, endued with great strength, neighing\r\ncheerfully, well-trained and of the Sindhu breed, yoked unto his car and\r\ndrawing the vehicle excellently, always preserving in the midst of\r\nbattle, did they become weak and faint? Coolly bearing in battle the roar\r\nof elephants, while those huge creatures trumpeted at the blare of conchs\r\nand the beat of drums, unmoved by the twang of bows and showers of arrows\r\nand other weapons, foreboding the defeat of foes by their very\r\nappearance, never drawing long breaths (in consequence of toil), above\r\nall fatigue and pain, how were those fleet steeds that drew the car of\r\nBharadwaja's son soon over-powered? Even such were the steeds yoked unto\r\nhis golden car. Even such were the steeds yoked thereto by that foremost\r\nof human heroes. Mounted on his own excellent car decked with pure gold,\r\nwhy, O son, could he not cross the sea of the Pandava army? What feat\r\nwere achieved in battle by Bharadwaja's son, that warrior who always drew\r\ntears from other heroes, and upon whose knowledge (of weapons) all the\r\nbowmen of the world rely? Firmly adhering to truth, and endued with great\r\nmight, what, indeed, did Drona do in battle? Who were those car-warriors\r\nthat encountered that achiever of fierce deeds, that foremost of all\r\nwielders of the bow, that first of heroes, who resembled Sakra himself in\r\nheaven? Did the Pandava fly away beholding him of the golden car and of\r\nmighty strength who invoked into existence celestial weapons? Or, did\r\nking Yudhishthira the just, with his younger brothers, and having the\r\nprince of Panchala (Dhrishtadyumna) for his binding chord,[13] attack\r\nDrona, surrounding him with his troops on all sides? Verily, Partha must\r\nhave, with his straight shafts, checked all the other car-warriors, and\r\nthen Prishata's son of sinful deeds must have surrounded Drona. I do not\r\nsee any other warrior, save the fierce Dhrishtadyumna protected by\r\nArjuna, who could have compassed the death of that mighty hero? It seems\r\nthat when those heroes, viz., the Kekayas, the Chedis, the Karushas, the\r\nMatsyas, and the other kings, surrounding the preceptor, pressed him\r\nexceedingly like ants pressing upon a snake, while he was engaged in some\r\ndifficult feat, the wretched Dhrishtadyumna must have slain him then.\r\nThis is what, I think. He who, having studied the four Vedas with their\r\nbranches and the histories forming the fifth (Veda), became the refuge of\r\nthe Brahmanas, as the ocean is of rivers, that scorcher of foes, who\r\nlived both as a Brahmana and as a Kshatriya, alas, how could that\r\nBrahmana, reverend in years, meet with his end at the edge of a weapon?\r\nOf a proud spirit, he was yet often humiliated and had to suffer, pain on\r\nmy account. However undeserving of it, he yet attained at the hands of\r\nKunti's son, the fruit of his own conduct.[14] He, upon whose feats\r\ndepend all wielders of bows in the world, alas, how could that hero,\r\nfirmly adhering to truth and possessed of great skill, be slain by\r\npersons desirous of affluence? Foremost in the world like Sakra himself\r\nin heaven, of great might and great energy, alas, how could he be slain\r\nby the Parthas, like the whale by the smaller fish? He, from whose\r\npresence no warrior desirous of victory could ever escape with life, he\r\nwhom, while alive, these two sounds never left, viz., the sound of the\r\nVedas by those desirous of Vedic lore, and the twang of bows caused by\r\nthose desirous of skill in bowmanship, he who was never cheerless, alas,\r\nthat tiger among men, that hero endued with prosperity and never\r\nvanquished in battle, that warrior of prowess equal to that of the lion\r\nor the elephant, hath been slain. Verily, I cannot bear the idea of his\r\ndeath. How could Prishata's son, in the sight of the foremost of men,\r\nslay in battle that invincible warrior whose might was never humiliated\r\nand whose fame was never tarnished? Who were they that fought in Drona's\r\nvan, protecting him, standing by his side? Who proceeded in his rear and\r\nobtained that end which is so difficult of attainment? Who were those\r\nhigh-souled warriors that protected the right and the left wheels of\r\nDrona? Who were in the van of that hero while he struggled in battle? Who\r\nwere they that, reckless of their lives on that occasion, met with death\r\nwhich stood face to face with them? Who were those heroes that went in\r\nthe last journey in Drona's battle? Did any of those Kshatriyas that were\r\nassigned for Drona's protection, proving false, abandon that hero in\r\nbattle? Was he slain by the foe after such desertion and while alone?\r\nDrona would never, from fear, show his back in battle, however great the\r\ndanger. How then was he slain by the foe? Even in great distress, O\r\nSanjaya, an illustrious person should do this, viz., put forth his\r\nprowess according to the measure of his might. All this was in Drona; O\r\nchild, I am losing my senses. Let this discourse be suspended for a\r\nwhile. After regaining my senses I will once more ask thee, O Sanjaya!'\""

And once more he began to interrogate Gavalgana's son of the Suta\r\ncaste about the incidents, as they occured in the battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, [That Ajatasatru] who, like the risen sun,\r\ndispelleth darkness by his own light; who rusheth against a foe as a\r\nswift and angry elephant with rent temples, incapable of being vanquished\r\nby hostile leaders of herds, rusheth against a rival proceeding with\r\ncheerful face towards a female of the species in rust, O, what warriors\r\n(of my army) resisted that Ajatasatru as he came, for keeping him away\r\nfrom Drona?[15] That hero, that foremost of persons, who hath slain many\r\nbrave warriors (of my army) in battle, that mighty-armed and intelligent\r\nand courageous prince of unbaffled prowess, who, unassisted by any one,\r\ncan consume the entire host of Duryodhana by means of his terrible\r\nglances alone, that slayer by his sight, that one bent on winning\r\nvictory, that bowman, that hero of unfading glory, that self-restrained\r\nmonarch who is revered by the whole world, O, who were those heroes (of\r\nmy army) that surrounded that warrior?[16] That invincible prince, that\r\nbowman of unfading glory, that tiger among men, that son of Kunti, who\r\nadvancing with great celerity came upon Drona, that mighty warrior who\r\nalways achieves grand feats against the foe, that hero of gigantic fame\r\nand great courage, who in strength is equal to ten thousand elephants, O,\r\nwhat brave combatants of my army surrounded that Bhimasena as he rushed\r\nupon my host? When that car-warrior of exceeding energy, viz., Vibhatsu,\r\nlooking like a mass of clouds, came, emitting thunderbolts like the\r\nclouds themselves, shooting showers of arrows like Indra pouring rain,\r\nand making all the points of the compass resound with the slaps of his\r\npalms and the rattle of his car-wheels, when that hero whose bow was like\r\nthe lightning's flash and whose car resembled a cloud having for its\r\nroars the rattle of its wheels (when that hero came) the whizz of whose\r\narrows made him exceedingly fierce, whose wrath resembles an awful cloud,\r\nand who is fleet as the mind or the tempest, who always pierces the foe\r\ndeep into his very vitals, who, armed with shafts, is terrible to look\r\nat, who like Death himself bathes all the points of the compass with\r\nhuman blood in profusion, and who, with fierce uproar and awful visage,\r\nwielding the bow Gandiva incessantly pours on my warriors headed by\r\nDuryodhana shafts whetted on stone and furnished with vultures' feathers,\r\nalas, when that hero of great intelligence came upon you, what became the\r\nstate of your mind? When that warrior having the huge ape on his banner\r\ncame, obstructing the welkin with dense showers of arrows, what became\r\nthat state of your mind at sight of that Partha? Did Arjuna advance upon\r\nyou, slaying your troops with the twang of the Gandiva and achieving\r\nfierce feats on the way? Did Duryodhana take, with his shafts, your\r\nlives, like the tempest destroying gathering masses of clouds or felling\r\nforests of reeds, blowing through them? What man is there that is capable\r\nof bearing in battle the wielder of the Gandiva? Hearing only that he is\r\nstationed at the head of the (hostile) force, the heart of every foe\r\nseems to rend in twain. In that battle in which the troops trembled and\r\neven heroes were struck with fear, who were they that did not desert\r\nDrona, and who were those cowards that abandoned him from fear? Who were\r\nthey that, reckless of their lives met Death himself, standing face to\r\nface with them, in the shape of Dhananjaya, who hath vanquished even\r\nsuperhuman combatants in battle? My troops are incapable of bearing the\r\nimpetus of that warrior having white steeds yoked unto his car and the\r\ntwang of Gandiva, that resembles the roll of the very clouds. That car\r\nwhich has Vishnu himself for its driver and Dhananjaya for its warrior,\r\nthat car I regard to be incapable of being vanquished by the very gods\r\nand the Asuras united together. Delicate, young, and brave, and of a very\r\nhandsome countenance, that son of Pandu who is gifted with intelligence\r\nand skill and wisdom and whose prowess incapable of being baffled in\r\nbattle, when Nakula with loud noise and afflicting all hostile warriors,\r\nrushed at Drona, what heroes (of my army) surrounded him? When Sahadeva\r\nwho resembles an angry snake of virulent poison, when that hero owning\r\nwhite steeds and invincible in battle, observant of laudable vows,\r\nincapable of being baffled in his purposes, gifted with modesty, and\r\nnever vanquished in fight, came upon us, what heroes (of our army)\r\nsurrounded him? That warrior who, having crushed the mighty host of the\r\nSauvira king, took for his wife the beautiful Bhoja maiden of symmetrical\r\nlimbs, that bull among men, viz., Yuyudhana, in whom are always truth and\r\nfirmness and bravery and Brahmacharya, that warrior gifted with great\r\nmight, always practising truth, never cheerless, never vanquished, who in\r\nbattle is equal to Vasudeva and is regarded as his second self, who,\r\nthrough Dhananjaya's instructions, hath become foremost in the use of\r\narrows, and who is equal to Partha himself in weapons, O, what warrior\r\n(of my army) resisted that Satyaki, for keeping him away from Drona? The\r\nforemost hero among the Vrishnis, exceedingly brave among all bowmen,\r\nequal to Rama himself in (knowledge and the use of) weapons and in\r\nprowess and fame, (know, O Sanjaya, that) truth and firmness,\r\nintelligence and heroism, and knowledge of Brahma, and high weapons, are\r\nall in him (Satyaki) of the Satwata race, as the three worlds are in\r\nKesava. What heroes (of my army), approaching that mighty bowman,\r\nSatyaki, possessed of all those accomplishments and incapable of being\r\nresisted by the very gods, surrounded him? The foremost among the\r\nPanchalas, possessed of heroism, high-born and the favourite of all\r\nhigh-born heroes, ever achieving good deeds in battle, viz., Uttamaujas,\r\nthat Prince ever engaged in the welfare of Arjuna, born for only my evil,\r\nequal unto Yama, or Vaisaravana, or Aditya, or Mahendra, or Varuna, that\r\nprince regarded as a mighty car-warrior and prepared to lay down his life\r\nin the thick of battle, O, what heroes (of my army) surrounded him? Who\r\n(amongst my warriors) opposed Dhrishtaketu, that single warrior amongst\r\nthe Chedis who, deserting them, hath embraced the side of the Pandavas,\r\nwhile he rushed upon Drona? Who resisted the heroic Ketumat for keeping\r\nhim away from Drona, the brave Ketumat who slew prince Durjaya while the\r\nlatter had taken shelter in Girivraja? What heroes (of my army)\r\nsurrounded Sikhandin, that tiger among men, who knows the merits and\r\ndemerits (in his own person) of manhood and femininity, that son of\r\nYajnasena, who is always cheerful in battle, that hero who became the\r\ncause of the high-souled Bhishma's death in battle, when he rushed\r\ntowards Drona? That foremost hero of the Vrishni race, that chief of all\r\nbowmen, that brave warrior in whom all accomplishments exist in a greater\r\ndegree than in Dhananajaya himself, in whom are ever weapons and truth\r\nand Brahmacharya, who is equal to Vasudeva in energy and Dhananjaya in\r\nstrength, who in splendour is equal to Aditya and in intelligence to\r\nVrihaspati, viz., the high-souled Abhimanyu, resembling Death himself\r\nwith wide-open mouth, O what heroes (of my army) surrounded him when he\r\nrushed towards Drona? That youth of vigorous understanding, that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, viz., Subhadra's son, O, when he rushed towards Drona,\r\nwhat became the state of your mind? What heroes surrounded those tigers\r\namong men, viz., the sons of Draupadi, when they rushed in battle against\r\nDrona like rivers rushing towards the sea? Those children who, giving up\r\nall (childish) sports for twelve years, and observing excellent vows,\r\nwaited upon Bhishma for the sake of weapons, those children, viz.,\r\nKshatranjaya and Kshatradeva and Kshatravarman and Manada, those heroic\r\nsons of Dhrishtadyumna, O, who resisted them, seeking to keep them away\r\nfrom Drona? He whom the Vrishnis regarded as superior in battle to a\r\nhundred car-warriors, O, who resisted that great bowman, viz., Chekitana,\r\nfor keeping him away from Drona? Those five Kekaya brothers, virtuous and\r\npossessed of prowess, incapable of being baffled, resembling (in hue) the\r\ninsects called Indragopakas, with red coats of mail, red weapons and red\r\nbanners, those heroes that are the maternal cousins of the Pandavas and\r\nthat always wish for victory unto the latter, O, what heroes (of my army)\r\nsurrounded those valiant princes when they rushed towards Drona for\r\nslaying him? That lord of battle, that foremost of bowmen, that hero of\r\nunbaffled aim and great strength, that tiger among men, viz., Yuyutsu,\r\nwhom many wrathful kings battling together for six months at Varanavata\r\nfrom desire of slaying him could not vanquish, and who in battle at\r\nVaranasi overthrew with a broad-headed arrow that mighty car-warrior,\r\nviz., the prince of Kasi, desirous of seizing (at a Swayamvara) a maiden\r\nfor wife, O, what hero (of my army) resisted him? That mighty bowman,\r\nviz., Dhrishtadyumna, who is the chief counsellor of the Pandavas, who is\r\nengaged in doing evil to Duryodhana, who was created for Drona's\r\ndestruction, O, what heroes (of my army) surrounded him when he came\r\ntowards Drona, breaking through all my ranks and consuming all my\r\nwarriors in battle?

Who kept away from Drona the gigantic Ghatotkacha, that\r\nthorn (on the side), of my sons, that warrior who always wishes victory\r\nunto the Pandavas, that heroic Rakshasa, possessed of extensive powers of\r\nillusion, endued with great strength and great prowess, and born of Bhima\r\nin course of a single day, and of whom I entertain very great fears?[17]\r\nWhat, O Srinjaya, can remain unconquered by them for whose sake these and\r\nmany others are prepared to Jay down their lives in battle? How can the\r\nsons of Pritha meet with defeat, they, viz., that have the greatest of\r\nall beings, the wielder of the bow called Sarnga, for their refuge and\r\nbenefactor? Vasudeva is, indeed, the great Master of all the worlds, the\r\nLord of all, and Eternal! Of celestial soul and infinite power, Narayana\r\nis the refuge of men in battle. The wise recite his celestial feats. I\r\nalso will recite them with devotion, for recovering my firmness!'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Hear, O Sanjaya, the celestial feats of Vasudeva,\r\nfeats that Govinda achieved and the like of which no other person hath\r\never been able to achieve. Whilst being brought up, O Sanjaya, in the\r\nfamily of the cowherd (Nanda), that high-souled one, while yet a boy,\r\nmade the might of his arms known to the three worlds. Even then he slew\r\nHayaraja, living in the woods (on the shores) of the Yamuna, who was\r\nequal to (the celestial steed) Uchchaisravas in strength and the wind\r\nitself in speed.[18] In childhood, he also slew with his two bare arms,\r\nthe Danava, in the form of a bull, of terrible deeds, and risen like\r\nDeath himself unto all the kine. Of eyes like the lotus petals, he also\r\nslew the mighty Asuras named Pralamva, and Naraka, and Jambha, and Pitha,\r\nas also Mura, that terror of the celestials. And so also Kansa of mighty\r\nenergy, who was, besides, protected by Jarasandha, was, with all his\r\nfollowers, slain in battle by Krishna aided by his prowess alone.[19]\r\nWith Valadeva as his second, that slayer of foes, viz., Krishna, consumed\r\nin battle, with all his troops, the king of the Surasenas, viz., Sunaman,\r\nof great activity and prowess in battle, the lord of a full Akshauhini,\r\nand the valiant second brother of Kansa, the king of the Bhojas. The\r\nhighly wrathful regenerate Rishi (gratified with the adoration) gave him\r\nboons.[20] Of eyes like the lotus petals, and endued with great bravery,\r\nKrishna, vanquishing all the kings at a self-choice, bore away the\r\ndaughter of the king of the Gandharas. Those angry kings, as if they were\r\nhorses by birth, were yoked unto his nuptial car and were lacerated with\r\nthe whip. The mighty-armed Janardana also caused Jarasandha, the lord of\r\na full Akshauhini of troops, to be slain through the instrumentality of\r\nanother.[21] The mighty Krishna also slew the valiant king of Chedis,\r\nthat leader of kings, as if he were some animal, on the occasion of the\r\nlatter's disputing about the Arghya. Putting forth his prowess, Madhava\r\nhurled unto the sea the Daitya city called Saubha, (moving) in the skies,\r\nprotected by Salwa, and regarded as impregnable. The Angas, the Vangas,\r\nthe Kalingas, the Magadhas, the Kasis, the Kosalas, the Vatsyas, the\r\nGargyas, the Karushas and the Paundras,--all these he vanquished in\r\nbattle. The Avantis, the Southerners, the Mountaineers, the Daserakas,\r\nthe Kasmirakas, the Aurasikas, the Pisachas, the Samudgalas, the\r\nKamvojas, the Vatadhanas, the Cholas, the Pandyas, O Sanjaya, the\r\nTrigartas, the Malavas, the Daradas difficult of being vanquished, the\r\nKhasas arrived from diverse realms, as also the Sakas, and the Yavanas\r\nwith followers, were all vanquished by him of eyes like lotus-petals. In\r\ndays of old, penetrating into the very sea, he vanquished in battle\r\nVaruna himself in those watery depths, surrounded by all kinds of aquatic\r\nanimals. Slaying in battle (the Danava named) Panchajanya living in the\r\ndepths of Patala, Hrishikesa obtained the celestial conch called\r\nPanchajanya. The mighty Kesava, accompanied by Partha, having gratified\r\nAgni at Khandava, obtained his invincible weapon of fire, viz., his\r\ndiscus (called Sudarsana). Riding on Vinata's son and frightening (the\r\ndenizens of) Amaravati, the heroic Krishna brought from Mahendra himself\r\n(the celestial flower called) Parijata. Knowing Krishna's prowess, Sakra\r\nquietly bore that act.[22] We have never heard that there is any one\r\namong the kings who has not been vanquished by Krishna. That exceedingly\r\nwonderful feat also, O Sanjaya, which the lotus-eyed one performed in my\r\ncourt, who else is capable of performing it? And since, humbled by\r\ndevotion, I was suffered to behold Krishna as the Supreme Lord;\r\neverything (about that feat) is well-known to me, myself having witnessed\r\nit with my own eyes, O Sanjaya, the end can never be seen of the\r\n(infinite) achievements of Hrishikesa. of great energy and great\r\nintelligence. Gada, and Samva, and Pradyumna, and Viduratha, and\r\nCharudeshna, and Sarana, and Ulmukha, and Nisatha, and the valiant\r\nJhilivabhru, and Prithu, and Viprithu, and Samika, and Arimejaya,--these\r\nand other mighty Vrishni heroes, accomplished in smiting, will, standing\r\non the field of battle, take up their position in the Pandava host, when\r\nsummoned by that Vrishni hero, viz., the high-souled Kesava. Everything\r\n(on my side) will then be in great danger. Even this is what I think. And\r\nthere where Janardana is, there will be the heroic Rama, equal in\r\nstrength to ten thousand elephants, resembling the Kailasa peak, decked\r\nwith garlands of wild flowers, and armed with the plough. That Vasudeva,\r\nO Sanjaya, whom all the regenerate ones describe as the Father of all,\r\nwill that Vasudeva fight for the sake of the Pandavas? O son, O Sanjaya,\r\nif he puts on his armour for the sake of the Pandavas, there is none\r\namongst us who can be his antagonist. If the Kauravas happen to vanquish\r\nthe Pandavas, he, of the Vrishni race, will then, for the sake of the\r\nlatter, take up his mighty weapon. And that tiger among men, that\r\nmighty-armed one, slaying then all the kings in battle as also the\r\nKauravas, will give away the whole earth to Kunti's son. What car will\r\nadvance in battle against that car which has Hrishikesa for its driver\r\nand Dhananjaya for its warrior? The Kurus cannot, by any means, gain\r\nvictory. Tell me, then everything about how the battle took place. Arjuna\r\nis Kesava's life and Krishna is always victory; in Krishna is always\r\nfame. In all the worlds, Vibhatsu is invincible. In Kesava are infinite\r\nmerits in excess. The foolish Duryodhana, who doth not know Krishna or\r\nKesava, seems, through Destiny, to have Death's noose before him. Alas,\r\nDuryodhana knows not Krishna of Dasarha's race and Arjuna the son of\r\nPandu. These high-souled ones are ancient gods. They are even Nara and\r\nNarayana. On earth they are seen by men as; two separate forms, though in\r\nreality they are both possessed but by one soul. With the mind alone,\r\nthat invincible pair, of world-wide fame, can, if only they wish it,\r\ndestroy this host. Only, in consequence of their humanity they do not\r\nwish it.[23] Like a change of the Yuga, the death of Bhishma, O child,\r\nand the slaughter of the high-souled Drona, overturn the senses. Indeed,\r\nneither by Brahmacharya, nor by the study of the Vedas, nor by\r\n(religious) rites, nor by weapons, can any one prevent death. Hearing of\r\nthe slaughter of Bhishma and Drona, those heroes accomplished in weapons,\r\nrespected by all the worlds, and invincible in battle, why O Sanjaya, do\r\nI yet live? In consequence of the death of Bhishma and Drona, O Sanjaya,\r\nwe will henceforth have to live as dependants on that prosperity\r\nbeholding which in Yudhishthira we had before been so jealous. Indeed,\r\nthis destruction of the Kurus hath come in consequence only of my acts. O\r\nSuta, in killing these that are ripe for destruction, the very straw\r\nbecomes thunderbolt. That prosperity is without end in this; world which\r\nYudhishthira is about to obtain--Yudhishthira through whose wrath both\r\nBhishma and Drona have fallen. In consequence of his very disposition,\r\nhath Righteousness gone over to the side of Yudhishthira, while it is\r\nhostile to my son. Alas, time, so cruel, that hath now come for the\r\ndestruction of all, cannot be overcome. Things calculated in one way, O\r\nson, even by men of intelligence, become otherwise through Destiny. This\r\nis what I think. Therefore, tell me everything that has taken place\r\nduring the progress of this unavoidable and dreadful calamity productive\r\nof the most sorrowful reflection incapable of being crossed over (by\r\nus).'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Yes, as I saw everything with my own eyes, I will\r\ndescribe to thee how Drona fell down, slain by the Pandavas and the\r\nSrinjayas. Having obtained the command of the troops, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja's son, said these words unto thy son in the\r\nmidst of all the troops, 'Inasmuch as, O king, thou hast honoured me with\r\nthe command of the troops immediately after that bull among the Kauravas,\r\nviz., the son of the Ocean-going (Ganga), take thou, O Bharata, the\r\nadequate fruit of that act of thine. What business of thine shall I now\r\nachieve? Ask thou the boon that thou desirest.' Then king Duryodhana\r\nhaving consulted with Karna and Duhsasana and others, said unto the\r\npreceptor, that invincible warrior and foremost of all victors, these\r\nwords, 'If thou wouldst give me a boon, then, seizing that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Yudhishthira, alive, bring him unto me here.' Then\r\nthat preceptor of the Kurus, hearing those words of thy son, returned him\r\nthe following answer, gladdening all the troops therewith, Praised be\r\nKunti's son (Yudhishthira) whose seizing only thou desirest. O thou that\r\nart difficult of being vanquished, thou askest not any other boon (one\r\nfor example) for his slaughter. For what reason, O tiger among men, dost\r\nthou not desire his death? Thou art, without doubt, O Duryodhana, not\r\nignorant of policy. Why, therefore, dost thou not allude to Yudhisthira's\r\ndeath? It is a matter of great wonder that king Yudhisthira, the just,\r\nhath no enemy desirous of his death. Inasmuch as thou wishest him to be\r\nalive, thou (either) seekest to preserve thy race from extinction, or, O\r\nchief of the Bharatas, thou, having vanquished the Pandavas in battle,\r\nart desirous of establishing brotherly relation (with them) by giving\r\nthem their kingdom. Auspicious was the birth of that intelligent prince.\r\nTruly is he called Ajatasatru (the foeless one), for even thou bearest\r\naffection for him.' Thus addressed by Drona, O Bharata, the feeling that\r\nis ever present in thy son's breast suddenly made itself known. Not even\r\npersons like Vrihaspati can conceal the expressions of their countenance.\r\nFor this, thy son, O king, filled with joy, said these words, 'By the\r\nslaughter of Kunti's son in battle, O preceptor, victory cannot be mine.\r\nIf Yudhishthira were slain, Partha then, without doubt, would slay all of\r\nus. All of them, again, cannot be slain by the very gods. He amongst them\r\nthat will, in that case, survive, will exterminate us. Yudhishthira,\r\nhowever, is truthful in his promises. If brought hither (alive),\r\nvanquished once more at dice, the Pandavas will once more go to the\r\nwoods, for they are all obedient to Yudhishthira. It is evident that such\r\na victory will be an enduring one. It is for this that I do not, by any\r\nmeans, desire the slaughter of king Yudhishthira the just.' Ascertaining\r\nthis crooked purpose of Duryodhana, Drona who was conversant with the\r\ntruths of the science of profit and gifted with great intelligence,\r\nreflected a little and gave him the boon circumscribing it in the\r\nfollowing way.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'If the heroic Arjuna do not protect Yudhishthira in battle,\r\nthou mayst think the eldest Pandava as already brought under thy control.\r\nAs regards Partha, the very gods and the Asuras together headed by Indra,\r\ncannot advance against him in battle. It is for this that I dare not do\r\nwhat thou askest me to do. Without doubt, Arjuna is disciple, and I was\r\nhis first preceptor in arms. He is, however, young, endued with great\r\ngood fortune, and excessively intent (on the achievement of his\r\npurposes). He hath obtained, again, many weapons from Indra and Rudra. He\r\nhath besides been provoked by thee. I dare not, therefore, do what thou\r\naskest me. Let Arjuna be removed, by whatsoever means that can be done,\r\nfrom the battle. Upon Partha being withdrawn, thou mayst regard king\r\nYudhishthira as already vanquished. Upon his seizure is victory and not\r\nupon his slaughter, O bull among men! Even by stratagem, can his seizure\r\nbe accomplished. Seizing that king devoted to truth and righteousness, I\r\nwill, without doubt, O monarch, bring him to thy control this very day,\r\nif he stays before me in battle even for a moment, of course, if\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Kunti, that tiger among men, be withdrawn from the\r\nfield. In Phalguni's presence, however, O king, Yudhishthira is incapable\r\nof being taken in battle even by the gods and the Asuras headed by Indra.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'After Drona had promised the king's seizure even\r\nunder these limitations, thy foolish sons regarded Yudhishthira as\r\nalready taken. Thy son (Duryodhana) knew Drona's partiality for the\r\nPandavas. In order to make Drona stick to his promise, therefore, he\r\ndivulged those counsels. Then, O chastiser of foes, the fact of Drona's\r\nhaving promised to seize the (eldest) Pandava was proclaimed by\r\nDuryodhana unto all his troops.'\""

King Yudhishthira the just,\r\nhowever, O Bharata, soon learnt in detail, through his spies, everything\r\nabout the purpose upon which Bharadwaja's son was intent.

Hearing that loud blare of conchs that arose from the camp of the\r\nmighty sons of Pandu, diverse instruments were sounded amongst thy\r\ndivisions also. Then thy divisions as also those of theirs were arrayed\r\nin order of battle. And slowly they advanced against each other from\r\ndesire of battle. Then commenced a battle, that was fierce and that made\r\nthe hairs stand on their ends, between the Pandavas and the Kurus, and\r\nDrona and the Panchalas. The Srinjayas, though struggling vigorously,\r\nwere unable to beat in battle the host of Drona as it was protected by\r\nDrona himself. And so also the mighty car-warriors of thy son, skilled in\r\nsmiting, could not beat the Pandava host, as it was protected by the\r\nDiadem-decked (Arjuna). Protected by Drona and Arjuna, both the hosts\r\nseemed to stand inactive like two blossoming forests in the silence of\r\nthe night. Then he, of the golden car, (viz., Drona) like the Sun himself\r\nof great splendour, crushing the ranks of the Pandavas, careered through\r\nthem at will. And the Pandavas, and the Srinjayas, through fear, regarded\r\nthat single warrior of great activity upon his quickly-moving car as if\r\nmultiplied into many. Shot by him, terrible shafts coursed in all\r\ndirections, frightening, O king, the army of Pandu's son. Indeed, Drona\r\nthen seemed as the Sun himself at mid-day covered by a hundred rays of\r\nlight. And as the Danavas were unable to look at Indra, so there was not\r\none amongst the Pandavas, who. O monarch, was able to look at the angry\r\nson of Bharadwaja in that battle. The valiant son of Bharadwaja then,\r\nhaving confound the (hostile) troops, speedily began to consume the\r\ndivision of Dhrishtadyumna by means of sharp shafts. And covering and\r\nobstructing all the points of the compass by means of his straight\r\nshafts, he began to crush the Pandava force even there, where Prishata's\r\nson was.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Drona, causing a great confusion in the Pandava\r\nhost, careered through it, like a conflagration consuming (a forest of)\r\ntrees. Beholding that angry warrior, owning a golden car, consume their\r\ndivisions like a raging conflagration, the Srinjayas trembled (in fear).\r\nThe twang, in that battle, of the constantly stretched bow of that\r\nwarrior of great activity was heard to resemble the roar of the\r\nthunder.[24] Fierce shafts shot by Drona, endued with great lightness of\r\nhand, began to crush car-warriors and horsemen and elephant-warriors and\r\nfoot soldiers along with elephants and steeds. Showering his arrows as\r\nthe roaring clouds at the close of summer, assisted by the wind, pour\r\nhail-stones, he inspired fear in the hearts of the foe. Coursing (through\r\nthe hostile ranks), O king, and agitating the troops, the mighty Drona\r\nenhanced the unnatural fear entertained by the enemy. The gold-decked\r\nbow, on his quickly-moving car, was repeatedly seen to resemble the\r\nlightning's flash amid a mass of dark clouds. That hero, firm in truth,\r\nendued with wisdom, and always devoted, besides, to righteousness, caused\r\nan awful river of angry current, such as may be seen at the end of the\r\nYuga, to flow there. And that river had its source in the impetuosity of\r\nDrona's wrath, and it was haunted by crowds of carnivorous creatures. And\r\nthe combatants constituted the waves that filled its entire surface. And\r\nheroic warriors constituted the trees on its banks whose roots were\r\nconstantly eaten away by its current. And its waters were constituted by\r\nthe blood that was shed in that battle, and cars constituted its eddies,\r\nand elephants and steeds formed its banks. And costs of mail constituted\r\nits lilies, and the flesh of creatures the mire on its bed. And the fat,\r\nmarrow, and bones (of fallen animals and men) formed the sands on its\r\nbeach, and (fallen) head-gears its froth. And the battle itself that was\r\nfought there constituted the canopy above its surface. And lances\r\nconstituted the fish with which it abounded. And it was inaccessible in\r\nconsequence of the large number of (slain) men, elephants, and steeds\r\n(that fell in it). And the impetus of the shaft shot constituted its\r\ncurrent. And the slain bodies themselves constituted the timber floating\r\non it. And cars constituted its tortoises. And heads constituted the\r\nstones scattered on its banks and bed, and scimitars, its fish in\r\nprofusion. And cars and elephants formed its lakes. And it was decked\r\nwith many adornments. And mighty car-warriors constituted its hundreds of\r\nlittle whirlpools. And the dust of the earth constituted its wavelets.\r\nAnd capable of being easily crossed by those possessed of exceeding\r\nenergy, it was incapable of being crossed by the timid. And heaps of dead\r\nbodies constituted the sand-banks obstructing its navigation. And it was\r\nthe haunt of Kankas and vultures and other birds of prey. And it carried\r\naway thousands of mighty-car-warriors to the abode of Yama. And long\r\nspears constituted the snakes that infested it in profusion. And the\r\nliving combatants constituted the fowls sporting on its waters.[25] Torn\r\numbrellas constituted its large swans. Diadems formed the (smaller) birds\r\nthat adorned it. Wheels constituted its turtles, and maces its\r\nalligators, and arrows its smaller fish. And it was the resort of\r\nfrightful swarms of crows and vultures and jackals. And that river, O\r\nbest of kings, bore away in hundreds, to the region of the Pitris, the\r\ncreatures that were slain by Drona in battle. Obstructed by hundreds of\r\nbodies (floating on it), the hair (of slain warriors and animals)\r\nconstituted its moss and weeds. Even such was the river, enhancing the\r\nfears of the timid, that Drona caused to flow there.[26]\r\n\r\n\"And when Drona was thus grinding the hostile army hither and thither,\r\nthe Pandava warriors headed by Yudhishthira rushed at that mighty\r\ncar-warrior from all sides. Then seeing them thus rushing (towards\r\nDrona), brave combatants of thy army, possessed of unyielding prowess,\r\nrushed from every side. And the battle that thereupon ensued made the\r\nhair stand on end. Sakuni, full of a hundred kinds of deceit, rushed\r\ntowards Sahadeva, and pierced the latter's charioteer, and standard, and\r\ncar, with many keen-pointed shafts. Sahadeva, however, without being much\r\nexcited, cutting off Sauvala's standard and bow and car-driver and car,\r\nwith sharp arrows, pierced Sauvala himself with sixty shafts. Thereupon,\r\nSuvala's son, taking up mace, jumped down from his excellent car, and\r\nwith that mace, O king, he felled Sahadeva's driver from the latter's\r\ncar. Then these two heroic and mighty warriors, O monarch, both deprived\r\nof car, and both armed with mace, sported in battle like two crests of\r\nhills. Drona, having pierced the ruler of the Panchalas with ten shafts,\r\nwas, in return, pierced by the latter with many shafts. And the latter\r\nwas again pierced by Drona with a larger number of shafts. Bhimasena\r\npierced Vivinsati with sharp arrows. The latter, however, thus pierced,\r\ntrembled not, which seemed to be highly wonderful. Vivinsati then, O\r\nmonarch, suddenly deprived Bhimasena of his steeds and standard and bow.\r\nAnd thereupon all the troops worshipped him for that feat. The heroic\r\nBhimasena, however, brooked not that exhibition of prowess by his enemy\r\nin battle. With his mace, therefore, he slew the well-trained steeds of\r\nVivinsati. Then the mighty Vivinsati, taking up a shield (and sword)\r\njumped down from that car whose steeds had been slain, and rushed against\r\nBhimasena like an infuriated elephant rushing against an infuriated\r\ncompeer. The heroic Salya, laughing the while, pierced, as if in\r\ndalliance, his own dear nephew, Nakula. with many shafts for angering\r\nhim. The valiant Nakula, however, cutting off his uncle's steeds and\r\numbrella and standard and charioteer and bow in that battle, blew his\r\nconch. Dhrishtaketu, engaged with Kripa, cut off diverse kinds of arrows\r\nshot at him by the latter, and then pierced Kripa, with seventy arrows.\r\nAnd then he cut off the device of Kripa's standard with three arrows.\r\nKripa, however, began to oppose him with a thick shower of arrows. And\r\nresisting him in this way, the Brahmana fought on with Dhrishtaketu.\r\nSatyaki, laughing the while, pierced Kritavarman in the centre of the\r\nchest with a long arrow. And piercing him then with seventy arrows, he\r\nonce more pierced him with many others. The Bhoja warrior, however, in\r\nreturn, pierced Satyaki with seventy arrows of keen points. Like the\r\nswiftly-coursing winds failing to move a mountain, Kritavarman was unable\r\nto move Satyaki or make him tremble. Senapati deeply struck Susarman in\r\nhis vitals. Susarman also struck his antagonist with a lance on the\r\nshoulder-joint. Virata, aided by his Matsya warriors of great energy,\r\nresisted Vikartana's son in that battle. And that feat (of the Matsya\r\nking) seemed highly wonderful. Even this was regarded as an act of great\r\nvalour on the part of the Suta's son, in that, he singly resisted that\r\nwhole force by means of his straight shafts. King Drupada was engaged\r\nwith Bhagadatta. And the battle between those two warriors became\r\nbeautiful to behold. That bull among men, viz., Bhagadatta, pierced king\r\nDrupada and his driver and standard and car with many straight shafts.\r\nThen Drupada, excited with wrath, quickly pierced that mighty car-warrior\r\nin the chest with a straight shaft. Those two foremost of warriors on\r\nearth, viz., Somadatta's son and Sikhandin, both conversant with every\r\nweapon, encountered each other in fierce battle that made all creatures\r\ntremble with fear. The valiant Bhurisravas, O king, covered that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, Yajnasena's son Sikhandin, with a thick shower of arrows.\r\nSikhandin, then O monarch, excited with wrath, pierced Somadatta's son\r\nwith ninety shafts, and caused him, O Bharata, to tremble. Those\r\nRakshasas of fierce deeds, viz., Hidimba's son and Alamvusha, each\r\ndesirous of vanquishing the other, battled most wonderfully. Both capable\r\nof creating a hundred illusions, both swelling with pride, battled with\r\neach other most wonderfully, relying on their powers of illusion, and\r\neach desirous of vanquishing the other. The fierce Chekitana battled with\r\nAnuvinda. They coursed on the field, disappearing at times, and causing\r\ngreat wonder. Lakshmana fought fiercely with Kshatradeva, even as Vishnu,\r\nO monarch, in days of old, with the (Asura) Hiranyaksha. With his fleet\r\nsteeds and upon his car duly equipped, Paurava, O king, roared at\r\nAbhimanyu. Endued with great might, Paurava then rushed at Abhimanyu,\r\ndesirous of battle. Then that chastiser of foes, viz., Abhimanyu fought\r\nfiercely with that foe. Paurava covered Subhadra's son with a thick\r\nshower of arrows. Thereupon, Arjuna's son felled his antagonist's\r\nstandard and umbrella and bow on earth.[27] Then piercing Paurava with\r\nseven arrows, Subhadra's son pierced the latter's driver and steeds with\r\nfive arrows. Gladdening his troops thus, he then repeatedly roared like a\r\nlion. Then Arjuna's son quickly fixed an arrow on his bow-string that was\r\ncertain to take away Paurava's life. Beholding however, that arrow of\r\nfrightful mien fixed on Abhimanyu's bow-string, Haridika's son, with two\r\nshafts, cut off that bow and arrow. Then that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\nviz., Subhadra's son, throwing aside that broken bow, took up a bright\r\nsword and a shield. Whirling with great speed that shield decked with\r\nmany stars, and whirling that sword also, he coursed on the field,\r\nexhibiting his prowess. Whirling them before him, and whirling them on\r\nhigh, now shaking them and now jumping up himself, from the manner of his\r\nhandling those weapons, it seemed that (with him) there is no difference\r\nbetween that offensive and that defensive weapons. Jumping suddenly then\r\nupon the shafts of Paurava's car, he roared aloud. Mounting next upon his\r\ncar, he seized Paurava by the hair, and slaying meanwhile with a kick,\r\nthe latter's driver, he felled his standard with a stroke of his sword.\r\nAnd as regards Paurava himself, Abhimanyu raised him up, like the Garuda\r\nraising a snake from the bottom of the sea agitating the waters.\r\nThereupon, all the kings beheld Paurava (standing helpless) with\r\ndishevelled hair, and looking like an ox deprived of its senses while on\r\nthe point of being slain by a lion. Beholding Paurava thus prostrated,\r\nplaced under the control of Arjuna's son, and dragged helplessly,\r\nJayadratha was unable to brook it. Taking up a sword as also a shield\r\nthat bore the device of a peacock and was decked with a hundred bells of\r\nsmall size suspended in rows, Jayadratha jumped down from his car with a\r\nloud roar. Then Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu), beholding the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, let Paurava alone, and leaping up like a hawk from the latter's\r\ncar, quickly alighted on the earth. The lances and aves and scimitars\r\nhurled by his foes--Arjuna's son cut off by means of his sword or warded\r\noff by his shield. Thus showing unto all the warriors the strength of his\r\nown arms the mighty [and heroic] Abhimanyu, once more upraising his large\r\nand heavy sword as also his shield,[28] proceeded towards\r\nVriddhakshatra's son who was a sworn foe of his (Abhimanyu's) father,\r\nlike a tiger proceeding against an elephant. Approaching they cheerfully\r\nattacked each other with their swords like a tiger and a lion with their\r\nclaws and teeth. And none could notice any difference between those two\r\nlions among men as regards the whirl-strokes, and descent of their swords\r\nand shields.[29] And as regards the descent and the whiz of their swords,\r\nand the warding off of each other's blows, it seemed there was no\r\ndistinction between the two. Coursing, beautifully in outward and inward\r\ntracks, those two illustrious warriors seemed to be like two winged\r\nmountains. Then Jayadratha struck on the shield of the renowned Abhimanyu\r\nwhen the latter stretched his sword for making a pass at him. Then, O\r\nBharata, Jayadratha's large sword sticking into Abhimanyu's shield\r\ncovered with golden plate, broke, as the ruler of the Sindhus attempted\r\nto draw it off forcibly. Seeing his sword broken, Jayadratha hastily\r\nretreated six steps and was seen within a twinkle of the eye to be\r\nmounted on his own car. Then Arjuna's son also, that combat with the\r\nsword being over, ascended his own excellent car. Many kings, then, of\r\nthe Kuru army, uniting together, surrounded him on all sides. The mighty\r\nson of Arjuna, however, eyeing Jayadratha, whirled his sword and shield,\r\nand uttered a loud shout. Having vanquished the ruler of the Sindhus,\r\nSubhadra's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, then began to scorch that\r\ndivision of the Kaurava army like Sun scorching the world. Then in that\r\nbattle Salya hurled at him a fierce dart made wholly of iron, decked with\r\ngold, and resembling a blazing flame of fire. Thereupon, Arjuna's son,\r\njumping up, caught hold of that dart, like Garuda catching a mighty snake\r\nfalling from above. And having seized it thus, Abhimanyu unsheathed his\r\nsword. Witnessing the great activity and might of that warrior of\r\nimmeasurable energy, all the kings together uttered a leonine shout. Then\r\nthat slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Subhadra, hurled with the\r\nmight of his arms at Salya himself that very dart of great effulgence,\r\ndecked with stones of lapis lazuli. Resembling a snake that has recently\r\ncast off its slough, that dart, reaching Salya's car slew the latter's\r\ndriver and felled him from his niche of the vehicle. Then Virata and\r\nDrupada, and Dhristaketu, and Yudhishthira, and Satyaki, and Kekaya, and\r\nBhima, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin, and the twins (Nakula and\r\nSahadeva), and the five sons of Draupadi, all exclaimed, 'Excellent!\r\nExcellent!' And diverse kinds of sounds due to the shooting of arrows,\r\nand many leonine shouts, arose there, gladdening the unretreating son of\r\nArjuna. Thy sons, however, could not brook those indications of the\r\nvictory of their foe. Then all of them suddenly surrounded Subhadra's son\r\nand covered him, O king, with showers of arrows like the clouds pouring\r\nrain on the mountain-breast. Then that slayer of foes, viz., Artayani\r\n(Salya), wishing good of thy sons, and remembering the overthrow of his\r\nown driver, rushed in rage against Subhadra's son.'\""

This battle between the Kurus and the Pandavas, resembling that (of\r\nold) between the gods and the Asuras, will be spoken of as exceedingly\r\nwonderful by all men. I am scarcely gratified by listening to thy\r\nnarrations of this stirring battle. Tell me, therefore, about this combat\r\nbetween Artayani (Salya) and Subhadra's son.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding his driver slain, Salya, upraising a mace made\r\nwholly of iron, jumped down in rage from his excellent car. Bhima, then\r\ntaking up his own huge mace, quickly rushed towards Salya who then\r\nresembled the blazing Yuga-fire or the Destroyer himself armed with his\r\nbludgeon. Subhadra's son also, taking up a prodigious mace resembling the\r\nbolt of heaven, addressed Salya, saying, 'Come, Come!' Bhima, however,\r\nwith much ado, persuaded him to stand aside. The valiant Bhimasena, then,\r\nhaving persuaded Subhadra's son to stand aside, approached Salya in\r\nbattle and stood immovable as a hill. The mighty ruler of Madras also,\r\nbeheld Bhima, and proceeded towards him like a tiger towards an elephant.\r\nThen was heard there the loud blare of trumpets and conchs by thousands\r\nand leonine shouts, and the sound of drums. And loud cries of 'Bravo,\r\nBravo,' arose among hundreds of Pandava and Kaurava warriors rushing\r\ntowards each other. There is none else among all the kings, O Bharata,\r\nsave the ruler of Madras who can venture to bear the might of Bhimasena\r\nin battle; similarly, who else save Vrikodara, in the world, can venture\r\nto bear the impetus of the illustrious Salya's mace in battle? Bound in\r\nhempen strings mixed with wires of gold, the prodigious mace, of Bhima,\r\ncapable of delighting by its beauty all spectators, being grasped by him,\r\nshone, brilliantly. And similarly the mace of Salya, also, who coursed in\r\nbeautiful circles, looked like a blazing flash of lightning. Both of them\r\nroared like bulls, and both coursed in circles. And both Salya and\r\nVrikodara, standing as they did, with their maces slightly bent, looked\r\nlike a couple of horned bulls. Whether as regards coursing in circles or\r\nin whirling and striking with their maces, the combat that took place\r\nbetween those two lions among men was in every way equal. Struck by\r\nBhimasena with his mace, the prodigious mace of Salya, emitting fierce\r\nsparks of fire, soon broke unto fragments. And similarly, Bhimasena's\r\nmace, struck by the foe, looked beautiful like a tree covered fire-flies\r\nduring the season of rains at even-tide. And the mace that the ruler of\r\nMadras hurled in that battle, irradiating the welkin, O Bharata,\r\nfrequently caused sparks of fire (to fly around). Similarly, the mace\r\nhurled by Bhimasena at the foe scorched his antagonist's forces like a\r\nfierce meteor falling down (from the firmament). And both those best of\r\nmaces, striking against each other, resembled sighing she-snakes and\r\ncaused flashes of fire. Like two large tigers attacking each other with\r\ntheir claws, or like two mighty elephants with their tusks, those mighty\r\nwarriors coursed in circles, encountering each other with those two\r\nforemost of maces, and soon covered with blood, those two illustrious\r\nwarriors seemed to resemble a couple of flowering Kinsukas. And the\r\nblows, loud as Indra's thunder, of the maces wielded by those two lions\r\namong men were heard on all sides. Struck by the ruler of Madras with his\r\nmace on both the left and the right side, Bhima moved not in the least,\r\nlike a hill riven by the thunder. Similarly, the mighty ruler of Madras,\r\nstruck by Bhima with his mace, patiently stood still like a hill struck\r\nwith the thunder. Both of them, with upraised maces, endued as they were\r\nwith great impetus, fell upon each other, coursing in shorter circles.\r\nQuickly nearing each other, then by eight steps and falling upon each\r\nother like two elephants, they suddenly struck each other with those\r\nmaces of theirs made entirely or iron. And each of those heroes, in\r\nconsequence of the other's impetuosity and violence being struck with\r\neach other's mace, fell down at the same instant of time like a couple of\r\nIndra's poles. Then the mighty car-warrior Kritavarman quickly approached\r\nSalya who, deprived of his senses, was breathing hard as he lay on the\r\nfield. And beholding him, O king, struck violently with the mace, and\r\nwrithing like a snake, and deprived of his senses in a swoon, the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Kritavarman, taking him upon his car, quickly bore the ruler\r\nof Madras away from the field. Reeling like a drunken man, the heroic\r\nBhima of mighty arms, rising up within the twinkling of an eye, stood\r\nmace in hand. Thy sons then, beholding the ruler of the Madras turn away\r\nfrom the fight, began, O sire, to tremble, along with their elephants,\r\nand foot-soldiers, and cavalry, and cars. Ground then by the Pandavas\r\ndesirous of victory, those warriors of thy army, struck with fear, fled\r\naway in all directions, like masses of clouds driven away by the wind.\r\nAnd those mighty car-warriors, viz., the Pandavas, having vanquished the\r\nDhritarashtras, looked resplendent in that battle. O king, like blazing\r\nfires. And they uttered loud leonine roars, and blew their conchs, elated\r\nwith joy. And they beat their drums, large and small, and cymbals and\r\nother instruments.'\""

Shot by Vrishasena in that\r\nbattle, thousands of arrows coursed in all directions, piercing through\r\nmen and steeds and cars and elephants. Mighty arrows, of blazing\r\neffulgence, shot by him, coursed in thousands, like the rays, O monarch,\r\nof the sun, in the summer season. Afflicted and crushed therewith, O\r\nking, car-warriors and horse-men, suddenly fell down on the earth, like\r\ntrees broken by the wind. The mighty car-warrior Vrishasena, O king,\r\nfelled large bodies of steeds, of cars and of elephants, in that battle,\r\nby thousands. Beholding that single warrior coursing fearlessly on the\r\nfield, all the kings (of the Pandava army) uniting together, surrounded\r\nhim on all sides. Nakula's son, Satanika, rushed at Vrishasena and\r\npierced him with ten arrows capable of penetrating into the vitals. The\r\nson of Karna, however, cutting off his bow, felled then his standard.\r\nThereupon, the other sons of Draupadi, desirous of rescuing that brother\r\nof theirs, rushed at him. And soon they made Karna's son invisible by\r\nmeans of their arrowy showers. Against them thus smiting (the son of\r\nKarna), many car-warriors headed by Drona's son (Aswatthama) rushed. And\r\nthose, O monarch, quickly covered those mighty car-warriors, viz., the\r\nsons of Draupadi, with diverse kinds of arrows like clouds pouring rain\r\non mountain breasts. Thereupon, the Pandavas, from affection for their\r\nsons, quickly encountered those assailants. The battle then that took\r\nplace between thy troops and those of the Pandavas, was exceedingly\r\nfierce and made the hairs stand on their ends, resembling as it did that\r\nbetween the Gods and the Danavas. Even thus did the heroic Kauravas and\r\nthe Pandavas, excited with rage, fight, eyeing one another (furiously)\r\nand having incurred one another's animosity for past offences. The bodies\r\nof those heroes of immeasurable energy then seemed, in consequence of\r\n(the) wrath (that inspired them), to resemble those of Garuda and\r\n(mighty) Nagas battling in the sky. And with Bhima and Karna and Kripa\r\nand Drona and Drona's son and Prishata's son and Satyaki, the field of\r\nbattle looked resplendent like the all-destructive sun that rises at the\r\nend of the Yuga. The battle that took place between those mighty men\r\nengaged with mighty antagonists and all smiting one another was fierce in\r\nthe extreme, resembling that (of yore) between the Danavas and the gods.\r\nThen Yudhishthira's host, uttering a shout, loud as that of the surging\r\nsea, began to slaughter thy troops, the great car-warriors of thy army\r\nhaving fled away. Beholding the (Kaurava) host broken and excessively\r\nmangled by the foe, Drona said, 'Ye heroes, ye need not fly away.' Then\r\nhe (Drona) owning red steeds, excited with wrath and resembling a\r\n(fierce) elephant with four tusks, penetrated into the Pandava host and\r\nrushed against Yudhishthira. Then Yudhishthira pierced the preceptor with\r\nmany whetted arrows equipped with Kanka feathers; Drona, however, cutting\r\noff Yudhishthira's bow, rushed impetuously at him. Then the protector of\r\nYudhishthira's car-wheels, Kumara, the renowned prince of the Panchalas,\r\nreceived the advancing Drona, like the continent receiving the surging\r\nsea. Beholding Drona, that bull among Brahmanas, held in check by Kumara,\r\nloud leonine shouts were heard there with cries of 'Excellent,\r\nExcellent!' Kumara then, in that great battle, excited with rage, pierced\r\nDrona with an arrow in the chest and uttered many leonine shouts. Having\r\nchecked Drona in battle, the mighty Kumara, endued with great lightness\r\nof hand, and above all fatigue, pierced him with many thousands of\r\narrows. Then that bull among men (Drona) slew that protector of\r\nYudhishthira's car-wheels, Kumara, that hero observant of virtuous vows\r\nand accomplished in both mantras and weapons. And then penetrating into\r\nthe midst of the (Pandava) host and careering in all directions, that\r\nbull among men, Bharadwaja's son, became the protector of thy troops. And\r\npiercing Sikhandin with twelve arrows, and Uttamaujas with twenty, and\r\nNakula with five, and Sahadeva with seven, and Yudhishthira with twelve,\r\nand each of the (five) sons of Draupadi with three, and Satyaki with\r\nfive, and the ruler of Matsyas with ten arrows, and agitating the entire\r\nhost in that battle, he rushed against one after another of the foremost\r\nwarriors (of the Pandavas). And then he advanced against Kunti's son,\r\nYudhisthira, from a desire of seizing him. Then Yugandhara, O king,\r\nchecked Bharadwaja's son, that mighty car-warrior, filled with rage and\r\nresembling the very ocean lashed into fury by the tempest. Bharadwaja's\r\nson, however, having pierced Yudhishthira with many straight arrows,\r\nfelled Yugandhara with a broad-headed shaft from his niche in the car.\r\nThen, Virata and Drupada, and the Kaikeya princes, and Satyaki, and Sivi,\r\nand Vyaghradatta, the prince n the Panchalas, and the valiant Singhasena,\r\nthese, and many others, desirous of rescuing Yudhishthira, surrounded\r\nDrona on all sides and impeded his way, scattering countless arrows.\r\nVyaghradatta, the prince of the Panchalas, pierced Drona with fifty\r\nkeen-pointed arrows, at which, O king, the troops uttered loud shouts.\r\nThen Singhasena also, quickly piercing that mighty car-warrior, Drona,\r\nroared aloud in joy, striking terror into the hearts of mighty\r\ncar-warriors; Drona then expanding his eyes and rubbing his bowstring and\r\nproducing loud sound of slaps by his palms, rushed against the latter.\r\nThen the mighty son of Bharadwaja, putting forth his prowess, cut off\r\nwith a couple of broad-headed arrows the heads decked with earrings from\r\nthe trunks of both Singhasena and Vyaghradatta. And afflicting also, with\r\nhis arrowy showers, the other mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, he\r\nstood in front of Yudhishthira's car, like all-destroying Death himself.\r\nThen, O king, loud cries were heard among the warriors of Yudhishthira's\r\narmy to the effect, 'The king is slain,' when Bharadwaja's son, of\r\nregulated vows, thus, stood in his vicinity. And the warriors there all\r\nexclaimed, beholding Drona's prowess, 'Today the royal son of\r\nDhritarashtra will be crowned with success. This very moment Drona having\r\nseized Yudhishthira, will, filled, with joy, assuredly come to us and\r\nDuryodhana's presence. While thy soldiers were indulging in such talks,\r\nKunti's son (Arjuna) quickly came there, filling (the welkin) with the\r\nrattle of his car, and creating, as he came, owing to the carnage he\r\ncaused, a river whose waters were blood, and whose eddies were cars, and\r\nwhich abounded with the bones and bodies of brave warriors and which bore\r\ncreatures away to where the spirits of the departed dwell. And the son of\r\nPandu came there, routing the Kurus, and quickly crossing that river\r\nwhose froth was constituted by showers of arrows and which abounded with\r\nfish in the form of lances and other weapons. And the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna) suddenly came upon Drona's divisions, covering it with a thick\r\nnet-work of arrows and confounding the very sense (of those that followed\r\nDrona). Incessantly placing his arrows on the bow-string and quickly\r\nshooting them, none could notice any lapse of time between these two acts\r\nof the renowned son of Kunti. Neither (four cardinal) directions, nor the\r\nfirmament above, nor the earth, O king, could any longer be\r\ndistinguished, for everything then became one dense mass of arrows.\r\nIndeed, O king, when the wielder of Gandiva caused that thick darkness by\r\nmeans of his arrows, nothing could be seen in that battle. Just then the\r\nsun also set, enveloped with a dusty cloud. Neither friend nor foe could\r\nany longer be distinguished. Then Drona and Duryodhana and others caused\r\nthe withdrawal of their troops. And ascertaining the foe to be inspired\r\nwith fear and unwilling to continue the fight, Vibhatsu also slowly\r\ncaused his troops to be withdrawn. Then the Pandavas and the Srinjayas\r\nand the Panchalas, filled with joy, praised Partha with delightful\r\nspeeches like the Rishis praising the Sun. Having vanquished his foes\r\nthus, Dhananjaya then, filled with joy, retired to his tent, proceeding\r\nin the rear of the whole army, with Kesava as his companion. And\r\nstationed on his beautiful car decked with the costliest specimens of\r\nsapphires and rubies and gold and silver and diamonds and corals and\r\ncrystals, the son of Pandu looked resplendent like the moon in the\r\nfirmament bespangled with stars.'\""

Having withdrawn the\r\ntroops, Drona, in great cheerlessness of mind, beholding Duryodhana, said\r\nthese words in shame: 'I told thee before that when Dhananjaya is by\r\nYudhishthira, he is incapable of being seized in battle by the very gods.\r\nAlthough all of you fell upon him in battle, yet Partha frustrated all\r\nyour attempts. Do not doubt what I say, Krishna and Pandu's son (Arjuna)\r\nare invincible. If, however, Arjuna of white steeds can, by any means, be\r\nwithdrawn (from Yudhishthira's side), then Yudhishthira, O king, shall\r\nsoon come under thy control. Let some one challenging him (Arjuna) in\r\nbattle draw him away to some other part of the field. The son of Kunti\r\nwill not return without vanquishing him. Meanwhile, when Arjuna will not\r\nbe by, O monarch, I will seize king Yudhishthira the just, penetrating\r\nthrough the Pandava host in the very sight of Dhrishtadyumna. Thus, O\r\nmonarch, I will, without doubt, bring Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,\r\nalong with his followers, under control. If that son of Pandu stays even\r\nfor a moment before me in battle, I will bring him a captive from the\r\nfield. That feat will be more advantageous than victory (over the Pandava\r\narmy).'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing those words of Drona, the ruler of the\r\nTrigartas, O monarch, with his brothers, said these words: 'We, O king,\r\nare always humiliated by the wielder of Gandiva! O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, although we have done him no injury, yet he hath always injured us.\r\nRemembering all those diverse instances of humiliation, we burn in wrath\r\nand are never able to sleep at night. By good luck, that Arjuna, armed\r\nwith weapons, will stand before us. That therefore, which is in our heart\r\nand which we strive to accomplish, we are resolved to achieve now, that\r\nviz., which will be agreeable to thee, and which will bring us renown.\r\nTaking him out of the field will slay him. Let the earth today be without\r\nArjuna or let it be without the Trigartas. We truly swear this before\r\nthee. This our vow will never be false.' And Satyaratha and Satyavarman,\r\nO Bharata, and Satyavrata and Satyeshu, and Satyakarman also, having\r\nspoken similarly, those five brothers together, with ten thousand cars,\r\ncame, O king, (before Duryodhana), having taken that oath on the field of\r\nbattle. And the Malavas, and the Tundikeras with thousand cars, and the\r\ntiger among men, Susarman, the ruler of Prasthala, with the Mavellakas,\r\nthe Lalithas, and the Madrakas, accompanied by ten thousand cars and his\r\nbrothers, and with another ten thousand cars from diverse realms came\r\nforward for taking the oath. Then bringing fire, and each making\r\npreparations for igniting one for himself, they took up ropes Kusa grass\r\nand beautiful coats of mail. And equipped in mail, bathed in clarified\r\nbutter, clad in robes of Kusa grass, and with their bow-strings serving\r\nas girdles, those heroes, who had given away hundreds and thousands as\r\npresents to Brahmanas, who had performed many sacrifices, had been\r\nblessed with children, and were deserving of blessed regions hereafter,\r\nwho had nothing more to do in this world, who were deserving of blessed\r\nregions hereafter, who were prepared to lay down their lives in battle,\r\nand who devoted their souls to the attainment of fame and victory, who\r\nwere desirous of soon repairing by fair fight to those regions\r\n(hereafter) that are attainable by means only of sacrifices, with\r\nabundant presents to Brahmanas, and by means also of the rites, the chief\r\namongst which are Brahmacharya and study of the Vedas, those heroes,\r\nhaving each gratified Brahmanas by giving them gold,[30] and kine, and\r\nrobes, and having addressed one another in loving discourse, ignited\r\nthose fires and took that vow in battle. And in the presence of those\r\nfires, firmly resolved, they took that vow. And having made that vow for\r\nthe slaughter of Dhananjaya, they, in the hearing of creatures, very\r\nloudly said, Those regions that are for persons who have never adopted\r\nany vows, are for one who drinketh wine, those that are for him who hath\r\nadulterous connection with his preceptor's wife, those that are for him\r\nwho robbeth the property of a Brahmana, or for him who enjoyeth the\r\nking's grant without satisfying the condition of that grant or for him\r\nwho abandoneth one asking for shelter, or for him who slayeth a candidate\r\nfor his favour, those that are for persons that set fire to houses and\r\nfor those that slay kine, those regions that are for those that injure\r\nothers, those that are for persons harbouring malice against Brahmanas,\r\nthose that are for him who from folly doth not seek the companionship of\r\nhis wife in her season, those also that are for those that seek the\r\ncompanionship of women on the day they have to perform the Sraddha of\r\ntheir ancestors, those that are for persons that injure their own selves,\r\nor for those that misappropriate what is deposited with them from\r\nconfidence or for those that destroy learning, or for those who battle\r\nwith eunuchs, or for those that follow persons that are mean those\r\nregions that are for atheists, or for those that abandon their (sacred)\r\nfires and mothers, and those regions also that are for the sinful, those\r\nshall be ours, if without slaying Dhananjaya we return from the field, or\r\nif, ground by him on the field, we turn back from fear. If, again, we\r\nsucceed in achieving in battle feats the most difficult of accomplishment\r\nin the world, we shalt then, without doubt, obtain the most desirable\r\nregions. Having said these words, O king, those heroes then marched to\r\nbattle, summoning Arjuna towards the southern part of the field. That\r\ntiger among men, and subjugator of hostile cities, Arjuna, thus\r\nchallenged by them, said these words unto king Yudhishthira the Just\r\nwithout any delay: 'Summoned, I never turn back. This is my fixed vow.\r\nThese men, sworn to conquer or die, are summoning me, O king, to great\r\nbattle. This Susarman here, with his brothers, summoneth me to battle. It\r\nbehoveth thee to grant me permission for slaying him, with all his\r\nfollowers. O bull among men, I am unable to brook this challenge. I tell\r\nthee truly, know these foes to be (already) slain in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast heard, O child, in detail, what Drona hath\r\nresolved to accomplish. Act thou in such a way that that resolve of his\r\nmay become futile. Drona is endued with great might. He is a hero,\r\naccomplished in arms, and above fatigue. O mighty car-warrior, even he\r\nhath vowed my seizure.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'This Satyajit, O king, will today become thy protector in\r\nbattle. As long as Satyajit lives, the preceptor will never be able to\r\nattain his desire. If, however, O lord, this tiger among men, Satyajit,\r\nbe slain in battle, thou shouldst not then remain on the field even if\r\nsurrounded by all our warriors.'\r\n\r\n\"'Sanjaya continued, 'King Yudhishthira then gave (Arjuna) the leave (he\r\nsought). And he also embraced Arjuna and eyed him affectionately. And\r\ndiverse were the benedictions that the king uttered on him. Having made\r\nthis arrangement (for Yudhishthira's protection),[31] the mighty Partha\r\nwent out against the Trigartas, like a hungry lion, for assuaging his\r\nhunger upon a herd of deer. Then Duryodhana's troops, filled with joy at\r\nArjuna's absence (from Yudhishthira's side), became furious for the\r\nseizure of Yudhishthira. Then both the hosts, with a great impetuosity,\r\nencountered each other, like the Ganga and the Sarayu in the season of\r\nrains when both streams are swollen with water.'\""

And those tigers among men, beholding the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna) come towards them, were, O sire, filled with\r\ndelight and uttered loud shouts. That noise filled the sky and all the\r\npoints of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary. And because it was an\r\nopen plain covered only with men, it produced no echoes. Ascertaining\r\nthem to be exceedingly delighted, Dhananjaya, with a little smile, said\r\nthese words unto Krishna: 'Behold, O thou that hast Devaki for thy\r\nmother, those Trigarta brothers, who are about to perish in battle, are\r\nfilled with delight at a time when they should weep. Or, this is, without\r\ndoubt, the hour of delight (with them) since they will obtain those\r\nexcellent regions that are unattainable by cowards.' Having said these\r\nwords unto the mighty-armed Hrishikesa, Arjuna came upon the arrayed\r\nranks of the Trigartas in battle, taking up then his conch called\r\nDevadatta decked with gold, he blew it with great force, filling all the\r\npoints of the compass with its blare. Terrified by that blare, that\r\ncar-host of the Samsaptakas stood motionless in battle, as if it was\r\npetrified. And all their animals stood with eyes wide open, ears and\r\nnecks and lips paralysed, and legs motionless. And they passed urine and\r\nvomited blood. Regaining consciousness then, and placing their ranks in\r\nproper order, they shot their arrows all at once at the son of Pandu.\r\nCapable of displaying his prowess with great speed, Arjuna, with five and\r\nten arrows cut off those thousands of arrows before they could reach him.\r\nThey then pierced Arjuna, each with ten arrows. Partha pierced them with\r\nthree arrows. Then each of them, O king, pierced Partha with five arrows.\r\nEndued with great prowess, he pierced each of them in return with two\r\narrows. And, once again, excited with wrath, they quickly poured upon\r\nArjuna and Kesava countless arrows like the clouds pouring upon a lake\r\ntheir incessant showers. Then those thousands of arrows fell upon Arjuna,\r\nlike swarms of bees upon a flowering cluster of trees in the forest. Then\r\ndeeply pierced Arjuna's diadem with thirty shafts, endued with the\r\nstrength of adamant with those shafts equipped with wings of gold fixed\r\non his diadem, Arjuna, as if decked with ornaments of gold, shone like\r\nthe (newly) risen sun. The son of Pandu then, in that battle, with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow, cut off the leathern fence of Suvahu, and covered\r\nSudharman and Sudhanwan, and Suvahu pierced Partha with ten arrows.\r\nPartha, having the excellent ape-device on his banner, pierced all of\r\nthem in return with many arrows, and also cut off, with some broad-headed\r\nshafts, their standards made of gold. And cutting off the bow of\r\nSudhanwan, he slew with his arrows the latter's steeds. And then he cut\r\noff from his trunk the latter's head graced with turban. Upon the fall of\r\nthat hero, his followers were terrified. And stricken with panic, they\r\nall fled away to where Duryodhana's forces were. Then Vasava's son,\r\nfilled with wrath, smote that mighty host with incessant showers of\r\narrows, like the sun destroying darkness by means of his incessant rays.\r\nThen when that host broke and melted away on all sides, and Arjuna was\r\nfilled with wrath, the Trigartas were struck with fear. While being\r\nslaughtered by Partha with his straight shafts, they remained where they\r\nstood, deprived of their senses, like a terrified, herd of deer. Then the\r\nking of the Trigartas, filled with rage, addressed those mighty\r\ncar-warrior, saying, 'Do not fly, ye heroes! It behoveth ye not to be\r\nfrightened. Having, in the sight of all the troops, taken those terrible\r\nsteps, repairing thither, what shall ye say unto the leaders of\r\nDuryodhana's host? Do we not incur ridicule in the world by such a\r\n(cowardly) act in battle? Therefore, stop ye all, and fight according to\r\nyour strength.' Thus addressed, O king, those heroes, repeatedly uttering\r\nloud shouts, blew their conchs, gladdening one another.

They will not give up the\r\nbattle alive. This is what I think. Today thou shalt witness the terrible\r\nmight of my arms as also of my bow. Today I shall slay all these, like\r\nRudra slaying creatures (at the end of the Yuga).' Hearing these words,\r\nthe invincible Krishna smiled, and gladdening him with auspicious\r\nspeeches, conveyed Arjuna to those places whither the latter desired to\r\ngo. While borne in battle by those white steeds, that car looked\r\nexceedingly resplendent like a celestial car borne along the firmament.\r\nAnd like Sakra's car, O king, in the battle between the gods and the\r\nAsuras in days of old, it displayed circular, forward, backward, and\r\ndiverse other kinds of motion. Then the Narayanas, excited with wrath and\r\narmed with diverse weapons, surrounded Dhananjaya, covering him with\r\nshowers of arrows. And, O bull of Bharata's race, they soon made Kunti's\r\nson, Dhananjaya, together with Krishna, entirely invisible in that\r\nbattle. Then Phalguni, excited with wrath, doubled his energy, and\r\nquickly rubbing its string, grasped Gandiva, (firmly) in the battle.\r\nCausing wrinkles to form themselves on his brow, sure indications of\r\nwrath, the son of Pandu blew his prodigious conch, called Devadatta, and\r\nthen he shot the weapon called Tvashtra that is capable of slaying large\r\nbodies of foes together. Thereupon, thousands of separate forms started\r\ninto existence there (of Arjuna himself and of Vasudeva). Confounded by\r\nthose diverse images after the form of Arjuna, the troops began to strike\r\neach other, each regarding the other as Arjuna's self.' 'This is Arjuna!'\r\n'This is Govinda!' 'They are Pandu's son and he is of Yadu's race!'\r\nUttering such exclamations, and deprived of their senses, they slew one\r\nanother in that battle. Deprived of their senses by that mighty weapon,\r\nthey slew one another. Indeed, those warriors (while striking one\r\nanother) looked beautiful like blossoming Kinsukas. Consuming those\r\nthousands of arrows shot by them, that (mighty) weapon despatched those\r\nheroes to Yama's abode. Then Vibhatsu, laughing, crushed with his arrows\r\nthe Lalithya, the Malava, the Mavellaka, and the Trigarta warriors. While\r\nthose Kshatriyas, urged by fate, were thus slaughtered by that hero, they\r\nshot at Partha showers of diverse kinds of arrows. Overwhelmed with those\r\nterrible showers of arrows, neither Arjuna, nor his car, nor Kesava,\r\ncould any longer be seen. Seeing their arrows strike the aim, they\r\nuttered joyous shouts. And regarding the two Krishnas as already slain,\r\nthey joyously waved their garments in the air. And those heroes also blew\r\ntheir conchs and beat their drums and cymbals by thousands, and uttered\r\nmany leonine shouts, O sire! Then Krishna, covered with sweat, and much\r\nweakened, addressed Arjuna, saying, 'Where art thou, O Partha! I do not\r\nsee thee. Art thou alive, O slayer of foes?' Hearing those words of his,\r\nDhananjaya with great speed dispelled, by means of the Vayavya weapon,\r\nthat arrowy downpour shot by his foes. Then the illustrious Vayu (the\r\npresiding deity of that mighty weapon) bore away crowds of Samsaptakas\r\nwith steeds and elephants and cars and weapons, as if these were dry\r\nleaves of trees. Borne away by the wind, O king, they looked highly\r\nbeautiful, like flights of birds, O monarch, flying away from trees. Then\r\nDhananjaya, having afflicted them thus, with great speed struck hundreds\r\nand thousands of them with sharp shafts. And he cut off their heads and\r\nalso hands with weapons in their grasp, by means of his broad-headed\r\narrows. And he felled on the ground, with his shafts, their thighs,\r\nresembling the trunks of elephants. And some were wounded on their backs,\r\narms and eyes. And thus Dhananjaya deprived his foes of diverse limbs,\r\nand cars decked and equipped according to rule, and looking like the\r\nvapour edifices in the welkin, he cut off into fragments, by means of his\r\narrows, their riders and steeds and elephants. And in many places crowds\r\nof cars, whose standards had been cut off, looked like forests of\r\nheadless palmyras. And elephants with excellent weapons, banners, hooks,\r\nand standards fell down like wooded mountains, split with Sakra's\r\nthunder. Graced with tails, looking like those of the yak, and covered\r\nwith coats of mail, and with their entrails and eyes dragged out, steeds\r\nalong with their riders, rolled on the ground, slain by means of Partha's\r\nshafts. No longer holding in their grasp the swords that had served for\r\ntheir nails, with their coats of mail tom, and the joints of their bones\r\nbroken, foot-soldiers with their vital limbs cut open, helplessly laid\r\nthemselves down on the field, slain by means of Arjuna's arrows. And the\r\nfield of battle assumed an awful aspect in consequence of those warriors\r\nslain, or in the course of being slaughtered, falling and fallen,\r\nstanding or in course of being whirled along. And the air was purified of\r\nthe dust that had arisen, by means of the showers of blood (caused by\r\nArjuna's arrows). And the earth, strewn with hundreds of headless trunks,\r\nbecame impassable. And the car of Vibhatsu in that battle shone fiercely\r\nlike the car of Rudra himself, while engaged at the end of the Yuga in\r\ndestroying all creatures. While slaughtered by Partha thus, those\r\nwarriors, with their steeds and cars and elephants in great distress,\r\nceased not to rush against him; though, deprived of life one after\r\nanother, they had to become the guests of Sakra. Then the field of\r\nbattle, O chief of the Bharatas, strewn with mighty car-warriors deprived\r\nof life, looked dreadful like Yama's domains, abounding with the spirits\r\nof the departed creatures. Meanwhile, when Arjuna was furiously engaged\r\n(with the Samsaptakas), Drona, at the head of his forces arrayed for\r\nbattle, rushed against Yudhishthira, and many warriors, accomplished in\r\nsmiting and properly arrayed, followed him, actuated by the desire of\r\nseizing Yudhishthira.

Seeing that Drona\r\nhad arrayed his forces in the form of a Garuda, Yudhishthira disposed his\r\ntroops in counter array in the form of a semi-circle. In the mouth of\r\nthat Garuda was the mighty car-warrior Drona himself. And its head was\r\nformed by king Duryodhana, surrounded by his uterine brothers. And\r\nKritavarman and the illustrious Kripa formed the two eyes of that Garuda.\r\nAnd Bhutasarman, and Kshemasarman, and the valiant Karakaksha, and the\r\nKalingas, the Singhalas, the Easterners, the Sudras, the Abhiras, the\r\nDaserakas, the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas, the Hangsapadas, the\r\nSurasenas, the Daradas, the Madras, and the Kalikeyas, with hundreds and\r\nthousands of elephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers were stationed at\r\nits neck. And Bhurisravah. and Salya, and Somadatta, and Valhika, these\r\nheroes, surrounded by a full Akshauhini, took up their position in the\r\nright wing. And Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Sudakshina, the ruler\r\nof the Kamvojas, stationed themselves in the left wing at the head,\r\nhowever, of Drona's son Aswatthaman. In the back (of that Garuda) were\r\nthe Kalingas, the Amvashthas, the Magadhas, the Paundras, the Madrakas,\r\nthe Gandharas, the Sakunas, the Easterners, the Mountaineers, and the\r\nVasatis. In the tail stood Vikartana's son Karna, with his sons, kinsmen\r\nand friends, and surrounded by a large force raised from diverse realms,\r\nJayadratha, and Bhimaratha, and Sampati, and the Jays, and the Bhojas,\r\nand Bhuminjaya, and Vrisha, and Kratha, and the mighty ruler of the\r\nNishadhas, all accomplished in battle, surrounded by a large host and\r\nkeeping the region of Brahma before their eyes, stood, O king, in the\r\nheart of that array. That array, formed by Drona, in consequence of its\r\nfoot-soldiers, steeds, cars and elephants, seemed to surge like the\r\ntempest-tossed ocean (as it advanced to battle). Warriors, desirous of\r\nbattle, began to start out from the wings and sides of that array, like\r\nroaring clouds charged with lightning rushing from all sides (in the\r\nwelkin) at summer. And in the midst of that army, the ruler of the\r\nPragjyotishas, mounted on his duly equipped elephant, looked resplendent,\r\nO king, like the rising sun. Decked, O monarch, in garlands of flower,\r\nand with a white umbrella held over his head, he looked like the full\r\nmoon when in conjunction with the constellation Krittika. And blind with\r\nthe wine-like exudation, the elephant, looking like a mass of black\r\nantimony, shone like a huge mountain washed by mighty clouds (with their\r\nshowers). And the ruler of the Pragjyotishas was surrounded by many\r\nheroic kings of the hilly countries, armed with diverse weapons, like\r\nSakra himself surrounded by the celestials. Then Yudhishthira, beholding\r\nthat superhuman array incapable of being vanquished by foes in battle,\r\naddressed Prishata's son, saying, 'O lord, O thou that ownest steeds\r\nwhite as pigeons, let such measures be adopted that I may not be taken a\r\nprisoner by the Brahmana.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'O thou of excellent vows, never shalt thou be\r\nplaced under the power of Drona, however much may he strive. Even I shall\r\ncheck Drona today with all his followers. As long as I am alive, O thou\r\nof Kuru's race, it behoveth thee not to feel any anxiety.

Beholding this, that crusher of foes, viz., thy son Durmukha,\r\ndesirous of doing what was agreeable to Drona, began to resist\r\nDhrishtadyumna. Then a terrible and a fierce battle took place, O\r\nBharata, between the brave son of Prishata and thy son, Durmukha. Then\r\nPrishata's son, quickly covering Durmukha, with a shower of arrows,\r\nchecked Bharadwaja's son also with a thick arrowy downpour. Beholding\r\nDrona checked, thy son Durmukha quickly rushed at Prishata's son and\r\nconfounded him with clouds of arrows of diverse kinds. And while the\r\nprince of the Panchalas and that foremost one of Kuru's race were thus\r\nengaged in battle, Drona consumed many sections of Yudhishthira's host.\r\nAs a mass of clouds is dispersed in different directions by the wind,\r\neven so was Yudhisthira's host, in many parts of the field, scattered by\r\nDrona. For only a short while did that battle look like an ordinary\r\ncombat. And then, O king, it became an encounter of infuriated persons in\r\nwhich no consideration was shown for anybody. And the combatants could no\r\nlonger distinguish their own men from the foe. And the battle raged on,\r\nthe warriors being guided by inferences and watch-words. Upon the gems on\r\ntheir headgears, upon their necklaces and other ornaments, and upon their\r\ncoats of mail, rays of light like those of the Sun seemed to fall and\r\nplay. And cars and elephants and steeds, decked with streaming banners,\r\nseemed in that battle to resemble masses of clouds with flocks of cranes\r\nunder them. And men slew men, and steeds of fiery metal slew steeds, and\r\ncar-warriors slew car-warriors and elephants slew elephants. And soon a\r\nfierce and terrible encounter took place between elephants with tall\r\nstandards on their backs and mighty compeers (rushing against them). All\r\nin consequence of those huge creatures rubbing their bodies against those\r\nof hostile compeers and tearing one another (with their tusks), fires\r\nmixed with smoke were generated there by (such) friction of countless\r\ntusks with tusks. Shorn of the standards (on their backs), those\r\nelephants, in consequence of the fires caused by their tusks, looked like\r\nmasses of clouds in the welkin charged with lightning. And the earth,\r\nstrewn with elephants dragging (hostile compeers) and roaring and falling\r\ndown, looked beautiful like the autumnal sky overspread with clouds. And\r\nthe roars of those elephants while they were being slaughtered with\r\nshowers of shafts and lances, sounded like the roll of clouds in the\r\nrainy season. And some huge elephants, wounded with lances and shafts,\r\nbecame panic-stricken. And others amongst those creatures, left the field\r\nwith loud cries.[35] And some elephants there, struck by others with\r\ntheir tusks, uttered fierce yells of distress that resounded like the\r\nroll of the all-destroying clouds at the end of the Yuga. And some,\r\nturned back by huge antagonists, returned to the charge, urged on by\r\nsharp hooks. And crushing hostile ranks, they began to kill all who came\r\nin their way. And elephant-drivers, attacked by elephant-drivers with\r\narrows and lances, fell down from the backs of their beasts, their\r\nweapons and hooks being loosened from their hands. And many elephants,\r\nwithout riders on their backs, wandered hither and thither like clouds\r\ntorn from mightier masses, and then fell down, encountering one another.\r\nAnd some huge elephants, bearing on their backs slain and fallen\r\nwarriors, or those whose weapons had fallen down, wandered in all\r\ndirections singly.[36] And in the midst of that carnage, some elephants\r\nattacked, or in course of being attacked with lances, swords and battle\r\naxes, fell down in course of that awful carnage, uttering sounds of\r\ndistress. And the earth, suddenly struck with the falling bodies, huge as\r\nhills, of those creatures all around trembled and emitted sounds. And\r\nwith those elephants slain along with their riders and lying all about\r\nwith the standards on their backs, the earth looked beautiful as if\r\nstrewn with hills. And the drivers on the backs of many elephants, with\r\ntheir breasts pierced by car-warriors with broad-headed shafts in that\r\nbattle, fell down, their lances and hooks loosened from their grasp. And\r\nsome elephants, struck with long shafts, uttered crane like cries and ran\r\nin all directions, crushing friends and foes by trampling them to death.\r\nAnd covered with countless bodies of elephants and steeds and\r\ncar-warriors, the earth, O king, became miry with flesh and blood. And\r\nlarge cars with wheels and many without wheels, crushed by the points of\r\ntheir tusks, were thrown up by elephants, with the warriors mounted on\r\nthem. Cars were seen deprived of warriors. And riderless steeds and\r\nelephants ran in all directions, afflicted with wounds. And there father\r\nslew his son, and son slew his sire, for the battle that took place was\r\nexceedingly fierce and nothing could be distinguished. Men sank\r\nankle-deep in the gory mire and looked like tall trees whose lower parts\r\nwere swallowed up in a blazing forest-conflagration. And robes and coats\r\nof mail and umbrellas and standards having been dyed with blood,\r\neverything seemed to be bloody on the field. Large bodies of slain\r\nsteeds, of cars, and of men, were again cut into fragments by the rolling\r\nof car-wheels. And that sea of troops having elephants for its current,\r\nand slain men for its floating moss and weeds, and cars for its fierce,\r\neddies, looked terribly grim. Warriors, having steeds and elephants for\r\ntheir large vessels, and desirous of victory as their wealth, plunged\r\ninto that sea, and instead of sinking in it endeavoured to deprive their\r\nenemies of their senses. When all the warriors, each bearing particular\r\nsigns, were covered with arrowy showers, there was none amongst them lost\r\nheart, though all were deprived of their signs. In that fierce and awful\r\nbattle, Drona confounding the senses of his foes, (at last) rushed at\r\nYudhishthira.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Drona, beholding Yudhishthira near him\r\nfearlessly received him with a thick shower of arrows. And there arose a\r\nloud noise among the troops of Yudhishthira's army like what is made by\r\nthe elephants belonging to a herd when their leader is attacked by a\r\nmighty lion. Beholding Drona, the brave Satyajit, of prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, rushed at the Preceptor who was desirous of seizing\r\nYudhishthira. The Preceptor and the Panchala prince, both endued with\r\ngreat might, fought with each other, agitating each other's troops, like\r\nIndra and Vali. Then Satyajit, of prowess incapable of being baffled,\r\ninvoking a mighty weapon, pierced Drona with keen-pointed arrows. And\r\nSatyajit shot at Drona's charioteer five arrows, fatal as snake-poison\r\nand each looking like Death himself. The charioteer, thus struck, became\r\ndeprived of his senses. Then Satyajit quickly Pierced Drona's steeds with\r\nten shafts; and filled with rage, he next pierced each of his Parshni\r\ndrivers with ten shafts. And then he coursed at the head of his troops on\r\nhis car in a circular motion. Excited with wrath, he cut off the standard\r\nof Drona, that crushers of foes Drona then, that chastiser of foes,\r\nbeholding these feats of his foe in battle, mentally resolved to despatch\r\nhim to the other world.[37] The Preceptor, cutting off Satyajit's bow\r\nwith arrow fixed thereon, quickly pierced him with ten arrows capable of\r\npenetrating into the very vitals. Thereupon, the valiant Satyajit,\r\nquickly taking up another bow, struck Drona, O king, with thirty arrows\r\nwinged with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Beholding Drona (thus)\r\nencountered in battle by Satyajit, the Pandayas, O king, shouted in joy\r\nand waved their garments. Then the mighty Vrika, O king, excited with\r\ngreat wrath, pierced Drona in the centre of the chest with sixty arrows.\r\nThat feat seemed highly wonderful., Then that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nDrona, of great impetuosity, covered with the arrowy showers (of his\r\nfoes) opened his eyes wide and mustered all his energy. Then cutting off\r\nthe bows of both Satyajit and Vrika, Drona, with six shafts slew Vrika\r\nwith his charioteer and steeds. Then Satyajit, taking up another bow that\r\nwas tougher, pierced Drona with his steeds, his charioteer, and his\r\nstandard. Thus afflicted in battle by the prince of the Panchalas, Drona\r\ncould not brook that act. For the destruction then of his foe, he quickly\r\nshot his arrows (at him). Drona then covered with incessant showers of\r\narrows his antagonist's steeds and standards as also the handle of his\r\nbow, and both his Parshni drivers. But though his bows were (thus)\r\nrepeatedly cut off, the prince of the Panchalas conversant with the\r\nhighest weapons continued to battle with him of red steeds. Beholding\r\nSatyajit swell with energy in that dreadful combat, Drona cut off that\r\nillustrious warrior's head with a crescent-shaped arrow.[38] Upon the\r\nslaughter of that foremost of combatants, that mighty car-warrior among\r\nthe Panchalas, Yudhishthira, from fear of Drona, fled away, (borne) by\r\nfleet steeds. Then the Panchalas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, the Chedis,\r\nthe Karushas and the Kosalas, seeing Drona, rushed at him, desirous of\r\nrescuing Yudhishthira. The Preceptor, however, that slayer of large\r\nnumbers of foes, desirous of seizing Yudhishthira, began to consume those\r\ndivisions, like fire consuming heaps of cotton. Then Satanika, the\r\nyounger brother of the ruler of the Matsyas, rushed at Drona who was thus\r\nengaged in incessantly destroying those divisions (of the Pandava host).\r\nAnd Satanika, piercing Drona along with his driver and steeds with six\r\nshafts, bright as the rays of the sun and polished by his hands of their\r\nforger, uttered loud shouts. And engaged in a cruel act, and endeavouring\r\nto accomplish what was difficult of attainment, he covered Bharadwaja's\r\nson, that mighty car-warrior with showers of arrows.[39] Then Drona, with\r\nan arrow sharp as razor, quickly cut off from his trunk the head, decked\r\nwith ear-rings of Satanika, shouting at him. Thereupon, the Matsya\r\nwarriors all fled away. Having vanquished the Matsyas, the son of\r\nBharadwaja then defeated the Chedis, the Karushas, the Kaikeyas, the\r\nPanchalas, the Srinjayas. and the Pandus repeatedly. Beholding that hero\r\nof the golden car, excited with rage and consuming their divisions, like\r\na fire consuming a forest, the Srinjayas trembled (with fear). Endued\r\nwith great activity and slaughtering the foe ceaselessly, the twang of\r\nthe bow-string, as he stretched his bow, was heard in all directions.\r\nFierce arrows shot by that warrior endued with great lightness of hand,\r\ncrushed elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers and car-warriors and\r\nelephant-riders. As a mighty mass of roaring clouds in summer with\r\nviolent winds (blowing) poureth a shower of hail-stones, so did Drona\r\npour his arrowy showers and inspired fear in the hearts of his foes. That\r\nmighty hero, that great bowman, that dispeller of the fears of his\r\nfriends, careered in all directions (of the field) agitating the\r\n(hostile) host. The bow, decked with gold, of Drona of immeasurable\r\nenergy, was seen in all directions like the flashes of lightning in the\r\nclouds. The beautiful altar on his banner, as he careered in battle, O\r\nBharata, was seen to resemble a crest or Himavat. The slaughter that\r\nDrona caused among the Pandava troops was very great, resembling that\r\ncaused by Vishnu himself, the adored of both the gods and Asuras, among\r\nthe Daitya host. Heroic, truthful in speech, endued with great wisdom and\r\nmight, and possessed of prowess incapable of being baffled, the\r\nillustrious Drona caused a river to flow there that was fierce and\r\ncapable of striking the timid with fear. Coats of mail formed its waves,\r\nand standards its eddies. And it carried away (as it ran) large numbers\r\nof mortal creatures. And elephants and steeds constituted its great\r\nalligators, and swords formed its fishes. And it was incapable of being\r\neasily crossed over. The bones of brave warriors formed its pebbles, and\r\ndrums and cymbals its tortoises. And shields and armour formed its boats,\r\nand the hair of warriors its floating moss and weeds. And arrows\r\nconstituted its wavelets and bows its current. And the arms of the\r\ncombatants formed its snakes.[40] And that river of fierce current,\r\nrunning over the field of battle, bore away both the Kurus and the\r\nSrinjayas. And the heads of human beings, constituted its stones, and\r\ntheir thighs its fishes. And maces constituted the rafts (by which many\r\nsought to cross it). And head-gears formed the forth that covered its\r\nsurface, and the entrails (of animals) its reptiles. Awful (in mien), it\r\nbore away heroes (to the other world). And blood and flesh constituted\r\nits mire. And elephants formed its crocodiles, and standards, the trees\r\n(on its banks). Thousands of Kshatriyas sank in it. Fierce, clogged\r\n(dead) bodies, and having horse-soldiers and elephant-warriors for its\r\nsharks, it was extremely difficult to cross it. And that river ran\r\ntowards the abode of Yama. And it abounded with Rakshasas and dogs and\r\njackals. And it v as haunted by fierce cannibals all around.\r\n\r\n\"Then many Pandava warriors, headed by Kunti's son, rushing at Drona,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior consuming their divisions like Death himself,\r\nsurrounded him on all sides. Indeed, those brave warriors completely\r\nencompassed Drona who was scorching everything around him like the sun\r\nhimself scorching the world with his rays. Then the kings and the princes\r\nof thy army, with upraised weapons, all rushed for supporting that hero\r\nand great bowman. Then Sikhandin pierced Drona with five straight arrows.\r\nAnd Kshatradharman pierced him with twenty arrows, and Vasudeva with\r\nfive. And Uttamaujas pierced him with three arrows, and Kshatradeva with\r\nfive. And Satyaki pierced him in that battle with a hundred arrows, and\r\nYudhamanyu with eight. And Yudhishthira pierced Drona with a dozen\r\nshafts, and Dhrishtadyumna pierced him with ten, and Chekitana with\r\nthree. Then Drona, of unbaffled aim and resembling an elephant with rent\r\ntemples, getting over the car-division (of the Pandavas), overthrew\r\nDridhasena. Approaching then king Kshema who was battling fearlessly, he\r\nstruck him with nine arrows. Thereupon, Kshema, deprived of life, fell\r\ndown from his car. Getting then into the midst of the (hostile) troops,\r\nhe careered in all directions, protecting others, but himself in no need\r\nof Protection. He then pierced Sikhandin with twelve arrows, and\r\nUttamaujas with twenty. And he despatched Vasudeva with a broad-headed\r\narrow to the abode of Yama. And he pierced Kshemavarman with eighty\r\narrows, and Sudakshina with six and twenty. And he felled Kshatradeva\r\nwith a broad-headed arrow from his niche in the car. And having pierced\r\nYudhamanyu with sixty-four arrows and Satyaki with thirty, Drona, of the\r\ngolden car, quickly approached Yudhishthira. Then Yudhishthira, that best\r\nof kings, quickly fled away from the preceptor, borne by his fleet\r\nsteeds. Then Panchala rushed at Drona. Drona slew the prince, cutting off\r\nhis bow, and felling his steeds and charioteer along with him. Deprived\r\nof life, the prince fell down on the earth from his car, like a luminary\r\nloosened from the firmament. Upon the fall of that illustrious prince of\r\nthe Panchalas, loud cries were heard thereof, 'Slay Drona, Slay Drona!'\r\nThe mighty Drona then began to crush and mangle the Panchalas, the\r\nMatsyas, the Kaikeyas, the Srinjayas, and the Pandavas, all excited with\r\nrage. And supported by the Kurus, Drona, then vanquished Satyaki and\r\nChekitana's son, and Senavindu, and Suvarchas, all these and numerous\r\nother kings. Thy warriors, O king, having obtained the victory in that\r\ngreat battle, slew the Pandavas as they flew away in all directions. And\r\nthe Panchalas, the Kaikeyas and the Matsyas, thus slaughtered on all\r\nsides like the Danavas by Indra, began to tremble (with fear).'\""

Alas, beholding Drona stationed in battle,\r\nlike a, awning tiger, or an elephant with rent temples, ready to lay down\r\nhis life in battle, well-armed, conversant with all modes of fight, that\r\ngreat bowman, that tiger among men, that enhancer of the fear of foes,\r\ngrateful, devoted to truth, ever desirous of benefiting\r\nDuryodhana,--alas, beholding him at the head of his troops, was there no\r\nman that could approach him, with a laudable determination for battle a\r\ndetermination that enhances the renown of Kshatriyas, that mean-spirited\r\npersons can never form, and that is distinctive only of the foremost of\r\npersons? Tell me, O Sanjaya, who were those heroes that approached the\r\nson of Bharadwaja, beholding him at the head of his forces?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the Panchalas, the Pandavas, the Matsyas, the\r\nSrinjayas, the Chedis, the Kalikeyas, thus routed after being broken in\r\nbattle by Drona with his shafts, beholding them thus driven from the\r\nfield by those showers of fleet arrows shot from Drona's, bow, like\r\nvessels sent adrift by the awful waves of the tempest-tossed ocean, the\r\nKauravas with many leonine shouts and with the noise of diverse\r\ninstruments, began to assail the cars and elephants and foot-soldiers (of\r\nthat hostile host) from all sides. And beholding those (fleeting soldiers\r\nof the Pandavas) king Duryodhana, stationed in the midst of his own\r\nforces and encompassed by his own relatives and kinsmen, filled with joy,\r\nand laughing as he spoke, said these words unto Karna.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'Behold, O Radha's son, the Panchalas broken by that\r\nfirm bowman (Drona) with his shafts, like a herd of the wild deer\r\nfrightened by a lion. These, I think, will not again come to battle. They\r\nhave been broken by Drona like mighty trees by the tempest. Afflicted by\r\nthat high-souled warrior with those shafts winged with gold, they are\r\nfleeing away, no two persons are together. Indeed, they seem to be\r\ndragged in eddies all over the field. Checked by the Kauravas as also by\r\nthe high-souled Drona, they are huddling close to one another like (a\r\nherd of) elephants in the midst of a conflagration. Like a blossoming\r\ntrees penetrated by flights of bees, these warriors, pierced with the\r\nsharp shafts of Drona, are huddling close to one another, as they are\r\nflying away from the field. There, the wrathful Bhima, abandoned by the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas, and surrounded by my warriors, delighteth me\r\ngreatly, O Karna! It is evident, that wicked wight beholdeth the world\r\ntoday to be full of Drona! Without doubt, that son of Pandu hath today\r\nbecome hopeless of life and kingdom.'\r\n\r\n\"Karna said, 'That mighty-armed warrior will not certainly abandon the\r\nbattle as long as he is alive. Nor will he, O tiger among men, brook\r\nthese leonine shouts (of ours). Nor will the Pandavas, I think, be\r\ndefeated in battle. They are brave, endued with great might, accomplished\r\nin weapons, and difficult of being resisted in battle. Recollecting the\r\nwoes caused them by our attempts at poisoning and burning them, and the\r\nwoes that arose from the match at dice, bearing in mind also their exile\r\nin, the woods, the Pandavas, I think, will not abandon the fight. The\r\nmighty-armed Vrikodara of immeasurable energy hath already turned back\r\n(for the fight). The son of Kunti will certainly slay many of our\r\nforemost car-warriors. With sword and bow and dart, with steeds and\r\nelephants and men and cars,[41] with his mace made of iron, he will slay\r\ncrowds (of our soldiers). Other car-warriors headed by Satyajit, together\r\nwith the Panchalas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, and especially the\r\nPandavas, are following him. They are all brave, and possessed of great\r\nmight and prowess. Mighty car-warriors, they are again led by Bhima in\r\nwrath. Those bulls of the race, surrounding Vrikodara on all sides, like\r\nthe clouds surrounding the Sun, begin to approach Drona from all sides.\r\nClosely intent upon one object, these will certainly afflict unprotected\r\nDrona, like flights of insects, on the point of death, striking a blazing\r\nlamp. Accomplished in weapons, they are certainly competent to resist\r\nDrona. Heavy is the burthen, I think, that now rests on Bharadwaja's son.\r\nLet us then quickly go to the spot where Drona is. Let not those slay him\r\nof regulated vows like wolves slaying a mighty elephant!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Radheya, king Duryodhana\r\nthen, accompanied by his brothers, O monarch, proceeded towards Drona's\r\ncar.

The irresistible\r\nYudhamanyu, excited with rage, proceeded against Drona, borne by\r\nexcellent steeds of variegated hue. Dhristadyumna, the son of the\r\nPanchala king, proceeded, borne by steeds of great fleetness in trappings\r\nof gold and of the hue of pigeons.[43] Desirous of protecting his sire,\r\nand wishing him complete success, Dhristadyumna's son, Kshatradharman of\r\nregulated vows, proceeded., borne by red steeds. Kshatradeva, the son of\r\nSikhandin, himself urging well-decked steeds of the hue of lotus-leaves\r\nand with eyes of pure white, proceeded (against Drona). Beautiful steeds\r\nof the Kamvoja breed, decked with the feathers of the green parrot,\r\nbearing Nakula, quickly ran towards thy army. Dark steeds of the clouds\r\nwrathfully bore Uttamaujas, O Bharata, to battle, against the invincible\r\nDrona, standing with arrows aimed. Steeds, fleet as the wind, and of\r\nvariegated hue, bore Sahadeva with upraised weapons to that fierce\r\nbattle. Of great impetuosity, and possessed of the fleetness of the wind,\r\nsteeds of the ivory hue and having black manes on the neck, bore\r\nYudhishthira, that tiger among men. And many warriors followed\r\nYudhishthira, borne on their steeds, decked in trappings of gold and all\r\nfleet as the wind. Behind the king was the royal chief of the Panchalas,\r\nviz., Drupada, with a golden umbrella over his head and himself protected\r\nby all those soldiers (that followed Yudhishthira). That great bowman\r\namong all the kings, viz., Sautabhi, proceeded, borne by beautiful steeds\r\ncapable of bearing every noise. Accompanied by all the great\r\ncar-warriors, Virata quickly followed the former. The Kaikeyas and\r\nSikhandin, and Dhrishtaketu, surrounded by their respective troops,\r\nfollowed the ruler of Matsyas. Excellent steeds of the (pale red) hue of\r\ntrumpet-flowers, looked exceedingly beautiful as they bore Virata. Fleet\r\nsteeds of yellow colour and decked in chains of gold, bore with great\r\nspeed the son (Uttara) of that slayer of foes, viz., Virata, the royal\r\nchief of the Matsyas. The five Kekaya brothers were borne by steeds of\r\ndeep red hue. Of the splendour of gold and owning standards of the red\r\nhue, and decked with chains of gold, all of them heroes, accomplished in\r\nbattle, they proceeded, clad in mail, and showering arrows like the very\r\nclouds. Excellent steeds, the gift of Tumvuru, of the hue of unbaked\r\nearthen pots, bore Sikhandin, the Panchala prince of immeasurable energy.\r\nAltogether, twelve thousand mighty car-warriors of the Panchala race\r\nproceeded to battle. Of these, six thousand followed Sikhandin. Sportive\r\nsteeds, O sire, of the dappled hue of the antelope, bore the son of\r\nSisupal, that tiger among men. That bull among the Chedis, viz.,\r\nDhrishtaketu, endued with great strength, and difficult of being\r\nvanquished in battle, proceeded, borne by Kamvoja steeds of variegated\r\nhue. Excellent steeds of the Sindhu breed, of beautiful limbs, and of the\r\nhue of the smoke of straw, quickly bore the Kaikeya prince,\r\nVrihatkshatra. Possessed of eyes of pure white, of the hue of the lotus,\r\nborn in the country of the Valhikas, and decked with ornaments, bore\r\nSikhandin's son, the brave Kshatradeva.[44] Decked in trappings of gold,\r\nand possessed of the hue of red silk, quiet steeds bore Senavindu, that\r\nchastiser of foes, to battle. Excellent steeds of the hue of cranes, bore\r\nto battle the youthful and delicate son of the king of the Kasis, that\r\nmighty car-warrior. White steeds with black necks, endued with the speed\r\nof the mind, O monarch, and exceedingly obedient to the driver, bore\r\nprince Prativindhya. Whitish yellow steeds bore Sutasoma, the son of\r\nArjuna, whom the latter had obtained from Soma himself. He was born in\r\nthe Kuru city known by the name of Udayendu. Endued with effulgence of a\r\nthousand moons, and because he also had won great renown in an assembly\r\nof the Somakas, he came to be called Sutasoma. Steeds of the hue of Sala\r\nflowers or of morning sun bore Nakula's son Satanika worthy of every\r\npraise. Steeds decked in trappings of gold, and endued with the hue of\r\nthe peacock's neck, bore that tiger among men, Srutakarman, the son of\r\nDraupdi (by Bhima). Excellent steeds of the hue of the king-fishers bore\r\nDraupadi's son Srutkirti to that battle, who like Partha was an ocean of\r\nlearning. Steeds of a tawny hue bore the youthful Abhimanyu who was\r\nregarded as superior to Krishna or Partha one and a half times in battle.\r\nGigantic steeds bore Yuyutsu to battle, that only warrior amongst the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra who (abandoning his brothers) hath sided with the\r\nPandavas. Plump and well-decked steeds of the hue of the (dried) paddy\r\nstalk bore Vardhakshemi of great activity to that dreadful battle. Steeds\r\nwith black legs, equipped in breast-plates of gold, and exceedingly\r\nobedient to the driver, bore youthful Sauchitti to battle. Steeds whose\r\nbacks were covered with golden armour, decked with chains of gold,\r\nwell-broken, and of the hue of red silk, bore Srenimat. Steeds of a red\r\nhue bore the advancing Satyadhriti accomplished in the science of arms\r\nand in the divine Vedas. That Panchala who was commander (of the Pandava\r\narmy) and who took Drona as the victim allotted to his share,--that\r\nDhrishtadyumna,--was borne by steeds of the hue of pigeons. Him followed\r\nSatyadhriti, and Sauchitti irresistible in battle, and Srenimat, and\r\nVasudana, and Vibhu, the son of the ruler of the Kasis. These had fleet\r\nsteeds of the best Kamvoja breed decked with chains of gold. Each\r\nresembling Yama or Vaisravana, they proceeded to battle, striking fear\r\ninto the hearts of the hostile soldiers. The Prabhadrakas of the Kamvoja\r\ncountry, numbering six thousand, with upraised weapons, with excellent\r\nsteeds of diverse hues on their gold-decked cars, with stretched bows and\r\nmaking their foes tremble with their showers of arrows and resolved to\r\ndie together,[45] followed Dhristadyumna. Excellent steeds of the hue of\r\ntawny silk, decked with beautiful chains of gold, cheerfully bore\r\nChekitana. Arjuna's maternal uncle Purujit, otherwise called Kuntibhoja,\r\ncame borne by excellent steeds of the colour of the rainbow. Steeds of\r\nthe colour of star-bespangled firmament bore to battle king Rochamana.\r\nSteeds of the hue of the red deer, with white streaks over their bodies,\r\nbore the Panchala prince Singhasena, the son of Gopati. That tiger among\r\nthe Panchalas who is known by the name of Janamejaya, had excellent\r\nsteeds of the hue of mustard flowers. Fleet, gigantic and dark blue\r\nsteeds decked with chains of gold, with backs of the hue of curd and\r\nfaces of the hue of the moon, bore with great speed the ruler of the\r\nPanchalas. Brave steeds with beautiful heads, (white) as the stalks of\r\nreeds, and a splendour resembling that of the firmament or the lotus,\r\nbore Dandadhara. Light brown steeds with backs of the hue of the mouse,\r\nand with necks proudly drawn up, bore Vyaghradatta to battle.\r\nDark-spotted steeds bore that tiger among men, viz., Sudhanwan, the\r\nprince of Panchala. Of fierce impetuosity resembling that of Indra's\r\nthunder, beautiful steeds of the hue of Indragopakas, with variegated\r\npatches, bore Chitrayudha. Decked with golden chains, steeds whose\r\nbellies were of the hue of the Chakravaka bore Sukshatra, the son of the\r\nruler of the Kosalas. Beautiful and tall steeds of variegated hue and\r\ngigantic bodies, exceedingly docile, and decked with chains of gold, bore\r\nSatyadhriti accomplished in battle. Sukla advanced to battle with his\r\nstandard and armour and bow and steeds all of the same white hue. Steeds\r\nborn on the sea-coast and white as the moon, bore Chandrasena of fierce\r\nenergy, the son of Samudrasena. Steeds of the hue of the blue lotus and\r\ndecked with ornaments of gold and adorned with beautiful floral wreaths,\r\nbore Saiva owning a beautiful car to battle. Superior steeds of the hue\r\nof Kalaya flowers, with white and red streaks, bore Rathasena difficult\r\nof being resisted in battle. White steeds bore that king who slew the\r\nPatachcharas and who is regarded as the bravest of men. Superior steeds\r\nof the hue of Kinsuka flowers bore Chitrayudha decked with beautiful\r\ngarlands and owning beautiful armour and weapons and standard. King Nila\r\nadvanced to battle, with standard and armour and bow and banner and\r\nsteeds all of the same blue colour. Chitra advanced to battle with\r\ncar-fence and standard and bow all decked with diverse kinds of gems, and\r\nbeautiful steeds and banner. Excellent steeds of the hue of the lotus\r\nbore Hemavarna, the son of Rochamana. Chargers, capable of bearing all\r\nkinds of weapons, of brave achievements in battle, possessed of vertebral\r\ncolumns of the hue of reeds, having white testicles, and endued with the\r\ncolour of the hen's egg, bore Dandaketu. The mighty Sarangadhwaja, endued\r\nwith wealth of energy, the king of the Pandyas, on steeds of the hue of\r\nthe moon's rays and decked with armour set with stones of lapis lazuli,\r\nadvanced upon Drona, stretching his excellent bow. His country having\r\nbeen invaded and his kinsmen having fled, his father had been slain by\r\nKrishna in battle. Obtaining weapons then from Bhishma and Drona, Rama\r\nand Kripa, prince Sarangadhwaja became, in weapons, the equal of Rukmi\r\nand Karna and Arjuna and Achyuta. He then desired to destroy the city of\r\nDwaraka and subjugate the whole world. Wise friends, however, from desire\r\nof doing him good, counselled him against that course. Giving up all\r\nthoughts of revenge, he is now ruling his own dominions. Steeds that were\r\nall of the hue of the Atrusa flower bore a hundred and forty thousand\r\nprinciple car-warriors that followed that Sarangadhwaja, the king of the\r\nPandyas. Steeds of diverse hues and diverse kinds of forces, bore the\r\nheroic Ghatotkacha. Mighty steeds of gigantic size, of the Aratta breed,\r\nbore the mighty-armed Vrihanta of red eyes mounted on his golden car,\r\nthat prince, viz., who, rejecting the opinions of all the Bharatas, hath\r\nsingly, from his reverence for Yudhishthira. gone over to him, abandoning\r\nall his cherished desire.[46] Superior steeds of the hue of gold,\r\nfollowed that foremost of kings viz., the virtuous Yudhishthira at his\r\nback. Large number of Prabhadrakas, of celestial shapes, advanced to\r\nbattle, with steeds of diverse excellent colours. All of them owning\r\nstandards of gold and prepared to struggle vigorously, proceeded with\r\nBhimasena, and wore the aspect, O monarch, of the denizens of heaven with\r\nIndra at their head. That assembled host of Prabhadrakas was much liked\r\nby Dhristadyumna.'\r\n\r\n\"Bharadwaja's son, however, O monarch, surpassed all the warriors in\r\nsplendour. His standard, with a black deer-skin waving on its top and the\r\nbeautiful water-pot, O monarch, that it bore, looked exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. And Bhimasena's standard, bearing the device of a gigantic\r\nlion in silver with its eyes made of lapis lazuli, looked exceedingly\r\nresplendent. The standard of Yudhishthira of great energy, bearing the\r\ndevice of a golden moon with planets around it, looked very beautiful.\r\nTwo large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were\r\ntied to it. Played upon by machinery, these produced excellent music that\r\nenhanced the delight of all who heard it. For terrifying the foe, we\r\nbeheld that tall and fierce standard of Nakula, placed on his car bearing\r\nthe device of a Sarabha with its back made of gold. A beautiful silver\r\nswan with bells and banner terrible to look at and enhancing the grief of\r\nthe foe, was seen on Sahadeva's standard. The standards of the five sons\r\nof Draupadi bore on them the excellent images of Dharma, Marut, Sakra,\r\nand the twin Aswins. On the car, O king, of the youthful Abhimanyu was an\r\nexcellent standard that bore a golden peacock, which was bright as heated\r\ngold. On Ghatotkacha's standard, O king, a vulture shone brightly, and\r\nhis steeds also were capable of going everywhere at will, like those of\r\nRavana in days of yore. In Yudhishthira's hands was the celestial bow\r\ncalled Mahendra; and in the hands of Bhimasena, O king, was the celestial\r\nbow called Vayavya. For the protection of the three worlds Brahman\r\ncreated a bow. That celestial and indestructible bow was held by\r\nPhalguni. The Vaishnava bow was held by Nakula, and the bow called Aswina\r\nwas held by Sahadeva. That celestial and terrible bow called the\r\nPaulastya, was held by Ghatotkacha. The five jewels of bows born by the\r\nfive sons of Draupadi were the Raudra, the Agneya, the Kauverya, the\r\nYamya, and the Girisa. That excellent and best of bows, called the\r\nRaudra, which Rohini's son (Valadeva) had obtained, the latter gave unto\r\nthe high-souled son of Subhadra, having been gratified with him. These\r\nand many other standards decked with gold, were seen there, belonging to\r\nbrave warriors, all of which enhanced the fear of their foes. The host\r\ncommanded by Drona, which numbered not a single coward, and in which\r\ncountless standards rising together seemed to obstruct the welkin, then\r\nlooked, O monarch, like images on a canvas. We heard the names and\r\nlineage, O king, of brave warriors rushing towards Drona in that battle\r\nlike to what is heard, O monarch, at a self-choice.[47]\r\n\r\n\"Then royal Drupada advanced against him at the head of a mighty\r\ndivision. The encounter between those two old men at the heads of their\r\nrespective forces became terrible like that between two mighty leaders,\r\nwith rent temples, of two elephantine herds. Vinda and Anuvinda of\r\nAvanti, with their troops encountered Virata, the ruler of Matsyas at the\r\nhead of his forces, like Indra and Agni in days of old encountering the\r\n(Asura) Vali. That awful encounter between the Matsyas and the Kekayas,\r\nin which steeds and car-warriors and elephants fought most fearlessly,\r\nresembled that between the gods and the Asuras in days of old.\r\nBhutakarman, otherwise called Sabhapati, kept away from Drona. Nakula's\r\nson Satanika, as the latter advanced, scattering showers of arrows. Then\r\nthe heir of Nakula, with three broad-headed shafts of great sharpness,\r\ndeprived Bhutakarman of both his arms and head in that battle. Vivinsati\r\nresisted the heroic Sutasoma of great prowess, as the latter advanced\r\ntowards Drona, scattering showers of arrows. Sutasoma, however, excited\r\nwith wrath, pierced his uncle Vivinsati with straight arrows, and cased\r\nin mail, stood ready for the combat. Bhimaratha, (brother of Duryodhana),\r\nwith six sharp shafts of great swiftness and made wholly of iron,\r\ndespatched Salwa along with his steeds and charioteer to Yama's abode.\r\nChitrasena's son, O king, opposed thy (grand) son Srutakarman as the\r\nlatter came, borne by steeds, looking like peacocks. Those two grandsons\r\nof thine, both difficult of being vanquished in battle, and each desirous\r\nof slaying the other, fought vigorously for the success of the objects of\r\ntheir respective sires. Beholding Prativindhya staying at the van of that\r\ndreadful battle, Drona's son (Aswatthaman), desirous of protecting the\r\nhonour of his sire, resisted the former with his shafts. Prativindhya,\r\nthen, excited with rage pierced Aswatthaman, bearing on his standard the\r\ndevice of a lion's tail and staying in battle for the sake of his father,\r\nwith many sharp shafts. The (eldest) son of Draupadi then scattered over\r\nDrona's son showers of arrows, like a sower, O bull among men, scattering\r\nseeds on the soil at the sowing season.[48] The son of Duhsasana resisted\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Srutakirti, the son of Arjuna by Draupadi, as the\r\nlatter was rushing towards Drona. That son of Arjuna, however, who was\r\nequal to Arjuna himself, cutting off the former's bow and standard and\r\ncharioteer with three broad-headed arrows of great sharpness, proceeded\r\nagainst Drona. Duryodhana's son, Lakshmana, resisted the slayer of the\r\nPatachcharas,--him, that is, O king, who is regarded by both the armies\r\nas the bravest of the brave. The latter, however, cutting off both the\r\nbow and the standard of Lakshmana, and showering upon him many arrows,\r\nflared up with splendour. The youthful Vikarna of great wisdom resisted\r\nSikhandin, the youthful son of Yajnasena, as the latter advanced in that\r\nbattle. Yajnasena's son then covered the former with showers of arrows.\r\nThe mighty son Vikarna, baffling those arrowy showers, looked resplendent\r\non the field of battle. Angada resisted with showers of arrows the heroic\r\nUttamaujas in that battle as the latter rushed towards Drona. That\r\nencounter between those two lions among men became frightful, and it\r\nfilled both them and the troops with great zeal. The great bowman\r\nDurmukha, endued with great might, resisted with his shafts the heroic\r\nPurujit as the latter proceeded towards Drona. Furujit struck Durmukha\r\nbetween his eye-brows with a long shaft. Thereupon, Durmukha's face\r\nlooked beautiful like a lotus with its stalk. Karna resisted with showers\r\nof arrows the five Kekaya brothers, owning red standards, as they\r\nproceeded towards Drona. Scorched with the arrowy showers of Karna, those\r\nfive brothers covered Karna with their arrows. Karna, in return,\r\nrepeatedly covered them with showers of arrows. Covered with arrows,\r\nneither Karna nor the five brother could be seen with their steeds,\r\ncharioteers, standards, and cars. Thy sons, Durjaya, Jaya, and Vijaya,\r\nresisted Nila, and the ruler of the Kasis, and Jayatsena, three against.\r\nAnd the combat between those warriors deepened and gladdened the hearts\r\nof the spectators like those between a lion, a tiger, and a wolf on the\r\none side and a bear, a buffalo, and a bull on the other. The brothers\r\nKshemadhurti and Vrihanta mangled Satyaki of the Satwata race with their\r\nkeen arrows, as the latter proceeded against Drona. The battle between\r\nthose two on one side and Satyaki on the other became exceedingly\r\nwonderful to behold, like that between a lion and two mighty elephants\r\nwith rent temples in the forest. The king of the Chedis, excited with\r\nwrath, and shooting many warriors, kept away from Drona, king Amvashtha,\r\nthat hero who always delighted, in battle. Then king Amvashtha pierced\r\nhis antagonist with a long arrow capable of penetrating into the very\r\nbones. Thereupon, the latter, with bow and arrow loosened from his grasp,\r\nfell down from his car on the ground. The noble Kripa, son of Saradwata,\r\nwith many small arrows resisted Vardhakshemi of the Vrishni race who was\r\nthe embodiment of wrath (in battle). They that looked at Kripa, son of\r\nSaradwata, with many small arrows, resisted Vardhakshemi of the Vrishni\r\nrace who was the embodiment of wrath (in battle). They that looked at\r\nKripa and Vardhakshemi, those heroes conversant with every mode of\r\nwarfare, thus engaged in encountering each other, became so absorbed in\r\nit that, they could not attend to anything else. Somadatta's son, for\r\nenhancing the glory of Drona, resisted king Manimat of great activity as\r\nthe latter came to fight. Then Manimat quickly cut off the bowstring, the\r\nstandard, the banner, the charioteer and the umbrella of Somadatta's son\r\nand caused them to fall down from the latter's car.[49] The son of\r\nSomadatta then, bearing the device of the sacrificial stake on his\r\nstandard, that slayer of foes, quickly jumping down from his car, cut off\r\nwith his large swords, his antagonist with his steeds, charioteer,\r\nstandard, and car. Re-ascending then upon his own car, and taking up\r\nanother bow, and guiding his steeds himself, he began, O monarch, to\r\nconsume the Pandava host. Vrishasena (the son of Karna), competent for\r\nthe feat, resisted with showers of arrows king Pandava who was rushing to\r\nbattle like Indra himself following the Asuras for smiting them. With\r\nmaces and spiked bludgeons, and swords and axes and stones, short clubs\r\nand mallets, and discs, short arrows and battle-axes with dust and wind,\r\nand fire and water, and ashes and brick-bats, and straw and trees,\r\nafflicting and smitting, and breaking, and slaying and routing the foe,\r\nand hurling them on the hostile ranks, and terrifying them therewith,\r\ncame Ghatotkacha, desirous of getting at Drona. The Rakshasa Alambusha,\r\nhowever, excited with rage, encountered him with diverse weapons and\r\ndiverse accoutrements of war. And the battle that took place between\r\nthose two foremost of Rakshasas resembled that which took place in days\r\nof old between Samvara and the chief of the celestials. Thus blessed be\r\nthou, took place hundreds of single combats between car-warriors and\r\nelephants, and steeds and foot-soldiers of thy army and theirs in the\r\nmidst of the dreadful general engagement. Indeed, such a battle was never\r\nseen or heard of before as that which then took place between those\r\nwarriors that were bent upon Drona's destruction and protection. Indeed,\r\nmany were the encounters that were then seen on all parts of field, some\r\nof which were terrible, some beautiful, and some exceedingly fierce, O\r\nlord.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the troops were thus engaged and thus\r\nproceeded against one another in separate divisions, how did Partha and\r\nthe warriors of my army endued with great activity fight? What also did\r\nArjuna do towards the car-warriors of the Samsaptakas? And what, O\r\nSanjaya, did the Samsaptakas, in their turn, do to Arjuna?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'When the troops were thus engaged and proceeded against\r\none another, thy son Duryodhana himself rushed against Bhimasena, leading\r\nhis elephant division. Like an elephant encountering an elephant, like a\r\nbull encountering a bull, Bhimasena, summoned by the king himself, rushed\r\nagainst that elephant division of the Kaurava army. Skilled in battle and\r\nendued with great might of arms, Pritha's son, O sire, quickly broke that\r\nelephant division. These elephants, huge as hills, and with ichor\r\ntrickling down from every part of their bodies, were mangled and forced\r\nto turn back by Bhimasena with his arrows. Indeed, as the wind, when it\r\nriseth, driveth away gathering masses of clouds, so did that son of\r\nPavana rout that elephant force of the Kauravas. And Bhima, shooting his\r\narrows at those elephants, looked resplendent like the risen sun,\r\nstriking everything in the world with his rays. Those elephants,\r\nafflicted with the shafts of Bhima, became covered with blood and looked\r\nbeautiful like masses of clouds in the welkin penetrated with the rays of\r\nthe sun. Then Duryodhana, excited with wrath, pierced with the sharp\r\nshafts that son of the Wind-god who was causing such a slaughter among\r\nhis elephants. Then Bhima, with eyes red in wrath, desirous of\r\ndespatching the king to Yama's abode, pierced him speedily with many\r\nsharp shafts. Then Duryodhana, mangled all over with arrows and excited\r\nwith rage, pierced Bhima, the son of Pandu, with many shafts endued with\r\nthe effulgence of solar rays, smiling the while. Then the son of Pandu,\r\nwith a couple of broad-headed arrows, quickly cut off Duryodhana's bow as\r\nalso his standard, bearing the device of a jewelled elephant, decked with\r\ndiverse gems. Beholding Duryodhana thus afflicted, O sire, by Bhima, the\r\nruler of the Angas on his elephant came there for afflicting the son of\r\nPandu. Thereupon, Bhimasena deeply pierced with a long arrow that prince\r\nof elephants advancing with loud roars, between its two frontal globes.\r\nThat arrow, penetrating through its body, sank deep in the earth. And at\r\nthis the elephants fell down like a hill riven by the thunder. While the\r\nelephant was falling down, the Mleccha king also was falling down it. But\r\nVrikodara, endued with great activity, cut off his head with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow before his antagonist actually fell down. When the\r\nheroic ruler of the Angas fell, his divisions fled away. Steeds and\r\nelephants and car-warriors struck with panic, crushed the foot-soldiers\r\nas they fled.\r\n\r\n\"When those troops, thus broken, fled away in all directions, the ruler\r\nof the Pragjyotishas then advanced against Bhima, upon his elephant.[50]\r\nWith its two (fore) legs and trunk contracted, filled with rage, and with\r\neyes rolling, that elephant seemed to consume the son of Pandu (like a\r\nblazing fire). And it pounded Vrikodara's car with the steed yoked\r\nthereto into dust. Then Bhima ran forward and got under the elephant's\r\nbody, for he knew the science called Anjalikabedha. Indeed, the son of\r\nPandu fled not. Getting under the elephant's body, he began to strike it\r\nfrequently with his bare arms. And he smote that invincible elephant\r\nwhich was bent upon slaying him. Thereupon, the latter began to quickly\r\nturn round like a potter's wheel. Endued with the might of ten thousand\r\nelephants, the blessed Vrikodara, having struck that elephant thus, came\r\nout from under Supratika's body and stood facing the latter. Supratika\r\nthen, seizing Bhima by its trunk, threw him down by means of its knees.\r\nIndeed, having seized him by the neck, that elephant wished to slay him.\r\nTwisting the elephant's trunk, Bhima freed himself from its twine, and\r\nonce more got under the body of that huge creature. And he waited there,\r\nexpecting the arrival of a hostile elephant of his own army. Coming out\r\nfrom under the beast's body, Bhima then ran away with great speed. Then a\r\nloud noise was heard, made by all the troops, to the effect, 'Alas, Bhima\r\nhath been slain by the elephant!' The Pandava host, frightened by that\r\nelephant, suddenly fled away, O king, to where Vrikodara was waiting.\r\nMeanwhile, king Yudhishthira, thinking Vrikodara to have been slain,\r\nsurrounded Bhagadatta on all sides, aided by the Panchalas. Having\r\nsurrounded him with numerous cars, king Yudhishthira that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, covered Bhagadatta with keen shafts by hundreds and\r\nthousands. Then Bhagadatta, that king of the mountainous regions,\r\nfrustrating with his iron hook that shower of arrows, began to consume\r\nboth the Pandavas and the Panchalas by means of that elephant of his.\r\nIndeed. O monarch, the feat that we then beheld, achieved by old\r\nBhagadatta with his elephant, was highly wonderful. Then the ruler of the\r\nDasarnas rushed against the king of the Pragjyotisha, on a fleet elephant\r\nwith temporal sweat trickling down, for attacking Supratika in the flank.\r\nThe battle then that took place between those two elephants of awful\r\nsize, resembled that between two winged mountains overgrown with forests\r\nin days of old. Then the elephant of Bhagadatta, wheeling round and\r\nattacking the elephant of the king of the Dasarnas, ripped open the\r\nlatter's flank and slew it outright. Then Bhagadatta himself with seven\r\nlances bright as the rays of the sun, slew his (human) antagonist seated\r\non the elephant just when the latter was about to fall down from his\r\nseat. Piercing king Bhagadatta then (with many arrows), Yudhishthira\r\nsurrounded him on all sides with a large number of cars. Staying on his\r\nelephant amid car-warriors encompassing him all around, he looked\r\nresplendent like a blazing fire on a mountain-top in the midst of a dense\r\nforest. He stayed fearlessly in the midst of those serried cars ridden by\r\nfierce bowmen, all of whom showered upon him their arrows. Then the king\r\nof the Pragjyotisha, pressing (with his toe) his huge elephant, urged him\r\ntowards the car of Yuyudhana. That prodigious beast, then seizing the car\r\nof Sinis grandson, hurled it to a distance with great force. Yuyudhana,\r\nhowever, escaped by timely flight. His charioteer also, abandoning the\r\nlarge steeds of the Sindhu breed, yoked unto that car, quickly followed\r\nSatyaki and stood where the latter stopped. Meanwhile the elephant,\r\nquickly coming out of the circle of cars, began to throw down all the\r\nkings (that attempted to bar his course). These bulls among men,\r\nfrightened out of their wits by that single elephant coursing swiftly,\r\nregarded it in that battle as multiplied into many. Indeed, Bhagadatta,\r\nmounted on that elephant of his, began to smite down the Pandavas, like\r\nthe chief of the celestials mounted on Airavata smiting down the Danavas\r\n(in days of old).[51] As the Panchalas fled in all directions, loud and\r\nawful was the noise that arose amongst them, made by their elephants and\r\nsteeds. And while the Pandava troops were thus destroyed by Bhagadatta,\r\nBhima, excited with rage, once more rushed against the ruler of the\r\nPragjyotisha. The latter's elephant then frightened the steeds of\r\nadvancing Bhima by drenching them with water spouted forth from its\r\ntrunk, and thereupon those animals bore Bhima away from the field. Then\r\nKriti's son, Ruchiparvan, mounted on his car, quickly rushed against\r\nBhagadatta, scattering showers of arrows and advancing like the Destroyer\r\nhimself. Then Bhagadatta, that ruler of the hilly regions, possessed of\r\nbeautiful limbs, despatched Ruchiparvan with a straight shaft to Yama's\r\nabode.[52] Upon the fall of the heroic Ruchiparvan, Subhadra's son and\r\nthe sons of Draupadi, and Chekitana, and Dhrishtaketu, and Yuyutsu began\r\nto afflict the elephant. Desiring to slay that elephant, all those\r\nwarriors, uttering loud shouts, began to pour their arrows on the\r\nanimals, like the clouds drenching the earth with their watery down-pour.\r\nUrged then by its skilful rider with heel, hook, and toe the animal\r\nadvanced quickly with trunk stretched, and eyes and cars fixed. Treading\r\ndown Yuyutsu's steeds, the animal then slew the charioteer. Thereupon, O\r\nking, Yuyutsu, abandoning his car, fled away quickly. Then the Pandava\r\nwarriors, desirous of slaying that prince of elephants, uttered loud\r\nshouts and covered it quickly with showers of arrows. At this time, thy\r\nson, excited with rage, rushed against the car of Subhadra's son.\r\nMeanwhile, king Bhagadatta on his elephant, shooting shafts on the foe,\r\nlooked resplendent like the Sun himself scattering his rays on the earth.\r\nArjuna's son then pierced him with a dozen shafts, and Yuyutsu with ten,\r\nand each of the sons of Draupadi pierced him with three shafts and\r\nDhrishtaketu also pierced him with three. That elephant then, pierced\r\nwith these shafts, shot with great care, looked resplendent like a mighty\r\nmass of clouds penetrated with the rays of the sun. Afflicted with those\r\nshafts of the foe, that elephant then, urged by its riders with skill and\r\nvigour, began to throw hostile warriors on both his flanks. Like a\r\ncowherd belabouring his cattle in the forest with a goad, Bhagadatta\r\nrepeatedly smote the Pandava host. Like the cawing of quickly retreating\r\ncrows when assailed by hawks, a loud and confused noise was heard among\r\nthe Pandava troops who fled away with great speed. That prince of\r\nelephants, struck by its rider with hook, resembled, O king, a winged\r\nmountain of old. And it filled the hearts of the enemy with fear, like to\r\nwhat merchants experience at sight of the surging sea.[53] Then elephants\r\nand car-warriors and steeds and kings, flying away in fear, made, as they\r\nfled, a loud and awful din that, O monarch, filled the earth and sky and\r\nheaven and the cardinal and subsidiary directions in that battle. Mounted\r\non that foremost of elephants, king Bhagadatta penetrated the hostile\r\narmy like the Asura Virochana in days of old into the celestial host in\r\nbattle well-protected by the gods. A violent wind began to blow; a dusty\r\ncloud covered the sky and the troops; and people regarded that single\r\nelephant as multiplied into many, coursing all over the field.'\""

This loud din that we hear must be due to him. Well-versed in\r\nthe art of grinding and battling from the back of an elephant, and not\r\ninferior to Indra himself in battle, he, I think, is the formost of all\r\nelephant-warriors in the world.[54] His elephant, again, is the foremost\r\nof elephants, without a rival to encounter it in battle. Possessed of\r\ngreat dexterity and above all fatigue, it is, again, impervious to all\r\nweapons. Capable of bearing every weapon and even the touch of fire, it\r\nwill, O sinless one, alone destroy the Pandava force today. Except us\r\ntwo, there is none else capable of checking that creature. Go quickly,\r\ntherefore, to that spot where the ruler of the Pragjyotishas is. Proud in\r\nbattle, in consequence of the strength of his elephant, and arrogant in\r\nconsequence of his age, I will this very day send him as a guest to the\r\nslayer of Vala.' At these words of Arjuna, Krishna began to proceed to\r\nthe place where Bhagadatta was breaking the Pandava ranks. While Arjuna\r\nwas proceeding towards Bhagadatta, the mighty Samsaptaka car-warriors,\r\nnumbering fourteen thousand, made up of ten thousand Gopalas or Narayanas\r\nwho used to follow Vasudeva, returning to the field, summoned him to\r\nbattle. Beholding the Pandava host broken by Bhagadatta, and summoned on\r\nthe other hand by the Samsaptakas, Arjuna's heart was divided in twain.\r\nAnd he began to think, 'Which of these two act will be better for me to\r\ndo today, to return from this spot for battling with Samsaptakas or to\r\nrepair to Yudhishthira?' Reflecting with the aid of his understanding, O\r\nperpetuator of Kuru's race, Arjuna's heart, at last, was firmly fixed on\r\nthe slaughter of the Samsaptakas. Desirous of alone slaughtering in\r\nbattle thousands of car-warriors, Indra's son (Arjuna) having the\r\nforemost of apes on banner, suddenly turned back. Even this was what both\r\nDuryodhana and Karna had thought of for achieving the slaughter of\r\nArjuna. And it was for this that they had made arrangements for the\r\ndouble encounter. The son of Pandu allowed his heart to waver this side\r\nand that, but, at last, resolving to slay those foremost of warriors,\r\nviz., the Samsaptakas, he baffled the purpose of his enemies.[55] Then\r\nmighty Samsaptakas car-warriors, O king, shot at Arjuna thousands of\r\nstraight arrows. Covered with those arrows, O monarch, neither Kunti's\r\nson Partha, nor Krishna, otherwise called Janardana, nor the steeds, nor\r\nthe car, could be seen. Then Janardana became deprived of his senses and\r\nperspired greatly. Thereupon, Partha shot the Brahma weapon and nearly\r\nexterminated them all. Hundreds upon hundreds of arms with bows and\r\narrows and bowstrings in grasp, cut off from trunks, and hundreds upon\r\nhundreds of standards and steeds and charioteers and car-warriors, fell\r\ndown on the ground. Huge elephants, well-equipped and resembling foremost\r\nhills over-grown with woods or masses of clouds, afflicted with Partha's\r\nshafts and deprived of riders, fell down on the earth. Many elephants\r\nagain, with riders on their backs, crushed by means of Arjuna's shafts,\r\nfell down, deprived of life, shorn of the embroidered cloths on their\r\nbacks, and with their housings torn. Cut off by Kiritin with his\r\nbroad-headed arrows, countless arms having swords and lances and rapiers\r\nfor their nails or having clubs and battle-axes in grasp, fell down on\r\nthe earth. Heads also, beautiful, O king, as the morning sun or the lotus\r\nor the moon, cut off by Arjuna with his arrows, dropped down on the\r\nground. While Phalguni in rage was thus engaged in slaying the foe with\r\ndiverse kinds of well-adorned and fatal shafts, that host seemed to be\r\nablaze. Beholding Dhanunjaya crushing that host like an elephant crushing\r\nlotus-stalks, all creatures applauded him, saying, 'Excellent,\r\nExcellent!' Seeing that feat of Partha resembling that of Vasava himself,\r\nMadhava wondered much and, addressing him with joined hands, said,\r\n'Verily, O Partha, I think that this feat which thou hast achieved, could\r\nnot be performed by Sakra, or Yama, or the Lord of treasures himself. I\r\nsee that thou hast today felled in battle hundreds and thousands of\r\nmighty Samsaptaka warriors an together.' Having slain the Samsaptakas\r\nthen,--that is, who were engaged in battle,--Partha addressed Krishna,\r\nsaying, 'Go towards Bhagadatta.'\""

While that foremost one of the Kurus was thus proceeding\r\ntowards his brothers who were exceedingly afflicted by Drona, Susarman\r\nwith his brothers, followed him behind, desirous of battle. The\r\never-victorious Arjuna then addressed Krishna, saying, 'O thou of\r\nunfading glory, this Susarman here, with his brothers, challengeth me to\r\nbattle! O slayer of foes, our host, again, is broken (by Drona) towards\r\nthe north. In consequence of these Samsaptakas, my heart wavers today as\r\nto whether I should do this or that. Shall I slay the Samsaptakas now, or\r\nprotect from harm my own troops already afflicted by the foe? Know this\r\nto be what I am thinking of, viz., 'Which of these would be better for\r\nme?' Thus addressed by him, he of Dasarha's race, turned back the car,\r\nand took the son of Pandu to where the ruler of the Trigartas was. Then\r\nArjuna pierced Susarman with seven shafts, and cut off both his bow and\r\nstandard with a couple of sharp arrows. He then, with six arrows, quickly\r\ndespatched the brothers of Trigarta king to Yama's abode.[56] Then\r\nSusarman, aiming Arjuna, hurled at him a dart made wholly of iron and\r\nlooking like a snake, and aiming Vasudeva, hurled a lance at him. Cutting\r\noff that dart with three arrows and that lance also with three other\r\narrows, Arjuna, by means of his arrowy showers, deprived Susarman of his\r\nsenses on his car. Then advancing fiercely (towards thy division),\r\nscattering showers of arrows, like Vasava pouring rain, none among thy\r\ntroops, O king, ventured to oppose. Like a fire consuming heaps of straw\r\nas it advances, Dhananjaya advanced, scorching all the mighty\r\ncar-warriors among the Kauravas by means of his arrows. Like a living\r\ncreature incapable of bearing the touch of fire, thy troops could not\r\nbear the irresistible impetuosity of that intelligent son of Kunti.\r\nIndeed, the son of Pandu, overwhelming the hostile host by means of his\r\narrows, came upon the king of the Pragjyotishas, O monarch, like Garuda\r\nswooping down (upon his prey). He then held in his hands that Gandiva\r\nwhich in battle was beneficial to the innocent Pandavas and baneful to\r\nall foes, for the destruction of Kshatriyas brought about, O king, by the\r\nfault of thy son who had recourse to deceitful dice for accomplishing his\r\nend. Agitated by Partha thus, thy host then, O king, broke like a boat\r\nwhen it strikes against a rock. Then ten thousand bowmen, brave and\r\nfierce, firmly resolved to conquer, advanced (to encounter Arjuna). With\r\ndauntless hearts, those mighty car-warriors all surrounded him. Capable\r\nof bearing any burden, howsoever heavy in battle, Partha took up that\r\nheavy burden. As an angry elephant of sixty years, with rent temples,\r\ncrushes an assemblage of lotus stalks, even so did Partha crush that\r\ndivision of thy army. And when that division was being thus crushed, king\r\nBhagadatta, on that same elephant of his, impetuously rushed towards\r\nArjuna. Thereupon, Dhananjaya, that tiger among men, staying on his car,\r\nreceived Bhagadatta. That encounter between Arjuna's car and Bhagadatta's\r\nelephant was fierce in the extreme. Those two heroes, viz., Bhagadatta\r\nand Dhananjaya, then coursed on the field, the one on his car and the\r\nother on his elephant, both of which were equipped according to the rules\r\nof science. Then Bhagadatta, like the lord Indra, from his elephant\r\nlooking like a mass of clouds, poured on Dhananjaya showers of arrows.\r\nThe valiant son of Vasava, however, with his arrows, cut off those arrowy\r\nshowers of Bhagadatta before they could reach him. The king of the\r\nPragjyotishas, then, baffling that arrowy shower of Arjuna, struck both\r\nPartha and Krishna, O king, with many shafts and overwhelming both of\r\nthem with a thick shower of shafts, Bhagadatta then urged his elephant\r\nfor the destruction of Krishna and Partha. Beholding that angry elephant\r\nadvancing like Death himself, Janardana quickly moved his car in such a\r\nway as to keep the elephant on his left. Dhananjaya, although he thus got\r\nthe opportunity of slaying that huge elephant with its rider from the\r\nback, wished not yet to avail himself of it, remembering the rules of\r\nfair fight. The elephant, however, coming upon other elephants and cars\r\nand steeds, O king, despatched them all to Yama's abode. Beholding this,\r\nDhananjaya was filled with rage."

Tell me all this, O Sanjaya!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'While Partha and Krishna were thus engaged with the ruler\r\nof the Pragjyotishas, all creatures regarded them to be very near the\r\njaws of Death. Indeed, O monarch, from the neck of his elephant,\r\nBhagadatta scattered showers of shafts on the two Krishnas, staying upon\r\ntheir car. He pierced Devaki's son with many arrows made wholly of black\r\niron, equipped with wings of gold, whetted on stone, and shot from his\r\nbow, drawn to the fullest stretch. Those shafts whose touch resembled\r\nthat of fire, equipped with beautiful feathers, and shot by Bhagadatta,\r\npassing through Devaki's son, entered the earth. Partha then cut off\r\nBhagadatta's bow and slaying next the warrior that protected his elephant\r\nfrom the flank, began to fight with him as if in sport. Then Bhagadatta\r\nhurled at him fourteen lances of sharp points, that were bright as the\r\nrays of the sun. Arjuna, however, cut each of those lances into three\r\nfragments. Then Indra's son cut open the armour in which that elephant\r\nwas eased, by means of a thick shower of arrows. The armour thus cut off,\r\nfell down on the earth. Exceedingly afflicted with arrows shot by Arjuna,\r\nthat elephant, deprived of its coat of mail, looked like a prince of\r\nmountains destitute of its cloudy robes and with streaks of water running\r\ndown its breast. Then the ruler of the Pragjyotishas hurled at Vasudeva a\r\ndart made wholly of iron and decked with gold. That dart Arjuna cut in\r\ntwain. Then cutting off the king's standard and umbrella by means of his\r\narrows Arjuna quickly pierced that ruler of the mountainous realms with\r\nten arrows, smiling all the while. Deeply pierced with those shafts of\r\nArjuna, that were beautifully winged with Kanka feathers, Bhagadatta, O\r\nmonarch, became incensed with the son of Pandu. He then hurled some\r\nlances at Arjuna's head and uttered a loud shout. In consequence of those\r\nlances Arjuna's diadem was displaced. Arjuna, then, having placed his\r\ndiadem properly, addressed the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, saying, 'Look\r\nwell on this world!' Thus addressed by him, Bhagadatta became filled with\r\nrage, and taking up a bright bow showered upon both the Pandava and\r\nGovinda his arrowy down-pours. Partha then cutting off his bow and\r\nquivers, quickly struck him with two and seventy shafts, afflicting his\r\nvital limbs. Thus pierced, he was excessively pained. Filled then with\r\nrage, he with Mantras, turned his hook into the Vaishnava weapon and\r\nhurled it at Arjuna's breast. That all-slaying weapon, hurled by\r\nBhagadatta, Kesava, covering Arjuna, received on his breast. Thereupon,\r\nthat weapon became a triumphal garland on Kesava's breast. Arjuna then\r\ncheerlessly addressed Kesava, saying, 'O sinless one, without battling\r\nthyself, thou art to only guide my steed! Thou hadst said so, O\r\nlotus-eyed one! Why then dost thou not adhere to thy promise? If I sink\r\nin distress, or become unable to baffle, or resist a foe or weapon, then\r\nmayst thou act so, but not when I am standing thus. Thou knowest that\r\nwith my bow and arrows I am competent to vanquish these worlds with the\r\ngods, the Asuras, and men.' Hearing these words of Arjuna, Vasudeva\r\nreplied unto him, saying, 'Listen, O Partha, to this secret and ancient\r\nhistory as it is, O sinless one! I have four forms, eternally engaged as\r\nI am in protecting the worlds. Dividing my own Self, I ordain the good of\r\nthe worlds. One form of mine, staying on the earth, is engaged in the\r\npractice of ascetic austerities. Another beholdeth the good and the evil\r\ndeeds in the world. My third form, coming into the world of men, is\r\nengaged in action. My fourth form lieth down in sleep for a thousand\r\nyears. The form of mine which awaketh from sleep at the end of a thousand\r\nyears, granteth, upon awakening, excellent boons to persons deserving of\r\nthem. The earth, knowing (on one occasion) that that time had come, asked\r\nof me a boon for (her son) Naraka. Hear, O Partha, what that boon was.\r\nPossessed of the Vaishnava weapon, let my son become incapable of being\r\nslain by the gods and the Asuras. It behoveth thee to grant me that\r\nweapon. Hearing this prayer, I then gave, in days of old, the supreme and\r\ninfallible Vaishnava weapon to the Earth's son. I said also at that time\r\nthese words, 'O Earth, let this weapon be infallible for the protection\r\nof Naraka. None will be able to slay him. Protected by this weapon, thy\r\nson will always, in all the worlds, be invincible and crush all hostile\r\nhosts.' Saying, So be it! the intelligent goddess went away, her wishes\r\nfulfilled. And Naraka also became invincible and always scorched his\r\nfoes. It was from Naraka, O Partha, that the ruler of the Pragjyotishas\r\ngot this weapon of mine. There is none, in all the world, O sire,\r\nincluding even Indra and Rudra, who is unslayable by this weapon. It was\r\nfor thy sake, therefore, that I baffled it, violating my promise. The\r\ngreat Asura hath now been divested of that supreme weapon. Slay now, O\r\nPartha, that invincible foe of thine, viz., Bhagadatta, enemy of the\r\ngods, even as I formerly slew for the good of the worlds, the Asura\r\nNaraka.' Thus addressed by the high-souled Kesava, Partha suddenly\r\noverwhelmed Bhagadatta with clouds of whetted arrows. Then, the\r\nmighty-armed and high-souled Arjuna fearlessly struck a long arrow\r\nbetween the frontal globes of his enemy's elephant. That arrow, splitting\r\nthe elephant like the thunder splitting a mountain, penetrated into its\r\nbody to the very wings, like a snake penetrating into an ant-hill. Though\r\nurged repeatedly then by Bhagadatta, the elephant refused to obey like a\r\npoor man's wife her lord. With limbs paralysed, it fell down, striking\r\nthe earth with its tusks. Uttering a cry of distress, that huge elephant\r\ngave up the ghost. The son of Pandu then, with a straight shaft furnished\r\nwith a crescent-shaped head, pierced the bosom of king Bhagadatta. His\r\nbreast, being pierced through by the diadem-decked (Arjuna), king\r\nBhagadatta, deprived of life, threw down his bow and arrows. Loosened\r\nfrom his head, the valuable piece of cloth that had served him for a\r\nturban, fell down, like a petal from a lotus when its stalk is violently\r\nstruck. And he himself, decked with golden garlands, fell down from his\r\nhuge elephant adorned with golden housings, like flowering Kinsuka broken\r\nby the force of the wind from the mountain-top. The son of Indra then,\r\nhaving slain in battle that monarch who resembled Indra himself in\r\nprowess and who was Indra's friend, broke the other warriors of thy army\r\ninspired with hope of victory like the mighty wind breaking rows of\r\ntrees.'\""

Then the two sons of the king of Gandhara viz., the\r\nbrothers Vrishaka and Achala, those subjugators of hostile towns, began\r\nto afflict Arjuna in battle. Those two heroic bowmen, uniting together,\r\nbegan to deeply pierce Arjuna from the front and from behind with whetted\r\nshafts of great impetuosity. Arjuna then with sharp shafts cut off the\r\nsteeds and driver and bow and umbrella and standard and car of Vrishaka,\r\nthe son of Suvala, into atoms. With clouds of arrows and diverse other\r\nweapons, Arjuna then once more severely afflicted the Gandhara troops\r\nheaded by Suvala's son. Then Dhananjaya, filled with rage, despatched to\r\nYama's abode, with his shafts, five hundred heroic Gandharas with\r\nupraised weapons. The mighty-armed hero then, quickly alighting from that\r\ncar whose steeds had been slain, mounted upon the car of his brother and\r\ntook up another bow. Then those two brothers, viz., Vrishaka and Achala,\r\nboth mounted on the same car, began incessantly to pierce Vibhatsu with\r\nshowers of arrows. Indeed, those high-souled princes, those relatives of\r\nthine by marriage, viz., Vrishaka and Achala, struck Partha very\r\nseverely, like Vritra or Vala striking Indra of old. Of unfailing aim,\r\nthese two princes of Gandhara, themselves unhurt, began once more to\r\nstrike the son of Pandu, like the two months of summer afflicting the\r\nworld with sweat-producing rays.[57] Then Arjuna slew those princes and\r\ntigers among men, viz., Vrishaka and Achala, staying on one car side by\r\nside, with, O monarch, a single arrow. Then those mighty-armed heroes,\r\nwith red eyes and looking like lions, those uterine brothers having\r\nsimilar features, together fell down from that car. And their bodies,\r\ndear to friends, falling down upon the earth, lay there, spreading sacred\r\nfame all around.\r\n\r\n\"Beholding their brave and unretreating maternal uncles thus slain by\r\nArjuna, thy sons, O monarch, rained many weapons upon him. Sakuni also,\r\nconversant with a hundred different kinds of illusions, seeing his\r\nbrothers slain, created illusions for confounding the two Krishnas. Then\r\nclubs, and iron balls, and rocks and Sataghnis and darts, and maces, and\r\nspiked bludgeons, and scimitars, and lances, mallets, axes, and Kampanas,\r\nand swords, and nails, and short clubs, and battle-axes, and razors, and\r\narrows with sharp broad heads, and Nalikas, and calf-tooth headed shafts,\r\nand arrows having bony heads and discs and snake-headed shafts, and\r\nspears, and diverse other kinds of weapons, fell upon Arjuna from all\r\nsides. And asses, and camels, and buffaloes, and tigers, and lions, and\r\ndeer, and leopards, and bears, and wolves and vultures, and monkeys, and\r\nvarious reptiles, and diverse cannibals, and swarms of crows, all hungry,\r\nand excited with rage, ran towards Arjuna. Then Dhananjaya, the son of\r\nKunti, that hero conversant with celestial weapons, shooting clouds of\r\narrows, assailed them all. And assailed by that hero with those excellent\r\nand strong shafts, they uttered loud cries and fell down deprived of\r\nlife. Then a thick darkness appeared and covered Arjuna's car, and from\r\nwithin that gloom harsh voices rebuked Arjuna. The latter, however, by\r\nmeans of the weapons called Jyotishka, dispelled that thick and awful\r\ndarkness. When that darkness was dispelled frightful waves of water\r\nappeared. For drying up those waters, Arjuna applied the weapon called\r\nAditya. And in consequence of that weapon, the waters were almost dried\r\nup. These diverse illusions, repeatedly created by Sauvala, Arjuna\r\ndestroyed speedily by means of the force of his weapons, laughing the\r\nwhile. Upon all his illusions being destroyed, afflicted with Arjuna's\r\nshafts and unmanned by fear, Sakuni fled away, aided by his fleet,\r\nsteeds, like a vulgar wretch. Then Arjuna, acquainted with all weapons,\r\nshowing his enemies the exceeding lightness of his hands, showered upon\r\nthe Kaurava host clouds of arrows. That host of thy son, thus slaughtered\r\nby Partha, became divided into two streams like the current of Ganga when\r\nimpeded by a mountain. And one of those streams, O bull among men,\r\nproceeded towards Drona, and the other with loud cries, proceeded towards\r\nDuryodhana. Then a thick dust arose and covered all the troops. We could\r\nnot then see Arjuna. Only the twang of Gandivas was heard by us from off\r\nthe field. Indeed, the twang of Gandiva was heard, rising above the blare\r\nof conchs and the beat of drums and the noise of other instruments. Then\r\non the southern part of the field took place a fierce battle between many\r\nforemost warriors on the one side and Arjuna on the other. I, however,\r\nfollowed Drona. The various divisions of Yudhishthira's force smote the\r\nfoe on every part of the field. The diverse divisions of thy son, O\r\nBharata, Arjuna smote, even as the wind in the summer season destroys\r\nmasses of clouds in the welkin. Indeed, as Arjuna came, scattering clouds\r\nof arrows, like Vasava pouring thick showers of rain, there was none in\r\nthy army who could resist that great fierce bowman, that tiger among men.\r\nStruck by Partha, thy warriors were in great pain. They fled away, and in\r\nflying killed many among their own number. The arrows shot by Arjuna,\r\nwinged Kanka feathers and capable of penetrating into every body, fell\r\ncovering all sides, like flights of locusts. Piercing steeds and\r\ncar-warriors and elephants and foot-soldiers, O sire, like snakes through\r\nant-hills, those shafts entered the earth. Arjuna never shot arrows, at\r\nany elephant, steed or man. Struck with only one arrow, each of these,\r\nseverely afflicted, fell down deprived of life. With slain men and\r\nelephant and shaft-struck steeds lying all about, and echoing with yells\r\nof dogs and jackals, the field of battle presented a variegated and awful\r\nsight. Pained with arrows, sire forsook son, and friend forsook friend\r\nand son forsook sire. Indeed, every one was intent upon protecting his\r\nown self. Struck with Partha's shafts, many warriors abandoned the very\r\nanimals that bore them.'\""

The rallying of ranks when broken and\r\nflying away without beholding a spot whereon to stand, is always\r\nexceedingly difficult. Tell me all about it, O Sanjaya!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, [Although thy troops were broken], yet, O monarch, many\r\nforemost of heroes in the world, inspired by the desire of doing good to\r\nthy son and of maintaining their own reputation, followed Drona. In that\r\ndreadful pass, they fearlessly followed their commander, achieving\r\nmeritorious feats against the Pandava troops with weapons upraised, and\r\nYudhishthira within accessible distance.[58] Taking advantage of an error\r\nof Bhimasena of great energy and of heroic Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna, O\r\nmonarch, the Kuru leaders fell upon the Pandava Army.[59] The Panchalas\r\nurged their troops, saying, 'Drona, Drona!' Thy sons, however, urged all\r\nthe Kurus, saying, 'Let not Drona be slain. Let not Drona be slain!' One\r\nside saying, 'Slay Drona', 'Slay Drona,' and the other saying, 'Let not\r\nDrona be slain, 'Let not Drona be slain,' the Kurus and the Pandavas\r\nseemed to gamble, making Drona their stake. Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of\r\nthe Panchalas, proceeded to the side of all those Panchala car-warriors\r\nwhom Drona sought to crush. Thus no rule was observed as to the\r\nantagonist one night select for battling with him. The strife became\r\ndreadful. Heroes encountered heroes, uttering loud shouts Their foes\r\ncould not make the Pandavas tremble. On the other hand, recollecting all\r\ntheir woes, the latter made the ranks of their enemies tremble. Though\r\npossessed of modesty, yet excited with rage and vindictiveness, and urged\r\nby energy and might, they approached that dreadful battle, reckless of\r\ntheir very lives for slaying Drona. That encounter of heroes of\r\nimmeasurable energy, sporting in fierce battle making life itself the\r\nstake, resembled the collision of iron against adamant. The oldest men\r\neven could not recollect whether they had seen or heard of a battle as\r\nfierce as that which took place on this occasion. The earth in that\r\nencounter, marked with great carnage and afflicted with the weight of\r\nthat vast host, began to tremble. The awful noise made by the Kuru army\r\nagitated and tossed by the foe, paralysing the very welkin, penetrated\r\ninto the midst of even the Pandava host. Then Drona, coming upon the\r\nPandava divisions by thousands, and careering over the field, broke them\r\nby means of his whetted shafts. When these were being thus crushed by\r\nDrona of wonderful achievements, Dhrishtadyumna, the generalissimo of the\r\nPandava host, filled with rage himself checked Drona. The encounter that\r\nwe beheld between Drona and the prince of the Panchalas was highly\r\nwonderful. It is my firm conviction that it has no parallel.\r\n\r\n\"Then Nila, resembling a veritable fire, his arrows constituting its\r\nsparks and his bow its flame, began to consume the Kuru ranks, like a\r\nconflagration consuming heaps of dry grass. The valiant son of Drona, who\r\nfrom before had been desirous of an encounter with him, smilingly\r\naddressed Nila as the latter came consuming the troops, and said unto him\r\nthese polite words,[60] 'O Nila, what dost thou gain by consuming so many\r\ncommon soldiers with thy arrowy flames? Fight with my unaided self, and\r\nfilled with rage, strike me.' Thus addressed, Nila, the brightness of\r\nwhose face resembled the splendour of a full-blown lotus, pierced\r\nAswatthaman, whose body resembled an assemblage of lotuses and whose eyes\r\nwere like lotus-petals with his shafts. Deeply and suddenly pierced by\r\nNila, Drona's son with three broad-headed arrows, cut off his\r\nantagonist's bow and standard and umbrella. Quickly jumping down from his\r\ncar, Nila, then, with a shield and an excellent sword, desired to sever\r\nfrom Aswatthaman's trunk his head like a bird (bearing away its prey in\r\nits talons). Drona's son, however, O sinless one, by means of a bearded\r\narrow, cut off, from his antagonist's trunk, his head graced with a\r\nbeautiful nose and decked with excellent ear-rings, and which rested on\r\nelevated shoulders. That hero, then, the brightness of whose face\r\nresembled the splendour of the full moon and whose eyes were like\r\nlotus-petals, whose stature was tall, and complexion like that of the\r\nlotus, thus slain, fell down on the earth. The Pandava host then, filled\r\nwith great grief, began to tremble, when the Preceptor's son thus slew\r\nNila of blazing energy. The great car-warriors of the Pandavas, O sire,\r\nall thought, 'Alas, how would Indra's son (Arjuna) be able to rescue us\r\nfrom the foe, when that mighty warrior is engaged on the southern part of\r\nthe field in slaughtering the remnant of the Samsaptakas and the Narayana\r\nforce?'\""

Disregarding their\r\nkingdoms and casting off all fear of death, the warriors of thy army\r\nproceeded against the Pandavas. Horsemen encountered horsemen, and\r\ncar-warriors encountered car-warriors. The battle proceeded, darts\r\nagainst darts, swords against swords, axes against axes. A fierce\r\nencounter with swords took place, producing a terrible carnage. And in\r\nconsequence of the collision of elephants against elephants the battle\r\nbecame furious. Some fell down from the backs of elephants, and some from\r\nthe backs of steeds, with heads downwards. And others, O sire, fell down\r\nfrom cars, pierced with arrows. In that fierce press, as some one fell\r\ndown deprived of armour, an elephant might be seen attacking him in the\r\nchest and crushing his head. Elsewhere might be seen elephants crushing\r\nnumbers of men fallen down on the field. And many elephants, piercing the\r\nearth with their tusks (as they fell down), were seen to tear therewith\r\nlarge bodies of men. Many elephants, again, with arrows sticking to their\r\ntrunks, wandered over the field, tearing and crushing men by hundreds.\r\nAnd some elephants were seen pressing down into the earth fallen warriors\r\nand steeds and elephants cased in armour of black iron, as if these were\r\nonly thick reeds. Many kings, graced with modesty, their hour having\r\ncome, laid themselves down (for the last sleep) on painful beds, overlaid\r\nwith vultures' feathers. Advancing to battle on his car, sire slew son;\r\nand son also, through madness all losing regard, approached-sire in\r\nbattle. The wheels of cars were broken; banners were torn; umbrellas fell\r\ndown on the earth. Dragging broken yokes, steeds ran away. Arms with\r\nswords in grasp, and heads decked with ear-rings fell down. Cars, dragged\r\nby mighty elephants, thrown down on the ground, were reduced to\r\nfragments. Steeds with riders fell down, severely wounded by elephants.\r\nThat fierce battle went on, without anybody showing any regard for any\r\none. 'Oh father!--Oh son!--Where art thou, friend?--Wait!--Where dost\r\nthou go!--Strike!--Bring! Slay this one!'--these and diverse other cries,\r\nwith loud laughs and shouts, and roars were uttered and heard there. The\r\nblood of human beings and steeds and elephants, mingled together. The\r\nearthy dust disappeared. The hearts of all timid persons became\r\ncheerless. Here a hero getting his car-wheel entangled with the car-wheel\r\nof another hero, and the distance being too near to admit of the use of\r\nother weapons, smashed that other's head by means of his mace. Brave\r\ncombatants, desirous of safety where there was no safety, dragged one\r\nanother by the hair, and fought fiercely with fists, and teeth and nails.\r\nHere was a hero whose upraised arm with sword in grasp was cut off, There\r\nanother's arm was lopped off with bow, or arrow or hook in grasp. Here\r\none loudly called upon another. There another turned his back on the\r\nfield. Here one severed another's head from his trunk, getting him within\r\nreach. There another rushed with loud shouts Upon an enemy. Here one was\r\nfilled with fear at another's roar. There another slew with sharp shafts\r\na friend or a foe. Here an elephant, huge as a hill, slain with a long\r\nshaft, fell down en the field and lay like a flat island in a river\r\nduring the summer season. There an elephant, with sweat trickling down\r\nits body, like a mountain with rills flowing adown its breast, steed,\r\nhaving crushed by its tread a car-warrior with his steeds and charioteer\r\non the field. Beholding brave warriors, accomplished in arms and covered\r\nwith blood, strike one another, they that were timid and of weak hearts,\r\nlost their senses. In fact, all became cheerless. Nothing could any\r\nlonger be distinguished. Overwhelmed with the dust raised by the troops,\r\nthe battle became furious. Then the commander of the Pandava forces\r\nsaying, 'This is the time,' speedily led the Pandavas on those heroes\r\nthat are always endued with great activity. Obeying his behest, the\r\nmighty-armed Pandavas, smiting (the Katirava army) proceeded towards\r\nDrona's car like swans towards a lake,--'Seize him,'---'Do not fly\r\naway,'--'Do not fear,'--'Cut into pieces,'--these uproarious cries were\r\nheard in the vicinity of Drona's car. Then Drona and Kripa, and Karna and\r\nDrona's son, and king Jayadratha, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and\r\nSalya, received those heroes. Those irresistible and invincible warriors,\r\nhowever, viz., the Panchalas and the Pandavas, inspired by noble\r\nsentiments, did not, though afflicted with shafts, avoid Drona. Then\r\nDrona, excited with great rage, shot hundreds of shafts, and caused a\r\ngreat carnage amongst the Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Pandavas. The\r\ntwang of his bowstring and the slaps of his palms, were, O sire, heard on\r\nall sides. And they resembled the roar of thunder and struck fear into\r\nthe hearts of all. Meanwhile, Jishnu, having vanquished large number of\r\nSamsaptakas, quickly came to that place where Drona was grinding the\r\nPandava troops. Having crossed many large lakes whose waters were\r\nconstituted by blood, and whose fierce billows and eddies were\r\nconstituted by shafts, and having slain the Samsaptakas, Phalguni showed\r\nhimself there. Possessed of great fame and endued as he was with the\r\nenergy of the Sun himself, Arjuna's emblem, viz., his banner bearing the\r\nape, was beheld by us to blaze with splendour. Having dried up the\r\nSamsaptaka ocean by means of weapons that constituted his rays, the son\r\nof Pandu then blasted the Kurus also, as if he were the very Sun that\r\narises at the end of the Yuga. Indeed, Arjuna scorched all the Kurus by\r\nthe heat of his weapons, like the fire[61] that appears at the end of the\r\nYuga, burning down all creatures. Struck by him with thousands of shafts,\r\nelephant warriors and horsemen and car-warriors fell down on the earth,\r\nwith dishevelled hair, and exceedingly afflicted with those arrowy\r\nshowers, some uttered cries of distress. Others set up loud shouts. And\r\nsome struck with the shafts of Partha, fell down deprived of life.\r\nRecollecting the practices of (good) warriors, Arjuna struck not those\r\ncombatants among the foe that had fallen down, or those that were\r\nretreating, or those that were unwilling to fight. Deprived of their cars\r\nand filled with wonder, almost all the Kauravas, turning away from the\r\nfield, uttered cries of Oh and Alas and called upon Karna (for\r\nprotection). Hearing that din made by the Kurus, desirous of protection,\r\nAdhiratha's son (Karna), loudly assuring the troops with the words 'Do\r\nnot fear' proceeded to face Arjuna. Then (Karna) that foremost of Bharata\r\ncar-warriors, that delighter of all the Bharatas, that first of all\r\npersons acquainted with weapons, invoked into existence the Agneya\r\nweapon. Dhananjaya, however, baffled by means of his own arrowy downpours\r\nthe flights of arrows shot by Radha's son, that warrior of the blazing\r\nbow, that hero of bright shafts. And similarly, Adhiratha's son also\r\nbaffled the shafts of Arjuna of supreme energy. Resisting Arjuna's\r\nweapons thus by his own, Karna uttered loud shouts and shot many shafts\r\nat his antagonist. Then Dhristadyumna and Bhima and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki, all approached Karna, and each of them pierced in\r\nwith three straight shafts. The son of Radha, however, checking Arjuna's\r\nweapons by his own arrowy showers, cut off with three sharp shafts the\r\nbows of those three warriors. Their bows cut off, they looked like snakes\r\nwithout poison. Hurling darts at their foe from their respective cars,\r\nthey uttered loud leonine shouts. Those fierce darts of great splendour\r\nand great impetuosity, looking like snakes, hurled from those mighty\r\narms, coursed impetuously towards Karna's car. Cutting each of those\r\ndarts with three straight arrows and speeding many arrows at the same\r\ntime at Partha, the mighty Karna uttered a loud shout. Then Arjuna\r\npiercing Karna with seven shafts, despatched the latter's younger brother\r\nby means of his sharp shafts. Slaying Satrunjaya thus with six arrows,\r\nPartha, with a broad-headed shaft, struck off Vipatha's head as the\r\nlatter stood on his car. In the very sight of the Dhritarashtras,\r\ntherefore, as also of the Suta's son, the three uterine brothers of the\r\nlatter were despatched by Arjuna unaided by any one. Then Bhima, jumping\r\ndown from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent\r\nsword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna.\r\nMounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna\r\nwith ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna\r\nalso taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and\r\nalso Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince\r\nthen, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna\r\nwith three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson\r\nalso, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow\r\npierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And\r\ncutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more\r\npierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king\r\nDuryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the\r\nSatyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. And foot-soldiers\r\nand steeds and cars and elephants, belonging to thy army and numbering by\r\nhundreds, all accomplished in smitting rushed to the spot where Karna was\r\nfrightening (his assailants). Then Dhrishtadyumna, and Bhima and\r\nSubhadra's son, and Arjuna himself, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, began to\r\nprotect Satyaki in that battle. Even thus went on that fierce battle for\r\nthe destruction of bowmen belonging to thy army and of the enemy's. All\r\nthe combatants fought, reckless of their very lives. Infantry and cars\r\nand steeds and elephants were engaged with cars and infantry.\r\nCar-warriors were engaged with elephants and foot-soldiers and steeds,\r\nand cars and foot-soldiers were engaged with cars and elephants. And\r\nsteeds were seen engaged with steeds, and elephants with elephants, and\r\nfoot-soldiers with foot-soldiers. Even thus did that battle, marked by\r\ngreat confusion, take place, enhancing the delight of cannibals and\r\ncarnivorous creatures, between those high-souled men facing one another\r\nfearlessly. Indeed, it largely swelled the population of Yama's kingdom.\r\nLarge numbers of elephants and cars and foot-soldiers and steeds were\r\ndestroyed by men, cars, steeds and elephants. And elephants were slain by\r\nelephants, and car-warriors with weapons upraised by car-warriors, and\r\nsteeds by steeds, and large bodies of foot-soldiers. And elephants were\r\nslain by cars, and large steeds by large elephants and men by steeds; and\r\nsteeds by foremost of car-warriors. With tongues lolling out, and teeth\r\nand eyes pressed out of their places, with coats of mail and ornaments\r\ncrushed into dust, the slaughtered creatures fell down on the field.\r\nOthers, again, of terrible mien were struck and thrown down on the earth\r\nby others armed with diverse and excellent weapons and sunk into the\r\nearth by the tread of steeds and elephants, and tortured and mangled by\r\nheavy cars and car wheels. And during the progress of that fierce carnage\r\nso delightful to beasts of prey and carnivorous birds and cannibals,\r\nmighty combatants, filled with wrath, and slaughtering one another\r\ncareered over the field putting forth all their energy. Then when both\r\nthe hosts were broken and mangled, the warriors bathed in blood, looked\r\nat each other. Meanwhile, the Sun went to his chambers in the western\r\nhills, and both the armies, O Bharata, slowly retired to their respective\r\ntents."

All of them with coats of mail torn and covered with dust, cast\r\nanxious glances around. Retiring from the field with Drona's consent,\r\nafter having been vanquished by their enemies of sure aim and humiliated\r\nby them in battle, they heard, as they proceeded, the countless merits of\r\nPhalguni praised by all creatures, and the friendship of Kesava for\r\nArjuna spoken of by all. They passed the night like men under a curse,\r\nreflecting upon the course of events and observing perfect silence.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning, Duryodhana said unto Drona, these words, from petulance\r\nand wrath, and in great cheerlessness of heart at the sight of the\r\nprosperity of their foe. Skilled in speech, and filled with rage at the\r\nsuccess of the foe, the king said these words in the hearing of all the\r\ntroops, 'O foremost of regenerate ones, without doubt thou hast set us\r\ndown for men who should be destroyed by thee. Thou didst not seize\r\nYudhishthira today even though thou hadst got him within thy reach. That\r\nfoe whom thou wouldst seize in battle is incapable of escaping thee if\r\nonce thou gettest him within sight, even if he be protected by the\r\nPandavas, aided by the very gods. Gratified, thou gavest me a boon; now,\r\nhowever, thou dost not act according to it. They that are noble (like\r\nthee), never falsify the hopes of one devoted to them.' Thus addressed by\r\nDuryodhana, Bharadwaja's son felt greatly ashamed. Addressing the king,\r\nhe said, 'It behoveth thee not to take me to be such. I always endeavour\r\nto achieve what is agreeable to thee. The three worlds with the gods, the\r\nAsuras, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Nagas and the Rakshasas, cannot\r\ndefeat the force that is protected by the diadem-decked (Arjuna). There\r\nwhere Govinda, the Creator of the universe is, and there where Arjuna is\r\nthe commander, whose might can avail, save three-eyed Mahadeva's, O lord?\r\nO sire, I tell the truly today and it will not be otherwise. Today, I\r\nwill slay a mighty car-warrior, one of the foremost heroes of the\r\nPandavas. Today I will also form an array that impenetrable by the very\r\ngods. Do, however, O king, by some means take Arjuna away from the field.\r\nThere is nothing that he doth not know or cannot achieve in battle. From\r\nvarious places hath he acquired all that is to be known about battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'After Drona had said these words, the Samsaptakas\r\nonce more challenged Arjuna to battle and took him away to the southern\r\nside of the field. Then an encounter took place between Arjuna and his\r\nenemies, the like of which had never been seen or heard of. On the other\r\nhand, the array formed by Drona, O king, looked resplendent. Indeed, that\r\narray was incapable of being looked at like the sun himself when in his\r\ncourse he reaches the meridian and scorches (everything underneath).\r\nAbhimanyu, at the command, O Bharata, of his sire's eldest brother,\r\npierced in battle that impenetrable circular array in many places. Having\r\nachieved the most difficult feats and slain heroes by thousands, he was\r\n(at last) encountered by six heroes together. In the end, succumbing to\r\nDuhsasana's son, O lord of earth, Subhadra's son, O chastiser of foes,\r\ngave up his life. At this we were filled with great joy and the Pandavas\r\nwith great grief. And after Subhadra's son had been slain, our troops\r\nwere withdrawn for nightly rest.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing, O Sanjaya, of the slaughter of the son\r\n(Abhimanyu), yet in his minority, of that lion among men, (viz., Arjuna),\r\nmy heart seems to break into pieces. Cruel, indeed, are the duties of\r\nKshatriyas as laid down by the legislators, in as much as brave men,\r\ndesirous of sovereignty scrupled not to shoot their weapons at even a\r\nchild. O son of Gavalgana, tell me how so many warriors, accomplished in\r\narms, slew that child who, though brought up in luxury, yet careered over\r\nthe field so fearlessly. Tell me, O Sanjaya, how our warriors behaved in\r\nbattle with Subhadra's son immeasurable energy who had penetrated into\r\nour car-array.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'That which thou askest me, O king, viz., the slaughter of\r\nSubhadra's son, I will describe to thee in detail. Listen, O monarch,\r\nwith attention. I shall relate to thee how that youth, having penetrated\r\ninto our ranks, played with his weapons, and how the irresistible heroes\r\nof thy army, all inspired by hope of victory, were afflicted by him. Like\r\nthe denizens of a forest abounding with plants and herbs and trees, when\r\nsurrounded on all sides by a forest conflagration, the warriors of thy\r\narmy were all filled with fear.'\""

Reverence for\r\nsuperiors, keeping counsels, humility, self-restraint, beauty of person,\r\nand bravery--these six--are ever present in Nakula. In knowledge of\r\nscriptures, gravity, sweetness of temper, righteousness and prowess, the\r\nheroic Sahadeva is equal to the Aswins themselves.

In it were\r\nplaced all the kings (of our side) that are each equal to Sakra himself.\r\nAt the entrance were stationed all the princes possessed of solar\r\neffulgence. All of them had taken oaths (about standing by one another).\r\nAll of them had standards decked with gold. All of them were attired in\r\nred robes, and all had red ornaments. All of them had red banners and all\r\nwere adorned with garlands of gold, smeared with sandal-paste and other\r\nperfumed unguents; they were decked with floral wreaths. In a body they\r\nrushed towards Arjuna's son, desirous of battle. Firm bowmen, all they\r\nnumbered ten thousand. Placing thy handsome grandson, Lakshmana, at their\r\nhead, all of them, sympathising with one another in joy and grief, and\r\nemulating one another in feats of courage, desiring to excel one another,\r\nand devoted to one another's good, they advanced to battle. Duryodhana, O\r\nmonarch, was stationed in the midst of his forces. And the king was\r\nsurrounded by the mighty car-warriors, Karna, Duhsasana, and Kripa, and\r\nhad a white umbrella held over his head. And fanned with yak tails, he\r\nlooked resplendent like the chief of the celestials.

The valiant son of Bharadwaja,\r\nhowever, fearlessly checked all those warriors, as soon as they came\r\nnear, with a thick shower of arrows. Like a mighty wave of waters coming\r\nagainst an impenetrable hill, or the surging sea itself approaching its\r\nbank, those warriors were pushed back by Drona. And the Pandavas, O king,\r\nafflicted by the shafts shot from Drona's bow, were unable to stay before\r\nhim. And the strength of Drona's arms that we saw was wonderful in the\r\nextreme, inasmuch as the Panchalas and the Srinjayas failed to approach\r\nhim. Beholding Drona advancing in rage. Yudhishthira thought of diverse\r\nmeans for checking his progress. At last, regarding Drona incapable of\r\nbeing resisted by any one else, Yudhishthira placed that heavy and\r\nunbearable burden on the son of Subhadra. Addressing Abhimanyu, that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, who was not inferior to Vasudeva himself and\r\nwhose energy was superior to that of Arjuna, the king said, 'O child, act\r\nin such a way that Arjuna, returning (from the Samsaptakas), may not\r\nreprove us. We do not know how to break the circular array. Thyself, or\r\nArjuna or Krishna, or Pradyumna, can pierce that array. O mighty-armed\r\none, no fifth person can be found (to achieve that teat). O child, it\r\nbehoveth thee, O Abhimanyu, to grant the boon that thy sires, thy\r\nmaternal uncles, and all these troops ask of thee.

I shall not be able, however, to come out if any kind\r\nof danger overtakes me.'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, 'Break this array once, O foremost of warriors, and\r\nmake a passage for us. All of us will follow thee in the track by which\r\nthou wilt go. In battle, thou art equal to Dhananjaya himself. Seeing\r\nthee enter, we shall follow thee, protecting thee on all sides.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhima said, 'I myself will follow thee, and Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki,\r\nand the Panchalas, and the Prabhadrakas. After the array once is broken\r\nby thee, will enter it repeatedly and slay the foremost warriors within\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"Abhimanyu said, 'I will penetrate into this invincible array of Drona,\r\nlike an insect filled with rage entering a blazing fire. Today, I will do\r\nthat which will be beneficial to both races (viz., my sire's and my\r\nmother's). I will do that which will please my maternal uncle as also my\r\nmother.

Then Arjuna's son, superior to Arjuna's\r\nself eased in golden mail and owning an excellent standard that bore the\r\ndevice of a Karnikara tree, fearlessly encountered, from desire of\r\nbattle, warriors headed by Drona, like a lion-cub assailing a herd of\r\nelephants. Those warriors then, filled with joy, began to strike\r\nAbhimanyu while he endeavoured to pierce their array. And for a moment an\r\nagitation took place there, like to the eddy that is seen in the ocean\r\nwhere the current of the Ganga mingles with it. The battle, O king, that\r\ncommenced there, between those struggling heroes striking one another,\r\nbecame fierce and terrible. And during the progress of that awful battle,\r\nArjuna's son, in the very sight of Drona, breaking that array, penetrated\r\ninto it. Then large bodies of elephants and steeds and cars and infantry,\r\nfilled with joy, encompassed that mighty warrior after he had thus\r\npenetrated into the midst of the foe, and commenced to smite him.\r\n[Causing the earth to resound] with noise of diverse musical instruments,\r\nwith shouts and slaps of arm-pits and roars, with yells and leonine\r\nshouts, with exclamations of 'Wait, Wait,' with fierce confused voices\r\nwith cries of, 'Do not go, Wait, Come to me', with repeated exclamations\r\nof, 'This one, It is I, The foe,' with grunt of elephants, with the\r\ntinkling of bells and ornaments, with bursts of laughter, and the clatter\r\nof horse-hoofs and car-wheels, the (Kaurava) warriors rushed at the son\r\nof Arjuna. That mighty hero, however, endued with great lightness of\r\nhands and having a knowledge of the vital parts of the body, quickly\r\nshooting weapons capable of penetrating into the very vitals, stew those\r\nadvancing warriors. Slaughtered by means of sharp shafts of diverse\r\nkinds, those warriors became perfectly helpless, and like insects falling\r\nupon a blazing fire, they continued to fall upon Abhimanyu on the field\r\nof battle. And Abhimanyu strewed the earth with their bodies and diverse\r\nlimbs of their bodies like priests strewing the altar at a sacrifice with\r\nblades of Kusa grass. And Arjuna's son cut off by thousands the arms of\r\nthose warriors. And some of these were eased in corslets made of iguana\r\nskin and some held bows and shafts, and some held swords or shields or\r\niron hooks and reins; and some, lances of battle axes. And some held\r\nmaces or iron balls or spears and some, rapiers and crow-bars and axes.\r\nAnd some grasped short arrows, or spiked maces, or darts, or Kampanas.\r\nAnd some had goads and prodigious conchs; and some bearded darts and\r\nKachagrahas. And some had mallets and some other kinds of missiles. And\r\nsome had nooses, and some heavy clubs, and some brickbats. And all those\r\narms were decked with armlets and laved with delightful perfumes and\r\nunguents. And with those arms dyed with gore and looking bright the field\r\nof battle became beautiful, as if strewn, O sire, with five-headed snakes\r\nslain by Garuda. And Phalguni's son also scattered over the field of\r\nbattle countless heads of foes, heads graced with beautiful noses and\r\nfaces and locks, without pimples, and adorned with ear-rings. Blood\r\nflowed from those heads copiously, and the nether-lips in all were bit\r\nwith wrath. Adorned with beautiful garlands and crowns and turbans and\r\npearls and gems, and possessed of splendour equal to that of the sun or\r\nthe moon, they seemed to be like lotuses severed from their stalks.\r\nFragrant with many perfumes, while life was in them, they could speak\r\nwords both agreeable and beneficial. Diverse cars, well-equipped, and\r\nlooking like the vapoury edifices in the welkin, with shafts in front and\r\nexcellent bamboo poles and looking beautiful with the standards set up on\r\nthem, were deprived of their Janghas, and Kuvaras, and Nemis, and\r\nDasanas, and wheels, and standards and terraces. And the utensils of war\r\nin them were all broken.[64] And the rich clothes with which they were\r\noverlaid, were blown away, and the warriors on them were slain by\r\nthousands. Mangling everything before him with his shafts, Abhimanyu was\r\nseen coursing on all sides. With his keen-edged weapons, he cut into\r\npieces elephant-warriors, and elephants with standards and hooks and\r\nbanners, and quivers and coats of mail, and girths and neck-ropes and\r\nblankets, and bells and trunks and tusks as also the foot-soldiers that\r\nprotected those elephants from behind. And many steeds of the Vanayu, the\r\nhilly, the Kamvoja, and the Valhika breeds, with tails and ears and eyes\r\nmotionless and fixed, possessed of great speed, well-trained, and ridden\r\nby accomplished warriors armed with swords and lances, were seen to be\r\ndeprived of the excellent ornaments on their beautiful tails. And many\r\nlay with tongues lolling out and eyes detached from their sockets, and\r\nentrails and livers drawn out. And the riders on their backs lay lifeless\r\nby their sides. And the rows of bells that adorned them were all torn.\r\nStrewn over the field thus, they caused great delight to Rakshasas and\r\nbeasts of prey. With coats of mail and other leathern armour (casing\r\ntheir limbs) cut open, they weltered in excreta ejected by themselves.\r\nThus slaying many foremost of steeds of thy army, Abhimanyu looked\r\nresplendent. Alone achieving the most difficult feat, like the\r\ninconceivable Vibhu himself in days of old, Abhimanyu crushed thy vast\r\nhost of three kinds of forces (cars, elephants, and steeds), like the\r\nthree-eyed (Mahadeva) of immeasurable energy crushing the terrible Asura\r\nhost. Indeed, Arjuna's son, having achieved in battle feats incapable of\r\nbeing borne by his foes, everywhere mangled large divisions of\r\nfoot-soldiers belonging to thy army. Beholding then thy host extensively\r\nslaughtered by Subhadra's son single-handed with his whetted shafts like\r\nthe Asura host by Skanda (the celestial generalissimo), thy warriors and\r\nthy sons cast vacant looks on all sides. Their mouths became dry; their\r\neyes became restless; their bodies were covered with sweat; and their\r\nhairs stood on their ends. Hopeless of vanquishing their foe, they set\r\ntheir hearts on flying away from the field. Desirous of saving their\r\nlives, called one another by their names and the names of their families,\r\nand abandoning their wounded sons and sires and brothers and kinsmen and\r\nrelatives by marriage lying around on the field, they endeavoured to fly\r\naway, urging their steeds and elephants (to their utmost speed).'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding his army routed by Subhadra's son of\r\nimmeasurable energy, Duryodhana, filled with rage, himself proceeded\r\nagainst the former. Seeing the king turn back towards Subhadra's son in\r\nbattle, Drona, addressing all the (Kaurava) warriors, said, 'Rescue the\r\nking.[65] Before us, in our very sight, the valiant Abhimanyu is slaying\r\nall he aims at. Rush ye, therefore, speedily against him, without fear\r\nand protect the Kuru king.' Then many grateful and mighty warriors,\r\nhaving Duryodhana's good at heart, and always graced with victory,\r\ninspired with fear, surrounded thy son. And Drona, and Drona's son, and\r\nKripa and Karna and Kritavarman and Suvala's son, Vrihadvala, and the\r\nruler of the Madras, and Bhuri, and Bhurisravas, and Sala, and Paurava\r\nand Vrishasena, shooting sharp shafts, checked Subhadra's son by means of\r\nthose arrowy showers. Confounding him with those showers of shafts, they\r\nrescued Duryodhana. The son of Arjuna, however, brooked not that act of\r\nsnatching a morsel from his mouth. Covering those mighty car-warriors,\r\ntheir charioteers, and steeds with thick showers of arrows and causing\r\nthem to turn back, the son of Subhadra uttered a leonine roar. Hearing\r\nthat roar of his, resembling that of a lion hungering after prey, these\r\nangry car-warriors, headed by Drona, brooked it not. Encompassing him on\r\nall sides, O sire, with a large body of cars they shot at him showers of\r\ndiverse kinds of arrows. The grandson, however, cut them off in the\r\nwelkin (before any of them could reach him) by means of sharp shafts, and\r\nthen pierced all of them with his shafts. That feat of his seemed\r\nexceedingly wonderful. Provoked by him thus by means of those shafts of\r\nhis that resembled snakes of virulent poison, they surrounded that\r\nunretreating son of Subhadra, desirous of slaying him. That sea of\r\n(Kaurava) troops, however, O bull of Bharata's race, the son of Arjuna\r\nsingly held in check by means of his shafts, like the continent resisting\r\nthe surging ocean. And among those heroes thus fighting with and striking\r\none another, viz., Abhimanyu and his man on one side and all those\r\nwarriors together on the other, none turned back from the field. In that\r\ndreadful and fierce battle, Duhsaha pierced Abhimanyu with nine shafts.\r\nAnd Duhsasana pierced him with a dozen; and Saradwata's son Kripa, with\r\nthree. And Drona pierced him with seventeen shafts, each resembling a\r\nsnake of virulent poison. And Vivinsati, pierced him with seventy shafts,\r\nand Kritavarman with seven. And Vrihadvala pierced him with eight, and\r\nAswatthaman with seven shafts. And Bhurisrava pierced him with three\r\nshafts and the ruler of the Madras with six. And Sakuni pierced him with\r\ntwo, and king Duryodhana with three shafts. The valiant Abhimanyu,\r\nhowever, O king, seemingly dancing on his car, pierced each of those\r\nwarriors in return with three shafts. Then Abhimanyu, filled with rage in\r\nconsequence of thy sons' endeavouring to frighten him thus, displayed the\r\nwonderful strength he had acquired from culture and practice. Borne by\r\nhis well-broken steeds, endued with the speed of Garuda or the Wind, and\r\nthoroughly obedient to the behests of him who held their reins, he\r\nquickly checked the heir of Asmaka. Staying before him, the handsome son\r\nof Asmaka, endued with great might, pierced him with ten shafts and\r\naddressing him, said, 'Wait, Wait.' Abhimanyu then, with ten shafts, cut\r\noff the former's steeds and charioteer and standard and two arms and bow\r\nand head, and caused them to fall down on the earth, smiling the while.\r\nAfter the heroic ruler of the Asmakas had thus been slain by the son of\r\nSubhadra, the whole of his force wavered and began to fly away from the\r\nfield. Then Karna and Kripa, and Drona and Drona's son, and the ruler of\r\nthe Gandharas, and Sala and Salya, and Bhurisravas and Kratha, and\r\nSomadatta, and Vivinsati, and Vrishasena, and Sushena, and Kundavedhin,\r\nand Pratardana, and Vrindaraka and Lalithya, and Pravahu, and\r\nDrighalochana, and angry Duryodhana, showered their arrows upon him. Then\r\nAbhimanyu, excessively pierced by those great bowmen with their straight\r\nshafts, shot shafts at Karna which was capable of piercing through every\r\narmour and body. That shaft, piercing through Karna's coat of mail and\r\nthen his body, entered the earth like a snake piercing through an\r\nanthill. Deeply pierced, Karna felt great pain and became perfectly\r\nhelpless. Indeed, Karna began to tremble in that battle like a hill\r\nduring an earthquake. Then with three other shafts of great sharpness,\r\nthe mighty son of Arjuna, excited with rage, slew those three warriors,\r\nviz., Sushena, Drighalochana, and Kundavedhin. Meanwhile, Karna\r\n(recovering from the shock) pierced Abhimanyu with five and twenty\r\nshafts. And Aswatthaman struck him with twenty, and Kritavarman with\r\nseven. Covered all over with arrows, that son of Sakra's son, filled with\r\nrage, careered over the field. And he was regarded by all the troops as\r\nYama's self armed with the noose. He then scattered over Salya, who\r\nhappened to be near him thick showers of arrows. That mighty-armed\r\nwarrior then uttered loud shouts, frightening thy troops therewith.\r\nMeanwhile, Salya, pierced by Abhimanyu accomplished in weapons, with\r\nstraight shafts penetrating into his very vitals, sat down on the terrace\r\nof his car and fainted away. Beholding Salya thus pierced by the\r\ncelebrated son of Subhadra, all the troops fled away in the very sight of\r\nBharadwaja's son. Seeing that mighty-armed warrior, viz., Salya, thus\r\ncovered with shafts of golden wings, thy army fled away like a head of\r\ndeer attacked by a lion. And Abhimanyu glorified by the Pitris, the gods,\r\nand Charanas, and Siddhas, as also by diverse classes of creatures on the\r\nearth, with praises about (his heroism and skill in) battle, looked\r\nresplendent like a sacrificial fire fed with clarified butter.'\""

So quick were his movements that none could obtain a\r\nsight of his person.

And they said, 'Thou shalt not escape us with\r\nlife today!' Hearing them say so, the son of Subhadra, smiling the while,\r\npierced with his shafts those amongst them that had pierced him first.\r\nDisplaying diverse weapons of beautiful look and of great celerity, the\r\nheroic son of Arjuna battled mildly with them. Those weapons that he had\r\nreceived from Vasudeva and those that he had received from Dhananjaya,\r\nAbhimanyu displayed in the very same way as Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.\r\nDisregarding the heavy burthen he had taken upon himself and casting off\r\nall fear, he repeatedly shot his arrows. No interval, again, could be\r\nnoticed between his aiming and letting off an arrow. Only his trembling\r\nbow drawn to a circle could be seen on every side, looking like the\r\nblazing disc of the autumnal sun. And the twang of his bow, and the slap\r\nof his palms, O Bharata, were heard to resound like the roaring of clouds\r\ncharged with thunder. Modest, wrathful, reverential to superiors, and\r\nexceedingly handsome, the son of Subhadra, out of regard for the hostile\r\nheroes, fought with them mildly. Commencing gently, O king, he gradually\r\nbecame fierce, like the illustrious maker of the day when autumn comes\r\nafter the season of the rains is over.

O son of Gavalgana, ten me\r\neverything once more in detail about the encounter of youthful Abhimanyu,\r\nwhich seems to have been pretty like Skanda's encounter with the Asura\r\nhost.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'I will relate to thee that fearful encounter that fierce\r\nbattle, as it took place between one and the many. Mounted upon his car,\r\nAbhimanyu, with great daring, showered his arrows on the warriors of thy\r\narmy mounted on their cars, all of whom were chastisers of foes, endued\r\nwith great courage. Careering with great speed like a circle of fire, he\r\npierced Drona and Karna, and Kripa, and Salya and Drona's son, and\r\nKritavarman of the Bhoja race, and Vrihadvala, and Duryodhana, and\r\nSomadatta, and mighty Sakuni, and diverse kings and diverse princes and\r\ndiverse bodies of troops. While engaged in slaying his foes by means of\r\nsuperior weapons, the valiant son of Subhadra, endued with mighty energy,\r\nseemed, O Bharata, to be present everywhere. Beholding that conduct of\r\nSubhadra's son of immeasurable energy, thy troops trembled repeatedly.\r\nSeeing that warrior of great proficiency in battle, Bharadwaja's son of\r\ngreat wisdom, with eyes expanded in joy, quickly came towards Kripa, and\r\naddressing him said, as if crushing (by that speech of his) the very\r\nvitals of thy son, O Bharata, the following words, 'Yonder cometh the\r\nyouthful son of Subhadra at the head of the Parthas, delighting all his\r\nfriends, and king Yudhishthira, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhimasena,\r\nthe son of Pandu, and all his kinsmen, and relatives by marriage, and all\r\nwho are watching the battle as spectators without taking any part in it.\r\nI do not regard any bowman to be his equal in battle. If only he\r\nentertains the wish, he can slay this vast host. It seems, that for some\r\nreason or other, he doth not entertain that wish.' Hearing these words of\r\nDrona, so expressive of the gratification he felt, thy son, enraged with\r\nAbhimanyu, looked at Drona, faintly smiling the while. Indeed, Duryodhana\r\nsaid unto Karna and king Valhika and Duhsasana and the ruler of the\r\nMadras and the many other mighty car-warriors of his army, these words,\r\n'The preceptor of the entire order of the Kshatriyas,--he that is the\r\nforemost of all conversant with Brahma, doth not, from stupefaction, wish\r\nto slay this son of Arjuna. None can, in battle, escape the preceptor\r\nwith life, not even the Destroyer himself, if the latter advanceth\r\nagainst the preceptor as a foe. What, O friend, shall we say then of any\r\nmortal? I say this truly. This one is the son of Arjuna, and Arjuna is\r\nthe preceptor's disciple. It is for this that the preceptor protecteth\r\nthis youth. Disciples and sons and their sons are always dear to the\r\nvirtuous people. Protected by Drona, the youthful son of Arjuna regardeth\r\nhimself valourous. He is only a fool entertaining a high opinion of\r\nhimself. Crush him, therefore, without delay.' Thus addressed by the Kuru\r\nking, those warriors, O monarch, excited with rage and desirous of\r\nslaying their foe, rushed, in the very sight of Drona at the son of\r\nSubhadra that daughter of the Satwata race. Duhsasana, in particular,\r\nthat tiger among the Kurus, hearing those words of Duryodhana, answered\r\nthe latter, saying, 'O monarch, I tell thee that even I will slay this\r\none in the very sight of the Pandavas and before the eyes of the\r\nPanchalas. I shall certainly devour the son of Subhadra today, like Rahu\r\nswallowing Surya (sun).' And once more addressing the Kuru king loudly,\r\nDuhsasana said, 'Hearing that Subhadra's son hath been slain by me, the\r\ntwo Krishnas, who are exceedingly vain, will without doubt, go to the\r\nregion of the departed spirits, leaving this world of men. Hearing then\r\nof the death of the two Krishnas, it is evident that the other sons born\r\nof Pandu's wives, with all their friends, will, in course of a single\r\nday, cast away their lives from despair. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nthis one foe of thine being slain, all thy foes will be slain. Wish me\r\nwell, O king, even I will slay this foe of thine.' Having said these\r\nwords, O king, thy son Duhsasana, filled with rage and uttering a loud\r\nroar, rushed against the son of Subhadra and covered him with showers of\r\narrows. Abhimanyu then, O chastiser of foes, received that son of thine\r\nthus advancing upon him wrathfully, with six and twenty arrows of sharp\r\npoints. Duhsasana, however, filled with rage, and looking like an\r\ninfuriated elephant, fought desperately with Abhimanyu, the son of\r\nSubhadra in that battle. Both of them masters in car-fight, they fought\r\non describing beautiful circles with their cars, one of them to the left\r\nand other to the right. The warriors then, with their Panavas and\r\nMridangas and Dundubhis and Krakachas and great Anakas and Bheris and\r\nJharjaras, caused a deafening noise mingled with leonine roars, such as\r\narise from the great receptacle of salt waters!\""

In the assembly (for the\r\nKurus) and in the hearing of king Dhritarashtra, thou hadst, with thy\r\nharsh speeches, angered king Yudhishthira. Relying on the deception of\r\nthe dice and the skill (therein) of Suvala's son, thou hadst also\r\nmaddened by success, addressed many delirious speech to Bhima![67] In\r\nconsequence of the anger of those illustrious persons, thou art, at last,\r\nabout to obtain the fruit of that conduct of thine![68].

O Kaurava, today I\r\nshall free myself of the debt I owe to Bhima. With life thou shalt not\r\nescape me, if indeed, thou dost not abandon the battle.' Having said\r\nthese words, that mighty-armed warrior, that slayer of hostile heroes,\r\naimed a shaft endued with the splendour of Yama or of Agni or of the\r\nWind-god, capable of despatching Duhsasana to the other world. Quickly\r\napproaching Duhsasana's bosom, that shaft fell upon his shoulder-joint\r\nand penetrated into his body up to the very wings, like a snake into an\r\nant-hill. And soon Abhimanyu once more struck him with five and twenty\r\narrows whose touch resembled that of fire, and which were sped from his\r\nbow drawn to its fullest stretch, Deeply pierced and greatly pained,\r\nDuhsasana, sat down on the terrace of his car and was, O king, overtaken\r\nby a swoon. Afflicted thus by the arrows of Subhadra's son and deprived\r\nof his senses, Duhsasana. was speedily borne away from the midst of the\r\nfight by his charioteer. Beholding this, the Pandavas, the five sons of\r\nDraupadi, Virata, the Panchalas, and the Kekayas, uttered leonine shouts.\r\nAnd the troops of the Pandavas, filled with joy, caused diverse kinds of\r\nmusical instruments to be beat and blown. Beholding that feat of\r\nSubhadra's son they laughed with joy. Seeing that implacable and proud\r\nfoe of theirs thus vanquished, those mighty car-warriors, viz., the\r\n(five) sons of Draupadi, who had on their banners the images of Yama and\r\nMaruta and Sakra and the twin Aswins, and Satyaki, and Chekitana, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin, and the Kekayas, and Dhrishtaketu, and the\r\nMatsyas, Panchalas, and the Srinjayas, and the Pandavas headed by\r\nYudhishthira, were filled with joy. And all of them rushed with speed,\r\ndesirous of piercing Drona's array. Then a dreadful battle took place\r\nbetween the warriors and those of the foe, All of them were unretreating\r\nheroes, and inspired by desire of victory. During the progress of that\r\ndreadful encounter, Duryodhana, O monarch, addressing the son of Radha,\r\nsaid, 'Behold, the heroic Duhsasana, who resembleth the scorching sun who\r\nwas hitherto slaying the foe in battle, hath at last himself succumbed to\r\nAbhimanyu. The Pandavas also, filled with rage and looking fierce like\r\nmighty lions, are rushing towards us, desirous of rescuing the son of\r\nSubhadra.' Thus addressed, Karna with rage and desirous of doing good to\r\nthy son, rained showers of sharp arrows on the invincible Abhimanyu. And\r\nthe heroic Karna, as if in contempt of his antagonist, also pierced the\r\nlatter's followers on the field of battle, with many excellent shafts of\r\ngreat sharpness. The high-souled Abhimanyu, however, O king, desirous of\r\nproceeding against Drona, quickly pierced Radha's son with three and\r\nseventy shafts. No car-warrior of thy army succeeded at that time in\r\nobstructing the progress towards Drona, of Abhimanyu, who was the son of\r\nIndra's son and who was afflicting all the foremost car-warriors of the\r\nKaurava host. Then Karna, the most honoured of all bowmen, desirous of\r\nobtaining victory, pierced the son of Subhadra with hundreds of arrows,\r\ndisplacing his best weapons. That foremost of all persons conversant with\r\nweapons, that valiant disciple of Rama, by means of his weapons, thus\r\nafflicted Abhimanyu who was incapable of being defeated by foes. Though\r\nafflicted in battle by Radha's son with showers of weapons, still\r\nSubhadra's son who resembled a very celestial (for prowess) felt no pain.\r\nWith his shafts whetted on stone and furnished with sharp points, the son\r\nof Arjuna, cutting off the bows of many heroic warriors, began to afflict\r\nKarna in return. With shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison and\r\nshot from his bow drawn to a circle, Abhimanyu quickly cut off the\r\numbrella, standard, the charioteer, and the steeds of Karna, smiling the\r\nwhile. Karna then shot five straight arrows at Abhimanyu. The son of\r\nPhalguna, however, received them fearlessly. Endued with great valour and\r\ncourage, the latter then, in a moment, with only a single arrow, cut off\r\nKarna's bow and standard and caused them to drop down on the ground.\r\nBeholding Karna in such distress, his younger brother, drawing the bow\r\nwith great force, speedily proceeded against the son of Subhadra. The\r\nParthas then, and their followers uttered loud shouts and beat their\r\nmusical instruments and applauded the son of Subhadra [for his heroism].'\""

And Karna's brother, with\r\nten shafts, pierced invincible Abhimanyu and his umbrella and standard\r\nand charioteer and steeds, smiling the while. Beholding Abhimanyu thus\r\nafflicted with those arrows, although he had achieved those superhuman\r\nfeats in the manner of his sire and grandsire, the warriors of thy army\r\nwere filled with delight. Then Abhimanyu, forcibly bending the bow and\r\nsmiling the while, with one winged arrow cut off his antagonist's head.\r\nThat head, severed from the trunk, fell down on the earth. Beholding his\r\nbrother slain and overthrown, like a Karnikara tree shaken and thrown\r\ndown by the wind from the mountain top, Karna, O monarch, was filled with\r\npain. Meanwhile, the son of Subhadra, causing Karna by means of his\r\narrows to turn away from the field, quickly rushed against the other\r\ngreat bowmen. Then Abhimanyu of fierce energy and great fame, filled with\r\nwrath, broke that host of diverse forces abounding with elephants and\r\nsteeds and cars and infantry. As regards Karna, afflicted by Abhimanyu\r\nwith countless shafts, he fled away from the field borne by swift steeds.\r\nThe Kaurava array then broke. When the welkin was covered with\r\nAbhimanyu's shafts, like flights of locusts or thick showers of rain,\r\nnothing, O monarch, could be distinguished. Amongst thy warriors thus\r\nslaughtered by Abhimanyu with sharp shafts, none, O monarch, stayed any\r\nlonger on the field of battle except the ruler of the Sindhus. Then that\r\nbull among men, viz., the son of Subhadra, blowing his conch, speedily,\r\nfell upon the Bharata host, O bull of Bharata's race! Like a burning\r\nbrand thrown into the midst of dry grass, Arjuna's son began to consume\r\nhis foes, quickly careering through the Kaurava army. Having pierced\r\nthrough their array, he mangled cars and elephants and steeds and human\r\nbeings by means of his sharp shafts and caused the field of battle teem\r\nwith headless trunks. Cut off by means of excellent arrows shot from the\r\nbow of Subhadra's son, the Kaurava warriors fled away, slaying, as they\r\nfled, their own comrades before them. Those fierce arrows, of terrible\r\neffect whetted on stone and, countless in number, slaying car-warriors\r\nand elephants, steeds, fell fast on the field. Arms, decked with Angadas\r\nand other ornaments of gold, cut off and hands cased in leathern covers,\r\nand arrows, and bows, and bodies and heads decked with car-rings and\r\nfloral wreaths, lay in thousands on the field. Obstructed with Upashkaras\r\nand Adhishthanas and long poles also with crushed Akshas and broken\r\nwheels and yokes, numbering thousands, With darts and bows and swords and\r\nfallen standards, and with shields and bows lying all about, with the\r\nbodies, O monarch, of slain Kshatriyas and steeds and elephants, the\r\nfield of battle, looking exceedingly fierce, soon became impassable. The\r\nnoise made by the princes, as they called upon One another while\r\nslaughtered by Abhimanyu, became deafening and enhanced the fears of the\r\ntimid. That noise, O chief of the Bharatas, filled all the points of the\r\ncompass. The son of Subhadra, rushed against the (Kaurava) troops,\r\nslaying foremost of car-warriors and steeds and elephants, Quickly\r\nconsuming his foes, like a fire playing in the midst of a heap of dry\r\ngrass, the son of Arjuna was seen careering through the midst of the\r\nBharata army. Encompassed as he was by our troops and covered with dust,\r\nnone of us could obtain a sight of that warrior when, O Bharata, he was\r\ncareening over the field in all directions, cardinal and subsidiary. And\r\nhe took the lives of steeds and elephants and human warriors, O Bharata,\r\nalmost incessantly. And soon after we saw him (come out of the press).\r\nIndeed, O monarch, we beheld him then scorching his foes like the\r\nmeridian sun (scorching everything with his rays). Equal to Vasava\r\nhimself in battle, that son of Vasava's son viz., Abhimanyu, looked\r\nresplendent in the midst of the (hostile) army.'\""

Indeed, Abhimanyu's sires accompanied\r\nby his maternal uncles, those smiters of foes, arrayed in order of battle\r\nrushed along the self-same path that Abhimanyu had created, desirous of\r\nrescuing him.. Beholding those heroes rushing, thy troops turned away\r\nfrom the fight. Seeing then that vast army of thy son turning away from\r\nthe fight, the son-in-law of great energy rushed to rally them. Indeed,\r\nking Jayadratha, the son of the ruler of the Sindhus, checked, with all\r\ntheir followers, the Parthas, desirous of rescuing their son. That fierce\r\nand great bowman, viz. the son of Vriddhakshatra, invoking into existence\r\ncelestial weapons resisted the Pandavas, like an elephant sporting in a\r\nlow land.'[70]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I think, Sanjaya, that heavy was the burthen thrown\r\nupon the ruler of the Sindhus, inasmuch as alone he had to resist the\r\nangry Pandavas desirous of rescuing their son. Exceedingly wonderful, I\r\nthink, was the might and heroism of the ruler of the Sindhus. Tell me\r\nwhat the high-souled warrior's prowess was and how he accomplished that\r\nforemost of feats. What gifts did he make, what libations had he poured,\r\nwhat sacrifices had he performed, what ascetic austerities had he well\r\nundergone, in consequence of which, single-handed, he succeeded in\r\nchecking Parthas excited with wrath?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'On the occasion of his insult to Draupadi, Jayadratha was\r\nvanquished by Bhimasena. From a keen sense of his humiliation, the king\r\npractised the severest of ascetic austerities, desirous of a boon.\r\nRestraining his senses from all objects dear to them, bearing hunger,\r\nthirst and heat, he reduced his body till his swollen veins became\r\nvisible. Uttering the eternal words of the Veda, he paid his adoration to\r\nthe god Mahadeva. That illustrious Deity, always inspired with compassion\r\nfor his devotees, at last, became kind towards him. Indeed, Hara,\r\nappearing in a dream unto the ruler of the Sindhus, addressed him, saying\r\n'Solicit the boon thou desirest. I am gratified with thee, O Jayadratha!\r\nWhat dost thou desire?' Thus addressed by Mahadeva, Jayadratha, the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, bowed down unto him and said with joined palms and\r\nrestrained soul, 'Alone, on a single car, I shall check in battle all the\r\nsons of Pandu, endued though they are with terrible energy and prowess.'\r\nEven this, O Bharata, was the boon he had solicited. Thus prayed to that\r\nforemost of the deities said unto Jayadratha, 'O amiable one, I grant\r\nthee the boon. Except Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, thou shalt in battle\r\ncheck the four other sons of Pandu.' 'So be it,' said Jayadratha unto\r\nthat Lord of the gods and then awoke, O monarch, from his slumber. In\r\nconsequence of that boon which he had received and of the strength also\r\nof his celestial weapons, Jayadratha, single-handed, held in check the\r\nentire army of the Pandavas. The twang of his bow-string and the slaps of\r\nhis palms inspired the hostile Kshatriyas with fear, filling thy troops,\r\nat the same time with delight. And the Kshatriyas (of the Kuru army),\r\nbeholding that the burthen was taken up by the ruler of the Sindhus,\r\nrushed with loud shouts, O monarch, to that part of the field where\r\nYudhishthira's army was.'\""

Large steeds of the Sindhu breed, well-trained and fleet as\r\nthe wind, and obedient to the commands of the charioteer, bore him (on\r\nthat occasion). His car, duly equipped, looked like a vapoury edifice in\r\nthe welkin. His standard bearing the device of a large boar in silver,\r\nlooked exceedingly beautiful. With his white umbrella and banners, and\r\nthe yak-tails with which he was fanned--which are regal indications--he\r\nshone like the Moon himself in the firmament. His car-fence made of iron\r\nwas decked with pearls and diamonds and gems and gold. And it looked\r\nresplendent like the firmament bespangled with luminous bodies. Drawing\r\nhis large bow and scattering countless shafts, he once more filled up\r\nthat array in those places where openings had been made by the son of\r\nArjuna. And he pierced Satyaki with three arrows, and Vrikodara with\r\neight; and having pierced Dhrishtadyumna. with sixty arrows, he pierced\r\nDrupada with five sharp ones, and Sikhandin with ten. Piercing then the\r\nKaikeyas with five and twenty arrows, Jayadratha pierced each of the five\r\nsons of Draupadi with three arrows. And piercing Yudhishthira then with\r\nseventy arrows, the ruler of the Sindhus pierced the other heroes of the\r\nPandava army with thick showers of shafts. And that feat of his seemed\r\nexceedingly wonderful. Then, O monarch, the valiant son of Dharma, aiming\r\nJayadratha's bow, cut it off with a polished and well-tempered shaft,\r\nsmiling the while. Within the twinkling, however, of the eye, the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus took up another bow and piercing Pratha (Yudhishthira)\r\nwith ten arrows struck each of the others with three shafts. Marking that\r\nlightness of hands showed by Jayadratha, Bhima then with three\r\nbroad-headed shafts, quickly felled on the earth his bow, standard and\r\numbrella. The mighty Jayadratha then, taking up another bow, strung it\r\nand felled Bhima's standard and bow and steeds. O sire! His bow cut off,\r\nBhimasena then jumping down from that excellent car whose steeds had been\r\nslain, mounted on the car of Satyaki, like a lion jumping to the top of a\r\nmountain. Seeing this, thy troops were filled with joy. And they loudly\r\nshouted, 'Excellent! Excellent!' And they repeatedly applauded that feat\r\nof the ruler of the Sindhus. Indeed, all creatures highly applauded that\r\nfeat of his, which consisted in his resisting, single-handed, all the\r\nPandavas together, excited with wrath. The path that the son of Subhadra\r\nhad made for the Pandavas by the slaughter of numerous warriors and\r\nelephants was then filled up by the ruler of the Sindhus. Indeed, those\r\nheroes, viz., the Matsyas, the Panchalas, the Kaikeyas, and the Pandavas,\r\nexerting themselves vigorously, succeeded in approaching the presence of\r\nJayadratha, but none of them could bear him. Everyone amongst thy enemies\r\nwho endeavoured to pierce the array that had been formed by Drona, was\r\nchecked by the ruler of the Sindhus in consequence of the boon he had got\r\n(from Mahadeva).'\""

Against that chastiser of foes then, viz.,\r\nthe son of Subhadra, who was thus agitating the hostile host with his\r\narrowy showers, the principal warriors of the Kaurava army rushed, each\r\naccording to his rank and precedence. The clash between them of\r\nimmeasurable energy, scattering their arrowy showers with great force, on\r\nthe one side and Abhimanyu alone on the other, became awful. The son, of\r\nArjuna, encompassed on all sides by those enemies with crowds of cars,\r\nslew the charioteer of Vrishasena and also cut off his bow. And the\r\nmighty Abhimanyu then pierced Vrishasena's steeds with his straight\r\nshafts, upon which those coursers, with the speed of the wind, bore\r\nVrishasena away from the battle. Utilizing that opportunity, Abhimanyu's\r\ncharioteer freed his car from that press by taking it away to another\r\npart of the field. Those numerous car-warriors then, (beholding this\r\nfeat) were filled with joy and exclaimed, 'Excellent! Excellent!'

The latter pierced Abhimanyu with sixty shafts\r\nof golden wings and addressing him, said, 'As long as I am alive, thou\r\nshalt not escape with life.' Cased though he was in an iron coat of mail,\r\nthe son of Subhadra pierced him in the chest with a far-reaching shaft.\r\nThereupon Vasatiya fell down on the earth, deprived of life. Beholding\r\nVasatiya slain, many bulls among Kshatriyas became filled with wrath, and\r\nsurrounded thy grandson, O king, from a desire of slaying him. They\r\napproached him, stretching their countless bows of diverse kinds, and the\r\nbattle then that took place between the son of Subhadra and his foes was\r\nexceedingly fierce. Then the son of Phalguni, filled with wrath, cut off\r\ntheir arrows and bows, and diverse limbs of their bodies, and their heads\r\ndecked with ear-rings and floral garlands. And arms were seen lopped off,\r\nthat were adorned with various ornaments of gold, and that Still held\r\nscimitars and spiked maces and battle-axes and the fingers of which were\r\nstill cased in leathern gloves.

Possessed\r\nof prowess resembling that of Sakra himself, the mighty son of Sakra's\r\nson, viz., Abhimanyu, agitating the Katirava army looked exceedingly\r\nresplendent. Penetrating into the Katirava host, O king, that destroyer\r\nof foremost Kshatriyas resembling Yama himself, seized Satvasravas, like\r\nan infuriated tiger seizing a deer. Beholding Satyasrayas, seized by him,\r\nmany mighty car-warriors, taking up diverse kinds of weapons, rushed upon\r\nhim. Indeed, those bulls among Kshatriyas, from a spirit of rivalry,\r\nrushed at the son of Arjuna from desire of slaying him, all exclaiming,\r\n'I shall go first, I shall go first!' As a whale in the sea obtaining a\r\nshoal of small fish seizes them with the greatest ease, even so did\r\nAbhimanyu receive that whole division of the rushing Kshatriyas. Like\r\nrivers that never go back when they approach the sea, none amongst those\r\nunretreating Kshatriyas turned back when they approached Abhimanyu. That\r\narmy then reeled like a boat tossed on the ocean when overtaken by a\r\nmighty tempest, (with its crew) afflicted with panic caused by the\r\nviolence of the wind. Then the mighty Rukmaratha, son of the ruler of the\r\nMadras, for assuring the frightened troops, fearlessly said, 'Ye heroes,\r\nye need not fear! When I am here, what is Abhimanyu? Without doubt, I\r\nwill seize this one a living captive'. Having said these words, the\r\nvaliant prince, borne on his beautiful and well-equipped car, rushed at\r\nAbhimanyu. Piercing Abhimanyu with three shafts in the chest, three in\r\nthe right arm, and three other sharp shafts in the left arm, he uttered a\r\nloud roar. Phalguni's son, however, cutting off his bow, his right and\r\nleft arms, and his head adorned with beautiful eyes and eye-brows quickly\r\nfelled them on the earth.

Within the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, those princes, by means of their shafts of golden\r\nwings, and of diverse forms and great impetuosity, made Arjuna's son\r\ninvisible. Himself, his standard, and his car, O sire, were seen by us\r\ncovered with shafts like (trees overwhelmed with) flights of locusts.\r\nDeeply pierced, he became filled with rage like an elephant struck with\r\nthe hook.

Quickly displaying his\r\nweapons, he careered in that battle like a circle of fire, and was, O\r\nking, seen sometimes as a single individual, sometimes as a hundred, and\r\nsometimes as a thousand ones. Confounding his foes by the skill with\r\nwhich his car was guided and by the illusion caused by his weapons, he\r\ncut in a hundred pieces, O monarch, the bodies of the kings (opposed to\r\nhim). By means of his sharp shafts the lives of living creatures were\r\ndespatched. These, O king attained to the other world while their bodies\r\nfell down on the earth. Their bows, and steeds and charioteers, and\r\nstandards, and armies decked with Angadar, and heads, the son of Phalguni\r\ncut off with his sharp shafts. Those hundred princes were slain and\r\nfelled by Subhadra's son like a tope of five-year old mango-trees just on\r\nthe point of bearing fruit (laid low by a tempest). Beholding those\r\nyouthful princes brought up in every luxury, and resembling angry snakes\r\nof virulent poison, all slain by the single-handed Abhimanyu, Duryodhana\r\nwas filled with fear.

Almost all these, O king, were beaten back\r\nby thy grandson. Only one warrior then, viz., Lakshmana, brought up in\r\nluxury, accomplished in arrows, endued with great energy, and fearless in\r\nconsequence of inexperience and pride, proceeded against the son of\r\nArjuna. Anxious about his son, his father (Duryodhana) turned back for\r\nfollowing him. Other mighty car warriors, turned back for following\r\nDuryodhana. All of them then drenched Abhimanyu with showers of arrows,\r\nlike clouds pouring rain on the mountain-breast.

Like one infuriated\r\nelephant encountering another, Arjuna's son then encountered thy\r\ninvincible grandson, Lakshmana, of great personal beauty, endued with\r\ngreat bravery, staying near his father with outstretched bow, brought up\r\nin every luxury, and resembling a second prince of the Yakshas[74].\r\nEncountering Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of\r\nSubhadra, had his two arms and chest struck with his sharp shafts. Thy\r\ngrandson, the mighty-armed Abhimanyu then, filled with rage like a snake\r\nstruck (with a rod), addressing, O king, thy (other) grandson, said,\r\n'Look well on this world, for thou shalt (soon) have to go to the other.\r\nIn the very sight of all thy kinsmen, I will despatch thee to Yama's\r\nabode.' Saying thus that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the mighty-armed\r\nson of Subhadra, took out a broad-headed arrow that resembled a snake\r\njust emerged from its slough. That shaft, sped by Abhimanyu's arms, cut\r\noff the beautiful head, decked with ear-rings, of Lakshmana, that was\r\ngraced with a beautiful nose, beautiful eye-brows, and exceedingly\r\ngood-looking curls. Beholding Lakshmana slain, thy troops uttered\r\nexclamations of Oh and, Alas. Upon the slaughter of his dear son,\r\nDuryodhana became filled with rage.

Piercing them with sharp arrows and beating them off from him,\r\nthe son of Arjuna fell with great speed and fury upon the vast forces of\r\nJayadratha. Thereupon, the Kalingas, the Nishadas, and the valiant son of\r\nKratha, all clad in mail, cut off his path by encompassing him with their\r\nelephant-division.

Drona's son, however, in\r\nreturn, piercing Abhimanyu. with sixty fierce arrows of great impetuosity\r\nand keen sharpness, failed to make him tremble, for the latter, pierced\r\nby Aswatthaman, stood immovable like the Mainaka mountain. Endued with\r\ngreat energy, the mighty Abhimanyu then pierced his antagonist with three\r\nand seventy straight arrows, equipped with wings of gold. Drona then,\r\ndesirous of rescuing his son, pierced Abhimanyu with a hundred arrows.\r\nAnd Aswatthaman pierced him with sixty arrows, desirous of rescuing his\r\nfather. And Karna struck him with two and twenty broad-headed arrows and\r\nKritavarman struck him with four and ten. And Vrihadvala pierced him with\r\nfifty such shafts, and Saradwata's son, Kripa, with ten. Abhimanyu,\r\nhowever, pierced each of these in return with ten shafts. The ruler of\r\nthe Kosala struck Abhimanyu, in the chest with a barbed arrow. Abhimanyu,\r\nhowever, quickly felled on the earth his antagonist's steeds and standard\r\nand bow and charioteer. The ruler of the Kosalas, then, thus deprived of\r\nhis car, took up a sword and wished to sever from Abhimanyu's trunk his\r\nbeautiful head, decked with ear-rings. Abhimanyu then pierced king\r\nVrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, in the chest, with a strong arrow.\r\nThe latter then, with riven heart, fell down. Beholding this, ten\r\nthousand illustrious kings broke and fled. Those kings, armed with swords\r\nand bows, fled away, uttering words inimical (to king Duryodhana's\r\nInterest). Having slain[77] Vrihadvala thus, the son of Subhadra careered\r\nit battle, paralysing thy warriors,---those great bowmen,--by means of\r\narrowy downpours, thick as rain.'\"[78]"

The son of Radha pierced Abhimanyu in return with as\r\nmany shafts. Covered all over with arrows, Abhimanyu, then, O sire,\r\nlooked exceedingly beautiful. Filled with rage, he caused Karna also to\r\nbe bathed in blood. Mangled with arrows and covered with blood, the brave\r\nKarna also shone greatly.[79] Both of them pierced with arrows, both\r\nbathed in blood, those illustrious warriors then resembled a couple of\r\nflowering Kinsukas. The son of Subhadra then slew six of Karna's brave\r\ncounsellors, conversant with all modes of warfare, with their steeds and\r\ncharioteers and cars. As regards other great bowmen Abhimanyu fearlessly\r\npierced each of them in return, with ten arrows. That feat of his seemed\r\nhighly wonderful. Slaying next the son of the ruler of the Magadhas,\r\nAbhimanyu, with six straight shafts, slew the youthful Aswaketu with his\r\nfour steeds and charioteer. Then slaying, with a sharp razor-headed\r\narrow, the Bhoja prince of Martikavata, bearing the device of an elephant\r\n(on his banner), the son of Arjuna uttered a loud shout and began to\r\nscatter his shafts on all sides. Then the son of Duhsasana pierced the\r\nfour steeds of Abhimanyu with four shafts, his charioteer with one and\r\nAbhimanyu himself with ten. The son of Arjuna, then, piercing Duhsasana's\r\nson with ten fleet shafts, addressed him in a loud tone and with eyes red\r\nin wrath, said, 'Abandoning the battle, thy sire hath fled like a coward.\r\nIt is well thou knowest how to fight. Thou shalt not, however, escape\r\ntoday with life.' Saying these words unto him, Abhimanyu sped a long\r\narrow, well polished by smith's hand, at his foe. The son of Drona cut\r\nthat arrow with three shafts of his own. Leaving Aswatthaman alone,\r\nArjuna's son struck Salya, in return, fearlessly pierced him in the chest\r\nwith highly nine shafts, equipped with vulture's feathers. That feat\r\nseemed highly wonderful. The son of Arjuna then cut off Salya's bow and\r\nslew both his Parshni charioteers. Abhimanyu then pierced Salya himself\r\nwith six shafts made wholly of iron. Thereupon, the latter, leaving that\r\nsteedless car, mounted another. Abhimanyu then slew five warriors., named\r\nSatrunjaya, and Chandraketu, and Mahamegba, and Suvarchas, and\r\nSuryabhasa. He then pierced Suvala's son. The latter piercing Abhimanyu\r\nwith three arrows, said unto Duryodhana, 'Let us all together grind this\r\none, else, fighting singly with us he will slay us all. O king, think of\r\nthe means of slaying this one, taking counsel with Drona and Kripa and\r\nothers.' The Karna, the son of Vikartana, said unto Drona, 'Abhimanyu\r\ngrindeth us all. Tell us the means by which we may slay him.' Thus\r\naddressed, the mighty bowman, Drona, addressing them all, said,\r\n'Observing him with vigilance, have any of you been able to detect any\r\ndefeat in this youth? He is careening in all directions. Yet have any of\r\nyou been able to detect today the least hole in him? Behold the lightness\r\nof hand and quickness of motion of this lion among men, this son of\r\nArjuna. In the track of his car, only his bow drawn to a circle can be\r\nseen, so quickly is he aiming his shafts and so quickly is he letting\r\nthem off. Indeed, this slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of\r\nSubhadra, gratifieth me although he afflicteth my vital breath and\r\nstupefieth me with shafts. Even the mightiest car-warriors, filled with\r\nwrath, are unable to detect any flaw in him. The son of Subhadra,\r\ntherefore, careering on the field of battle, gratifieth me greatly. I do\r\nnot see that in battle there is any difference between the wielder of\r\nGandiva himself and this one of great lightness of hand, filling all the\r\npoints of the horizon with his mighty shafts.' Hearing these words,\r\nKarna, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna's son, once more said unto\r\nDrona, 'Exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Abhimanyu, I am staying\r\nin battle, only because (as a warrior) I should stay here. Indeed, the\r\narrows of this south of great energy are exceedingly fierce. Terrible as\r\nthey are and possessed of the energy of fire, these arrows are weakening\r\nmy heart.' The preceptor then, slowly and with a smile, said unto Karna,\r\n'Abhimanyu is young, his prowess is great. His coat of mail is\r\nimpenetrable. This one's father had been taught by me the method of\r\nwearing defensive armour. This subjugator of hostile towns assuredly\r\nknoweth the entire science (of wearing armour). With shafts well shot,\r\nyou can, however, cut off his bow, bow-string, the reins of his steeds,\r\nthe steeds themselves, and two Parshni charioteers. O mighty bowman, O\r\nson of Radha, if competent, do this. Making him turn back from the fight\r\n(by this means), strike him then. With his bow in hand he is incapable of\r\nbeing vanquished by the very gods and the Asuras together. If you wish,\r\ndeprive him of his car, and divest him of his bow.'. Hearing these words\r\nof the preceptor, Vikartana's son Karna quickly cut off, by means of his\r\nshafts, the bow of Abhimanyu, as the latter was shooting with great\r\nactivity. He, of Bhoja's race (viz., Kritavarman) then slew his steeds,\r\nand Kripa slew his two Parshni charioteers. The others covered him with\r\nshowers of arrows after he had been divested of his bow. Those six great\r\ncar-warriors, with great speed, when speed was so necessary, ruthlessly\r\ncovered that carless youth, fighting single-handed with them, with\r\nshowers of arrows. Bowless and carless, with an eye, however, to his duty\r\n(as a warrior), handsome Abhimanyu, taking up a sword and a shield,\r\njumped into the sky. Displaying great strength and great activity, and\r\ndescribing the tracks called Kausika and others, the son of Arjuna\r\nfiercely coursed through the sky, like the prince of winged creatures\r\n(viz., Garuda.). 'He may fall upon me sword in hand,' with such thoughts,\r\nthose mighty bowmen, were on the lookout for the laches of Abhimanyu, and\r\nbegan to pierce him in that battle, with their gaze turned upwards. Then\r\nDrona of mighty energy, that conqueror of foes with a sharp arrow quickly\r\ncut off the hilt, decked with gems, of Abhimanyu's sword. Radha's son\r\nKarna, with sharp shafts, cut off his excellent shield. Deprived of his\r\nsword and shield thus, he came down, with sound limbs, from the welkin\r\nupon the earth. Then taking up a car-wheel, he rushed in wrath against\r\nDrona. His body bright with the dust of car-wheels, and himself holding\r\nthe car-wheel in his upraised arms, Abhimanyu looked exceedingly\r\nbeautiful, and imitating Vasudeva (with his discus), became awfully\r\nfierce for a while in that battle. His robes dyed with the blood flowing\r\n(from his wounds), his brow formidable with the wrinkles visible thereon,\r\nhimself uttering loud leonine roars, lord Abhimanyu of immeasurable\r\nmight, staying in the midst of those kings, looked exceedingly\r\nresplendent on the field of battle.'\""

With\r\nthe end of his locks waving in the air, with that supreme weapon upraised\r\nin his hands, his body became incapable of being looked at by the very\r\ngods. The kings beholding it and the wheel in his hands, became filled\r\nwith anxiety, and cut that off in a hundred fragments. Then that great\r\ncar-warrior, the son of Arjuna, took up a mighty mace. Deprived by them\r\nof his bow and car and sword, and divested also of his wheel by his foes,\r\nthe mighty-armed Abhimanyu (mace in hand) rushed against Aswatthaman.\r\nBeholding that mace upraised, which looked like the blazing thunderbolt,\r\nAswatthaman, that tiger among men, rapidly alighted from his car and took\r\nthree (long) leaps (for avoiding Abhimanyu). Slaying Aswatthaman's steeds\r\nand two Parshni charioteers with that mace of his, Subhadra's son,\r\npierced all over with arrows, looked like a porcupine. Then that hero\r\npressed Suvala's son, Kalikeya, down into the earth, and stew seven and\r\nseventy Gandhara followers of the latter. Next, he slew ten car-warriors\r\nof the Brahma-Vasatiya race, and then ten huge elephants. Proceeding next\r\ntowards the car of Duhsasana's son, he crushed the latter's car and\r\nsteeds, pressing them down into the earth. The invincible son of\r\nDuhsasan, then, O sire, taking up his mace, rushed at Abhimanyu. saying,\r\n'Wait, Wait!' Then those cousins, those two heroes, with upraised maces,\r\nbegan to strike each other, desirous of achieving each other's death,\r\nlike three-eyed (Mahadeva) and (the Asura) Andhaka in the days of old. I\r\nach of those chastisers of foes, struck with the other's mace-ends fell\r\ndown on the earth, like two uprooted standards erected to the honour of\r\nIndra. Then Duhsasana's son, that enhancer of the fame of the Kurus,\r\nrising up first, struck Abhimanyu with the mace on the crown of his head,\r\nas the latter, was on the point of rising. Stupefied with the violence of\r\nthat stroke as also with the fatigue he had undergone, that slayer of\r\nhostile hosts, viz., the son of Subhadra, fell on the earth, deprived of\r\nhis senses. Thus, O king, was one slain by many in battle,--one who had\r\nground the whole army, like an elephant grinding lotus-stalks in a lake.\r\nAs he lay dead on the field, the heroic Abhimanyu looked like a wild\r\nelephant slain by the hunters, The fallen hero was then surrounded by thy\r\ntroops. And he looked like an extinguished fire in the summer season\r\nafter (as it lies) having consumed a whole forest, or like a tempest\r\ndivested of its fury after having crushed mountain crests;[80] or like\r\nthe sun arrived at the western hills after having blasted with his heat\r\nthe Bharata host; or like Soma swallowed up by Rahu; or like the ocean\r\nreft of water. The mighty car-warriors of thy army beholding Abhimanyu\r\nwhose face had the splendour of the full moon, and whose eyes were\r\nrendered beautiful in consequence of lashes black as the feathers of the\r\nraven, lying prostrate on the bare earth, were filled with great joy. And\r\nthey repeatedly uttered leonine shouts. Indeed, O monarch, thy troops\r\nwere in transports of joy, while tears fell fast from the eyes of the\r\nPandava heroes. Beholding the heroic Abhimanyu lying on the field of\r\nbattle, like the moon dropped from the firmament, diverse creatures, O\r\nking, in the welkin, said aloud, 'Alas, this one lieth on the field,\r\nslain, while fighting singly, by six mighty car-warriors of the\r\nDhartarashtra army, headed by Drona and Karna. This act hath been, we\r\nhold, an unrighteous one.' Upon the slaughter of that hero, the earth\r\nlooked exceedingly resplendent like the star-bespangled firmament with\r\nthe moon. Indeed, the earth was strewn with shafts equipped with wings of\r\ngold, and covered with waves of blood. And strewn with the beautiful\r\nheads of heroes, decked with ear-rings and variegated turbans of great\r\nvalue, and banner and yak-tails and beautiful blankets, and begemmed\r\nweapons of great efficacy, and the bright ornaments of cars and steeds,\r\nand men and elephants, and sharp and well-tempered swords, looking like\r\nsnakes freed from their sloughs, and bows, and broken shafts, and darts,\r\nand swords, and lances, and Kampanas, and diverse other kinds of weapons,\r\nshe assumed a beautiful aspect. And in consequence of the steeds dead or\r\ndying, but all weltering in blood, with their riders (lying about them),\r\nfelled by Subhadra's son, the earth in many places became impassable. And\r\nwith iron hooks, and elephants--huge as hills--equipped with shields and\r\nweapons and standards, lying about, crushed with shafts, with excellent\r\ncars deprived of steeds and charioteers and car-warriors, lying scattered\r\non the earth, crushed by elephants and looking like agitated lakes, with\r\nlarge bodies of foot-soldiers decked with diverse weapons and lying dead\r\non the ground, the field of battle, wearing a terrible aspect, inspired\r\nall timid hearts with terror.\r\n\r\n\"Beholding Abhimanyu, resplendent as the sun or the moon, lying on the\r\nground, thy troops were in transport of joy, while Pandavas were filled\r\nwith grief. When youthful Abhimanyu, yet in his minority, fell, the\r\nPandava divisions, O king, fled away in the very sight of king\r\nYudhishthira. Beholding his army breaking upon the fall of Subhadra's\r\nson, Yudhishthira addressed his brave warriors, slaying, 'The heroic\r\nAbhimanyu, who without retreating from battle hath been slain, hath\r\ncertainly ascended to heaven. Stay then, and fear not, for we shall yet\r\nvanquish our foes.' Endued with great energy and great splendour, king\r\nYudhishthira the just, that foremost of warriors, saying such words unto\r\nhis soldiers inspired with grief, endeavoured to dispel their stupor. The\r\nking continued, 'Having in the first instance, slain in battle hostile\r\nprinces, resembling snakes of virulent poison, the son of Arjuna hath\r\nthen given up his life. Having slain ten thousand warriors, viz., the\r\nking of the Kosalas, Abhimanyu, who was even like Krishna or Arjuna\r\nhimself, hath assuredly gone to the abode of Indra. Having destroyed cars\r\nand steeds and men and elephants by thousands, he was still not content\r\nwith what he did. Performing as he did such meritorious feats, we should\r\nnot certainly grieve for him, he hath gone to the bright regions of the\r\nrighteous, regions that men acquire by meritorious deeds.'\""

And\r\nhe took away with him the splendour of our swords and darts, rapiers and\r\ncar-fences, and shields and ornaments. Causing the firmament and the\r\nearth to assume the same hue, the sun assumed his favourite form of fire.\r\nThe field of battle was strewn with the motionless bodies of innumerable\r\nelephants deprived of life, Looking like crests of cloud-capped hills\r\nriven by the thunder, and lying about with their standards and hooks and\r\nriders fallen from their backs. The earth looked beautiful with large\r\ncars crushed to pieces, and with their warriors and charioteers and\r\nornaments and steeds and standards and banners crushed, broken and torn.\r\nThose huge cars, O king, looked like living creatures deprived of their\r\nlives by the foe with his shafts. The field of battle assumed a fierce\r\nand awful aspect in consequence of large number of steeds and riders all\r\nlying dead, with costly trappings and blankets of diverse kinds scattered\r\nabout, and tongues and teeth and entrails and eyes of those creatures\r\nbulging out of their places. Men decked with costly coats of mail and\r\nornaments and robes and weapons, deprived of life, lay with slain steeds\r\nand elephants and broken cars, on the bare ground, perfectly helpless,\r\nalthough deserving of costly beds and blankets. Dogs and jackals, and\r\ncrown and cranes and other carnivorous birds, and wolves and hyenas, and\r\nravens and other food-drinking creatures, all diverse tribes of\r\nRakshasas, and large number of Pisachas, on the field of battle, tearing\r\nthe skins of the corpse and drinking their fat, blood and marrow, began\r\nto eat their flesh. And they began to suck also the secretions of rotten\r\ncorpses, while the Rakshasas laughed horribly and sang aloud, dragging\r\ndead bodies numbering thousands. An awful river, difficult to cross, like\r\nthe Vaitarani itself, was caused there by foremost of warriors. Its\r\nwaters were constituted by the blood (of fallen creatures). Cars\r\nconstituted the rafts (or, which to cross it), elephants formed its\r\nrocks, and the heads of human beings, its smaller stones. And it was miry\r\nwith the flesh (of slain steeds and elephants and men). And diverse kinds\r\nof costly weapons constituted the garlands (floating on it or lying on\r\nits banks). And that terrible river flowed fiercely through the middle of\r\nthe field of battle, wafting living creatures to the regions of the dead.\r\nAnd large numbers of Pisachas, of horrible and repulsive forms, rejoiced,\r\ndrinking and eating in that stream. And dogs and jackals and carnivorous\r\nbirds, all eating of the same food, and inspiring living creatures with\r\nterror, held their high carnival there. And the warriors, gazing on that\r\nfield of battle which, enhancing the population of Yama's domain,\r\npresented such an awful sight, and where human corpses rising up, began\r\nto dance, slowly left it as they beheld the mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu\r\nwho resembled Sakra himself, lying on the field, his costly ornaments\r\ndisplaced and fallen off, and looking like a sacrificial fire on the\r\naltar no longer drenched with clarified butter.'\""

Encompassed by countless foes on the field of battle,\r\nhe sped thousands of shafts at those warriors and the elephants that\r\nsurrounded him. Having achieved the most difficult feats in battle, O\r\nYudhishthira, that scorcher of foes was, at last, slain in the midst of\r\nthe army. Performing the obsequies of his son, king Akampana cleansed\r\nhimself.[83] Grieving, however, for his son day and night, the king\r\nfailed to regain happiness of mind. Informed of his grief on account of\r\nthe death of his son, the celestial Rishi Narada came to his presence.\r\nThe blessed king, beholding the celestial Rishi, told the latter\r\neverything that had happened unto him, viz., his defeat at the hands of\r\nhis foes, and the slaughter of his son. And the king said, 'My son was\r\nendued with great energy, and equalled Indra or Vishnu himself in\r\nsplendour. That mighty son of mine, having displayed his prowess on the\r\nfield against countless foes was at last slain! O illustrious one, who is\r\nthis Death? What is the measure of his energy, strength and prowess? O\r\nforemost of intelligent persons, I desire to hear all this truly.'\r\nHearing these words of his, the boon giving lord, Narada., recited the\r\nfollowing elaborate history, destructive of grief on account of a son's\r\ndeath.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada said. 'Listen, O mighty-armed king, to this long history, exactly\r\nas I have heard it, O monarch! In the beginning, the Grandsire Brahma\r\ncreated all creatures. Endued with mighty energy, he saw that the\r\ncreation bore no signs of decay. Thereat, O king, the Creator began to\r\nthink about the destruction of the universe. Reflecting on the matter, O\r\nmonarch, the Creator failed to find any means of destruction. He then\r\nbecame angry, and in consequence of his anger a fire sprang from the sky.\r\nThat fire spread in all directions for consuming everything of the\r\nuniverse. Then heaven, sky, and earth, all became filled with fire. And\r\nthus the Creator began to consume the whole mobile and immobile universe.\r\nThereby all creatures, mobile and immobile, were destroyed. Indeed, the\r\nmighty Brahma, frightening everything by the force of his wrath, did all\r\nthis, Then Hara, otherwise called Sthanu or Siva, with matted locks on\r\nhis head, that Lord of all wanderers of the night, appealed to the divine\r\nBrahma, the Lord of the gods. When Sthanu fell (at Brahma's feet) from a\r\ndesire of doing good to all creatures, the Supreme Deity to that greatest\r\nof ascetics, blazing with splendour, said, 'What wish of thine shall we\r\naccomplish, O thou that deservest to have all thy wishes fulfilled? O\r\nthou that hast been born of our wish! We shall do all that may be\r\nagreeable to thee! Tell us, O Sthanu, what is thy wish?'\""

Those very creatures, again, are now being consumed through thy\r\nfire. Seeing this, I am filled with compassion. O illustrious lord, be\r\ninclined to grace.'\r\n\r\n\"Brahma said, 'I had no desire of destroying the universe, I desired good\r\nof the earth, and it was for this that wrath possessed me. The goddess\r\nEarth, afflicted with the heavy weight of creatures, always urged me for\r\ndestroying the creatures on her. Urged by her, I could not however, find\r\nany means for the destruction of the infinite creation. At this wrath\r\npossessed me.'\r\n\r\n\"Rudra said, 'Be inclined to grace. O lord of the universe, cherish not\r\nthe wrath for the destruction of creatures. No more let creatures,\r\nimmobile and mobile, be destroyed. Through thy grace, O illustrious one,\r\nlet the threefold universe, viz., the Future, the Past, and the Present\r\nexist. Thou, O Lord, hadst blazed up with wrath. From that wrath of\r\nthine, a substance like fire sprang into existence, That fire is even now\r\nblasting rocks and trees and rivers, and all kinds of herbs and grass.\r\nIndeed, that fire is exterminating the immobile and the mobile universe.\r\nThe mobile and the immobile universe is being reduced to ashes. Be\r\ninclined to grace, O illustrious one! Do not give way to wrath. Even this\r\nis the boon I solicit, All created things, O divine Being, belonging to\r\nthee, are being destroyed. Therefore, let thy wrath be appeased. Let it\r\nbe annihilated in thy own self. Cast thy eye on thy creatures, inspired\r\nwith the desire of doing them good. Do that by which creatures endued\r\nwith life may not cease to be. Let not these creatures, with their\r\nproductive powers weakened be exterminated. O Creator of the worlds, thou\r\nhast appointed me their Protector, O Lord of the universe, let not the\r\nmobile and the immobile universe to be destroyed. Thou art inclined to\r\ngrace, and it is for this that I say these words unto thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada continued, Hearing these words (of Mahadeva) the divine Brahma,\r\nfrom desire of benefiting creatures, held in his own inner self his wrath\r\nthat had been roused. Extinguishing the fire, the divine Benefactor of\r\nthe world, the great Master, declared the duties of Production and\r\nEmancipation. And while the Supreme Deity exterminated that fire born of\r\nhis wrath, there came out from the doors of his diverse senses a female\r\nwho was dark and red and tawny, whose tongue and face and eyes were red,\r\nand who was decked with two brilliant ear-rings and diverse other\r\nbrilliant ornaments. Issuing out of his body, she smilingly looked at\r\nthose two lords of the universe and then set out for the southern\r\nquarter, Then Brahma, that controller of the creation and destruction of\r\nthe worlds, called after her by the name of Death. And Brahma, O king,\r\nsaid unto her, 'Slay these creatures of mine! Thou hast been born of that\r\nwrath of mine which I cherished for the destruction (of the universe). By\r\ndoing this, kill all creatures including idiots and seers at my command.\r\nBy doing this, thou wilt be benefited.' Thou lotus-lady, called Death,\r\nthus addressed by him reflected deeply, and then helplessly wept aloud in\r\nmelodious accents. The Grandsire then caught the tears she had shed, with\r\nhis two hands, for the benefit of all creatures, and began to implore her\r\n(with these words).'"

O divine\r\nLord, be inclined to grace. Sons and friends and brothers and sires and\r\nhusbands are always dear; (if I kill them), they who will suffer these\r\nlosses will seek to injure me. It is this that I fear. The tears that\r\nwill fall from the eyes of woe-stricken and weeping persons, inspire me\r\nwith fear, O Lord! I seek thy protection. O divine Being, O foremost of\r\ngods, I will not go to Yama's abode. O boon-giving one, I implore thee or\r\nthy grace, bowing my head and joining my palms.

The divine Brahma also, that Lord of the lord of all\r\ncreatures, remained silent. And soon the Grandsire became gratified in\r\nhis own self. And casting his eyes upon all the creation he smiled. And,\r\nthereupon, creatures continued to live as before i.e., unaffected by\r\npremature death. And upon that, invincible and illustrious Lord having\r\nshaken off his wrath, that damsel left the presence of that wise Deity.\r\nLeaving Brahma, without having agreed to destroy creatures, the damsel\r\ncalled Death speedily proceeded to the retreat called Dhenuka. Arrived\r\nthere, she practised excellent and highly austere vows. And she stood\r\nthere on one leg for sixteen billions of years, and five times ten\r\nbillions also, through pity for living creatures and from desire of doing\r\nthem good, and all the time restraining her senses from their favourite\r\nobjects. And once again, O king she stood there on one leg for one and\r\ntwenty times ten billions of years. And then she wandered for ten times\r\nten thousand billions of years with the creatures (of the earth), Next,\r\nrepairing to the sacred Nanda that was full of cool and pure water, she\r\npassed in those waters eight thousand years. Observing rigid vows at\r\nNanda, she cleansed herself of all her sins. Then she proceeded, first of\r\nall, to the sacred Kausiki, observant of vow. Living upon air and water\r\nonly, she practised austerities there, Repairing then to Panchaganga and\r\nnext to Vetasa, that cleansed damsel, by diverse kinds of especial\r\nausterities, emaciated her own body. Going next to the Ganga and thence\r\nto the great Meru, she remained motionless like a stone, suspending her\r\nlife-breath. Thence going to the top of Himavat, where the gods had\r\nperformed their sacrifice (in days of yore), that amiable and auspicious\r\ngirl remained for a billion of years standing on the toe only of her\r\nfeet. Wending then to Pushkara, and Gokarna, and Naimisha, and Malaya,\r\nshe emaciated her body, practising austerities agreeable to her heart.\r\nWithout acknowledging any other god, with steady devotion to the\r\nGrandsire, she lived and gratified the Grandsire in every way. Then the\r\nunchangeable Creator of the worlds, gratified said unto her, with a\r\nsoftened and delighted heart. 'O Death, why dost thou undergo ascetic\r\nausterities so severe?' Thus addressed, Death said unto the divine\r\nGrandsire, 'Creatures, O Lord, are living in health. They do not injure\r\none another even by words. I shall not be able to slay them. O Lord, I\r\ndesire even this boon at thy hands. I fear sin, and it is for this that I\r\nam engaged in ascetic austerities. O blessed one, undertake to remove for\r\never my fears. I am a woman, in distress, and without fault. I beg thee,\r\nbe thou protector. Unto her the divine Brahman acquainted with the past,\r\nthe present and the future, said, 'Thou shalt commit no sin, O Death, by\r\nslaying these creatures. My words can never be futile., O amiable one!\r\nTherefore, O auspicious damsel, slay these creatures of four kinds.\r\nEternal virtue shall always be thine. That Regent of the world, viz.,\r\nYama, and the diverse disease shall become thy helpmates. I myself and\r\nall the gods will grant thee boons, so that, freed from sin and perfectly\r\ncleansed, thou mayst even acquire glory.' Thus addressed, O monarch, that\r\nlady, joining her hands, once more said these words, seeking her grace by\r\nbowing down unto him with her head, If, O Lord, this is not to be without\r\nme, then thy command I place upon my head. Listen, however, to what I\r\nsay, Let covetousness, wrath, malice, jealousy, quarrel, folly and\r\nshamelessness, and other stern passions tear the bodies of all embodied\r\ncreatures.'\r\n\r\n\"Brahman said, 'It will be, O Death, as thou sayest. Meanwhile, slay\r\ncreatures duly. Sin shall not be thine, nor shall I seek to injure thee,\r\nO auspicious one. Those tear-drops of thine that are in my hands, even\r\nthey will become diseases, springing from living creatures themselves.\r\nThey will kill men; and if men are killed, sin shall not be thine.\r\nTherefore, do not fear, Indeed, sin shall not be thine. Devoted to\r\nrighteousness, and observant of thy duty, thou shalt sway (all\r\ncreatures). Therefore, take thou always the fives of these living\r\ncreatures. Casting off both desire and wrath, take thou the life of all\r\nliving creatures. Even thus will eternal virtue be thine. Sin will stay\r\nthose that are of wicked behaviour. By doing my bidding cleanse thyself.\r\nIt will be thine to sink them in their sins that are wicked. Therefore,\r\ncast off both desire and wrath, and kill these creatures endued with\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\n\"Narada continued, 'That damsel, seeing that she was (persistently)\r\ncalled by the name of Death, feared (to act otherwise). And in terror\r\nalso of Brahma's curse, she said, 'Yes!' Unable to do otherwise, she\r\nbegan, casting off desire and wrath, to take the lives of living\r\ncreatures when the time came (for their dissolution). It is only living\r\ncreatures that die. Diseases spring from living creatures themselves.\r\nDisease is the abnormal condition of creatures. They are pained by it.\r\nTherefore, indulge not in fruitless grief for creatures after they are\r\ndead. The senses, upon the death of creatures, go with the latter (to the\r\nother world), and achieving their (respective) functions, once more come\r\nback (with creatures when the latter are reborn). Thus all creatures, O\r\nlion among beings, the very gods included going, thither, have to act,\r\nlike mortals.[86] The wind, that is awful, of terrible roars and great\r\nstrength, omnipresent and endued with infinite energy, it is the wind\r\nthat will rive the bodies of living creatures. It will, in this matter\r\nput forth no active energy, nor will it suspend its functions; (but do\r\nthis naturally). Even all the gods have the appellation of mortals\r\nattached to them. Therefore, O lion among kings, do not grieve for thy\r\nson! Repairing to heaven, the son of thy body is passing his days in\r\nperpetual happiness, having obtained those delightful regions that are\r\nfor heroes. Casting off all sorrows, he hath attained to the\r\ncompanionship of the righteous. Death hath been ordained by the Creator\r\nhimself for all creatures! When their hour comes, creatures are destroyed\r\nduly. The death of creatures arises from the creatures themselves.\r\nCreatures kill themselves. Death doth not kill any one, armed with her\r\nbludgeon! Therefore, they that are wise, truly knowing death to be\r\ninevitable, because ordained by Brahma himself, never grieve for\r\ncreatures that are dead. Knowing this death to be ordained by the Supreme\r\nGod, cast off, without delay; thy grief for thy dead son!'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of grave import spoken by Narada,\r\nking Akampana, addressing his friend, said, 'O illustrious one, O\r\nforemost of Rishi, my grief is gone, and I am contented. Hearing this\r\nhistory from thee, I am grateful to thee and I worship thee.' That\r\nforemost of superior Rishi, that celestial ascetic of immeasurable soul,\r\nthus addressed by the king, proceeded to the woods of Nandava. The\r\nfrequent recital of this history for the hearing of others, as also the\r\nfrequent hearing of this history, is regarded as cleansing, leading to\r\nfame and heaven and worthy of approbation. It enhanceth besides, the\r\nperiod of life. Having listened to this instructive story, cast off thy\r\ngrief, O Yudhishthira, reflecting besides or, the duties of a Kshatriya\r\nand the high state (of blessedness) attainable by heroes. Abhimanyu, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, endued with mighty energy, having slain (numerous)\r\nfoes before the gaze of all bowmen, hath attained to heaven. The great\r\nbowman, that mighty car-warrior, struggling on the field, hath fallen in\r\nthe battle struck with sword and mace and dart, and bow. Sprung from\r\nSoma, he hath disappeared in the lunar essence, cleansed of all his\r\nimpurities. Therefore, O son of Pandu, mustering all thy fortitude.\r\nthyself with thy brothers, without allowing your senses to be stupefied\r\nspeedily set out, inflamed with rage, for battle.'\"[87]"

They were\r\nroyal sages, O regenerate one, that were sinless and truth-speaking. Once\r\nmore, address me in words of grave import, and console me with (accounts\r\nof) the feats of those royal sages of ancient times. What was the measure\r\nof the sacrificial gifts made by them? Who were those high-souled royal\r\nsages of righteous deeds that made them? Tell me all this, O illustrious\r\none!'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'There was a king of the name of Switya. He had a son who\r\nwas called Srinjaya. The Rishis Narada and Parvata were his friends. One\r\nday, the two ascetics, for paying Srinjaya a visit, came to his palace.\r\nDuly worshipped by Srinjaya, they became pleased with him, and continued\r\nto live with him happily. Once on a time as Srinjaya was seated at his\r\ncase with the two ascetics, his beautiful daughter of sweet smiles came\r\nto him. Saluted with reverence by his daughter, Srinjaya delighted that\r\ngirl standing by his side with proper benedictions of the kind she\r\ndesired. Beholding that maiden, Parvata smilingly asked Srinjaya, saying,\r\n'Whose daughter is this damsel of restless glances and possessed of every\r\nauspicious mark? Is she the splendour of Surya, or the flame of Agni? Or,\r\nis she any of these, viz., Sri, Hri, Kirti, Dhriti, Pushti, Siddhi, and\r\nthe splendour of Soma?' After the celestial Rishi (Parvata) said these\r\nwords, king Srinjaya answered, saying, 'O illustrious one, this girl is\r\nmy daughter. She beggeth my blessings.' Then Narada addressed king\r\nSrinjaya and said. 'If, O monarch, thou wishest for great good (to\r\nthyself), then give this daughter of thine unto me for a wife.' Delighted\r\n(with the Rishi's proposal), Srinjaya addressed Narada, saying, 'I give\r\nher unto thee.' At this, the other Rishi, viz., Parvata, indignantly\r\naddressed Narada, saying, 'Chosen before this by me, within my heart,\r\nthou hast taken this damsel as thy wife. And since thou hast done this,\r\nthou, O Brahmana, shalt not go to heaven as thy will.' Thus addressed by\r\nhim, Narada answered him, saying, 'The husband's heart and speech\r\n(directed thereto), (the giver's) consent, the speeches (of both), the\r\nactual gift made by sprinkling water, and the (recital of the mantras)\r\nordained for the seizure of the (bride's hand),--these have been declared\r\nto be indications by which one is constituted a husband. Even this\r\nceremonial is not all. That which (above all) is essential is the walk\r\nfor seven paces (by the bride in circumambulating the bridegroom).[88]\r\nWithout these thy purpose (about marriage) have been unaccomplished. Thou\r\nhast cursed. Therefore, thou also shalt not go to heaven without me.'\r\nHaving cursed each other those two Rishis continued to live there.\r\nMeanwhile, king Srinjaya, desirous of (obtaining) a son, began, with\r\ncleansed soul, to carefully entertain the Brahmanas, to the utmost of his\r\npower, with food and robes. After a certain time, those foremost of\r\nBrahmanas devoted to the study of the Vedas and fully conversant with\r\nthose scriptures and their branches became gratified with that monarch,\r\ndesirous of getting a son. Together they came to Narada and said unto\r\nhim, 'Give this king a son of the kind he desires.'--Thus addressed by\r\nthe Brahmanas, Narada replied unto them, saying, 'So be it.'--and then\r\nthe celestial Rishi addressed Srinjaya saying, 'O royal sage, the\r\nBrahmanas have been pleased and they wish thee a son! Solicit thou the\r\nboon, blessed be thou, about the kind of son thou desirest.' Thus\r\naddressed by him, the king, with joined hands, asked for a son possessed\r\nof every accomplishment, famous, of glorious feats, of great energy, and\r\ncapable of chastising all foes. And he further asked that the urine, the\r\nexcreta, the phlegm and the sweat of that child should be gold. And in\r\ndue time the king had a son born unto him, who came to be named\r\nSuvarnashthivin[89] on earth. And in consequence of the boon, that child\r\nbegan to increase (his father's) wealth beyond all limits. And king\r\nSrinjaya caused all desirable things of his to be made of gold. And his\r\nhouses and walls and forts, and the houses of all Brahmanas (within his\r\ndominions), and his beds, vehicles, and plates, and all manners of pots\r\nand cups, and palace that he owned, and all implements and utensils,\r\ndomestic and otherwise were made of gold. And in time his stock\r\nincreased. Then certain robbers hearing of the prince and seeing him to\r\nbe such, assembled together and sought to injure the king. And some\r\namongst them said, 'We will seize the king's son himself. He is his\r\nfather's mine of gold. Towards that end, therefore, we should strive.'\r\nThen those robbers inspired with avarice, penetrating into the king's\r\npalace, forcibly took away prince Suvarnashthivin. Having seized and\r\ntaken him to the woods, those senseless idiots, inspired with avarice but\r\nignorant of what to do with him, slew him there and cut his body in\r\nfragments. They saw not, however, any gold in him. After the prince was\r\nslain, all the gold, obtained in consequence of the Rishi's boon,\r\ndisappeared. The ignorant and senseless robbers struck one another. And\r\nstriking one another thus, they perished and with them that wonderful\r\nprince on the earth. And those men of wicked deeds sank in an\r\nunimaginable and awful hell. Seeing that son of his, obtained through the\r\nRishi's boon thus slain, that great ascetic, viz., king Srinjaya,\r\nafflicted with deep sorrow, began to lament in piteous accents. Beholding\r\nthe king afflicted with grief on account of his son, and thus weeping,\r\nthe celestial Rishi Narada showed himself in his presence. Listen, O\r\nYudhishthira, to what Narada said unto Srinjaya, having approached that\r\nking, who afflicted with grief and deprived of his senses, was indulging\r\nin piteous lamentations. Narada said, 'Srinjaya, with thy desires\r\nunfulfilled, thou shalt have to die, although we utterers of Brahma, live\r\nin thy house. Avikshit's son Marutta even, O Srinjaya, we hear, had to\r\ndie. Piqued with Vrihaspati, he had caused Samvatta[90] himself to\r\nofficiate at his great sacrifices! Unto that royal sage the illustrious\r\nlord (Mahadeva) himself had given wealth in the shape of a golden plateau\r\nof Himavat. (With that wealth) king Marutta had performed diverse\r\nsacrifices. Unto him, after the completion of his sacrifices diverse\r\ntribes of celestials, those creators of the universe, with Indra himself\r\nin their company and with Vrihaspati at their head, used to come. All the\r\ncarpets and furnitures of his sacrificial compound were of gold. The\r\nregenerate classes, desirous of food, all ate as they pleased, at his\r\nsacrifices, food that was clean and agreeable to their desires. And in\r\nall his sacrifices, milk and cards and clarified butter and honey, and\r\nother kinds of food and edibles, all of the best order, and robes and\r\nornaments covetable for their costliness, gratified Brahmanas, thoroughly\r\nconversant with the Vedas. The very gods used to become distributors of\r\nfood in king Marutta's palace. The Viswedevas were the courtiers of that\r\nroyal sage, the son of Avikshit. By him were gratified the denizens of\r\nheaven with libations of clarified butter. And gratified (therewith),\r\nthese, in their turn, increased that powerful ruler's wealth of crops\r\nwith copious showers of rain. He always contributed to the gratification\r\nof the Rishis, the Pitris, and the gods, and thereby made them happy, by\r\npractising Brahmacharya, study of the Vedas, obsequial rites, and all\r\nkinds of gifts. And his beds and carpets and vehicles, and his vast\r\nstores of gold difficult to be given away, in fact, all that untold\r\nwealth of his, was given away voluntarily unto the Brahmanas, Sakra\r\nhimself used to wish him well. His subjects were made happy (by him),\r\nActing always with piety, he (ultimately) repaired to those eternal\r\nregions of bliss, acquired by his religious merit. With his children and\r\ncounsellors and wives and descendants and kinsmen, king Marutta, in his\r\nyouth, ruled his kingdom for a thousand years. When such a king, O\r\nSrinjaya, died who was superior to thee, in respect of the four cardinal\r\nvirtues (viz., ascetic penances, truth, compassion, and liberality), and\r\nwho, superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, do not grieve saying\r\n'O Swaitya, for thy son who performed no sacrifice and gave no\r\nsacrificial present.'\""

The vanquisher of foes,\r\nviz., king Sivi. always slew the foremost of foes. He performed many\r\nsacrifices with presents in profusion unto the Brahmanas. That monarch of\r\ngreat prowess and great intelligence had acquired enormous wealth. In\r\nbattle: he won the applause of all Kshatriyas.[95] Having brought the\r\nwhole earth under subjection, he performed many Horse-sacrifices, without\r\nany obstruction, which were productive of great merit giving away (as\r\nsacrificial present) a thousand crores of golden nishkas, and many\r\nelephants and steeds and other kinds of animals, much grain, and many\r\ndeer and sheep. And king Sivi gave away the sacred earth consisting of\r\ndiverse kinds of soil unto the Brahmanas. Indeed, Usinara's son, Sivi,\r\ngave away as many kine as the number of rain-drops showered on the earth,\r\nor the number of stars in the firmament, or the number of sand-grains or,\r\nthe bed of Ganga, or the number of rocks that constitute the mountain\r\ncalled Meru, or the number of gems or of (aquatic) animals in the ocean.\r\nThe Creator himself hath not met with and will not meet within the past,\r\nthe present, or the future, another king capable of bearing the burdens\r\nthat king Sivi bore. Many were the sacrifices, with every kind of rites,\r\nthat king Sivi performed. In those sacrifices, the stakes, the carpets,\r\nthe houses, the walls, and the arches, were all made of gold. Food and\r\ndrink, agreeable to the taste and perfectly clean were kept in profusion.\r\nAnd the Brahmanas that repaired to them could be counted by myriads and\r\nmyriads. Abounding with viands of every description, nothing but\r\nagreeable words such as give away and take were heard there. Milk and\r\ncurds were collected in large lakes. In his sacrificial compound, there\r\nwere rivers of drink and white hills of food. 'Bathe, and drink and eat\r\nas ye like,' these were the only words heard there. Gratified with his\r\nrighteous deeds, Rudra granted Sivi a boon, saying, As thou givest away,\r\nlet thy wealth, thy devotion,--thy fame, thy religious acts, the love\r\nthat all creatures bear thee, and the heaven (thou attain), be all\r\ninexhaustible.' Having obtained all these desirable boons, even Sivi,\r\nwhen the time came, left this world for heaven.

His subjects were as much delighted with him, as a sire is\r\ndelighted with the children of his loins. Endued with immeasurable\r\nenergy, countless virtues were there in him. Of unfading glory, Rama, the\r\nelder brother of Lakshmana, at the command of his father, lived for\r\nfourteen years in the woods, with his wife. That bull among men slew in\r\nJanasthana fourteen thousand Rakshasas for the protection of the\r\nascetics. While dwelling there, the Rakshasa called Ravana, beguiling\r\nboth him and his companion (Lakshmana) abducted his wife, the princess of\r\nVideha. Like the Three-eyed (Mahadeva), in days of old, slaying (the\r\nAsura) Andhaka, Rama in wrath slew in battle that offender of Pulastya's\r\nrace who had never before been vanquished by any foe. Indeed, the\r\nmighty-armed Rama slew in battle that descendant of Pulastya's race with\r\nall his kinsmen and followers, that Rakshasa who was incapable of being\r\nslain by the gods and the Asuras together, that wretch who was a thorn\r\nunto the gods and the Brahmanas. In consequence of his affectionate\r\ntreatment of his subjects, the celestials worshipped Rama. Filling the\r\nentire earth with his achievements, he was much applauded even by the\r\ncelestial Rishis. Compassionate unto all creatures, that king, having\r\nacquired diverse realms and protected his subjects virtuously, performed\r\na great sacrifice without obstruction. And the lord, Rama, also performed\r\na hundred Horse-sacrifices and the great sacrifice called Jaruthya. And\r\nwith libations of clarified butter he contributed to Indra's delight.[96]\r\nAnd by these acts of his, Rama conquered hunger and thirst, and all the\r\ndiseases to which living creatures are subject. Possessed of every\r\naccomplishment, he always blazed forth with his own energy. Indeed, Rama,\r\nthe son of Dasaratha, greatly outshone all creatures. When Rama ruled his\r\nkingdom, the Rishis, the gods, and men, all lived together on the earth.\r\nThe lives of living creatures were never otherwise. The life-breaths\r\nalso, called Prana, Apana, Samana, and the others, when Rama ruled his\r\nkingdom, all performed their functions. All luminous bodies shone\r\nbrighter, and calamities never occurred. All his subjects were\r\nlong-lived. None died in youth. The dwellers of heaven highly gratified,\r\nused to get, according to (the ordinances of) the four Vedas, libations\r\nof clarified butter and other offerings of food made by men. His realms\r\nwere free from flies and gnats; and of beasts of prey and poisonous\r\nreptiles, there were none. And none was of unrighteous tendencies, none\r\nwas covetous, and none was ignorant. The subjects, of all the (four)\r\norders, were engaged in righteous and desirable acts, When the Rakshasas,\r\nabout this time obstructed the offerings to the Pitris and the worship of\r\nthe gods in Janasthana, Lord Rama, slaying them, caused those offerings\r\nand that worship to be once more given to the Pitris  and the gods. Men\r\nwere each blessed with a thousand children, and the period of their lives\r\nwas a thousand years. Seniors had never to perform Sraddhas of their\r\njuniors.[97] Youthful in shape, of a dark-blue hue, of red eyes,\r\npossessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, with arms reaching down\r\nto the knees, and beautiful and massive, of leonine shoulders, of great\r\nstrength, and beloved by all creatures, Rama ruled his kingdom for eleven\r\nthousand years. His subjects always uttered his name. While Rama ruled\r\nhis kingdom, the world became extremely beautiful. Taking at last his\r\nfour kinds of subjects[98] with him Rama went to heaven, having\r\nestablished his own line consisting of eight houses on the earth. When\r\neven he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four\r\ncardinal virtues and superior to thy son, thou shouldst not lament,\r\nsaying 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' for thy son who performed no sacrifice\r\nand made no sacrificial present.'\""

All those damsels were upon cars. And unto\r\nevery car were yoked four steeds, and behind each car were a hundred\r\nkine. And behind each cow were (many) goats and sheep. King Bhagiratha\r\ngave enormous presents at his sacrifices. For that reason a large\r\nconcourse of men assembled there. Afflicted there with Ganga was much\r\npained. 'Protect Me,' she said and sat down on his lap. And because Ganga\r\nthus sat upon his lap in days of old, therefore, she, like the celestial\r\ndancer Urvasi came to be regarded as his daughter and was named after his\r\nname. And having become the king's daughter, she became his son (by\r\nbecoming like a son, the means of salvation unto his deceased\r\nancestors).[100] Sweet-speeched Gandharvas of celestial splendour,\r\ngratified, sang all this in the hearing of the Rishis, the gods, and\r\nhuman beings.[101] Thus, O Srinjaya, did that goddess, viz., the\r\nocean-going Ganga, select lord Bhagiratha, descendant of Ikshvaku, the\r\nperformer of sacrifices with profuse gifts (to the Brahmanas), as her\r\nfather. His sacrifices were always graced with (the presence of) the very\r\ngods with Indra at their head. And the gods used to take their respective\r\nshares, by removing all impediments, to facilitate those sacrifices in\r\nevery way. Possessed of great ascetic merit, Bhagiratha gave unto the\r\nBrahmanas whatever benefit they desired without obliging them to stir\r\nfrom the place wherever they might entertain those desires. There was\r\nnothing which he could withhold from the Brahmanas. Every one received\r\nfrom him everything he coveted. At last, the king ascended to the region\r\nof Brahman, through the grace of the Brahmanas. For that object on which\r\nthe Rishis that subsisted on the rays of the sun used to wait upon the\r\nsun and the presiding deity of the sun, for that very object they used to\r\nwait upon the lord Bhagiratha, that ornament of the three worlds.

Beholding a wreath of smoke, the king (directed by\r\nit) went to a sacrifice and drank the sacred sacrificial butter that lay\r\nscattered there. (The king, thereupon, conceived).

That high-souled king had two hundred thousand cooks to distribute\r\nexcellent food, raw and cooked, like unto Amrita, unto the Brahmanas, by\r\nday and by night, who might come to his house as guests.[109] The king\r\ngave away unto the Brahmanas his wealth acquired by righteous means.\r\nHaving studied the Vedas, he subjugated his foes in fair fight. Of rigid\r\nvows and always engaged in due performance of sacrifices, countless\r\nanimals, desirous of going to heaven, used to come to him of their own\r\naccord.[110] So large was the number of animals sacrificed in the\r\nAgnihotra of that king that the secretions flowing from his kitchen from\r\nthe heaps of skins deposited there caused a veritable river which from\r\nthis circumstance, came to be called the Charmanwati.[111] He,\r\nincessantly gave away nishkas of bright gold unto the Brahmanas, 'I give\r\nthee nishkas.' 'I give thee nishkas,' these were the words incessantly\r\nuttered by him. 'I give thee,' 'I give thee' saying these words he gave\r\naway thousands of nishkas. And once again, with soft words to the\r\nBrahmanas, he gave away nishkas. Having given away, in course of a single\r\nday, one crore of such coins, he thought that he had given away very\r\nlittle. And, therefore, he would give away more. Who else is there that\r\nwould be able to give what he gave? The king gave away wealth, thinking,\r\nIf I do not give wealth in the hands of Brahmanas, great and eternal\r\ngrief, without doubt, will be mine.' For a hundred years, every\r\nfortnight, he gave unto thousands of Brahmanas a golden bull into each,\r\nfollowed by a century of kine and eight hundred pieces of nishkas. All\r\nthe articles that were needed for his Agnihotra, and all that were needed\r\nfor his other sacrifices, he gave away unto the Rishis, including\r\nKarukas[112] and water-pots and plates and beds and carpets and vehicles,\r\nand mansions and houses, and diverse kinds of trees, and various kinds of\r\nviands. Whatever utensils and articles Rantideva possessed were of gold.\r\nThey that are acquainted with the history of ancient times seeing the\r\nsuperhuman affluence of Rantideva, sing this song, viz., 'We have not\r\nseen such accumulated treasures even in the abode of Kuvera; what need be\r\nsaid, therefore, of human beings?' And people wonderingly said, Without\r\ndoubt, the kingdom of Rantideva is made of gold.[113] On such nights,\r\nwhen guests were assembled in the abode of Rantideva, one and twenty\r\nthousand kine were sacrificed (for feeding them). And yet the royal cook\r\nadorned with begemmed ear-rings, had to cry out, saying, 'Eat as much\r\nsoup as you like, for, of meat, there is not as much today as in other\r\ndays. Whatever gold was left belonging to Rantideva, he gave even that\r\nremnant away unto the Brahmanas during the progress of one of his\r\nsacrifices. In his very sight the gods used to take the libations of\r\nclarified butter poured into the fire for them, and the Pitris the food\r\nthat was offered to them, in Sraddhas. And all superior Brahmanas used to\r\nobtain from him (the means of gratifying) all their desires. When he\r\ndied, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four\r\ncardinal virtues and who, superior to thee was, therefore, much superior\r\nto thy son, thou shouldst not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve\r\nfor the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial\r\npresent.'\""

While only a child (living) in the forest, he achieved feats\r\nincapable of being achieved by others. Endued with great strength, he\r\nspeedily deprived the very lions, white as snow and armed with teeth and\r\nclaws, of all their prowess, and dragged them and bound them (at his\r\npleasure). He used to check tigers also, that were fiercer and more\r\nruthless (than lions), and bring them to subjection. Seizing other beasts\r\nof prey possessed of great might, and even huge elephants, dyed with red\r\narsenic and spotted with other liquid minerals by their teeth and tusks,\r\nhe used to bring them to subjection, causing their mouths to become dry,\r\nor obliging them to fly away. Possessed of great might, he used also to\r\ndrag the mightiest of buffaloes. And in consequence of his strength, he\r\nchecked proud lions by hundreds, and powerful Srimaras and horned\r\nrhinoceroses and other animals. Binding them by their necks and crushing\r\nthem to an inch of their lives, he used to let them go. For those feats\r\nof his the regenerate ascetics (with whom he lived) came to call him\r\nSarvadamana (the controller of all). His mother, at last, forbade him\r\nfrom torturing animals in that way. Endued with great prowess he\r\nperformed a hundred Horse-sacrifices on the banks of the Yamuna, three\r\nhundred such sacrifices on the banks of Saraswati, and four hundred on\r\nthe banks of the Ganga. Having performed these sacrifices, he once more\r\nperformed a thousand Horse-sacrifices and a hundred Rajasuyas, great\r\nsacrifices, in which his gifts also to the Brahmanas were very profuse.\r\nOther sacrifices, again, such as the Agnishtoma, the Atiratra, the Uktha\r\nand the Viswajit, he performed together with thousands and thousands of\r\nVajapeyas, and completed without any impediment. The son of Sakuntala,\r\nhaving performed all these, gratified the Brahmanas with presents of\r\nwealth. Possessed of great fame, Bharata then gave ten thousand billions\r\nof coins, made of the most pure gold, unto Kanwa (who had brought up his\r\nmother Sakuntala as his own daughter). The gods with Indra at their head,\r\naccompanied by the Brahmanas, coming to his sacrifice, set up his\r\nsacrificial stake made entirely of gold, and measuring in width a hundred\r\nVyamas.[114] And imperial Bharata, of noble soul, that victor over all\r\nfoes, that monarch never conquered by any enemy, gave away unto the\r\nBrahmanas beautiful horses and elephants and cars, decked with gold, and\r\nbeautiful gems of all kinds, and camels and goats and sheep, and\r\nslaves--male and female--and wealth, and grains and milch cows with\r\ncalves, and villages and fields, and diverse kinds of robes, numbering by\r\nmillions and millions. When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee\r\nin respect of the four cardinal virtues and who superior to thee, was,\r\ntherefore, much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not, saying, 'Oh,\r\nSwaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice\r\nand made no sacrificial present.'"

He vanquished all, and his\r\nachievements, became known (all over the world). For this he came to be\r\ncalled Prithu (the celebrated). And because he protected all people from\r\nwounds and injuries, for this he became a true Kshatriya.[115] Beholding\r\nVena's son, Prithu, all his subjects said, We are highly pleased with\r\nhim. In consequence of this affection that he enjoyed of his subjects he\r\ncame to be called a Raja.[116] During the time of Prithu, the earth,\r\nwithout being cultivated, yielded crops in sufficiency. All the kine,\r\nagain, yielded milk whenever they were touched. Every lotus was full of\r\nhoney. The Kusa blades were all of gold, agreeable to the touch, and\r\notherwise delightful. And the subjects of Prithu made clothes of these\r\nblades and the beds also on which they lay. All the fruits were soft and\r\nsweet and like unto Amrita (in taste). And these constituted the food of\r\nhis subjects, none amongst whom had ever to starve. And all men in\r\nPrithu's time were hale and hearty. And all their wishes were crowned\r\nwith fruition. They had nothing to fear. On trees, or in caves, they\r\ndwelt as they liked. His dominions were not distributed into provinces\r\nand towns. The people lived happily and in joy as each desired. When king\r\nPrithu went to the sea, the waves became solid. The very mountains used\r\nto yield him openings that he might pass through them. The standard of\r\nhis car never broke (obstructed by anything). Once on a time, the tall\r\ntrees of the forest, the mountains, the gods, the Asuras, men, the\r\nsnakes, the seven Rishis, the Apsaras, and the Pitris, all came to\r\nPrithu, seated at his ease, and addressing him, said, 'Thou art our\r\nEmperor. Thou art our king. Thou art our protector and Father. Thou art\r\nour Lord. Therefore, O great king, give us boons after our own hearts,\r\nthrough which we may, for ever, obtain gratification and joy.' Unto them\r\nPrithu, the son of Vena, said, So be it. Then taking up his Ajagava\r\nbow[117] and some terrible arrows the like of which existed not, he\r\nreflected for a moment. He then addressed the Earth, saying, 'Coming\r\nquickly, O Earth! Yield to these the milk they desire. From that, blessed\r\nbe thou, I will give them the food they solicit.' Thus addressed by him,\r\nthe Earth said, 'It behoveth thee, O hero, to regard me as thy daughter.'\r\nPrithu answered, So be it!--And then that great ascetic, his passions\r\nunder control, made all arrangements (for milking the Earth. Then the\r\nentire assemblage of creatures began to milk the Earth). And first of\r\nall, the tall trees of the forest rose for milking her, The Earth then,\r\nfull of affection, stood there desiring a calf, a milker, and vessels\r\n(wherein to hold the milk). Then the blossoming Sala became the calf, the\r\nBanian became the milker, torn buds became the milk, and the auspicious\r\nfig tree became the vessel. (Next, the mountains milked her). The Eastern\r\nhill, whereon the Sun rises, became the calf; the prince of mountains,\r\nviz., Meru, became the milker; the diverse gems and deciduous herbs\r\nbecame the milk; and the stones became the vessels (for holding that\r\nmilk). Next, one of the gods became the milker, and all things capable of\r\nbestowing energy and strength became the coveted milk. The Asuras then\r\nmilked the Earth, having wine for their milk, and using an unbaked pot\r\nfor their vessel. In that act, Dwimurddhan became the milker, and\r\nVirochana, the calf. The human beings milked the Earth for cultivation\r\nand crops. The self-created Manu became their calf, and Prithu himself\r\nthe milker. Next, the Snakes milked the Earth, getting poison as the\r\nmilk, and using a vessel made of a gourd, Dhritarashtra became the\r\nmilker, and Takshaka the calf. The seven Rishis, capable of producing\r\neverything by their fiat,[118] then milked the Earth, getting the Vedas\r\nas their milk. Vrihaspati became the milker, the Chhandas were the\r\nvessel, and the excellent Soma, the calf. The Yakshas, milking the Earth,\r\ngot the power of disappearance at will as the milk in an unbaked pot.\r\nVaisravana (Kuvera) became their milker, and Vrishadhvaja their calf. The\r\nGandharvas and the Apsaras milked all fragrant perfumes in a vessel made\r\nof a lotus-leaf. Chitraratha became their calf, and the puissant\r\nViswaruchi their milker. The Pitris milked the Earth, getting Swaha as\r\ntheir milk in a vessel of silver. Yama, the son of Vivaswat, became their\r\ncalf, and (the Destroyer Antaka) their milker. Even thus was the Earth\r\nmilked by that assemblage of creatures who all got for milk what they\r\neach desired. The very calves and vessels employed by them are existing\r\nto this day and may always be seen. The powerful Prithu, the son of Vena,\r\nperforming various sacrifices, gratified all creatures in respect of all\r\ntheir desires by gifts of articles agreeable to their hearts. And he\r\ncaused golden images to be made of every article on earth, and bestowed\r\nthem all on the Brahmanas as his great Horse-sacrifice,[119] The king\r\ncaused six and sixty thousand elephants to be made of gold, and all those\r\nhe gave away unto the Brahmanas. And this whole earth also the king\r\ncaused to be decked with jewels and gems and gold, and gave her away unto\r\nthe Brahmanas. When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee as\r\nregards the four cardinal virtues and who, superior to thee, was,\r\ntherefore, much superior to thy son thou shouldst not, saying 'Oh,\r\nSwaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice\r\nand made no sacrificial present.'\""

Rooting out all evils from the\r\nearth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in. Having obtained unrivalled\r\nprosperity, no fault could be seen in him.[120] His father having been\r\nslain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any\r\nboast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With\r\nhis bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already\r\nwithin the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen\r\nthousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom\r\nhe slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a\r\nthousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging.[121] Heroic warriors,\r\nwith their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by\r\nthe wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father. And\r\nRama, on that occasion, slew ten thousand Kshatriyas with his axe. He\r\ncould not quietly bear the furious speeches uttered by those (foes of\r\nhis). And when many foremost of Brahmans uttered exclamations, mentioning\r\nthe name of Rama of Bhrigu's race,[122] then the valiant son of\r\nJamadagni, proceeding against the Kashmiras, the Daradas, the Kuntis, the\r\nKshudrakas, the Malavas, the Angas, the Vangas, the Kalingas, the\r\nVidehas, the Tamraliptakas, the Rakshovahas, the Vitahotras, the\r\nTrigartas, the Martikavatas, counting by thousand, slew them all by means\r\nof his whetted shafts. Proceeding from province to province, fie thus\r\nslew thousands of crores of Kshatriyas. Creating a deluge of blood and\r\nfilling many lakes also with blood as red as Indrajopakas or the wild\r\nfruit called Vandujiva, and bringing all the eighteen islands (of which\r\nthe earth is composed) under his subjection, that son of Bhrigu's race\r\nperformed a hundred sacrifices of great merit, all of which he completed\r\nand in all of which the presents he made unto the Brahmanas were profuse.\r\nThe sacrificial altar, eighteen nalas high made entirely of gold, and\r\nconstructed according to the ordinance, full of diverse kinds of jewels\r\nand gems, and decked with hundreds of standards, and this earth abounding\r\nin domestic and wild animals, were accepted by Kasyapa as sacrificial\r\npresent made unto him by Rama, the son of Jamadagni. And Rama also gave\r\nhim many thousand prodigious elephants, all adorned with gold. Indeed,\r\nfreeing the earth from all robbers, and making her teem with honest and\r\ngraceful inhabitants, Rama gave her away to Kasyapa at his great\r\nHorse-sacrifice. Having divested the earth of Kshatriyas for one and\r\ntwenty times, and having performed hundreds of sacrifices, the puissant\r\nhero gave away the earth to the Brahmanas. And it was Marichi (Kasyapa)\r\nwho accepted from him the earth with her seven islands. Then Kasyapa said\r\nunto Rama, 'Go out of the earth, at my command.' At the word of Kasyapa,\r\nthe foremost of warriors, desirous of obeying the Brahmana's behest,\r\ncaused by his arrows the very ocean to stand aside, and repairing to that\r\nbest of mountains called Mahendra, continued to live there. Even that\r\nenhancer of the fame of the Bhrigus, possessed of such numberless\r\nvirtues, that famous son of Jamadagni, of great splendour, will die.\r\nSuperior to thy son, (even he will die). Do not, therefore, grieve for\r\nthy son who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present. All\r\nthese, superior to thee as regards the four cardinal virtues and as\r\nregards also a hundred other merits, all these foremost of men, have\r\ndied, O Srinjaya, and they that are like them will also die.'\""

Or,\r\nare all these lost like Sraddha as performed by a person of regenerate\r\nclasses having a Sudra wife?' Thus addressed, Srinjaya then replied with\r\njoined hands, 'O thou that hast wealth of asceticism, having listened to\r\nthese excellent and praiseworthy histories of ancient royal sages, all of\r\nwhom had performed great sacrifices with profuse presents unto the\r\nBrahmanas, my grief hath all been dispelled by wonder, like the darkness\r\nthat is dispelled by the rays of the sun. I have now been cleansed of my\r\nsins, and I do not feel any pain now. Tell me, what shall I do now?'\r\n\r\n\"Narada said, 'By good luck it is that thy grief hath been dispelled.\r\nSolicit thou the boon that thou desirest. Thou wilt obtain all thou mayst\r\nask.

And king Srinjaya, once more\r\nmeeting with his son, became highly delighted. And he performed many\r\nmeritorious sacrifices, giving away profuse sacrificial presents upon\r\ncompletion. Srinjaya's son had not fulfilled the purposes of his being.\r\nHe had performed no sacrifice and had no children. Destitute of bravery,\r\nhe had perished miserably and not in battle. It was for this reason that\r\nhe could be brought back into life.[123] As regards Abhimanyu, he was\r\nbrave and heroic. He hath fulfilled the purposes of life, for the brave\r\nson of Subhadra, having blasted his foes by thousands, hath left the\r\nworld, falling in the field of battle. Those inaccessible regions that\r\nare attainable by Brahmacharya, by knowledge, by acquaintance with the\r\nscriptures, by foremost of sacrifices, even, these have been obtained by\r\nthy son. Men of knowledge always desire heaven by their righteous deeds.\r\nThey that are living in heaven never prefer this world to heaven.\r\nTherefore, it is not easy for any desirable thing that might have been\r\nunattained by him to bring back into the world Arjuna's son slain in\r\nbattle and now residing in heaven. Thy son has attained to that eternal\r\ngoal which is attained by yogins with eyes shut in contemplation or by\r\nperformers of great sacrifices, or people possessed of great ascetic\r\nmerit. After death, attaining a new body that hero is shining like a king\r\nin his own immortal rays. Indeed, Abhimanyu has once more got his own\r\nbody of lunar essence that is desirable by all regenerate persons. He\r\ndeserveth not thy grief.[124] Knowing this, be quiet, and slay thy foes.\r\nLet fortitude be thine. O sinless one, it is the living that stand in\r\nneed of our grief, and not they that have attained to heaven. His sins\r\nincrease, O king, for whom, the living grieve. Therefore, he that is\r\nwise, abandoning grief, should strive for (the) benefit (of the dead).\r\nThe living man should think of the joy, the glory, and the happiness (of\r\nthe dead). Knowing this, the wise never indulge in grief, for grief is\r\npainful. Know this to be true. Rise up! Strive (to achieve thy purpose).\r\nDo not grieve. Thou hast heard of the origin of Death, and her unexampled\r\npenances, as also the impartiality of her behaviour towards all\r\ncreatures. Thou hast heard that prosperity is unstable. Thou hast heard\r\nhow the dead son of Srinjaya was revived. O learned king, do not grieve.\r\nPeace be to thee, I go!'--Having said this, the holy Vyasa disappeared\r\nthen and there.

O child, unfortunate that I am, death forcibly\r\ntakes thee away from me, who was never satiated with looking at thee.\r\nWithout doubt, that abode of Yama, which is always the goal of persons of\r\nrighteous deeds, that delightful mansion, illuminated today by thy own\r\nsplendours, is rendered exceedingly beautiful by thee. Without doubt,\r\nYama and Varuna and Satakratu and Kuvera, obtaining thee as a favourite\r\nguest, are making much of thy heroic self. Thus indulging in diverse\r\nlamentations, like a merchant whose vessel has been sunken. Arjuna,\r\nafflicted with great grief, asked Yudhishthira, saying, 'O, thou of\r\nKuru's race, hath he ascended to heaven, having caused a great slaughter\r\namong the enemy and contended with the foremost warriors in the face of\r\nbattle? Without doubt, while contending single-handed with foremost of\r\nwarriors, countless in number, and fighting with vigour and resolution,\r\nhis heart turned towards me from a desire of help. While afflicted by\r\nKarna and Drona and Kripa and others with sharp shafts of diverse kinds\r\nand bright points, my sons of little strength, must have repeatedly\r\nthought, 'My father will in this press be my rescuer.' I think, while\r\nindulging in such lamentations, he was felled on the ground by cruel\r\nwarriors. Or, perhaps, when he was begotten by me, when he was the nephew\r\nof Madhva, when he was born in Subhadra he could not have uttered such\r\nlamentations. Without doubt, my heart, hard as it is, is made of the\r\nessence of the thunder, since it breaketh not, even though I do not\r\nbehold that mighty-armed hero of red eyes. How could those mighty bowmen\r\nof cruel hearts shoot their deep-piercing shafts upon that child of\r\ntender years, who, again, Was my son and the nephew of Vasudeva? That\r\nnoble-hearted youth who, coming forward every day, used to congratulate\r\nme, alas, why doth he not present himself today to me when I come back\r\nhaving slain the foe? Without doubt, overthrown, he lieth today on the\r\nbare earth bathed in blood. Beautifying the earth by his body, he lieth\r\nlike the sun fallen (from the firmament). I grieve for Subhadra, who,\r\nhearing of the death in battle of her unretreating son, will, afflicted\r\nwith sorrow, cast away her life. What will Subhadra missing Abhimanyu,\r\nsay unto me? What also will Draupadi say unto me? Afflicted with grief as\r\nthey are, what also shall I say unto them? Without doubt, my heart is\r\nmade of the essence of the thunder, since it breaketh not in a thousand\r\nfragments at the sight of my weeping daughter-in-law, pierced with grief.\r\nThe leonine shouts of the Dhritarashtras swelling with pride did, indeed,\r\nenter my ears. Krishna also heard Yuyutsu, censuring the heroes (of the\r\nDhritarashtra army in these words): 'Ye mighty car-warriors, having been\r\nunable to vanquish Vibhatsu, and having slain only a child, why do ye\r\nrejoice? Why, having done what is disagreeable to those two, viz., Kesava\r\nand Arjuna, in battle, why do you in joy roar like lions, when truly the\r\nhour for sorrow is come? The fruits of this sinful deed of Yours will\r\nsoon overtake you. Heinous is the crime perpetrated by you. How long will\r\nit not bear its fruits?' Rebuking them in these words, the high-souled\r\nson of Dhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife, went away, casting off his\r\nweapons afflicted with rage and grief. O Krishna, why did you not tell me\r\nall this during the battle? I would then have consumed all those\r\ncar-warriors of cruel hearts.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Vasudeva, consoling Partha who was afflicted\r\nwith grief on account of his son, who was exceedingly anxious, whose eyes\r\nwere bathed in tears, and who was, in fact, overwhelmed with this sorrow\r\ncaused by the slaughter of his child, said unto him, 'Do not yield so to\r\ngrief. This is the way of all brave, unretreating heroes, especially of\r\nKshatriyas, whose profession is battle. O foremost of intelligent men,\r\neven this is the goal ordained by the authors of our scriptures for\r\nunretreating heroes engaged in battle. Death is certain for heroes that\r\ndo not retreat. There is no doubt that Abhimanyu hath ascended to those\r\nregions that are reserved for persons of righteous acts. O bull of\r\nBharata's race, even this is coveted by all that are brave, viz., that\r\nthey may die in battle, facing their foes. As regards Abhimanyu, he\r\nhaving slain in battle many heroic and mighty princes, hath met with that\r\ndeath in the face of battle which is coveted by heroes. Do not grieve, O\r\ntiger among men I The legislators of old have declared this to be the\r\neternal merit of the Kshatriyas, viz., their death in battle. O best of\r\nthe Bharatas, these brothers of thine are all exceedingly cheerless, as\r\nalso the king, and these thy friends, seeing thee plunged in grief. O\r\ngiver of honours, comfort them in consoling words. That which should be\r\nis known to thee. It behoveth thee not to grieve.' Thus comforted by\r\nKrishna of wonderful deeds, Partha then said these words unto all his\r\nbrothers, with voice choked with sorrow: 'O lord of the earth, I desire\r\nto hear how the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, how that hero of large eyes,\r\nresembling lotus-petals, fought. Ye will see that I will exterminate the\r\nfoe with his elephants and cars and steeds, I will exterminate in battle\r\nthose slayers of my son with all their followers and kinsmen. Ye all are\r\naccomplished in arms. Ye all were armed with weapons, how then could\r\nSubhadra's son be slain, even if it were the wielder of the thunder-bolt\r\nhimself with whom he fought? Alas, if I had known that Pandavas and the\r\nPanchalas would be able to protect my son in battle, I myself would have\r\nthen protected him. Ye were then on your cars, ye were shooting your\r\nshafts. Alas, how then could Abhimanyu be slain by the foe, causing a\r\ngreat carnage in your ranks? Alas, ye have no manliness, nor have ye any\r\nprowess, since in the very sight of you all was Abhimanyu slain. Or, I\r\nshould chide my own self, since knowing that ye all are weak, cowardly,\r\nand irresolute, I went away! Alas, are your coats of mail and weapons of\r\nall kinds only ornaments for decking your persons, and were words given\r\nto you only for speaking in assemblies, that ye failed to protect my son\r\n(even though ye were clad in mail, armed from head to foot, and even\r\nthough you had assured me in words of your competence)?--Having said\r\nthese words, Partha sat down, holding bow and his excellent sword.\r\nIndeed, none could, at that time, even look at Vibhatsu who then\r\nresembled the Destroyer himself in wrath, repeatedly drawing deep\r\nbreaths. None of his friends or kinsmen could venture to look at or speak\r\nunto Arjuna, as he sat there exceedingly afflicted with grief on account\r\nof his son, and with face bathed in tears. None! Indeed could address\r\nhim, save Vasudeva or Yudhishthira. These two, under all circumstances,\r\nwere acceptable to Arjuna. And because they were highly reverenced and\r\ndearly loved, therefore, could they alone address him at such times. Then\r\nking Yudhishthira addressing Partha, of eyes like lotus-petals, who was\r\nthen filled with rage and exceedingly afflicted with grief on account of\r\nthe death of his son, said these words."

We succeeded, however, in resisting Drona at the head of\r\nthe array at all points, having in that battle, disposed our vigorously\r\ncontending car-divisions in counter-array. Held in check by a large\r\nnumber of warriors, and myself also having been well protected, Drona\r\nbegan to smite us with great activity, afflicting us with his whetted\r\nshafts. Thus afflicted by him, we could not then even gaze at his army,\r\nfar less face it in battle. All of us then, addressing thy son by\r\nSubhadra, who was equal to thyself, O lord, in prowess said unto him, [O\r\nson, pierce this array of Drona!]--That valorous hero thus urged by us,\r\nthen sought, like a good horse, to take that burden on himself, however\r\nunbearable it might have been for him. Endued as he was with thy energy,\r\naided by that knowledge of weapons which he derived from thee, that child\r\nthen penetrated unto that array, like Garuda penetrating into the ocean.\r\nAs regards ourselves, we followed that hero, that son of Subhadra,\r\ndesirous in that battle, of penetrating (into the Dhritarashtra army) by\r\nthe same path by which Abhimanyu had entered it. Then, O sire, the\r\nwretched king of the Sindhus, viz., Jayadratha, in consequence of the\r\nboon granted to him by Rudra, checked all of us! Then Drona, Kripa and\r\nKarna and Drona's son, and the king of the Kosalas, and Kritavarman,\r\nthese six car-warriors surrounded the son of Subhadra. Having surrounded\r\nthat child all those great car-warriors--too many for him although he was\r\ncontending to the utmost of his power, deprived him of his car. After he\r\nhad been deprived of his car, Dussasana's son, though he himself had a\r\nhair-breadth escape, succeeded, as chance would have it, in making\r\nAbhimanyu, meet with his end. As regards Abhimanyu, he, having slain many\r\nthousands of men and steeds and elephants, and eight thousand cars, and\r\nonce more nine hundred elephants, two thousand princes, and a large\r\nnumber of heroic warriors unknown to fame, and despatching in that battle\r\nking Vrihadvala also to heaven, at last, through ill luck, met with his\r\nown death. Thus hath occurred this event that so enhances our grief! That\r\ntiger among men hath even thus ascended to heaven! Hearing these words\r\nuttered by king Yudhishthira, Arjuna, saying--Oh son!--and breathing a\r\ndeep sigh, fell down on the earth in great pain. Then all the warriors of\r\nthe Pandavas, surrounding Dhananjaya with cheerless faces began, filled\r\nwith grief, to look at one another with winkless eyes. Recovering\r\nconsciousness then, Vasava's son became furious with rage. He seemed to\r\nbe in a feverish tremor, and sighed frequently. Squeezing his hands,\r\ndrawing deep breaths, with eyes bathed in tears, and casting his glances\r\nlike a mad man, he said these words.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said,---'Truly do I swear that tomorrow I will slay Jayadratha!\r\nIf from fear of death, he doth not forsake the Dhritarashtras, or implore\r\nour protection, or the protection of Krishna that foremost of men or of\r\nthine, O king, I shall assuredly slay him tomorrow! Forgetting his\r\nfriendship for me, engaged in doing what is agreeable to Dhritarashtra's\r\nson, that wretch is the cause of the child's slaughter! Tomorrow I will\r\nslay him! Whoever they may be that will encounter me in battle tomorrow\r\nfor protecting him, be it Drona, or Kripa, O king, I will cover them all\r\nwith my arrow! Ye bulls among men, if I do not achieve even this in\r\n(tomorrow's) battle, let me not attain the region., reserved for the\r\nrighteous, ye foremost of heroes! Those regions that are for them that\r\nslay their mothers, or for them that slay their fathers, or them that\r\nviolate their preceptor's beds, or them that are vile and wicked, or them\r\nthat cherish envy against the righteous, or them that speak ill of others\r\nor them that appropriate the wealth confidingly deposited with them by\r\nothers, or them that are betrayers of trusts, or them that speak ill of\r\nwives enjoyed by them before, or them that have slain Brahmanas, or them\r\nthat have killed kine, or them that eat sugared milk and rice, or food\r\nprepared of barley, or pot-herbs, or dishes prepared of milk, sesamum,\r\nand rice, or thin cakes of powdered barley fried in clarified butter or\r\nother kinds of cakes, or meat, without having dedicated the same to the\r\ngods,--even those regions shall speedily be mine if I do not slay\r\nJayadratha!--Those regions to which they go that offer insults to\r\nBrahmanas devoted to the study of the Vedas, or otherwise worthy of\r\nrespect, or to those that are their preceptors, (those regions shall\r\nspeedily be mine if I do not slay Jayadratha!) That end which becomes\r\ntheirs who touch Brahmanas or fire with the feet, that end which becomes\r\ntheirs who throw phlegm and excreta and eject urine into water, even that\r\nmiserable end shall be mine, if I do not slay Jayadratha! That end which\r\nis his who bathes (in water) in a state of nudity, or his who does not\r\nhospitably entertain a guest, that end which is theirs who receive\r\nbribes, speak falsehood, and deceive and cheat others, that end which is\r\ntheirs who offend against their own souls, or who falsely utter praises\r\n(of others), or of those low wretches who eat sweetmeats in the sight of\r\nservants and sons and wives and dependents without sharing the same with\r\nthose, that awful end shall be mine if I do not slay Jayadratha! That end\r\nwhich overtakes the wretch of ruthless soul who without supporting a\r\nrighteous and obedient protege casts him off, or him who, without giving\r\nunto a deserving neighbour the offerings in Sraddhas, giveth them away\r\nunto those that deserve them not, that end which is his who drinks wine,\r\nor his who insults those that are worthy of respect, or his who is\r\nungrateful, or his who speaketh ill of his brothers, that end shall soon\r\nbe mine if I do not stay Jayadratha! The end of all those sinful persons\r\nwhom I have not mentioned, as also of those whom I have mentioned, shall\r\nsoon be attained by me, if after this night passes away, I do not slay\r\nJayadratha tomorrow:\r\n\r\n\"--Listen now to another oath of mine! If tomorrow's sun set without my\r\nslaying that wretch, then even here I shall enter the blazing fire! Ye\r\nAsuras and gods and men. Ye birds and snakes, ye Pitris and all wanderers\r\nof the night, ye regenerate Rishis and celestial Rishis, ye mobile and\r\nimmobile creatures, ye all that I have not mentioned, ye will not succeed\r\nin protecting my foe from me! If he enters the abode of the nether\r\nregion, or ascends the firmament, or repairs to the celestials, or the\r\nrealms of the Daityas, I shall still, with a hundred arrows, assuredly\r\ncut off, on the expiration of this night, the head of Abhimanyu's foe!--'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued,--'Having uttered these words, Arjuna began to stretch\r\nGandiva with both his arms. Transcending Arjuna's voice the sound of that\r\nbow rose and touched the very heavens. After Arjuna had taken that oath,\r\nJanarddana, filled with wrath, blew his conch, Panchajanya. And Phalguna\r\nblew Devadatta. The great conch Panchajanya, well filled with the wind\r\nfrom Krishna's mouth, produced a loud blare. And that blare made the\r\nregents of the cardinal and the subsidiary points, the nether regions,\r\nand the whole universe, to shake, as it happens at the end of the Yuga.\r\nIndeed after the high-souled Arjuna had taken the oath, the sound of\r\nthousands of musical instruments and loud leonine roars arose from the\r\nPandava camp."

Reflecting for a while in the presence of\r\nthose gods among men, Jayadratha, in fear of Abhimanyu's father and\r\ncovered with shame, said these words--He who in Pandu's soil was begotten\r\nby Indra under the influence of desire, that wicked wretch is thinking of\r\ndespatching me to the abode of Yama! Blessed be ye, I shall, therefore go\r\nback to my home from desire of life! Or, ye bulls among Kshatriyas,\r\nprotect me by the force of your weapons! Partha seeks to slay me, ye\r\nheroes, render me fearless! Drona and Duryodhana and Kripa, and Karna,\r\nand the ruler of the Madras, and Valhika, and Dussasana and others, are\r\ncapable of protecting a person who is afflicted by Yama himself. When\r\nhowever, I am threatened by Phalguna alone, will not all these the lords\r\nof earth, will not all of you, joined together, be able to protect me?\r\nHaving heard the shouts of joy of the Pandavas, great hath been my fear.\r\nMy limbs, ye lords of earth, have become powerless like those of a person\r\non the point of death? Without doubt, the wielder of Gandiva hath sworn\r\nfor my death! It is for this that the Pandavas are shouting in joy at a\r\ntime when they should weep! Let alone the rulers of men, the very gods\r\nand Gandharvas, the Asuras, the Uragas, and the Rakshasas, cannot venture\r\nto baffle a vow of Arjuna. Therefore, ye bulls among men, blessed be ye,\r\ngive me permission (to leave the Kuru camp). I want to make myself\r\nscarce. The Pandavas will no longer be able to find me! While indulging\r\nin such lamentations, with heart agitated by fear, king Duryodhana,\r\nalways looking upon the accomplishment of his own business to be\r\npreferable to everything else, said unto him these words-Do not fear, O\r\ntiger among men! O bull among men, who will seek to encounter thee in\r\nbattle when thou will remain in the midst of these Kshatriya heroes!\r\nMyself, Vikartana's son, Karna, Chitrasena, Vivinsati, Bhurisravas, Sala,\r\nSalya, the invincible Vrishasena, Purumitra, Jaya, Bhoja, Sudakshina the\r\nruler of the Kamvojas, Satyavrata, the mighty-armed, Vikarna, Durmukha,\r\nDussasana, Subahu, the ruler of the Kalingas, with his weapons upraised,\r\nVinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, Drona, Drona's son, and Suvala's son\r\n(Sakuni),--these and numerous other kings will, with their forces, face\r\nthe battle surrounding thee on all sides! Let the fever of thy heart,\r\ntherefore, be dispelled! Thou art thyself one of the foremost of\r\ncar-warriors! O thou of immeasurable splendour, thou thyself art a hero!\r\nBeing what thou art how canst thou then see any cause of fear, O king of\r\nthe Sindhus! The eleven Akshauhinis of troops I own will carefully fight\r\nfor protecting thee! Therefore, do not fear, O king of the Sindhus! Let\r\nthy fears be dispelled!'\r\n\r\n'Sanjaya continued, 'Thus comforted, O monarch, by thy son, the king of\r\nthe Sindhus then, accompanied by Duryodhana, repaired that very night to\r\nDrona (the generalissimo of the Kuru army). Then, O king, having touched\r\nDrona's feet with reverence, and taken his seat with humility, he asked\r\nthe preceptor these words--In hitting the aim, in hitting it from it\r\ndistance, in tightness of hand, and in the force of the stroke, O\r\nillustrious one, tell the difference between myself and Phalguna! O\r\npreceptor, I wish to know accurately the difference as regards\r\nproficiency (in the science of arms) between myself and Arjuna! Say it\r\nunto me truly'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'Of tutorial instruction, both of you, i.e., thyself and\r\nArjuna, have had the same measure, O son! In consequence, however, of\r\nyoga and the hard life led by Arjuna, he is superior to thee! Thou\r\nshouldst not, however, for any reason, cherish fear of Partha! Without\r\ndoubt, I will, O son, protect thee from this fear! The very gods, cannot\r\nprevail over him who is protected by my arms! I will form an array which\r\nPartha will not succeed in piercing![127] Therefore contained thou in\r\nbattle, do not fear, observing the duties of thy own order! O mighty\r\ncar-warrior, tread in the track of thy sires and grandsires! Having duly\r\nstudied the Vedas, thou hast poured libations, according to the\r\nordinance, into fire! Thou hast also performed many sacrifices: Death\r\ncannot, therefore, be an object of terror to thee! (For if thou diest),\r\nattaining then to that great good fortune which is unattainable by vile\r\nmen, thou will acquire all those excellent regions in heaven that are\r\nattainable by the might of one's arms! The Kaurvas, the Pandavas, the\r\nVrishnis, and other men, as also myself with my son, are all mortal and\r\nshort-lived! Think of this. One after another, all of us, slain by Time\r\nwhich is all powerful, shall go to the other world, carrying with us only\r\nour respective deeds I Those regions that ascetics acquire by undergoing\r\nsevere penances, those regions are acquired by heroic Kshatriyas that are\r\nobservant of the duties of their order. Even thus was the ruler of the\r\nSindhus consoled by Bharadwaja's son. Banishing his fear of Partha, he\r\nset his heart on battle.

This hath been an\r\nact of great rashness (on thy part)! Without consulting me, thou hast\r\ntaken up a great weight (upon thy shoulders)! Alas, how shall we escape\r\nthe ridicule of all men? I had sent some spies into the camp of\r\nDhritarashtra's son. Those spies, quickly coming unto me, gave me this\r\ninformation, viz., that after thou, O lord, hadst vowed to slay the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, loud leonine shouts, mingled with the sounds of (our)\r\nmusical instruments, were heard by the Dhritarashtras. In consequence of\r\nthat uproar, the Dhritarashtras, with their well-wishers, became\r\nterrified,--These leonine shouts are not, causeless!--thought they, and\r\nwaited (for what would ensue). O thou of mighty arms, an uproarious din\r\nthen arose amongst the Kauravas, of their elephants and steeds and\r\ninfantry. And a terrible rattle was also heard of their cars.--Having\r\nheard of the death of Abhimanyu, Dhananjaya, deeply afflicted will in\r\nwrath come out in the night for battle!--Than king even thus, they waited\r\n(ready for battle). While preparing themselves. O thou of eyes like\r\nlotus-petals, they then learnt truly the vow about the slaughter of the\r\nruler of the Sindhus, made by thee that art wedded to truth.[128] Then\r\nall the counsellors of Suyodhana became heartless and frightened like\r\nlittle animals. As regards king Jayadratha, that ruler of the Sindhus and\r\nthe Sauviras, overwhelmed with grief and becoming thoroughly cheerless he\r\nstood up and entered his own tent with all his counsellors. Having\r\nconsulted (with them) about every remedy that could benefit him at a time\r\nwhen he stood in need of consultation, he proceeded to the assembly of\r\nthe (allied) kings and there said these words unto Suyodhana--Dhananjaya\r\nthinking me to be the slayer of his son, will tomorrow encounter me in\r\nbattle! He hath, in the midst of his army, vowed to stay me! That vow of\r\nSavyasachin the very gods and Gandharvas and Asuras and Uragas and\r\nRakshasas cannot venture to frustrate! Protect me, therefore, ye all in\r\nbattle! Let not Dhananjaya, placing his foot on your head, succeed in\r\nhitting the mark! Let proper arrangements be made in respect of this\r\nmatter! Or, if, O delighter of the Kurus, you think that you will not\r\nsucceed in protecting me in battle, grant me permission then, O king, so\r\nthat I may return home! Thus addressed (by Jayadratha), Suyodhana became\r\ncheerless and sat, hanging down his head. Ascertaining that Jayadratha\r\nwas in a great fright, Suyodhana began to reflect in silence. Beholding\r\nthe Kuru king to be greatly afflicted, king Jayadratha, the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, slowly said these words having a beneficial reference to\r\nhimself--I do not behold here that bowman of superior energy who can\r\nbaffle with his arms the weapons of Arjuna in great battle! Who, even if\r\nit be Satakratu himself, will stay in front of Arjuna having Vasudeva for\r\nhis ally, while wielding the bow Gandiva? It is heard that lord Maheswara\r\nhimself of supreme energy had been encountered, before this, by Partha on\r\nfoot, on the mountains of Himvat! Urged by the chief of the celestials,\r\nhe slew on a single car, a thousand Danavas dwelling in Hiranyapura! That\r\nson of Kunti is now allied with Vasudeva of great intelligence. I think\r\nthat he is competent to destroy the three worlds including the very gods.\r\nI wish that you will either grant me permission (to leave the field for\r\nmy home) or that the high-souled and heroic Drona with his son will\r\nprotect me! Or, I would await thy pleasure!--O Arjuna, (thus addressed by\r\nJayadratha) king Suyodhana humbly beseeched the preceptor in this\r\nmatter.[129] All remedial measures have been adopted. Cars and steeds\r\nhave been arranged. Karna and Bhurisravas, and Drona's son, and the\r\ninvincible Vrishasena, and Kripa, and the ruler of the Madras, these six\r\nwill be in (Jayadratha's) van. Drona will form an array half of which\r\nwill be a Sakata[130] and half a lotus. In the middle of the leaves of\r\nthat lotus will be a needle-mouthed array. Jayadratha, that ruler of the\r\nSindhus, difficult of being conquered in battle, will take his stand, by\r\nit, protected by heroes! In (the use of) the bow, in weapons, in prowess,\r\nin strength, and also in lineage, those six car-warriors, O Partha are\r\nwithout doubt, exceedingly difficult of being borne. Without first\r\nvanquishing those six car-warriors, access to Jayadratha will not to be\r\nhad. Think, O Arjuna, of the prowess of each of those six, O tiger among\r\nmen, when united together, they are not capable of being easily\r\nvanquished! We should, therefore, once again, take counsel with\r\nwell-wishing counsellors, conversant with policy, for our benefit and for\r\nthe success of our object!'\""

Suyodhana thinks that this\r\ngame (of battle) resteth on Drona! Therefore, piercing through the very\r\nvan commanded by Drona himself, I shall get at Jayadratha! Thou shalt\r\ntomorrow behold the mightiest of bowmen riven by me in battle by means of\r\nmy shafts endued with fierce energy, like summits of a hill riven by the\r\nthunder, Blood shall flow (in torrents) from the breasts of fallen men\r\nand elephants and steeds, split open by whetted shafts failing fast upon\r\nthem! The shafts shot from Gandiva, fleet as the mind or the wind, will\r\ndeprive thousands of men and elephants and steeds of life! Men will\r\nbehold in tomorrow's battle those weapons which I have obtained from Yama\r\nand Kaurva and Varuna and Indra and Rudra! Thou shalt behold in\r\ntomorrow's battle the weapons of all those who come to protect the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, baffled by me with my Brahma weapon! Thou shalt in\r\ntomorrow's battle, O Kesava, behold the earth strewn by me with the heads\r\nof kings cut off by the force, of my shafts! (Tomorrow) I shall gratify\r\nall cannibals, rout the foe, gladden my friends, and crush the ruler of\r\nthe Sindhus! A great offender, one who hath not acted like a relative,\r\nborn in a sinful country, the ruler of the Sindhu, slain by me, will\r\nsadden his own. Thou shalt behold that ruler of the Sindhus, of sinful\r\nbehaviour, and brought up in every luxury, pierced by me with my shafts!\r\nOn the morrow, O Krishana, I shall do that which shall make Suyodhana\r\nthink that there is no other bowman in the world who is equal to me! My\r\nGandiva is a celestial bow! I myself am the warrior. O bull among men!\r\nThou, O Hrishikesa, art the charioteer! What is that I will not be able\r\nto vanquish? Through thy grace, O holy one, what is there unattainable by\r\nme in battle? Knowing my prowess to be incapable of being resisted, why,\r\nO Hrishikesa, dost thou, yet rebuke me? As Lakshmi is ever present in\r\nSoma, as water is ever present in the Ocean, know this, O Janarddana,\r\nthat even so is my vow ever accomplished! Do not think lightly of my\r\nweapons! Do not think lightly of my tough bow! Do not think lightly of\r\nthe might of my arms! Do not think lightly of Dhananjaya! I shall go to\r\nbattle in such a way that I shall truly win and not lose! When I have\r\nvowed it, know that Jayadratha hath already been slain in battle! Verily,\r\nin the Brahmana is truth; verily, in the righteous is humility; verily,\r\nin sacrifice is prosperity; verily, in Narayana is victory!\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued,--'Having said these words unto Hrishikesa, the son of\r\nVasudeva, having himself said so unto his own self, Arjuna in a deep\r\nvoice, once more addressed lord Kesava, saying--Thou shouldst O Krishna,\r\nso act that my car may be well equipt as soon as this night dawns, since\r\ngrave is the task that is at hand!'\""

Fierce\r\nwinds, that were again dry and foreboded danger, began to blow. And a\r\nheadless trunk and a mace appeared on the disc of the sun. And although\r\nit was cloudless, frequent thunders were heard, of loud report, mixed\r\nwith flashes of lightning. The earth with her mountains and waters and\r\nforests, shook. The seas, those habitation of Makaras, swelled O king, in\r\nagitation. The rivers ran in directions opposite to their usual course.\r\nThe nether and upper lips of car-warriors and steeds and men and\r\nelephants began to tremble. And as if for gladdening the cannibals, on\r\nthat occasion foreboding a great accession of population to the domain of\r\nYama, the animals (on the field) began to eject urine and excreta, and\r\nutter loud cries of woe. Beholding these fierce omens that made the hair\r\nstand on end, and hearing also of the fierce vow of the mighty Arjuna,\r\nall thy warriors, O bull of Bharata's race became exceedingly agitated.\r\nThen the mighty-armed son of Pakasasana said unto Krishna. 'Go, and\r\ncomfort thy sister Subhadra with her daughter-in-law. And, O Madhava, let\r\nalso that daughter-in-law, and her companions, be comforted by thee; O\r\nlord, comfort them with soothing words that are again fraught with\r\ntruth.' Thus addressed, Vasudeva, with a cheerless heart, wending to\r\nArjuna's abode, began to comfort his sorrowing sister afflicted with\r\ngrief on account of the death of her son.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'O lady of Vrishni's race, do not grieve, with thy\r\ndaughter-in-law, for thy son. G timid one, all creatures have but one end\r\nordained by Time. The end thy son hath met with-that becometh a hero of\r\nproud lineage, especially who is a Kshatriya. Do not, therefore, grieve.\r\nBy good luck it is that mighty car-warrior of great wisdom, of prowess\r\nequal to that of his father, hath, after the Kshatriya custom, met with\r\nan end that is coveted by heroes. Having vanquished numberless foes and\r\ndespatched them unto Yama's presence, he hath himself repaired to those\r\neternal regions, that grant the fruition of every wish, and that are for\r\nthe righteous. Thy son hath attained that end which the righteous attain\r\nby penance, by Brahmacharya, by knowledge of the scriptures, and by\r\nwisdom. The mother of a hero, the wife of a hero, the daughter of a hero,\r\nand a kinsman of heroes, O amiable one, grieve not thou for thy son who\r\nhath obtained the supreme end. The wretched ruler of the Sindhus, O\r\nbeautiful lady, that murderer of a child, that perpetrator of a sinful\r\nact, shall, with his friends and kinsmen, obtain the fruit of this\r\narrogance of his on the expiry of this night. Even if he enters the abode\r\nof Indra himself he will not escape from the hands of Partha. Tomorrow\r\nthou shalt hear that the head of the Sindhus hath, in battle, been cut\r\noff from his trunk to roll on the outskirts of Samantapanchaka! Dispel\r\nthy sorrow, and do not grieve. Keeping the duties of a Kshatriya before\r\nhim, thy brave son hath attained the end of the righteous, that end,\r\nviz., which we here expect to obtain as also others that bear arms as a\r\nprofession. Of broad chest, mighty arms, unreturning, a crusher of\r\ncar-warriors, thy son, O beautiful lady, hath gone to heaven. Drive away\r\nthis fever (of thy heart). Obedient to his sires and maternal relations,\r\nthat heroic and mighty car-warriors of great prowess hath fallen a prey\r\nto death, after having slain thousands of foes comfort\r\nthy-daughter-in-law, O queen! Do not grieve too much, O Kshatriya lady!\r\nDrive away thy grief, O daughter, as thou shalt hear such agreeable news\r\non the morrow. That which Partha hath vowed must be accomplished. It\r\ncannot be otherwise. That which is sought to be done by thy husband can\r\nnever remain unaccomplished. Even if all human beings and snakes and\r\nPisachas and all the wanderers of the night and birds, and all the gods\r\nand the Asuras, help the ruler of the Sindhus on the field of battle; he\r\nshall still, with them, cease to exist tomorrow.'\""

Alas, how doth that face of thine which resembleth the\r\nblue lotus and is graced with beautiful teeth and excellent eyes, now\r\nseem, now that, O child, it is covered with battle's dust! Without doubt,\r\nthee so brave and unreturning, thee fallen on the field, with beautiful\r\nhead and neck and arms, with broad chest, low belly, thy limbs decked\r\nwith ornaments, thee that art endued with beautiful eyes, thee that art\r\nmangled with weapon wounds, thee all creatures are, without doubt,\r\nbeholding as the rising moon! Alas, thou whose bed used to be overlaid\r\nwith the whitest and costliest sheets, alas, deserving as thou art of\r\nevery luxury, how dost thou sleep today on the bare earth, thy body\r\npierced with arrows? That hero of mighty arms who used of old to be\r\nwaited upon by the foremost of beautiful women, alas, how can he, fallen\r\non the field of battle, pass his time now in the company of jackals! He\r\nwho of old was praised with hymns by singers and bards and panegyrists,\r\nalas, he is today greeted by fierce and yelling cannibals and beasts of\r\nprey. By whom, alas, hast thou been helplessly slain when thou hadst the\r\nPandavas, O lord, and all the Panchalas, for thy protectors? Oh son, O\r\nsinless one, I am not yet gratified with looking at thee. Wretched as I\r\nam, it is evident that I shall have to go to Yama's abode. When again\r\nshall I cast my eyes on that face of thine, adorned, with large eyes and\r\nbeautiful locks that smooth face without pimples, from which sweet words\r\nand exquisite fragrance constantly issued? Fie on the strength of\r\nBhimasena, on the bowmanship of Partha, on the prowess of the Vrishni\r\nheroes, and the might of the Panchalas! Fie on the Kaikeyas, the Chedis,\r\nthe Matsyas, and the Srinjayas, they that could not protect thee, O hero,\r\nwhile engaged in battle! I behold the earth today to be vacant and\r\ncheerless. Without seeing my Abhimanyu, my eyes are troubled with\r\naffliction. Thou wast the sister's son of Vasudeva, the son of the\r\nwielder of Gandiva, and thyself, a hero and an Atiratha. Alas, how shall\r\nI behold the slain! Alas, O hero, thou hast been to me like a treasure in\r\na dream that is seen and lost. Oh, every thing human is as transitory as\r\na bubble of water. This thy young wife is overwhelmed with grief on\r\naccount of the evil that hath befallen thee. Alas, how shall I comfort\r\nher who is even like a cow without her calf! Alas, O son, thou hast\r\nprematurely fled from me at a time when thou wast about to bear fruit of\r\ngreatness, although I am longing for a sight of thee. Without, doubt, the\r\nconduct of the Destroyer cannot be understood even by the wise, since\r\nalthough thou hast Kesava for thy protector, thou wast yet slain, as if\r\nthou wast perfectly helpless. O son, let that end be thine which is\r\ntheirs that perform sacrifices and theirs that are Brahmanas of purified\r\nsoul, and theirs that have practised Brahmacharya, and theirs that have\r\nbathed in sacred waters, and theirs that are grateful and charitable and\r\ndevoted to the service of their preceptors, and theirs that have made\r\nsacrificial presents in profusion. That end which is theirs that are\r\nbrave and unretreating while engaged in battle, or theirs that have\r\nfallen in battle, having slain their foes, let that end be thine. That\r\nauspicious end which is theirs that have given away a thousand kine, or\r\ntheirs that have given away in sacrifices, or theirs that give away\r\nhouses and mansions agreeable to the recipients, that end which is theirs\r\nthat give away gems and jewels to deserving Brahmanas, or theirs that are\r\npunishers of crime, O, let that end be thine. That end which is attained\r\nby Munis of rigid vows by Brahmacharya, or that which is attained by\r\nthose women that adhere to but one husband, O son, let that end be thine.\r\nThat eternal end which is attained by kings by means of good behaviour,\r\nor by those persons that have cleansed themselves by leading, one after\r\nanother, all the four modes of life, and through due observance of their\r\nduties, that end which is theirs that are compassionate to the poor and\r\nthe distressed, or theirs that equitably divide sweets amongst themselves\r\nand their dependants, or theirs that are never addicted to deceit and\r\nwickedness, O son, let that end be thine! That end which is theirs that\r\nare observant of vows, or theirs that are virtuous, or theirs that are\r\ndevoted to the service of preceptors, or theirs that have never sent away\r\na guest unentertained, O son, let that end be thine. That end which is\r\ntheirs that succeed in distress and the most difficult straits in\r\npreserving the equanimity of their souls, however much scorched they\r\nmight be by the fire of grief, O son, let that end be thine.

O son, let that end be thine which is attained by those wise\r\nmen who, restraining themselves from the wives of others, seek the\r\ncompanionship of only their own wives in season. O son, let that end be\r\nthine which is theirs that look upon all creatures with an eye of peace,\r\nor theirs that never give pain to others, or theirs that always forgive.\r\nO son, let that end be thine which is theirs that abstain from honey,\r\nmeat, wine, pride and untruth, or theirs that have refrained from giving\r\npain to others. Let that goal be thine which they attain that are modest,\r\nacquainted with all the scriptures, content with knowledge, and have\r\ntheir passions under control.'\r\n\r\n\"And while cheerless Subhadra, afflicted with grief, was indulging in\r\nsuch lamentations, the princess of Panchala (Draupadi), accompanied by\r\nVirata's daughter (Uttara), came to her. All of them, in great grief,\r\nwept copiously and indulged in heart-rending lamentations. And like\r\npersons reft of reason by sorrow, they fainted away and fell down on the\r\nearth. Then Krishna, who stood, ready with water, deeply afflicted,\r\nsprinkled it over his weeping, unconscious and trembling sister, pierced\r\nin her very heart, and comforting her, said what should be said on such\r\nan occasion. And the lotus-eyed one said, 'Grieve not, O Subhadra! O\r\nPanchali, console Uttara! Abhimanyu, that bull among Kshatriyas, hath\r\nobtained the most laudable goal. O thou of beautiful face, let all the\r\nother men yet alive in our race obtain that goal which Abhimanyu of great\r\nfame hath obtained. Ourselves with all our friends, wish to achieve, in\r\nthis battle, that feat, the like of which, O lady, thy son, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, hath achieved without any assistance.' Having consoled his\r\nsister and Draupadi and Uttara thus, that chastiser of foes, viz., the\r\nmighty-armed (Krishna), returned to Partha's side. Then Krishna, saluting\r\nthe kings, friends and Arjuna, entered the inner apartments of the\r\n(latter's) tent while those kings also repaired to respective abodes.'\""

And keeping excellent weapons\r\naround that bed, he adorned it duly with garlands of flowers and fried\r\npaddy, perfumes and other auspicious articles. And after Partha (also)\r\nhad touched water, meek and submissive attendants brought the usual\r\nnightly sacrifice to the Three-eyed (Mahadeva). Then Partha, with a\r\ncheerful soul, having smeared Madhava with perfumes and adorned with\r\nfloral garlands, presented unto Mahadeva the nightly offering.[131] Then\r\nGovinda, with a faint smile, addressed Partha, saying, 'Blessed be thou,\r\nO Partha, lay thyself down, I leave thee.' Placing door-keepers then, and\r\nalso sentinels well-armed, blessed Kesava, followed by (his charioteer)\r\nDaruka, repaired to his own tent. He then laid himself down on his white\r\nbed, and thought of diverse measures to be adopted. And the illustrious\r\none (Kesava) of eyes like lotus petals, began for Partha's sake, to think\r\nof various means that would dispel (Partha's) grief and anxiety and\r\nenhance his prowess and splendour. Of soul wrapt in yoga, that Supreme\r\nLord of all, viz., Vishnu of wide-spread fame, who always did what was\r\nagreeable to Jishnu, desirous of benefiting (Arjuna), lapsed into yoga,\r\nand meditation. There was none in the Pandava camp who slept that night.\r\nWakefulness possessed every one, O monarch. And everybody (in the Pandava\r\ncamp) thought of this, viz.,--The high-souled wielder of Gandiva, burning\r\nwith grief for the death of his son, hath suddenly vowed the slaughter of\r\nthe Sindhus. How, indeed, will that slayer of hostile heroes, that son of\r\nVasava, that mighty-armed warrior, accomplish his vow? The high-souled\r\nson of Pandu hath, indeed made a most difficult resolve. King Jayadratha\r\nis endued with mighty energy. Oh, let Arjuna succeed in fulfilling his\r\nvow. Difficult is that vow which he, afflicted with grief on account of\r\nhis son, hath made. Duryodhana's brothers are all possessed of great\r\nprowess. His forces also are countless. The son of Dhritarashtra hath\r\nassigned all these to Jayadratha (as his protectors). Oh, let Dhananjaya\r\ncome back (to the camp), having slain the ruler of the Sindhus in battle.\r\nVanquishing his foes, let Arjuna accomplish his vow. If he fails to slay\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus tomorrow, he will certainly enter into blazing\r\nfire. Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, will not falsify his oath. If Arjuna\r\ndies, how will the son of Dharma succeed in recovering his kingdom?\r\nIndeed, (Yudhishthira) the son of Pandu hath reposed (all his hopes of)\r\nvictory of Arjuna. If we have achieved any (religious) merit, if we have\r\never poured libations of clarified butter into fire, let Savyasachin,\r\naided by the fruits thereof, vanquish all his foes.' Thus talking, O\r\nlord, with one another about the victory (of the morrow), that long\r\nnight, O king, of theirs, at last, passed away. In the middle of the\r\nnight, Janardana, having awaked, remembered Partha's vow, and addressing\r\n(his charioteer) Daruka, said, 'Arjuna, in grief for the death of his\r\nson, hath vowed. O Daruka, that before tomorrow's sun goes down he will\r\nslay Jayadratha. Hearing of this, Duryodhana will assuredly take counsel\r\nwith his counsellors, about how Partha may fail to achieve his object.\r\nHis several Akshauhinis of troops will protect Jayadratha. Fully\r\nconversant with the ways of applying all weapons, Drona also, with his\r\nson, will protect him. That matchless hero, the Thousand-eyed (Indra\r\nhimself), that crusher of the pride of Daityas and Danavas cannot venture\r\nto slay him in battle who is protected by Drona. I, therefore, will do\r\nthat tomorrow by which Arjuna, the son of Kunti, may slay Jayadratha\r\nbefore the sun sets. My wives, my kinsmen, my relatives, non amongst\r\nthese is dearer to me than Arjuna. O Daruka, I shall not be able to cast\r\nmy eyes, even for a single moment, on the earth bereft of Arjuna. I tell\r\nthee, the earth shall not be reft to Arjuna. Myself vanquishing them all\r\nwith their steeds and elephants by putting forth my strength for the sake\r\nof Arjuna, I will slay them with Karna and Suyodhana. Let the three\r\nworlds tomorrow behold my prowess in great battle, when I put forth my\r\nvalour, O Daruka, for Dhananjaya's sake. Tomorrow thousands of kings and\r\nhundreds of princes, with their steeds and cars and elephants, will, O\r\nDaruka, fly away from battle. Thou shalt tomorrow, O Daruka, behold that\r\narmy of kings overthrown and crushed with my discus, by myself in wrath\r\nfor the sake of the son of Pandu. Tomorrow the (three) worlds with the\r\ngods, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Snakes, and the Rakshasas, will\r\nknow me as a (true) friend of Savyasachin. He that hateth him, hateth me.\r\nHe that followeth him, followeth me. Thou hast intelligence. Know that\r\nArjuna is half of myself. When morning comes after the expiry of this\r\nnight, thou, O Daruka, equipping my excellent car according to the rules\r\nof military science, must bring it and follow me with it carefully,\r\nplacing on it my celestial mace called Kaumodaki, my dart and discus, bow\r\nand arrows, and every other thing necessary. O Suta, making room on the\r\nterrace of my car for my standard and for the heroic Garuda thereon, that\r\nadorns my umbrella, and yoking thereto my foremost of steeds named\r\nValahaka and Meghapushpa and Saivya and Sugriva, having cased them in\r\ngolden mail of the splendour of the sun and fire, and thyself putting on\r\nthy armour, stay on it carefully. Upon hearing the loud and terrible\r\nblast of my conch Panchajanya emitting the shrill Rishava note,[132] thou\r\nwilt come quickly to me. In course of a single day, O Daruka, I shall\r\ndispel the wrath and the diverse woes of my cousin, the son of my\r\npaternal aunt. By every means shall I strive so that Vibhatsu in battle\r\nmay slay Jayadratha in the very sight of the Dhartarashtras. O\r\ncharioteer, I tell thee that Vibhatsu will certainly succeed in slaying\r\nall these for whose slaughter he will strive.'\r\n\r\n\"Daruka said, 'He is certain to have victory whose charioteership, O\r\ntiger among men, hath been taken by thee. Whence, indeed, can defeat come\r\nto him? As regards myself, I will do that which thou hast commanded me to\r\ndo. This night will bring (on its train) the auspicious morn for Arjuna's\r\nvictory.'\""

And soon he was lulled in the arms of sleep. Unto that\r\nape-bannered hero, burning with grief and immersed in thought Kesava,\r\nhaving Garuda on his banner, appeared in a dream. Dhananjaya of righteous\r\nsoul, inconsequence of his love and veneration for Kesava, never omitted\r\nunder any circumstances to stand up and advance a few steps for receiving\r\nKrishna. Rising up, therefore, now (in his dream), he gave unto Govinda a\r\nseat. He himself, however, at that time, did not set his heart upon\r\ntaking his seat. Then Krishna, of mighty energy, knowing the resolution\r\nof Partha, said, while seated, unto the son of Kunti, these words while\r\nthe latter was standing: 'Do not set thy heart, O Partha, on grief. Time\r\nis unconquerable. Time forceth all creatures into the inevitable course.\r\nO foremost of men what for is this grief of thine? Grief should not be\r\nindulged in, O foremost of learned persons! Grief is an impediment to\r\naction. Accomplish that act which should be accomplished. The grief that\r\nmaketh a person forgo all efforts is, indeed, O Dhananjaya, an enemy of\r\nthat person. A person, by indulging in grief, gladdens his foes and\r\nsaddens his friends, while the person is himself weakened. Therefore, it\r\nbehoveth thee not to grieve.' Thus addressed by Vasudeva, the\r\nunvanquished Vibhatsu of great learning then said these words of grave\r\nimport: 'Grave is the vow that I have made about the slaughter of\r\nJayadratha. Even tomorrow I shall slay that wicked wretch, that slayer of\r\nmy son. Even this hath been my vow, O Kesava! For frustrating my vow,\r\nJayadratha, protected by all the mighty car-warriors, will be kept in\r\ntheir rear by the Dhartarashtras. Their force, number, consists, O\r\nMadhava, of remnant, after slaughter, of eleven Akshauhinis of troops,\r\ndifficult of being vanquished. Surrounded in battle as he will be by all\r\nof them and by all the great car-warriors, how shall he obtain a sight, O\r\nKrishna, of the wicked rule of the Sindhus? My vow will not be\r\naccomplished, O Kesava! How can a person like me live, having failed to\r\naccomplish his vow? O hero, the non-accomplishment is evident of this (my\r\nvow which to me is a) source of great grief. (At this season of the\r\nyear), I tell thee that the sun setteth quickly.' The bird-bannered\r\nKrishna hearing this cause of Partha's grief, touched water and sat with\r\nface turned to the east. And then that hero, of eyes like lotus leaves,\r\nand possessed of great energy, said these words for the benefit of\r\nPandu's son who had resolved upon the slaughter of the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, 'O Partha, there is an indestructible, supreme weapon of the\r\nname of Pasupata. With it the god Maheswara slew in battle all the\r\nDaityas! If thou rememberest it now, thou shalt then be able to slay\r\nJayadratha tomorrow. If it is unknown to thee (now), adore within thy\r\nheart the god having the bull for his mark. Thinking of that god in thy\r\nmind, remember him, O Dhananjaya! Thou art his devotee. Through his grace\r\nthou shalt obtain that rich possession.' Hearing these words of Krishna,\r\nDhananjaya, having touched water, sat on the earth with concentrated mind\r\nand thought of the god Bhava. After he had thus sat with rapt mind at\r\nthat hour called Brahma of auspicious indications, Arjuna saw himself\r\njourneying through the sky with Kesava. And Partha, possessed of the\r\nspeed of the mind, seemed to reach, with Kesava, the sacred foot of\r\nHimavat and the Manimat mountain abounding in many brilliant gems and\r\nfrequented by Siddhas and Charanas. And the lord Kesava seemed to have\r\ncaught hold of his left arm. And he seemed to see many wonderful sights\r\nas he reached (those place). And Arjuna of righteous soul then seemed to\r\narrive at the White mountain on the north. And then he beheld, in the\r\npleasure-gardens of Kuvera the beautiful lake decked with lotuses. And he\r\nalso saw that foremost of rivers, viz., the Ganga full of water. And then\r\nhe arrived at the regions about the Mandara mountains. Those regions were\r\ncovered with trees that always bore blossoms and fruits. And they\r\nabounded with stones lying scattered about, that were all transparent\r\ncrystal. And they were inhabited by lions and tigers and abounded with\r\nanimals of diverse kinds. And they were adorned with many beautiful\r\nretreats of ascetics, echoing with the sweet notes of delightful\r\nwarblers. And they resounded also with the songs of Kinnaras. Graced with\r\nmany golden and silver peaks, they were illumined with diverse herbs and\r\nplants. And many Mandara trees with their pretty loads of flowers,\r\nadorned them. And then Arjuna reached the mountains called Kala that\r\nlooked like a mound of antimony. And then he reached the summit called\r\nBrahmatunga, and then many rivers, and then many inhabited provinces. And\r\nhe arrived at Satasinga, and the woods known by the name of Sharyati. And\r\nthen he beheld the sacred spot known as the Horse-head, and then the\r\nregion of Atharvana. And then he beheld that prince of mountains called\r\nVrishadansa, and the great Mandara, abounding in Apsaras, and graced with\r\nthe presence of the Kinnaras. And roaming on that mountain, Partha, with\r\nKrishna, beheld a spot of earth adorned with excellent fountains, decked\r\nwith golden mineral, and possessed of the splendour of the lunar rays,\r\nand having many cities and towns. And he also beheld many seas of\r\nwonderful forms and diverse mines of wealth. And thus going through the\r\nsky and firmament and the earth, he reached the spot called Vishnupada.\r\nAnd wandering, with Krishna in his company, he came down with great\r\nvelocity, like a shaft shot (from a bow). And soon Partha beheld a\r\nblazing mountain whose splendour equalled that of the planets, the\r\nconstellations, or fire. And arrived at that mountain, he beheld on its\r\ntop, the high-souled god having the bull for his mark, and ever engaged\r\nin ascetic penances, like a thousand suns collected together, and blazing\r\nwith his own effulgence. Trident in hand, matted locks on the head, of\r\nsnow-white colour, he was robed in bark and skin. Endued with great\r\nenergy, his body seemed to be flaming with a thousand eyes. And he was\r\nseated with Parvati and many creatures of brilliant forms (around him).\r\nAnd his attendants were engaged in singing and playing upon musical\r\ninstruments, in laughing and dancing, in moving and stretching their\r\nhands, and In uttering loud shouts. And the place was perfumed with\r\nfragrant odours, and Rishis that worshipped Brahma adored with excellent\r\nhymns of unfading glory, that God who was the protector of all creatures,\r\nand wielded the (great) bow (called Pinaka). Beholding him, Vasudeva of\r\nrighteous soul, with Partha, touched the earth with his head, uttering\r\nthe eternal words of the Veda. And Krishna adored, with speech, mind,\r\nunderstanding, and acts, that God who is the first source of the\r\nuniverse, himself uncreate, the supreme lord of unfading glory: who is\r\nthe highest cause of the mind, who is space and the wind, who is the\r\ncause of all the luminous bodies (in the firmament), who is the creator\r\nof the rain, and the supreme, primordial substance of the earth, who is\r\nthe object of adoration, with the gods, the Danavas, the Yakshas, and\r\nhuman beings; who is the supreme Brahma that is seen by Yogins and the\r\nrefuge of those acquainted with Shastras, who is the creator of all\r\nmobile and immobile creatures, and their destroyer also; who is the Wrath\r\nthat burns everything at the end of the Yuga; who is the supreme soul;\r\nwho is the Sakra and Surya, and the origin of all attributes. And Krishna\r\nsought the protection of that Bhava, whom men of knowledge, desirous of\r\nattaining to that which is called the subtle and the spiritual, behold;\r\nthat uncreate one is the soul of all causes. And Arjuna repeatedly adored\r\nthat Deity, knowing that he was the origin of all creatures and the cause\r\nof the past, the future, and the present. Beholding those two, viz., Nara\r\nand Narayana arrived, Bhava of cheerful soul, smilingly said unto them,\r\n'Welcome are ye, ye foremost of men! Rise up and let the fatigue of your\r\njourney be over. What, O heroes, is the desire in your heart? Let it be\r\nuttered quickly. What is the business that has brought you hither? I will\r\naccomplish it and do what would benefit you. I will grant everything ye\r\nmay desire., Hearing those words of the god, they both rose. And then\r\nwith joined hands, the faultless Vasudeva and Arjuna, both of great\r\nwisdom, began to gratify that high-souled deity with an excellent hymn.\r\nAnd Krishna and Arjuna said, 'We bow to Bhava, to Sarva, to Rudra, to the\r\nboon-giving deity. We bow to the lord of all creatures endued with life,\r\nto the god who is always fierce, to him who is called Kapardin! We bow to\r\nMahadeva, to Bhima, to the Three-eyed, to him who is peace and\r\ncontentment. We bow to Isana, to him who is the destroyer of (Daksha's)\r\nsacrifice. Let salutations be to the slayer of Andhaka, to the father of\r\nKumara, to him who is of blue throat, to him who is the creator.' Let\r\nsalutation be to the wielder of Pinaka, to one worthy of the offer of\r\nlibations of clarified butter, to him who is truth, to him who is\r\nall-pervading. To him who is unvanquished! To him who is always of blue\r\nlocks, to him who is armed with the trident, to him who is of celestial\r\nvision! To him who is Hotri, to him who protects all, to, him who is of\r\nthree eyes, to him who is disease, to him whose vital seed fell on fire!\r\nTo him who is inconceivable, to him who is the lord of Amvika, to him who\r\nis adored by all the gods! To him who hath the bull for his mark, to him\r\nwho is bold, to him who is of matted lock, to him who is a Brahmacharin!\r\nTo him who standeth as an ascetic in the water, to him who is devoted to\r\nBrahma, to him who hath never been conquered! To him who is the soul of\r\nthe universe, to him who is the creator of the universe, to him who\r\nliveth pervading the whole universe! We bow to thee that art, the object\r\nof the reverence of all, to thee that art the original cause of all\r\ncreatures! To thee that art called Brahmachakra, to thee that art called\r\nSarva, Sankara, and Siva! We bow to thee that art the lord of all great\r\nbeings! We bow to thee that hast a thousand heads, to thee that hast a\r\nthousand arms, to thee that art called Death! To thee that hast a\r\nthousand eyes, a thousand legs? To thee whose acts are innumerable! We\r\nbow to thee whose complexion is that of gold, to thee that art cased in\r\ngolden mail, to thee that art ever compassionate to thy devotees! O lord,\r\nlet our wish be accomplished.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having adored Mahadeva in these terms, Vasudeva with\r\nArjuna then began to gratify him for obtaining (the great) weapon (called\r\nPasupata).'\""

And he beheld the offerings\r\nhe made every night to Vasudeva lying by the side of the Three-eyed\r\ndeity. The son of Pandu then, mentally worshipping both Krishna and\r\nSarva, said unto the latter, 'I desire (to obtain) the celestial weapon.'\r\nHearing these words of Partha desiring the boon he sought, god Siva\r\nsmilingly said unto Vasudeva and Arjuna, 'Welcome to you, ye foremost of\r\nmen! I know the wish cherished by you, and the business for which you\r\nhave come here. I will give you what you wish. There is a celestial lake\r\nfull of Amrita, not far from this place, ye slayers of foes! There were\r\nkept some time back, that celestial bow and arrow of mine. With them I\r\nslew in battle all the enemies of the gods. Bring hither, ye Krishna,\r\nthat excellent bow with arrow fixed on it.' Hearing these words of Siva,\r\nVasudava with Arjuna answered, 'So be it.' And then accompanied by all\r\nthe attendants of Siva, those two heroes set out for that celestial lake\r\nwhich possessed hundreds of heavenly wonders, that sacred lake, capable\r\nof granting every object, which the god, having the bull for his mark,\r\nhad indicated to them, And unto that lake, the Rishis Nara and Narayana\r\n(viz., Arjuna and Vasudeva) went fearlessly. And having reached that\r\nlake, bright as the disc of the sun, Arjuna and Achyuta beheld within its\r\nwaters a terrible snake. And they beheld there another foremost of\r\nsnakes, that had a thousand heads. And possessed of the effulgence of\r\nfire, that snake was vomiting fierce flames. Then Krishna and Partha\r\nhaving touched water, joined their hands, and approached those snakes,\r\nhaving bowed unto the god having the bull for his mark. And as they\r\napproached the snakes, conversant as they were with the Vedas, they\r\nuttered the hundred stanzas of the Veda, to the praise of Rudra, bowing\r\nthe while with their sincere souls unto Bhava of immeasurable power. Then\r\nthose two terrible snakes, in consequence of the power of those\r\nadorations to Rudra, abandoned their snake-forms and assumed the forms of\r\na foe-killing bow and arrow. Gratified (with what they saw), Krishna and\r\nArjuna then seized that bow and arrow of great effulgence. And those\r\nhigh-souled heroes then brought them away and gave them unto the\r\nillustrious Mahadeva. Then from one of the sides of Siva's body there\r\ncame out a Brahmacharin of tawny eyes. And he seemed to be the refuge of\r\nasceticism. Of blue throat and red locks, he was endued with great might.\r\nTaking up that best of bows that Brahmacharin stood placing (both the bow\r\nand his feet properly). And fixing the arrow on the bowstring, he began\r\nto stretch the latter duly. Beholding the manner of his seizing the\r\nhandle of the bow and drawing the string and placing of his feet, and\r\nhearing also the Mantras uttered by Bhava, the son of Pandu, of\r\ninconceivable prowess, learnt everything duly. The mighty and puissant\r\nBrahmacharin then sped that arrow to that same lake. And he once more\r\nthrew that bow also in that self-same lake. Then Arjuna of good memory\r\nknowing that Bhava was gratified with him, and remembering also the boon\r\nthe latter had given him in the forest, and the sight also he gave him of\r\nhis person, mentally entertained the desire, 'Let all this become\r\nproductive of fruit!' Understanding this to be his wish, Bhava, gratified\r\nwith him, gave him the boon. And the god also granted him the terrible\r\nPasupata weapon and the accomplishment of his vow. Then having thus once\r\nmore obtained the Pasupata weapon from the supreme god, the invincible\r\nArjuna, with hair standing on end, regarded his business to be already\r\nachieved. Then Arjuna and Krishna filled with joy, paid their adorations\r\nunto the great god by bowing their heads. And permitted by Bhava both\r\nArjuna and Kesava, those two heroes, almost immediately came back to\r\ntheir own camp, filled with transports of delight. Indeed, their joy was\r\nas great as that of Indra and Vishnu when those two gods, desirous of\r\nslaying Jambha, obtained the permission of Bhava that slayer of great\r\nAsuras.'\""

Paniswanikas and Magadhas and Madhuparkikas and Sutas,\r\ngratified that bull among men (with songs and music). And dancers began\r\ntheir dance, and sweet-voiced singers sang their sweet songs fraught with\r\nthe praises of the Kuru race. And skilled musicians, well-trained (in\r\ntheir respective instruments), played on Mridangas and Jharjharas and\r\nBheris, and Panavas, and Anakas, and Gomukhas, and Adamvaras, and conchs,\r\nand Dundubhis of loud sound, and diverse other instruments. That loud\r\nnoise, deep as the roar of the clouds, touched the very heavens. And it\r\nawoke that foremost of kings, viz., Yudhishthira, from his slumber.\r\nHaving slept happily on his excellent and costly bed, the king awoke.\r\n\r\nAnd the monarch, rising from his bed, proceeded to the bath-room for\r\nperforming those acts that were absolutely necessary. Then a hundred and\r\neight servants, attired in white, themselves washed, and all young,\r\napproached the king with many golden jars filled to the brim. Seated at\r\nhis ease on a royal seat, attired in a thin cloth, the king bathed in\r\nseveral kinds of water fragrant with sandal-wood and purified with\r\nMantras. His body was rubbed by strong and well-trained servants with\r\nwater in which diverse kinds of medicinal herbs had been soaked. He then\r\nwashed with adhivasha water rendered fragrant by various odoriferous\r\nsubstances. Obtaining then a long piece of cloth (for the head) that was\r\nas white as the feathers of the swan, and that had been kept loose before\r\nhim, the king tied it round his head for drying the water. Smearing his\r\nbody then with excellent sandal-paste, and wearing floral garlands, and\r\naddressing himself in clean robes, the mighty-armed monarch sat with face\r\ntowards the cast, and his hands joined together. Following the path of\r\nthe righteous, the son of Kunti then mentally said his prayers. And then\r\nwith great humility he entered the chamber in which the blazing fire (for\r\nworship) was kept. And having worshipped the fire with faggots of sacred\r\nwood and with libations of clarified butter sanctified with Mantras, he\r\ncame out of the chamber. Then that tiger among men, entering a second\r\nchamber, beheld there many bulls among Brahmanas well-acquainted with the\r\nVedas. And they were all self-restrained, purified by the study of the\r\nVedas and by vows. And all of them had undergone the bath on the\r\ncompletion of sacrifices performed by them. Worshippers of the Sun, they\r\nnumbered a thousand. And, besides them, there were also eight thousand\r\nothers of the same class. And the mighty-armed son of Pandu, having\r\ncaused them to utter, in distinct voices, agreeable benedictions, by\r\nmaking presents to them of honey and clarified butter and auspicious\r\nfruits of the best kind, gave unto each of them a nishka of gold, a\r\nhundred steeds decked with ornaments, and costly robes and such other\r\npresents as were agreeable to them. And making unto them presents also of\r\nkine yielding milk whenever touched, with calves and having their horns\r\ndecked with gold and their hoofs with silver, the son of Pandu\r\ncircumambulated them. And then seeing and touching Swastikas fraught with\r\nincrease of good fortune, and Nandyavartas made of gold, and floral\r\ngarlands, water-pots and blazing fire, and vessels full of sun-dried rice\r\nand other auspicious articles, and the yellow pigment prepared from the\r\nurine of the cow, and auspicious and well-decked maidens, and curds and\r\nclarified butter and honey, and auspicious birds and diverse other things\r\nheld sacred, the son of Kunti came into the outer chamber. Then, O\r\nmighty-armed one, the attendants waiting in that chamber brought an\r\nexcellent and costly seat of gold that was of a circular shape. Decked\r\nwith pearls and lapis lazuli, and overlaid with a very costly carpet over\r\nwhich was spread another cloth of fine texture, that scat was the\r\nhandiwork of the artificer himself. After the high-souled monarch had\r\ntaken his seat, the servants brought to him all his costly and bright\r\nornaments. The high-souled son of Kunti put on those begemmed ornaments,\r\nwhereupon his beauty became such as to enhance the grief of his foes. And\r\nwhen the servants began to fan him with white yak-tails of the bright\r\neffulgence of the moon and all furnished with handles of gold, the king\r\nlooked resplendent like a mass of clouds charged with lightning. And\r\nbards began to sing his praises, and panegyrists uttered his eulogies.\r\nAnd singers began to sing unto that delighter of Kuru's race, and in a\r\nmoment the voices of the panegyrists swelled into a loud noise. And then\r\nwas heard the clatter of car-wheels, and the tread of horse-hoofs. And in\r\nconsequence of that noise mingling with the tinkle of elephants' bells\r\nand the blare of conchs and the tread of men, the very earth seemed to\r\ntremble. Then one of the orderlies in charge of the doors, cased in mail,\r\nyouthful in years, decked with ear-rings, and his sword hanging by his\r\nside, entering the private apartment, knelt down on the ground, and\r\nsaluting with (a bend of) his head the monarch who deserved every\r\nadoration, represented unto that high-souled and royal son of Dharma that\r\nHrishikesa was waiting to be introduced. Then that tiger among men,\r\nhaving ordered his servants, 'Let an excellent seat and an Arghya be kept\r\nready for him,' caused him of Vrishni's race to be introduced and seated\r\non a costly seat. And addressing Madhava with the usual enquiries of\r\nwelcome, king Yudhishthira the just duly worshipped Kesava.'"

Thou art aware, O Krishna,\r\nof the deprivation of our kingdom, our exile at the hands of the foe, and\r\nall our diverse woes. O lord of all, O thou that art compassionate unto\r\nthose that are devoted to thee, upon thee wholly rests the happiness of\r\nus all and our very existence, O slayer of Madhu! O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace, do that by which my heart may ever rest on thee! Do also that, O\r\nLord, by which the proposed vow of Arjuna may be realised. O, rescue us\r\ntoday from this ocean of grief and rage. O Madhava, become thou today a\r\nboat unto us that are desirous of crossing (that ocean). The car-warriors\r\ndesirous of slaying the foe cannot, in battle, do that (for the success\r\nof his object) which, O Krishna, the car-driver can do, if he exerts\r\nhimself carefully. O Janardana, as thou always savest the Vrishnis in all\r\ncalamities, even so it behoveth thee to save us from this distress, O\r\nmighty-armed one! O bearer of the conch, discus, and mace, rescue the\r\nsons of Pandu sunk in the fathomless and boatless Kuru-ocean, by becoming\r\na boat unto them. I bow to thee, O God of the lord of the gods, O thou\r\nthat art eternal, O supreme Destroyer, O Vishnu, O Jishnu, O Hari, O\r\nKrishna, O Vaikuntha, O best of mate beings! Narada described thee as\r\nthat ancient and best of Rishis (called Narayana) that giveth boons, that\r\nbeareth the bow Saranga, and that is the foremost of all. O Madhava, make\r\nthose words true. Thus addressed in the midst of that assembly by king\r\nYudhishthira the just, Kesava, that foremost of speakers, replied unto\r\nYudhishthira in a voice deep as that of clouds charged with rain, saying,\r\n'In all the worlds including that of the celestials, there is no bowman\r\nequal to Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha! Possessed of great energy.\r\naccomplished in weapons, of great prowess and great strength, celebrated\r\nin battle, ever wrathful, and of great energy, Arjuna is the foremost of\r\nmen. Youthful in years bull-necked, and of long arms, he is endued with\r\ngreat strength. Treading like a lion or a bull, and exceedingly beautiful\r\nhe will slay all thy foes. As regards myself, I will do that by which\r\nArjuna, the son of Kunti, may be able to consume the troops of\r\nDhritarashtra's son like a swelling conflagration. This very day, Arjuna\r\nwill, by his arrows despatch that vile wretch of sinful deeds, that\r\nslayer of Subhadra's son, (viz., Jayadratha), to that road from which no\r\ntraveller comes back. Today vultures and hawks and furious jackals and\r\nother carnivorous creatures will feed on his flesh. O Yudhishthira, if\r\neven all the gods with Indra become his protectors today, Jayadratha will\r\nstill, slain in the thick of battle, repair to Yama's capital. Having\r\nslain the ruler of the Sindhus, Jishnu will come to thee (in the\r\nevening). Dispel thy grief and the fever (of thy heart), O king, and be\r\nthou graced with prosperity.'\""

After he had entered that auspicious chamber and having\r\nsaluted him duly, had taken its stand before the king, that bull among\r\nthe Pandavas, (viz., king Yudhishthira), rising up from his seat,\r\nembraced Arjuna with great affection.

Then Jishnu related unto him that highly wonderful incident,\r\nsaying, 'Blessed be thou, O monarch, I have, through Kesava's grace,\r\nbeheld something exceedingly wonderful.'

And those two invincible warriors,\r\nthose two heroes, viz., Yuyudhana, and Janardana, together proceeded on\r\nthe same car to Arjuna's pavilion. Arrived there, Hrishikesa, like a\r\ncharioteer (by profession), began to equip that car bearing the mark of\r\nthe prince of apes and belonging to that foremost of car-warriors (viz.,\r\nArjuna). And that foremost of cars, of the effulgence of heated gold, and\r\nof rattle resembling the deep roar of the clouds, equipped (by Krishna),\r\nshone brightly like the morning sun. Then that tiger among men, (viz.,\r\nVasudeva), clad in mail informed Partha, who had finished his morning\r\nprayers, of the fact that 'his car had been properly equipped. Then that\r\nforemost of men in this world, viz., the diadem-decked (Arjuna), clad in\r\ngolden armour, with his bow and arrows in hand, circumambulated that car.\r\nAnd adored and blessed with benedictions about victory by Brahmanas, old\r\nin ascetic penances and knowledge and years, ever engaged in the\r\nperformance of religious rites and sacrifices, and having their passions\r\nunder control, Arjuna then ascended that great car, that excellent\r\nvehicle, which had previously been sanctified with mantras capable of\r\ngiving victory in battle, like Surya of blazing rays ascending the\r\neastern mountain. And that foremost of car-warriors decked with gold, in\r\nconsequence or those golden ornaments of his, on his car like Surya of\r\nblazing splendour on the breast of Meru. After Partha, Yuyudhana. and\r\nJanardana mounted on that car, like the twin Aswins riding the same car\r\nwith Indra while coming to the sacrifice of Saryati. Then Govinda, that\r\nforemost of charioteers, took the reins (of the steeds), like Matali\r\ntaking the reins of Indra's steeds, while the latter went to battle for\r\nslaying Vritra.[133] Mounted on that best of cars with those two friends,\r\nthat slayer of large bodies of foes, viz., Partha, proceeded for\r\nachieving the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus, like Soma rising (in\r\nthe firmament) with Budha and Sukra, for destroying the gloom of night,\r\nor like Indra proceeding with Varuna and Surya to the great battle (with\r\nthe Asuras) occasioned by the abduction of Taraka (the wife of\r\nVrihaspati). The bards and musicians gratified the heroic Arjuna, as he\r\nproceeded, with the sound of musical instruments and auspicious hymns of\r\ngood omen. And the voices of the panegyrists and the bards uttering\r\nbenedictions of victory and wishing good day, mingling with the sounds of\r\nmusical instruments, became gratifying to those heroes. And an auspicious\r\nbreeze, fraught with fragrance, blew from behind Partha, gladdening him\r\nand sucking up the energies of his foes. And at that hour, O king, many\r\nauspicious omens of various kinds appeared to view, indicating victory to\r\nthe Pandavas and defeat to thy warriors, O sire! Beholding those\r\nindications of victory, Arjuna, addressing the great bowman Yuyudhana on\r\nhis right, said these words: O Yuyudhana! in today's battle my victory\r\nseems to be certain, since O bull of Sini's race, all these (auspicious)\r\nomens are seen. I shall, therefore, go thither where the ruler of the\r\nSindhus waiteth for (the display of) my energy and in expectation of\r\nrepairing to the regions of Yama. Indeed, as the slaughter of the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus is one of my most imperative duties, even so is the\r\nprotection of king Yudhishthira the just another of my most imperative\r\nobligations. O thou of mighty arms, be thou today the king's protector.\r\nThou wilt protect him even as I myself protect him. I do not behold the\r\nperson in the world who would be able to vanquish thee. Thou art, in\r\nbattle, equal to Vasudeva himself. The chief of the celestials himself is\r\nunable to vanquish thee. Reposing this burden on thee, or on that mighty\r\ncar-warrior Pradyumna, I can, O bull among men, without anxiety slay the\r\nruler of the Sindhus. O thou of the Satwata race, no anxiety need be\r\nentertained on my account. With thy whole heart must thou protect the\r\nking. There where the mighty-armed Vasudeva stayeth, and where I myself\r\nstay, without doubt, the slightest danger to him or me can never befall.'\r\nThus addressed by Partha, Satyaki, that slayer of hostile heroes, replied\r\nsaying, 'So be it.'

Formerly, such sounds\r\nused to strike my ears incessantly. Alas, as they are plunged into grief\r\nI do not any longer hear those sounds uttered (in their camp). Formerly,\r\nO Sanjaya, while sitting in the abode of Somadatta who was devoted to\r\ntruth, I used to hear such delightful sounds. Alas, how destitute of\r\n(religious) merit I am, for I observe the abode of my sons today to be\r\nechoing with sounds of grief and lamentations and destitute of every\r\nnoise betokening life and energy. In the houses of Vivinsati, Durmukha,\r\nChitrasena, Vikarna, and other sons of mine, I do not hear the sounds I\r\nused to hear formerly. That great bowman, viz., the son of Drona, who was\r\nthe refuge of my sons, upon him Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, and\r\na large number of disciples used to wait, who took pleasure day and night\r\nin controversial disputations, in talk, in conversation, in the stirring\r\nmusic of diverse instruments, and in various kinds of delightful songs,\r\nwho was worshipped by many persons among the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the\r\nSatwatas, alas, O Suta, in the abode of that son of Drona no sound can be\r\nheard as formerly. Singers and dancers used, in a large number, to wait\r\nclosely upon that mighty bowman, viz., the son of Drona. Alas, their\r\nsounds can no longer be heard in his abode. That loud noise which rose in\r\nthe camp of Vinda and Anuvinda every evening, alas, that noise is no\r\nlonger heard there. Not in the camp of the Kaikeyas can that loud sound\r\nof song and slapping of palms be heard today which their soldiers,\r\nengaged in dance and revelry, used to make. Those priests competent in\r\nthe performance of sacrifices who used to wait upon Somadatta's son, that\r\nrefuge of scriptural rites, alas, their sounds can no longer be heard.\r\nThe twang of the bowstring, the sounds of Vedic recitation, the whiz of\r\nlances and swords, and rattle of car-wheels, used incessantly to be heard\r\nin the abode of Drona. Alas, those sounds can no longer be heard there.\r\nThat swell of songs of diverse realms, that loud noise of musical\r\ninstruments, which used to arise there, alas, those can no longer be\r\nheard today. When Janardana of unfading glory came from Upaplavya,\r\ndesirous of peace, from compassion for every creature, I then, O Suta,\r\nsaid unto the wicked Duryodhana: Obtaining Vasudeva as the means, make\r\npeace with the Pandavas, O son! I think the time has come (for making\r\npeace). Do not, O Duryodhana, transgress my command. If thou settest\r\nVasudeva aside, who now begs thee for peace and addresses thee for my\r\ngood, victory thou wilt never have in battle. Duryodhana, however, did\r\nset aside him of Dasarha's race, that bull among all bowmen, who then\r\nspoke what was for Duryodhana's good. By this, he embraced what was\r\ncalamitous to himself. Seized by Death himself, that wicked-souled son of\r\nmine, rejecting my counsels, adopted those of Duhsasana and Karna. I\r\nmyself did not approve of the game of dice. Vidura did not approve of it.\r\nThe ruler of the Sindhus did not, nor Bhishma; nor Salya; nor\r\nBhurisravas; nor Purumitra; nor Jaya; nor Aswatthaman; nor Kripa; nor\r\nDrona, O Sanjaya! If my son had conducted himself according to the\r\ncounsels of these persons, he would then, with his kinsmen and friends\r\nhave lived for ever in happiness and peace. Of sweet and delightful\r\nspeech ever saying what is agreeable amid their kinsmen, high-born, loved\r\nby all, and possessed of wisdom, the sons of Pandu are sure to obtain\r\nhappiness. The man who casteth his eye on righteousness, always and\r\neverywhere obtaineth happiness. Such a man after death, winneth benefit\r\nand grace. Possessed of sufficient might, the Pandavas deserve to enjoy\r\nhalf the earth. The earth girt by the seas is as much their ancestral\r\npossession (as of the Kurus). Possessed of sovereignty, the Pandavas will\r\nnever deviate from the track of righteousness. O child, I have kinsmen to\r\nwhose voice the Pandavas will ever listen, such, for instance, as Salya,\r\nSomadatta, the high-souled Bhishma, Drona, Vikarna, Valhika, Kripa, and\r\nothers among the Bharatas that are illustrious and reverend in years. If\r\nthey speak unto them on thy behalf the Pandavas will certainly act\r\naccording to those beneficial recommendations. Or, who amongst these,\r\nthinkest thou, belongs to their party that will speak to them otherwise?\r\nKrishna will never abandon the path of righteousness. The Pandavas are\r\nall obedient to him. Words of righteousness spoken by myself also, those\r\nheroes will never disobey, for the Pandavas are all of righteous soul.'\r\nPiteously lamenting, O Suta, I spoke these and many such words unto my\r\nson. Foolish as he is, he listened not to me! I think all this to be the\r\nmischievous influence of Time! There where Vrikodara and Arjuna are, and\r\nthe Vrishni hero, Satyaki, and Uttamaujas of the Panchalas, and the\r\ninvincible Yudhamanyu, and the irrepressible Dhrishtadyumna, and the\r\nunvanquished Sikhandin, the Asmakas, the Kekayas, and Kshatradharman of\r\n'the Somakas, the ruler of the Chedis, and Chekitana, and Vibhu, the son\r\nof the ruler of the Kasi, the sons of Draupadi, and Virata and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Drupada, and those tigers among men viz., the twins (Nakula\r\nand Sahadeva), and the stayer of Madhu to offer counsel, who is there in\r\nthis world that would fight these, expecting to live? Who else, again, is\r\nthere, save Duryodhana, and Karna, and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and\r\nDuhsasana as their fourth, for I do not see the fifth that would venture\r\nto resist my foes while the latter display their celestial weapons? They\r\nwho have Vishnu himself on their car, clad in mail and reins in hand,\r\nthey who have Arjuna for their warrior, they can never have defeat! Doth\r\nnot Duryodhana now recollect those lamentations of mine? The tiger among\r\nmen, Bhishma, thou hast said, has been slain. I think, beholding the\r\nfruits of the words uttered by the far-seeing Vidura, my sons are now\r\nindulging in lamentations! I think, beholding his army overwhelmed by\r\nSini's grandson and Arjuna, beholding the terraces of his cars empty, my\r\nsons are indulging in lamentations. As a swelling conflagration urged by\r\nthe winds consumes a heap of dry grass at the close of winter, even so\r\nwill Dhananjaya consume my troops. O Sanjaya, thou art accomplished in\r\nnarration. Tell me everything that transpired after the doing of that\r\ngreat wrong to Partha in the evening. When Abhimanyu was slain, what\r\nbecame the state of your minds? Having, O son, greatly offended the\r\nwielder of Gandiva, my warriors are incapable of bearing in battle his\r\nachievements. What measures were resolved upon by Duryodhana and what by\r\nKarna? What also did Duhsasana and Suvala's son do? O Sanjaya, O son,\r\nthat which has in battle befallen all my children assembled together, is\r\ncertainly due to the evil acts of the wicked Duryodhana, who followeth in\r\nthe path of avarice, who is of wicked understanding, whose judgment is\r\nperverted by wrath, who coveteth sovereignty, who is foolish, and who is\r\ndeprived of reason by anger. Tell me, O Sanjaya, what measures were then\r\nadopted by Duryodhana? Were they ill-judged or well-judged?'\""

Even as an\r\nembankment is useless after the waters (of the field) have flowed away,\r\neven so, O king, are these lamentations of thine useless! O bull of\r\nBharata's race, do not grieve. Wonderful as are the decrees of the\r\nDestroyer, they are incapable of being transgressed. Do not grieve, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, for this is not new. If thou hadst formerly\r\nrestrained Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, and thy sons also from the\r\nmatch at dice, this calamity then would never have overtaken thee. If,\r\nagain, when time for battle came, hadst thou restrained both the parties\r\ninflamed by wrath, this calamity then would never have overtaken thee.\r\nIf, again, hadst thou formerly urged the Kurus to slay the disobedient\r\nDuryodhana, then this calamity would never have overtaken thee. (If thou\r\nhadst done any of these acts), the Pandavas, the Panchalas, the Vrishnis,\r\nand the other kings would then have never known thy wrong-headedness. If,\r\nagain, doing, thy duty as a father, thou hadst, by placing Duryodhana in\r\nthe path of righteousness, caused him to tread along it, then this\r\ncalamity would never have overtaken thee. Thou art the wisest man on\r\nearth. Forsaking eternal virtue, how couldst thou follow the counsels of\r\nDuryodhana and Karna and Sakuni? These lamentations of thine, therefore,\r\nO king, that I hear,--of thine that art wedded to (worldly) wealth, seem\r\nto me to be honey mixed with poison. O monarch, formerly Krishna did not\r\nrespect king Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, or Drona, so much as he used\r\nto respect thee. When, however, he came to know thee as one fallen off\r\nfrom the duties of a king, since then Krishna hath ceased to regard thee\r\nwith respect. Thy sons had addressed various harsh speeches towards the\r\nsons of Pritha. Thou wast indifferent to those speeches then, O thou that\r\nwieldest sovereignty, unto thy sons. The consequence of that indifference\r\nof thine hath now overtaken thee. O sinless one, the ancestral\r\nsovereignty is now in danger. (If it is not so), obtain now the whole\r\nearth subjugated by the sons of Pritha.[134] The kingdom that the Kurus\r\nenjoy, as also their fame had been acquired by the Pandus. The virtuous\r\nsons of Pandu added to that kingdom and that fame. Those achievements,\r\nhowever, of theirs became (to them) barren of fruit as they came in\r\ncontact with thee, since they were deprived of even their ancestral\r\nkingdom by the covetous self. Now, O king, when the battle has begun,\r\nthou censurest thy sons indicating diverse faults of theirs. This is\r\nscarcely becoming. The Kshatriyas, while fighting, do not take care of\r\ntheir very lives. Indeed, those bulls among Kshatriyas fight, penetrating\r\ninto the array of the Parthas. Who else, indeed, save the Kauravas, would\r\nventure to fight with that force which is protected by Krishna and\r\nArjuna, by Satyaki and Vrikodara? Them that have Arjuna for their\r\nwarrior, them that have Janardana for their counsellor, them that have\r\nSatyaki and Vrikodara for their protectors, what mortal bowman is there\r\nthat would dare fight with, save the Kauravas and those that are\r\nfollowing their lead? All that is capable of being achieved by friendly\r\nkings endued with heroism and observant of the duties of Kshatriyas, all\r\nthat is being done by the warriors on the Kauravas side. Listen now,\r\ntherefore, to everything that hath taken place in the terrible battle\r\nbetween those tigers among men viz., the Kurus and the Pandavas.'\""

And some stretched their bows, and\r\nsome rubbed with their hands their bow-strings. And drawing deep breaths,\r\nmany of them shouted, saying, Where is that Dhananjaya? And some began to\r\nthrow upwards (and again seize) their naked swords, unyielding,\r\nwell-tempered, of the colour of the sky, possessed of great sharpness,\r\nand furnished with beautiful hilts. And brave warriors, desirous of\r\nbattle, by thousands, were seen to perform the evolutions of swordmen and\r\nof bowmen, with skill acquired by practice. Some whirling their maces\r\ndecked with bells, smeared with sandal paste, and adorned with gold and\r\ndiamonds enquired after the sons of Pandu. Some intoxicated with the\r\npride of strength, and possessed of massive arms, obstructed the welkin\r\nwith their spiked clubs that resembled (a forest of flag) staff raised in\r\nhonour of Indra. Others, brave warriors all, adorned with beautiful\r\ngarlands of flowers, desirous of battle, occupied diverse portions of the\r\nfield, armed with diverse weapons. 'Where is Arjuna? Where is that\r\nGovinda? Where is proud Bhima? Where also are those allies of their?'\r\nEven thus did they call upon them in battle. Then blowing his conch and\r\nhimself urging the horses to great speed, Drona moved about with great\r\ncelerity, arraying his troops. After all those divisions that delight in\r\nbattle had taken up their stations, Bharadwaja's son, O king, said these\r\nwords unto Jayadratha. 'Thyself, Somadatta's son, the mighty car-warrior\r\nKarna, Aswatthaman, Salya, Vrishasena and Kripa, with a hundred thousand\r\nhorse, sixty thousand cars, four and ten thousand elephants with rent\r\ntemples, one and twenty thousand foot-soldiers clad in mail take up your\r\nstation behind me at the distance of twelve miles. There the very gods\r\nwith Vasava at their head will not be able to attack thee, what need be\r\nsaid, therefore, of the Pandavas? Take comfort, O ruler of the Sindhus.\r\nThus addressed (by Drona), Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus, became\r\ncomforted. And he proceeded to the spot indicated by Drona, accompanied\r\nby many Gandhara warriors, and surrounded by those great car-warriors,\r\nand with many foot-soldiers clad in mail, prepared to fight vigorously\r\nand armed with nooses. The steeds of Jayadratha, well-skilled in bearing\r\nof drawing were all, O monarch, decked with yalk-tails and ornaments of\r\ngold. And seven thousand such steeds, and three thousand other steeds of\r\nthe Sindhu breed were with him.'\r\n\r\n\"Thy son Durmarshana, desirous of doing battle, stationed himself at the\r\nhead of all the troops, accompanied by a thousand and five hundred\r\ninfuriated elephants and awful size clad in mail and of fierce deeds, and\r\nall ridden by well-trained elephant-riders. Thy two other sons, viz.,\r\nDuhsasana and Vikarna, took up their position amid the advance-divisions\r\nof the army, for the accomplishment of the objects of Jayadratha. The\r\narray that Bharadwaja's son formed, part Sakata and part a circle, was\r\nfull forty-eight miles long and the width of its rear measured twenty\r\nmiles. Drona himself formed that array with countless brave kings,\r\nstationed with it, and countless cars and steeds and elephants and\r\nfoot-soldiers. In the rear of that array was another impenetrable array\r\nof the form of lotus. And within that lotus was another dense array\r\ncalled the needle. Having formed his mighty array thus, Drona took up his\r\nstation. At the mouth of that needle, the great bowman Kritavarman took\r\nup his stand. Next to Kritavarman, O sire, stood the ruler of the\r\nKamvojas and Jalasandha. Next to these, stood Duryodhana and Karna.\r\nBehind them hundreds and thousands of unreturning heroes were stationed\r\nin that Sakata for protecting its head. Behind them all, O monarch, and\r\nsurrounded by a vast force, was king Jayadratha stationed at one side of\r\nthat needle-shaped array. At the entrance of the Sakata, O king, was\r\nBharadwaja's son. Behind Drona was the chief of the Bhojas, who protected\r\nhim. Clad in white armour, with excellent head-gear, of broad chest and\r\nmighty arms, Drona stood, stretching his large bow, like the Destroyer\r\nhimself in wrath. Beholding Drona's car which was graced with a beautiful\r\nstandard and had red sacrificial altar and a black deer-skin, the\r\nKauravas were filled with delight. Seeing that array formed by Drona,\r\nwhich resembled the ocean itself in agitation, the Siddhas and the\r\nCharanas were filled with wonder. And all creatures thought that array\r\nwould devour the whole earth with her mountains and seas and forests, and\r\nabounding with diverse things. And king Duryodhana, beholding that mighty\r\narray in the form of a Sakata, teeming with carts and men and steeds and\r\nelephants, roaring dreadful of wonderful form, and capable of riving the\r\nhearts of foes, began to rejoice.'\""

Many thousands of ravens and crows,\r\nO Bharata, proceeded sporting on the front of Arjuna's car. Various\r\nanimals of terrible cries, and jackals of inauspicious sight, began to\r\nyell and howl on our right as we proceeded to battle. Thousands of\r\nblazing meteors fell with great noise. The whole earth trembled on that\r\ndreadful occasion. Dry winds blew in all directions, accompanied by\r\nthunder, and driving bard pebbles and gravel when Kunti's son came at the\r\ncommencement of battle. Then Nakula's son, Satanika, and Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nthe son of Pritha, those two warriors possessed of great wisdom, arrayed\r\nthe several divisions of the Pandavas. Then thy son Durmarshana,\r\naccompanied by a thousand cars, a hundred elephants, three thousand\r\nheroes, and ten thousand foot-soldiers, and covering a piece of ground\r\nthat measured the length of fifteen hundred bows, took up his position at\r\nthe very van of all the troops, and said: 'Like the continent resisting\r\nthe surging sea, even I will today resist the wielder of Gandiva, that\r\nscorcher of foes, that warrior who is irresistible in battle. Let people\r\ntoday behold the wrathful Dhananjaya collide with me, like a mass of\r\nstone against another stony mass. Ye car-warriors that are desirous of\r\nbattle, stay ye (as witness). Alone I will fight with all the Pandavas\r\nassembled together, for enhancing my honour and fame. That high-souled\r\nand noble son of thine, that great bowman saying this, stood there\r\nsurrounded by many great bowmen. Then, like the Destroyer himself in\r\nwrath, or Vasava himself armed with the thunder, or Death's irresistible\r\nself armed with his club and urged on by Time, or Mahadeva armed with the\r\ntrident and incapable of being ruffled, or Varuna bearing his noise, or\r\nthe blazing fire at the end of the Yuga risen for consuming the creation,\r\nthe slayer of the Nivatakavachas inflamed with rage and swelling with\r\nmight, the ever-victorious Jaya, devoted to truth and desirous of\r\nachieving his great vow, clad in mail and armed with sword, decked in\r\ngolden diadem, adorned with garlands of swords of white flowers and\r\nattired in white robes, his arms decked with beautiful Angadas and ears\r\nwith excellent ear-rings, mounted on his own foremost of cars, (the\r\nincarnate) Nara, accompanied by Narayana, shaking his Gandiva in battle,\r\nshone brilliantly like the risen sun. And Dhananjaya of great prowess,\r\nplacing his car, O king, at the very van of his army, where densest\r\nshowers of arrows would fall, blew his conch. Then Krishna also, O sire,\r\nfearlessly blew with great force his foremost of conchs called\r\nPanchajanya as Partha blew his. And in consequence of the blare of the\r\nconchs, all the warriors in thy army, O monarch, trembled and became lost\r\nheart. And their hair stood on end at that sound. As an creatures are\r\noppressed with fright at the sound of the thunder, even so did all thy\r\nwarriors took fright at the blare of those conchs. And all the animals\r\nejected urine and excreta. Thy whole army with its animals became filled\r\nwith anxiety, O king, and in consequence of the blare of those (two)\r\nconchs, all men, O sire, lost their strength. And some amongst them, O\r\nmonarch, were inspired with dread, and some lost their senses. And the\r\nape on Arjuna's banner, opening his mouth wide, made an awful noise with\r\nthe other creatures on it, for terrifying thy troops. Then conchs and\r\nhorns and cymbals and Anakas were once more blown and beat for cheering\r\nthy warriors. And that noise mingled with the noise of diverse (other)\r\nmusical instruments, with the shouts of warriors and the slaps of their\r\narm-pits, and with their leonine roars uttered by great car-warriors in\r\nsummoning and challenging (their antagonists). When that tumultuous\r\nuproar rose there, an uproar that enhanced the fear of the timid, the son\r\nof Pakasana, filled with great delight, addressing him of Dasarha's race,\r\nsaid (these words).'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesa, to where Durmarshana\r\nstayeth. Piercing through that elephant division I will penetrate into\r\nthe hostile army.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Savyasachin, the mighty-armed\r\nKesava urged the steeds to where Durmarshana was staying. Fierce and\r\nawful was the encounter that commenced there between one and the many, an\r\nencounter that proved very destructive of cars and elephants and men.\r\nThen Partha, resembling a pouring cloud, covered his foes with showers of\r\nshafts, like a mass of clouds pouring rain on the mountain breast.[135]\r\nThe hostile of car-warriors also, displaying great lightness of hand,\r\nquickly covered both Krishna and Dhananjaya with clouds of arrows. The\r\nmighty-armed Partha, then, thus opposed in battle by his foes, became\r\nfilled with wrath, and began to strike off with his arrows the heads of\r\ncar-warriors from their trunks. And the earth became strewn with\r\nbeautiful heads decked with ear-rings and turbans, the nether lips bit by\r\nthe upper ones, and the faces adorned with eyes troubled with wrath.\r\nIndeed, the scattered heads of the warriors looked resplendent like an\r\nassemblage of plucked off and crushed lotuses lying strewn about the\r\nfield. Golden coats of mail[136] dyed with gore (lying thick over the\r\nfield), looked like masses of clouds charged with lightning. The sound, O\r\nking, of severed heads dropping on the earth, resembled that of falling\r\npalmyra fruits ripened in due time, headless trunks arose, some with bow\r\nin hand, and some with naked swords upraised in the act of striking.\r\nThose brave warriors incapable of brooking Arjuna's feats and desirous of\r\nvanquishing him, had no distinct perception as to when their heads were\r\nstruck off by Arjuna. The earth became strewn with heads of horses,\r\ntrunks of elephants, and the arms and legs of heroic warriors. 'This is\r\none Partha', 'Where is Partha? Here is Partha!', 'Even thus, O king, the\r\nwarriors, of thy army became filled with the idea of Partha only.\r\nDeprived of their senses by Time, they regarded the whole world to be\r\nfull of Partha only, and therefore, many of them perished, striking one\r\nanother, and some struck even their own selves. Uttering yells of woe,\r\nmany heroes, covered with blood, deprived of their senses, and in great\r\nagony, laid themselves down, calling upon their friends and kinsmen.\r\nArms, bearing short arrows, or lances, or darts, or swords, or\r\nbattle-axes, or pointed stakes, or scimitars, or bows, or spears, or\r\nshafts, or maces, and cased in armour and decked with Angadas and other\r\nornaments, and looking like large snakes, and resembling huge clubs, cut\r\noff (from trunks) with mighty weapons, were seen to jump about, jerk\r\nabout, and move about, with great force, as if in rage. Every one amongst\r\nthose that wrathfully advanced against Partha in that battle, perished,\r\npierced in his body with some fatal shafts of that hero. While dancing on\r\nhis car as it moved, and drawing his bow, no one there could detect the\r\nminutest opportunity for striking him. The quickness with which he took\r\nhis shafts, fixed them on the bow, and let them off, filled all his\r\nenemies with wonder. Indeed Phalguna, with his shafts, pierced elephants\r\nand elephant-riders, horses and horse-riders, car-warriors and drivers of\r\ncars. There was none amongst his enemies, whether staying before him or\r\nstruggling in battle, or wheeling about, whom the son of Pandu did not\r\nslay. As the sun rising in the welkin destroyeth the thick gloom, even so\r\ndid Arjuna destroy that elephant-force by means of his shafts winged with\r\nKanka plumes. The field occupied by thy troops, in consequence of riven\r\nelephants fallen upon it, looked like the earth strewn with huge hills at\r\nthe hour of universal dissolution. As the midday sun is incapable of\r\nbeing looked at by all creatures, even so was Dhananjaya, excited with\r\nwrath, incapable of being looked at, in battle, by his enemies. The\r\ntroops of thy son, O chastiser of foes, afflicted (with the arrows of\r\nDhananjaya), broke and fled in fear. Like a mass of clouds pierced and\r\ndriven away by a mighty wind, that army was pierced and routed by Partha.\r\nNone indeed could gaze at the hero while he was slaying the foe. Urging\r\ntheir heroes to great speed by spurs, by the horns of their bows, by deep\r\ngrowls, by encouraging behests, by whips, by cuts on their flanks, and by\r\nthreatening speeches, thy men, viz., thy cavalry and thy car-warriors, as\r\nalso thy foot-soldiers, struck by the shafts of Arjuna, fled away from\r\nthe fields. Others (that rode on elephants), fled away, urging those huge\r\nbeasts by pressing their flanks with their hooks and many warriors struck\r\nby Partha's arrows, in flying, ran against Partha himself. Indeed, thy\r\nwarriors, then became all cheerless and their understandings were all\r\nconfused."

That hero of fierce prowess, cased in a\r\nbeautiful coat of mail, made of gold, and his head covered with a turban\r\ndecked with gold, caused Arjuna to be surrounded by a large\r\nelephant-force which seemed capable of devouring the whole earth. With\r\nsound of the elephants' bells, the blare of conchs, the twang of\r\nbow-strings, and the grunts of the tuskers, the earth, the points of\r\ncompass, and the welkin, seemed to be entirely filled.

And in consequence of the\r\nsound of horses' hoofs, rattle of car-wheels, the shouts of combatants,\r\nthe twang of bow-strings, the noise of diverse musical instruments, the\r\nblare of Panchajanya and Devadatta, and roar of Gandiva, men and\r\nelephants were dispirited and deprived of their senses. And men and\r\nelephants were riven by Savyasachin with his shafts whose touch resembled\r\nthat of snakes of virulent poison. And those elephants, in that battle,\r\nwere pierced all over their bodies with shafts, numbering thousands upon\r\nthousands shot from Gandiva. While thus mangled by the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna), they uttered loud noises and incessantly fell down on the earth\r\nlike mountains shorn of their wings. Others struck at the jaw, or frontal\r\nglobes, or temples with long shafts, uttered cries resembling those of\r\ncranes. The diadem-decked (Arjuna) began to cut off, with his straight\r\narrows the heads of warriors standing on the necks of elephants. Those\r\nheads decked with ear-rings, constantly falling on the earth, resembled a\r\nmultitude of lotuses that Partha was calling for an offer to his gods.\r\nAnd while the elephants wandered on the field, many warriors were seen to\r\nhang from their bodies, divested of armour, afflicted with wounds,\r\ncovered with blood, and looking like painted pictures. In some instances,\r\ntwo or three warriors, pierced by one arrow winged with beautiful\r\nfeathers and well-shot (from Gandiva), fell down on the earth. Many\r\nelephants deeply pierced with long shafts, fell down, vomiting blood from\r\ntheir mouths, with the riders on their backs, like hills overgrown with\r\nforests tumbling down through some convulsion of nature. Partha, by means\r\nof his straight shafts, cut into fragments the bow-strings, standards,\r\nbows, yokes, and shafts of the car-warriors opposed to him. None could\r\nnotice when Arjuna took up his arrows, when he fixed them on the\r\nbow-string, when he drew the string, and when he let them off. All that\r\ncould be seen was that Partha seemed to dance on his car with his bow\r\nincessantly drawn to a circle. Elephants, deeply pierced with long shafts\r\nand vomiting blood from their mouths, fell down, as soon as they were\r\nstruck, on the earth. And in the midst of that great carnage, O monarch,\r\ninnumerable headless trunks were seen to stand up. Arms, with bows in\r\ngrasp, or whose fingers were cased in leathern gloves, holding swords, or\r\ndecked with Angadas and other ornaments of gold, cut off from trunks,\r\nwere seen lying about. And the field of battle was strewn with\r\ninnumerable Upashkaras and Adhishthanas, and shafts, and crowns, crushed\r\ncar-wheels, and broken Akshas, and yokes, and warriors armed with shields\r\nand bows, and floral garlands, and ornaments and robes and fallen\r\nstandards. And in consequence of those slain elephants and steeds, and\r\nthe fallen bodies of Kshatriyas, the earth there assumed an awful aspect.\r\nDuhsasana's forces, thus slaughtered, O king, by the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna), fled away. Their leader himself was in great pain, for\r\nDuhsasana, greatly afflicted by those shafts, overcome by fear entered\r\nwith his division the Sakata array, seeking Drona as his deliverer.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Slaying the force of Duhsasana, the mighty car-warrior,\r\nSavyasachin, desirous of getting at the ruler of the Sindhus, proceeded\r\nagainst the division of Drona, Having approached Drona who was stationed\r\nat the entrance of the array, Partha, at Krishna's request joined his\r\nhands and said these words unto Drona: 'Wish me well, O Brahmana, and\r\nbless me, saying Swasti! Through thy grace, I wish to penetrate into this\r\nimpenetrable array. Thou art to me even as my sire, or even as king\r\nYudhishthira the just, or even as Krishna! I tell thee this truly. O\r\nsire, O sinless one! Even as Aswatthaman deserves to be protected by\r\nthee, I also deserve to be protected by thee, O foremost of regenerate\r\nones! Through thy grace, O foremost of men, I desire to stay the ruler of\r\nthe Sindhu in battle. O lord, see that my vow is accomplished.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by him, the preceptor, smiling,\r\nreplied unto him, saying, 'O Vibhatsu, without vanquishing me, thou shalt\r\nnot be able to vanquish Jayadratha. Telling him this much, Drona, with a\r\nsmile covered him with showers of sharp arrows, as also his car and\r\nsteeds and standard and charioteer. Then, Arjuna baffling Drona's arrowy\r\nshowers with his own arrows, rushed against Drona, shooting mightier and\r\nMore awful shafts. Observant of Kshatriya duties, Arjuna then pierced\r\nDrona in that battle with nine arrows. Cutting the shafts of Arjuna by\r\nhis own shafts, Drona then pierced both Krishna and Arjuna with many\r\nshafts that resembled poison or fire, Then, while Arjuna was thinking of\r\ncutting of Drona's bow with his arrows, the latter, endued with great\r\nvalour, fearlessly and quickly cut off, with shafts the bow-string of the\r\nillustrious Phalguna. And he also pierced Phalguna's steeds and standard\r\nand charioteer. And the heroic Drona covered Phalguna himself with many\r\narrows, smiling the while. Meantime, stringing his large bow anew,\r\nPartha, that foremost of all persons conversant with arms, getting the\r\nbetter of his preceptor, quickly shot six hundred arrows as if he had\r\ntaken and shot only one arrow. And once more he shot seven hundred other\r\narrows, and then a thousand arrows incapable of being resisted, and ten\r\nthousand other arrows. All these slew many warriors of Drona's array.\r\nDeeply pierced with those weapons by the mighty and accomplished Partha,\r\nacquainted with all modes of warfare, many men and steeds and elephants\r\nfell down deprived of life. And car-warriors, afflicted by those shafts,\r\nfell down from their foremost of cars, deprived of horses and standards\r\nand destitute of weapons and life. And elephants fell down like summits\r\nof hills, or masses of clouds, or large houses, loosened, dispersed, or\r\nburnt down by the thunder, or by the wind, or fire. Struck with Arjuna's\r\nshafts, thousands of steeds fell down like swans on the breast of\r\nHimavat, struck down by the force of watery current. Like the Sun, that\r\nrises at the end of the Yuga, drying up with his rays, vast quantities of\r\nwater, the son of Pandu, by his showers of weapons and arrows, slew a\r\nvast number of car-warriors and steeds and elephants and foot-soldiers.\r\nThen like the clouds covering the sun, the Drona-cloud, with its arrowy\r\nshowers, covered the Pandava-sun, whose rays in the shape of thick\r\nshowers of arrows were scorching in the battle the foremost ones among\r\nthe Kurus. And then the preceptor struck Dhananjaya at the breast with a\r\nlong shaft shot with great force and capable of drinking the life-blood\r\nof every foe. Then Arjuna, deprived of strength, shook in all his limbs,\r\nlike a hill during an earthquake. Soon, however, regaining for fortitude,\r\nVibhatsu pierced Drona with many winged arrows. Then Drona struck\r\nVasudeva with five arrows. And he struck Arjuna with three and seventy\r\narrows, and his standard with three. Then, O king, the valorous Drona\r\ngetting the better of his disciple, within the twinkling of an eye made\r\nArjuna invisible by means of his arrowy showers. We then beheld the\r\nshafts of Bharadwaja's son falling in continuous lines, and his bow also\r\nwas seen to present the wonderful aspect of being incessantly drawn to a\r\ncircle. And those shafts, countless in number, and winged with the Kanka\r\nfeathers, shot by Drona in that battle, incessantly fell, O king, on\r\nDhananjaya and Vasudeva. Beholding then that battle between Drona and the\r\nson of Pandu, Vasudeva of great intelligence began to reflect upon the\r\naccomplishment of the (important) task. Then Vasudeva, addressing\r\nDhananjaya, said these words: 'O Partha, O thou of mighty arms, we should\r\nnot waste time. We must go on, avoiding Drona, for a more important task\r\nawaits us. In reply Partha said unto Krishna, O Kesava, as thou pleasest!\r\nThen keeping the mighty-armed Drona to their right, Arjuna proceeded\r\nonwards. Turning his face round, Vibhatsu proceeded, shooting his shafts.\r\nThen Drona, addressing Arjuna, said, Whither dost thou proceed, O son of\r\nPandu! Is it not true that thou ceasest not (to fight) till thou hast\r\nvanquished thy foe?'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna answered, 'Thou art my preceptor and not my foe. I am thy\r\ndisciple and, therefore, like to thy son. Nor is there the man in the\r\nwhole world who can vanquish thee in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Saying these words, the mighty-armed Vibhatsu,\r\ndesirous of slaying Jayadratha, quickly proceeded against the (Kaurava)\r\ntroops. And while he penetrated into thy army, those high-souled princes\r\nof Panchala, viz., Yudhamanyu, and Uttamaujas, followed him as the\r\nprotector of his wheels. Then, O King, Jaya, and Kritavarman of the\r\nSatwata race, and the ruler of the Kamvojas, and Srutayus, began to\r\noppose the progress of Dhananjaya. And these had ten thousand\r\ncar-warriors for their followers. The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the\r\nSivis, the Vasatis, the Mavellakas, the Lilithyas, the Kaikeyas, the\r\nMadrakas, the Narayana Gopalas, and the various tribes of the Kamvojas\r\nwho had before been vanquished by Karna, all of whom were regarded as\r\nvery brave, placing Bharadwaja's son at their head, and becoming\r\nregardless of their lives, rushed towards Arjuna, for resisting that\r\nangry hero, burning with grief on account of the death of his son, that\r\nwarrior resembling all-destroying Death himself, clad in mail, conversant\r\nwith all modes of warfare, prepared to throw away his life in thick of\r\nbattle,--that mighty bowman of great prowess, that tiger among men,--who\r\nresembled an infuriate leader of elephantine herd, and who seemed ready\r\nto devour the whole hostile army. The battle then that commenced was\r\nexceedingly fierce and made the hair stand on end, between all those\r\ncombatants on the one side and Arjuna on the other. And all of them,\r\nuniting together, began to resist that bull among men, advancing for the\r\nslaughter of Jayadratha, like medicines resisting a raging disease.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Held in check by them, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nviz., Partha of great might and prowess, was quickly pursued by Drona\r\nfrom behind. The son of Pandu, however, like diseases scorching the body,\r\nblasted that army, scattering his sharp shafts and resembling on that\r\naccount the sun himself scattering his countless rays of light. And\r\nsteeds were pierced, and cars with riders were broken and mangled, and\r\nelephants were overthrown. And umbrellas were cut off and displaced, and\r\nvehicles were deprived of their wheels. And the combatants fled on all\r\nsides, exceedingly afflicted with arrows. Even thus progressed that\r\nfierce battle between those warriors and Arjuna encountering each other.\r\nNothing could be distinguished. With his straight shafts, Arjuna, O\r\nmonarch, made the hostile army tremble incessantly. Firmly devoted to\r\ntruth, Arjuna then, of white steeds desirous of accomplishing his vow\r\nrushed against the foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona of red steeds.\r\nThen the preceptor, Drona, struck his disciple, viz., the mighty bowman\r\nArjuna, with five and twenty straight shafts capable of reaching the very\r\nvitals. Thereupon, Vibhatsu, that foremost of all wielders of weapons,\r\nquickly rushed against Drona, shooting arrows capable of baffling the\r\nforce of counter arrows, shot at him. Invoking into existence then the\r\nBrahma weapon, Arjuna, of immeasurable soul, baffled with his straight\r\nshafts those shot so speedily at him by Drona. The skill we then beheld\r\nof Drona was exceedingly wonderful, since Arjuna, though young, and\r\nthough struggling vigorously, could not pierce Drona with a single shaft.\r\nLike a mass of clouds pouring torrents of rain, the Drona cloud rained\r\nshower on the Partha-mountain. Possessed of great energy, Arjuna received\r\nthat arrowy downpour, O king, by invoking the Brahma weapon, and cut off\r\nall those arrows by arrows of his own. Drona then afflicted Partha of\r\nwhite steeds with five and twenty arrows. And he struck Vasudeva with\r\nseventy arrows on the chest and arms. Partha then, of great intelligence,\r\nsmiling the while resisted the preceptor in that battle who was\r\nincessantly shooting sharp arrows. Then those two foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, while thus struck by Drona, avoided that invincible\r\nwarrior, who resembled the raging Yuga fire. Avoiding those sharp shafts\r\nshot from Drona's bow, the diadem-decked son of Kunti, adorned with\r\ngarlands of flowers, began to slaughter the host of the Bhojas. Indeed,\r\navoiding the invincible Drona who stood immovable like the Mainaka\r\nmountain, Arjuna took up his position between Kritavarman and Sudakshina\r\nthe ruler of the Kamvojas. Then that tiger among men, viz., the ruler of\r\nthe Bhojas, coolly pierced that invincible and foremost descendant of\r\nRuru with ten arrows winged with Kanka feathers. Then Arjuna pierced him,\r\nO monarch, in that battle with a hundred arrows. And once more he pierced\r\nhim with three other arrows, stupefying that hero of the Satwata race.\r\nThe ruler of the Bhojas then, laughing the while, pierced Partha and\r\nVasudeva each with five and twenty arrows. Arjuna then, cutting off\r\nKritavarman's bow, pierced him with one and twenty arrows resembling\r\nblazing flames of fire or angry snakes of virulent poison. Then\r\nKritavarman, that mighty car-warrior, taking up another bow, pierced\r\nArjuna in the chest, O Bharata, with five arrows. And once more he\r\npierced Partha with five sharp arrows. Then Partha struck him in return\r\nin the centre of the chest with nine arrows. Beholding the son of Kunti\r\nobstructed before the car of Kritavarman, he of Vrishni's race thought\r\nthat no time should be wasted. Then Krishna addressing Partha, said, Do\r\nnot show any mercy to Kritavarman! Disregarding thy relationship (with\r\nhim), crush and slay him!' Then Arjuna, stupefying Kritavarman with his\r\narrows, proceeded, on his swift steeds, to the division of the Kamvojas.\r\nSeeing Arjuna of white steeds penetrate into the Kamvoja force,\r\nKritavarman became filled with wrath. Taking his bow with arrows fixed\r\nthereon, he then encountered the two Panchala princes. Indeed,\r\nKritavarman, with his arrows resisted those two Panchala princes as they\r\nadvanced, following Arjuna for protecting his wheels. Then Kritavarman,\r\nthe ruler of the Bhojas, pierced them both with sharp shafts, striking\r\nYudhamanyu with three, and Uttamaujas with four. Those two princes in\r\nreturn each pierced him with ten arrows. And once more, Yudhamanyu\r\nshooting three arrows and Uttamaujas shooting three cut off Kritavarman's\r\nstandard and bow. Then the son of Hridika, taking up another bow, and\r\nbecoming infuriated with rage, deprived both those warriors of their bows\r\nand covered them with arrows. Then those two warriors, taking up and\r\nstringing two other bows, began to pierce Kritavarman. Meanwhile Vibhatsu\r\npenetrated into the hostile army. But those two princes, resisted by\r\nKritavarman, obtained no admittance into the Dhritarashtra host, although\r\nthose bulls among men struggled vigorously. Then Arjuna of white steeds\r\nquickly afflicted in that battle the divisions opposed to him. That\r\nslayer of foes, however, slew not Kritavarman although he had got him\r\nwithin reach.. Beholding Partha thus proceeding, the brave king\r\nSrutayudha, filled with wrath, rushed at him, shaking his large bow. And\r\nhe pierced Partha with three arrows, and Janardana with seventy. And he\r\nstruck the standard of Partha with a very sharp arrow having a razor-like\r\nhead. Then Arjuna, filled with wrath deeply pierced his antagonist with\r\nninety straight shafts, like (a rider) striking a mighty elephant with\r\nthe hook. Srutayudha, however, could not, O king, brook that act of\r\nprowess on the part of Pandu's son. He pierced Arjuna in return with\r\nseven and seventy shafts. Arjuna then cut off Srutayudha's bow and then\r\nhis quiver, and angrily struck him on the chest with seven straight\r\nshafts. Then, king Srutayudha, deprived of his senses by wrath, took up\r\nanother bow and struck the son of Vasava with nine arrows on the latter's\r\narms and chest. Then Arjuna, that chastiser of foes laughing the while, O\r\nBharata, afflicted Srutayudha with many thousands of arrows. And that\r\nmighty car-warrior quickly slew also the latter's steeds and charioteer.\r\nEndued with great strength the son of Pandu then pierced his foe with\r\nseventy arrows. Then the valiant king Srutayudha abandoning that\r\nsteedless car, rushed in that encounter against Partha, uplifting his\r\nmace. The heroic king Srutayudha was the son of Varuna, having for his\r\nmother that mighty river of cool water called Parnasa. His mother, O\r\nking, had for the sake of her son, begged Varuna saying, 'Let this my son\r\nbecome unslayable on earth.' Varuna, gratified (with her), had said, 'I\r\ngive him a boon highly beneficial to him, viz., a celestial weapon, by\r\nvirtue of which this thy son will become unslayable on earth by foes. No\r\nman can have immortality. O foremost of rivers, every one who hath taken\r\nbirth must inevitably die. This child, however, will always be invincible\r\nby foes in battle, through the power of this weapon. Therefore, let thy\r\nheart's fever be dispelled.' Having said these words, Varuna gave him,\r\nwith mantras, a mace. Obtaining that mace, Srutayudha became invincible\r\non earth. Unto him, however, illustrious Lord of the waters again said,\r\n'This mace should not be hurled at one who is not engaged in fight. If\r\nhurled at such a person, it will come back and fall upon thyself. O\r\nillustrious child, (if so hurled) it will then course in an opposite\r\ndirection and slay the person hurling it.' It would seem that when his\r\nhour came, Srutayudha disobeyed that injunction. With that hero-slaying\r\nmace he attacked Janardana, The valiant Krishna received that mace on one\r\nof his well-formed and stout shoulders. It failed to shake Sauri, like\r\nthe wind failing to shake the Vindhya mountain. That mace, returning unto\r\nSrutayudha himself, struck that brave and wrathful king staying on his\r\ncar, like an ill-accomplished act of sorcery injuring the performer\r\nhimself, and slaying that hero fell down on the earth. Beholding the mace\r\nturn back and Srutayudha slain, loud cries of Alas and Oh arose there\r\namong the troops, at the sight of Srutayudha that chastiser of foes,\r\nslain by a weapon of his own.[137] And because, O monarch, Srutayudha had\r\nhurled that mace at Janardana who was not engaged in fighting it slew him\r\nwho had hurled it. And Srutayudha perished on the field, even in the\r\nmanner that Varuna had indicated. Deprived of life, he fell down on the\r\nearth before the eyes of all the bowmen. While falling down, that dear\r\nson of Parnasa shone resplendent like a tall banian with spreading boughs\r\nbroken by the wind. Then all the troops and even all the principal\r\nwarriors fled away, beholding Srutayudha, that chastiser of foes, slain.\r\nThen, the son of the ruler of the Kamvojas, viz., the brave Sudakshina,\r\nrushed on his swift steeds against Phalguna that slayer of foes. Partha,\r\nthen, O Bharata, sped seven shafts at him. Those shafts passing through\r\nthe body of that hero, entered the earth. Deeply pierced those shafts\r\nsped in battle from Gandiva, Sudakshina pierced Arjuna in return with ten\r\nshafts winged with Kanka feathers. And piercing Vasudeva with three\r\nshafts, he once more pierced Partha with five. Then, O sire, Partha,\r\ncutting off Sudakshina's bow, lopped off the latter's standard. And the\r\nson of Pandu pierced his antagonist with a couple of broad-headed arrows\r\nof great sharpness. Sudakshina, however, piercing Partha once more with\r\nthree arrows, uttered a leonine shout. Then the brave Sudakshina, filled\r\nwith wrath, hurled at the wielder of Gandiva a terrible dart made wholly\r\nof iron and decked with bells. That dart blazing as a large meteor, and\r\nemitting sparks of fire, approaching that mighty car-warrior pierced him\r\nthrough and fell down on the earth. Deeply struck by that dart and\r\novercome with a swoon, Arjuna soon enough recovered. Then that hero of\r\nmighty energy, licking the corners of his mouth, that son of Pandu, of\r\ninconceivable feats, pierced his foe, along with his steeds, standard,\r\nbow, and charioteer, with four and ten shafts winged with Kanka feathers.\r\nWith other arrows, countless in number, Partha then cut Sudakshina's car\r\ninto fragments. And then the son of Pandu pierced Sudakshina, the prince\r\nof the Kamvojas, whose purpose and prowess had both been baffled, with a\r\nsharp arrow in the chest. Then the brave prince of the Kamvojas, his coat\r\nof mail cut off, his limbs weakened, his diadem and Angadas displaced,\r\nfell head downwards, like a pole of Indra when hurled from an engine.\r\nLike a beautiful Karnikara tree in the spring, gracefully growing on a\r\nmountain summit with beautiful branches, lying on the earth when uprooted\r\nby the wind, the prince of the Kamvojas lay on the bare ground deprived\r\nof life, though deserving of the costliest bed, decked with costly\r\nornaments. Handsome, possessed of eyes that were of a coppery hue, and\r\nbearing on his head a garland of gold, endued with the effulgence of\r\nfire, the mighty-armed Sudakshina, the son of the ruler of the Kamvojas,\r\noverthrown by Partha with his shafts, and lying on the earth, reft of\r\nfife, looked resplendent like a beautiful mountain with a level top. Then\r\nall the troops of thy son fled away, beholding Srutayudha, and Sudakshina\r\nthe prince of the Kamvojas, slain.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of Sudakshina and of the heroic Srutayudha,\r\nO monarch, thy warriors, filled with wrath, rushed with speed at Partha.\r\nThe Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis began, O king, to\r\nscatter their arrowy showers on Dhananjaya. The son of Pandu then\r\nconsumed by means of his arrows six hundred of them at once. Thereupon,\r\nthose warriors, terrified, fled away like smaller animals from a tiger.\r\nRallying, they once more surrounded Partha, who was slaying his foes and\r\nvanquishing them in battle. Dhananjaya then, with shafts sped from\r\nGandiva, speedily felled the heads and arms of the combatants thus\r\nrushing upon him. Not an inch of the field of battle was unstrewn with\r\nfallen heads, and the flights of crows and vultures and ravens that\r\nhovered over the field seemed to form a cloudy canopy. Seeing their men\r\nthus exterminated, Srutayus and Achyutayus were both filled with wrath.\r\nAnd they continued to contend vigorously with Dhananjaya. Endued with\r\ngreat might, proud, heroic, of noble lineage, and possessed of strength\r\nof arms, those two bowmen, O king, solicitous of winning great fame and\r\ndesirous, for the sake of thy son, to compass the destruction of Arjuna,\r\nquickly showered upon the latter their arrowy downpours at once from his\r\nright and left. Those angry heroes, with a thousand straight shafts,\r\ncovered Arjuna like two masses of clouds filling a lake. Then that\r\nforemost of car-warriors viz., Srutayus filled with wrath, struck\r\nDhananjaya with a well-tempered lance. That crusher of foes viz., Arjuna,\r\nthen, deeply pierced by his mighty foe, swooned away in that battle,\r\nstupefying Kesava also (by that act). Meanwhile, the mighty car-warrior\r\nAchyutayus forcibly struck the son of Pandu with a keen-pointed spear. By\r\nthe act he seemed to pour an acid upon the wound of the high-souled son\r\nof Pandu. Deeply pierced therewith, Partha supported himself by seizing\r\nthe flag-staff. Then a leonine shout was sent forth by all the troops, O\r\nmonarch, in the belief that Dhananjaya was deprived of life. And Krishna\r\nalso was scorched with grief upon beholding Partha senseless. Then Kesava\r\ncomforted Dhananjaya with soothing words.. Then those foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, (viz., Srutayus and Achyutayus), of true aim, pouring their\r\narrowy showers on all sides, in that battle, made Dhananjaya and Vasudeva\r\nof Vrishni's race invisible with their car and car-wheels and Kuvaras,\r\ntheir steeds and flagstaff and banner. And all this seemed wonderful.\r\nMeanwhile, O Bharata, Vibhatsu slowly regained his senses, like one come\r\nback from the very abode of the king of the dead. Beholding his car with\r\nKesava overwhelmed with arrows and seeing also those two antagonists of\r\nhis staying before him like two blazing fires, the mighty car-warriors\r\nPartha then invoked into existence the weapon named after Sakra. From\r\nthat weapon flowed thousands of straight shafts. And those shafts struck\r\nSrutayus and Achyutayus, those mighty bowmen. And the arrows shot by the\r\nlatter, pierced by those of Partha, coursed through the welkin. And the\r\nson of Pandu quickly baffling those arrows by the force of his own\r\narrows, began to career over the field, encountering mighty car-warriors.\r\nMeanwhile Srutayus and Achyutayus were, by Arjuna's arrowy showers,\r\ndeprived of their arms and heads. And they fell down on the earth, like a\r\ncouple of tall trees broken by the wind. And the death of Srutayus and\r\nslaughter of Achyutayus created surprise equal to what men would feel at\r\nthe sight of the ocean becoming dry. Then slaying fifty car-warriors\r\namongst the followers of those two princes, Partha proceeded against the\r\nBharata army, slaying many foremost of warriors. Beholding both Srutayus\r\nand Achyutayus slain, their sons, those foremost of men, viz., Niyatayus\r\nand Dirghayus, O Bharata, both filled with rage, rushed against the son\r\nof Kunti, scattering shafts of diverse kinds, and much pained by the\r\ncalamity that had happened to their sires. Arjuna, excited with rage, in\r\na moment despatched them both towards Yama's abode, by means of straight\r\nshafts. And those bulls among Kshatriyas (that were in the Kuru army)\r\nwere unable to resist Partha who agitated the Dhartarashtra ranks, like\r\nan elephant agitating the waters of a lake filled with lotuses. Then\r\nthousands of trained elephant-riders amongst the Angas, O monarch, filled\r\nwith rage, surrounded the son of Pandu with their elephant-force. Urged\r\nby Duryodhana, many kings also of the west and the south, and many others\r\nheaded by the ruler of the Kalingas, also surrounded Arjuna, with their\r\nelephants huge as hills. Partha however, with shafts sped from Gandiva,\r\nquickly cut off the heads and arms, decked with ornaments, of those\r\nadvancing combatants. The field of battle, strewn with those heads and\r\narms decked with Angadas, looked like golden stones entwined by snakes.\r\nAnd the arms of warriors cut off therewith, while failing down, looked\r\nlike birds dropping down from trees. And the elephants, pierced with\r\nthousands of arrows and shedding blood (from their wounds), looked like\r\nhills in the season of rains with liquefied red chalk streaming down\r\ntheir sides. Others, slain by Partha with sharp shafts, lay prostrate on\r\nthe field. And many Mlecchas on the backs of elephants, of diverse kinds\r\nof ugly forms, robed in diverse attires, O king, and armed with diverse\r\nkinds of weapons, and bathed in blood, looked resplendent as they lay on\r\nthe field, deprived of life by means of diverse kinds of arrows. And\r\nthousands of elephants along with their riders and those on foot that\r\nurged them forward, struck with Partha's shafts, vomited blood, or\r\nuttered shrieks of agony, or fell down, or ran ungovernably in all\r\ndirections. And many, exceedingly frightened, trod down and crushed their\r\nown men. And many which were kept as reserves and which were fierce as\r\nsnakes of virulent poison, did the same. And many terrible Yavanas and\r\nParadas and Sakas and Valhikas, and Mlecchas born of the cow (belonging\r\nto Vasishtha), of fierce eyes, accomplished in smiting looking like\r\nmessengers of Death, and all conversant with the deceptive powers of the\r\nAsuras and many Darvabhisaras and Daradas and Pundras numbering by\r\nthousands, of bands, and together forming a force that was countless,\r\nbegan to shower their sharp shafts upon the son of Pandu. Accomplished in\r\nvarious modes of warfare, those Mlecchas covered Arjuna with their\r\narrows. Upon them, Dhananjaya also quickly poured his arrows. And those\r\narrows, shot from Gandiva, looked like flights of locusts, as they\r\ncoursed through the welkin. Indeed. Dhananjaya, having by his arrows\r\ncaused a shade over the troops like that of the clouds, slew, by the\r\nforce of his weapons, all the Mlecchas, with heads completely shaved or\r\nhalf-shaved or covered with matted locks, impure in habits, and of\r\ncrooked faces. Those dwellers of hills, pierced with arrows, those\r\ndenizens of mountain-caves, fled away in fear. And ravens and Kankas and\r\nwolves, with great glee, drank the blood of those elephants and steeds\r\nand their Mleccha-riders overthrown on the field by Partha with his sharp\r\nshafts. Indeed, Arjuna caused a fierce river to flow there whose current\r\nconsisted of blood. (Slain) foot-soldiers and steeds and cars and\r\nelephants constituted its embankments. The showers of shafts poured\r\nconstituted its rafts and the hairs of the combatants formed its moss and\r\nweeds. And the fingers cut off from the arms of warriors, formed its\r\nlittle fishes. And that river was as awful as Death itself at the end of\r\nthe Yuga. And that river of blood flowed towards the region of Yama, and\r\nthe bodies of stain elephants floating on it, obstructed its current. And\r\nthe earth was covered all over with the blood of Kshatriyas and of\r\nelephants and steeds and their riders, and became one bloody expanse like\r\nto what is seen when Indra showers a heavy down-pour covering uplands and\r\nlowlands alike. And that bull among Kshatriyas despatched six thousand\r\nhorsemen and again a thousand foremost of Kshatriyas in that battle into\r\nthe jaws of death. Thousands of well-equipped elephants, pierced with\r\narrows, lay prostrate on the field, like hills struck down by thunder.\r\nAnd Arjuna careered over the field, slaying steeds and car-warriors and\r\nelephants, like an elephant of rent temples crushing a forest a reeds. As\r\na conflagration, urged by the wind, consumes a dense forest of trees and\r\ncreepers and plants and dry wood and grass, even so did that fire, viz.,\r\nPandu's son Dhananjaya, having shafts for its flames and urged on by the\r\nKrishna-wind, angrily consume the forest of thy warriors. Making the\r\nterraces of cars empty, and causing the earth to be strewn, with human\r\nbodies, Dhananjaya seemed to dance bow in hand, in the midst of those\r\nvast masses of men. Deluging the earth with blood by means of his shafts,\r\nendued with the strength of the thunder, Dhananjaya, excited with wrath,\r\npenetrated into the Bharata host. While thus proceeding, Srutayus, the\r\nruler of the Amvashthas, resisted him. Arjuna then, O sire, speedily\r\nfelled with keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers, the steeds of\r\nSrutayus struggling in battle. And cutting off with other shafts, the bow\r\nalso of his antagonist, Partha careered over the field. The ruler of the\r\nAmvashthas, then with eyes troubled in wrath, took up a mace and\r\napproached the mighty car-warrior Partha and Kesava also in that battle.\r\nThen that hero, uplifting his mace, stopped the (progress of Arjuna's)\r\ncar by its strokes, and struck Kesava also therewith. Then that slayer of\r\nhostile heroes, viz., Arjuna, beholding Kesava struck with that mace,\r\nbecame filled with wrath. And, then, O Bharata, that hero, with his\r\nshafts, equipped with wings of gold, covered the ruler of the Amvashthas,\r\nthat foremost or car-warriors, armed with mace, like clouds covering the\r\nrisen sun. With other shafts, Partha then cut off the mace of that\r\nhigh-souled warrior in fragments, reducing it almost to dust. And all\r\nthis seemed highly wonderful. Beholding that mace of his cut off in\r\nfragments, the ruler of the Amvashthas took up another huge mace, and\r\nrepeatedly struck both Arjuna and Kesava therewith. Then, Arjuna with a\r\ncouple of sharp broad-faced arrows, cut off the uplifted arms of Srutayus\r\nwhich held the mace, those arms that looked like a couple of Indra's\r\nstandard, and with another winged arrow, he cut off the head of that\r\nwarrior. Thus slain, Srutayus fell down, O king, filling the earth with a\r\nloud noise, like a tall standard of Indra when the strings, tying it to\r\nthe engine on which it is set, are cut off. Surrounded then on all sides\r\nby rounds of cars and by hundreds upon hundreds of elephants and cars,\r\nPartha became invisible like the sun covered with clouds.'\""

Quickly\r\ncoming on his car to Drona, Duryodhana said: 'That tiger among men (viz.,\r\nArjuna), having crushed this vast host hath already passed through it.\r\nAided by thy judgment, think now what should be done next for the\r\nslaughter of Arjuna in view of awful carnage. Blessed be thou, adopt such\r\nmeasures that that tiger among men may not succeed in slaying Jayadratha.\r\nThou art our sole refuge. Like a raging conflagration consuming heaps of\r\ndry grass and straw, Dhananjaya-fire, urged by the wind of his wrath, is\r\nconsuming the grass and straw constituted by my troops. O scorcher of\r\nfoes, seeing the son of Kunti pass, having pierced through this host,\r\nthose warriors that are protecting Jayadratha have become doubtful (of\r\ntheir ability to resist Partha). O foremost of those acquainted with\r\nBrahma, it was the settled conviction of the kings that Dhananjaya would\r\nnever, with life, succeed in transgressing Drona. O thou of great\r\nsplendour, when, however, Partha has pierced through thy division in the\r\nvery sight, I regard my army to be very weak. Indeed, I think that I have\r\nno troops. O thou that art highly blessed, I know thou art devoted to the\r\nwelfare of the Pandavas. I lose my reason, o regenerate one, in thinking\r\nwhat should be done. To the best of my power, I also seek to gratify\r\nthee. Thou, however, dost not bear all this in mind. O thou of\r\nimmeasurable prowess, although we are devoted to thee, still thou never\r\nseekest our welfare. Thou art always well-pleased with the Pandavas and\r\nalways engaged in doing us evil. Though deriving thy livelihood from us,\r\nstill thou art engaged in doing evil to us. I was not aware that thou art\r\nbut a razor steeped in honey. If thou hadst not granted me the boon about\r\nhumiliating and checking the Pandavas, I would never have prevented the\r\nruler of the Sindhus from returning to his own country. Fool that I am,\r\nexpecting protection from thee, I assured the ruler of the Sindhus, and\r\nthrough my folly offered him as a victim to death. A man may escape,\r\nhaving entered the very jaws of death, but there is no escape for\r\nJayadratha, when once he comes within reach of Dhananjaya's arms. O thou\r\nthat ownest red steeds, do that by which the ruler of the Sindhus may yet\r\nbe saved. Do not give way to wrath on hearing the delirious ravings of my\r\nafflicted self, O, protect ye the ruler of the Sindhus.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'I do not find fault with thy words. Thou art as dear to me\r\nas Aswatthaman himself. I tell thee truly. Act, however, now according to\r\nmy words, O king! Of all drivers of cars, Krishna is the foremost. His\r\nsteeds are also the foremost of their species. Obtaining only a very\r\nsmall space, Dhananjaya can pass very quickly through it. Seest thou not\r\nthat the shafts of the diadem-decked (Arjuna), countless in number, shot\r\nfrom his bow, are falling full two miles behind his car as he is\r\nproceeding? Burdened with the weight of years, I am now incapable of\r\ngoing so fast. The whole army of the Parthas, again, is now close upon\r\nour van. Yudhishthira also should be seized by me. Even so, O thou of\r\nmighty arms, hath been the vow made by me in the Presence of all bowmen\r\nand in the midst of all the Kshatriyas. O king! he is now staying at the\r\nhead of his troops, abandoned by Dhananjaya. I shall not, therefore,\r\nabandoning the gate of our array, fight with Phalguna. It is meet that\r\nthyself, properly supported, shouldst fight With that foe of thine, who\r\nis alone and who is thy equal in lineage and feats. Do not fear. Go and\r\nfight with him. Thou art the ruler of the world. Thou art a king. Thou\r\nart a hero. Possessed of fame, thou art accomplished in vanquishing (thy\r\nfoes). O brave subjugator of hostile towns, go thyself to that spot where\r\nDhananjaya the son of Pritha is.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'O preceptor, how is it possible for me to resist\r\nDhananjaya who has transgressed even thee that art the foremost of all\r\nwielders of arms? The very chief of celestials, armed with the thunder,\r\nis capable of being vanquished in battle, but Arjuna that subjugator of\r\nhostile towns, cannot be vanquished in battle. He by whom Hridika's son\r\n(Kritavarman), the ruler of the Bhojas, and thyself equal unto a\r\ncelestial, have both been vanquished by the power of his weapons, he by\r\nwhom Srutayus hath been slain, as also Sudakshina, and king Srutayus too,\r\nhe by whom both Srutayus and Achyutayus and myriads of Mlecchas also have\r\nbeen slain, how can I contend in battle with that invincible son of\r\nPandu, that accomplished master of weapons, who is even like an\r\nall-consuming fire? How also dost thou think me competent to fight with\r\nhim today? I am dependent on thee like a slave. Protect my fame.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'Thou sayest truly, O thou of Kuru's race, that Dhananjaya\r\nis irresistible. I, however, will do that by which thou shalt be able to\r\nbear him. Let all the bowmen in the world behold today the wonderful feat\r\nof the son of Kunti being held in check by thee in the very sight of\r\nVasudeva. This thy armour of gold, O king, I will tie on thy body in such\r\na way that no weapon used by man will be able to strike thee in battle.\r\nIf even the three worlds with the Asuras and the celestials, the Yakshas,\r\nthe Uragas, and the Rakshasas, together with all human beings, fight with\r\nthee today, thou needst still entertain no fear. Neither Krishna, nor the\r\nson of Kunti, nor any other wielder of weapons in battle, will be able to\r\npierce this armour of thine with arrows. Cased in that coat of mail,\r\nquickly go thou today against angry Arjuna in battle. He will not be able\r\nto bear thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having said these words, Drona, that foremost of persons\r\nconversant with Brahma, touching water, and duly uttering certain\r\nMantras, speedily tied that highly wonderful and bright armour on\r\nDuryodhana's body for the victory of thy son in that dreadful battle and\r\ncausing (by that act) all persons there to be filled with amazement. And\r\nDrona said, 'Let the Vedas, and Brahman, and the Brahmanas, bless thee.\r\nLet all the higher classes of reptiles be a source of blessings to thee,\r\nO Bharata! Let Yayati and Nahusha, and Dhundhumara, and Bhagiratha, and\r\nthe other royal sages, all do what is beneficial to thee. Let blessings\r\nbe to thee from creatures having but one leg, and from those that have\r\nmany legs. Let blessings be to thee, in this great battle from creatures\r\nthat have no legs. Let Swaha, and Swadha, and Sachi, also, all do what is\r\nbeneficial to thee. O sinless one, let Lakshmi and Arundhati too do what\r\nis beneficial to thee. Let Asita, and Devala and Viswamitra, and Angiras,\r\nand Vasishtha, and Kasyapa, O king, do what is beneficial to thee. Let\r\nDhatri, and the lord of the worlds and the points of the compass and the\r\nregents of those points, and the six-faced Karttikeya, all give thee what\r\nis beneficial. Let the divine Vivaswat benefit thee completely. Let the\r\nfour elephants, of the four quarters, the earth, the firmament, the\r\nplanets, and he who is underneath the earth and holds her (on his head),\r\nO king, viz., Sesha, that foremost of snakes, give thee what is for thy\r\nbenefit. O son of Gandhari, formerly the Asura named Vritra, displaying\r\nhis prowess in battle, had defeated the best of celestials in battle. The\r\nlatter, numbering thousands upon thousands, with mangled bodies, those\r\ndenizens of heaven, with Indra at their head, deprived of energy and\r\nmight, all repaired to Brahman and sought his protection, afraid of the\r\ngreat Asura Vritra. And the gods said, 'O best of gods, O foremost of\r\ncelestials, be thou the refuge of the gods now crushed by Vritra. Indeed,\r\nrescue us from this great fear.' Then Brahmana, addressing Vishnu staying\r\nbeside him as also those best of celestials headed by Sakra, said unto\r\nthem that were all cheerless, these words fraught with truth: Indeed, the\r\ngods with Indra at their head, and the Brahmanas also, should ever be\r\nprotected by me. The energy of Tvashtri from which Vritra hath been\r\ncreated is invincible. Having in days of yore performed ascetic penances\r\nfor a million of years, Tvashtri, then, ye gods, created Vritra,\r\nobtaining permission from Maheswara. That mighty foe of yours hath\r\nsucceeded in smiting you through the grace of that god of gods. Without\r\ngoing to the place where Sankara stayeth, ye cannot see the divine Hara.\r\nHaving seen that god, ye will be able to vanquish Vritra. Therefore, go\r\nye without delay to the mountains of Mandara. There stayeth that origin\r\nof ascetic penances, that destroyer of Daksha's sacrifice, that wielder\r\nof Pinaka, that lord of all creatures, that slayer of the Asura called\r\nBhaganetra.' Thus addressed by Brahman, the gods proceeding to Mandara\r\nwith Brahman in their company, beheld there that heap of energy, that\r\nSupreme god endued with the splendour of a million suns. Seeing the gods\r\nMaheswara welcomed them and enquired what he was to do for them. 'The\r\nsight of ray person can never be fruitless. Let the fruition of your\r\ndesires proceed from this.' Thus addressed by him, the dwellers of heaven\r\nreplied, 'We have been deprived of our energy by Vritra. Be thou the\r\nrefuge of the dwellers of heaven. Behold, O lord, our bodies beaten and\r\nbruised by his strokes. We seek thy protection. Be thou our refuge, O\r\nMaheswara!' The god of gods, called Sarva, then said, 'Ye gods, it is\r\nwell-known to you how this action, fraught with great strength, terrible\r\nand incapable of being resisted by persons destitute of ascetic merit,\r\noriginated, springing from the energy of Tvashtri (the divine artificer).\r\nAs regards myself, it is certainly my duty to render aid to the dwellers\r\nof heaven. O Sakra, take this effulgent armour from off my body. And, O\r\nchief of the celestials, put it on, mentally uttering these mantras.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona continued, 'Having said these words, the boon-giving (Siva) gave\r\nthat armour with the mantras (to be uttered by the wearer). Protected by\r\nthat armour, Sakra proceeded against the host of Vritra in battle. And\r\nalthough diverse kinds of weapons were hurled at him in that dreadful\r\nbattle, yet the joints of that armour could not be cut open. Then the\r\nlord of the celestials slew Vritra, and afterwards gave unto Angiras that\r\narmour, whose joints were made up of mantras. And Angiras imparted those\r\nmantras to his son Vrihaspati, having a knowledge of all mantras. And\r\nVrihaspati imparted that knowledge to Agnivesya of great intelligence.\r\nAnd Agnivesya imparted it to me, and it is with the aid of those mantras,\r\nO best of kings, that I, for protecting thy body, tie this armour on thy\r\nbody.'\r\n\r\n`Sanjaya continued, Having said these words Drona, that bull among\r\npreceptors, once more addressed thy son, of great splendour, saying, 'O\r\nking, I put this armour on thy body, joining its pieces with the aid of\r\nBrahma strings. In days of yore, Brahma himself had thus put it on Vishnu\r\nin battle. Even as Brahma himself had put this celestial armour on Sakra\r\nin the battle caused by the abduction of Taraka, I put it on thee.'\r\nHaving thus, with mantras, donned that armour duly on Duryodhana, the\r\nregenerate Drona sent the king to battle. And the mighty-armed king,\r\ncased in armour by the high-souled preceptor, and accomplished in\r\nsmiting, and a thousand infuriated elephants endued with great prowess,\r\nand a hundred thousand horses, and many other mighty car-warriors,\r\nproceeded towards the car of Arjuna. And the mighty-armed king proceeded,\r\nwith the sound of diverse kinds of musical instruments, against his foe,\r\nlike Virochana's son (Vali in days of yore). Then, O Bharata, a loud\r\nuproar arose among thy troops, beholding the Kuru king proceeding like a\r\nfathomless ocean.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'After that bull among men, viz., Duryodhana, had set out\r\nfrom behind, following Partha and him of Vrishni's race, O king, both of\r\nwhom had penetrated into the Kaurava army, the Pandavas accompanied by\r\nthe Somakas, quickly rushed against Drona with loud shouts. And then\r\ncommenced the battle (between them and Drona's troops). And the battle\r\nthat took place between the Kurus and the Pandavas at the gate of the\r\narray, was fierce and awful, making the hair stand on end. The sight\r\nfilled the spectators with wonder. O king, the sun was then in the\r\nmeridian. That encounter, O monarch, was truly such that we had never\r\nseen or heard of its like before. The Parthas headed by Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nall accomplished in smiting and arrayed properly covered the troops of\r\nDrona with showers of arrows. Ourselves also, placing Drona, that\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, at our head, covered the Parthas,\r\ngathered by Prishata's son, with our shafts. The two hosts, adorned with\r\ncars and looking beautiful, then appeared like two mighty masses of\r\nclouds in the summer sky, driven towards each other by opposite winds.\r\nEncountering each other, the two hosts increased their impetuosity, like\r\nthe rivers the Ganga and the Yamuna, swollen with water during the season\r\nof the rains. Having diverse kinds of weapons for the winds that ran\r\nbefore them, teeming with elephants and steeds and cars charged with\r\nlightning, constituted by the maces wielded by the warriors, the fierce\r\nand mighty cloud formed by the Kuru host, urged on by the Drona-tempest,\r\nand pouring incessant shafts that constituted its torrents of rain,\r\nsought to quench the scorching Pandava-fire. Like an awful hurricane in\r\nsummer agitating the ocean, that best of Brahmanas, viz., Drona,\r\nagitating the Pandava host. Exerting themselves with great vigour, the\r\nPandavas rushed towards Drona alone for piercing his host, like a mighty\r\ntorrent of water towards a strong embankment, for sweeping it away. Like\r\nan immovable hill resisting the fiercest current of water, Drona,\r\nhowever, resisted in that battle the enraged Pandavas and Panchalas and\r\nKekayas. Many other kings also, endued with great strength and courage,\r\nattacking them from all sides, began to resist the Pandavas. Then that\r\ntiger among men, viz., the son of Prishata, uniting with the Pandayas,\r\nbegan repeatedly to strike Drona, for piercing the hostile host. Indeed,\r\nas Drona showered his arrows on Prishata's son, even so did the latter\r\nshower his on Drona. Having scimitars and swords for the winds that blew\r\nbefore it, well-equipped with darts and lances and sabres, with the\r\nbow-string constituting its lightning, and the (twang of the) bow for its\r\nroars, the Dhrishtadyumna-cloud poured on all sides torrents of weapons,\r\nas its showers of stones. Slaying the foremost of car-warriors and a\r\nlarge number of steeds, the son of Prishata seemed to deluge the hostile\r\ndivisions (with his arrowy downpours). And the son of Prishata, by his\r\narrows, turned Drona away from all those tracks amid the car-divisions of\r\nthe Pandavas, through which that hero attempted to pass, striking the\r\nwarriors there with his shafts. And although Drona struggled vigorously\r\nin that battle, yet his host, encountering Dhrishtadyumna, became divided\r\ninto three columns. One of these retreated towards Kritavarman, the chief\r\nof the Bhojas; another towards Jalasandha; and fiercely slaughtered the\r\nwhile by the Pandavas, proceeded towards Drona himself. Drona, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, repeatedly united his troops. The mighty\r\nwarrior Dhrishtadyumna as often smote and separated them. Indeed, the\r\nDhartarashtra force, divided into three bodies, was slaughtered by the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas fiercely, like a herd of cattle in the woods\r\nby many beasts of prey, when unprotected by herdsmen. And people thought\r\nthat in that dreadful battle, it was Death himself who was swallowing the\r\nwarriors first stupefied by Dhrishtadyumna. As a kingdom of a bad king is\r\ndestroyed by famine and pestilence and robbers, even so was thy host\r\nafflicted by the Pandavas. And in consequence of the rays of the sun\r\nfailing upon the weapons and the warriors, and of the dust raised by the\r\nsoldiers, the eyes of all were painfully afflicted. Upon the Kaurava host\r\nbeing divided into three bodies during that dreadful carnage by the\r\nPandavas, Drona, filled with wrath, began to consume the Panchalas with\r\nhis shafts. And while engaged in crushing those divisions and\r\nexterminating them with his shafts, the form of Drona became like that of\r\nthe blazing Yuga-fire. That mighty car-warrior pierced cars, elephants,\r\nand steeds, and foot-soldiers, in that battle, each with only a single\r\narrow, (and never employing more than one in any case). There then was no\r\nwarrior in the Pandava army who was capable of bearing, O lord, the\r\narrows shot from the bow of Drona. Scorched by the rays of the sun and\r\nblasted by the shafts of Drona, the Pandava divisions there began to reel\r\nabout on the field. And thy host also, similarly slaughtered by\r\nPrishata's son, seemed to blaze up at every point like a dry forest on\r\nfire. And while both Drona and Dhrishtadyumna were slaughtering the two\r\nhosts, the warriors of both armies, in utter disregard of their lives,\r\nfought everywhere to the utmost extent of their prowess. Neither in thy\r\nhost, nor in that of the enemy, O bull of Bharata's race, was there a\r\nsingle warrior who fled away from the battle through fear. Those uterine\r\nbrothers, viz., Vivingsati and Chitrasena and the mighty car-warrior\r\nVikarna, surrounded Kunti's son Bhimasena on all sides. And Vinda and\r\nAnuvinda of Avanti, and Kshemadhurti of great prowess supported thy three\r\nsons (who contended against Bhimasena). King Valhika of great energy and\r\nnoble parentage, with his own troops and counsellors, resisted the sons\r\nof Draupadi. Saivya, the chief of the Govasanas, with a thousand foremost\r\nwarriors, faced the son, of great prowess, of the king of the Kasis and\r\nresisted him. King Salya, the ruler of the Madras, surrounded royal\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Kunti, who resembled a blazing fire. The brave\r\nand wrathful Duhsasana, properly supported by his own divisions, angrily\r\nproceeded, in that battle, against Satyaki, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors. I myself, with my own troops, cased in mail and equipped\r\nwith weapons, and supported by four hundred foremost of bowmen, resisted\r\nChekitana.[138] Sakuni with seven hundred Gandhara warriors armed with\r\nbows, darts and swords, resisted the son of Madri (viz., Sahadeva). Vinda\r\nand Anuvinda of Avanti, those two great bowmen, who had, for the sake of\r\ntheir friend (Duryodhana), uplifted their weapons, disregarding their\r\nlives, encountered Virata, the king of the Matsyas. King Valhika,\r\nexerting himself vigorously, resisted the mighty and unvanquished\r\nSikhandin, the son of Yajnasena, that hero capable of resisting all foes.\r\nThe chief of Avanti, with the Sauviras and the cruel Prabhadrakas,\r\nresisted wrathful Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas. Alamvusha\r\nquickly rushed against the brave Rakshasa Ghatotkacha. of cruel deeds,\r\nwho was wrathfully advancing to battle. The mighty car-warrior\r\nKuntibhoja, accompanied by a large force, resisted Alamvusha, that prince\r\nof Rakshasas, of fierce mien. Thus, O Bharata, hundreds of separate\r\nencounters between the warriors of thy army and theirs, took place.\r\n\r\n\"As regards the ruler of the Sindhus, he remained in the rear of the\r\nwhole army protected by many foremost of bowmen and car-warriors\r\nnumbering Kripa amongst them. And the ruler of the Sindhus had for the\r\nprotectors of his wheels two of the foremost warriors, viz., the son of\r\nDrona on his right, O king, and the Suta's son (Karna) on the left. And\r\nfor protecting his rear he had a number of warriors headed by Somadatta's\r\nson, viz., Kripa, and Vrishasena, and Sala, and the invincible Salya, who\r\nwere conversant with policy and were mighty bowmen accomplished in\r\nbattle. And the Kuru warriors, having made these arrangements for the\r\nprotection of the ruler of the Sindhus, fought (with the Pandavas).'\""

And\r\nDrona also, accompanied by his forces, desirous of protecting his own\r\narray, battled with the Parthas, seeking glory. Vinda and Anuvinda of\r\nAvanti, excited with wrath and desirous of benefiting thy son, struck\r\nVirata with ten shafts. Virata also, O king, approaching those two\r\nwarriors of great prowess staying in battle, fought with them and their\r\nfollowers. The battle that took place between these was fierce in the\r\nextreme, and blood ran in it like water. And it resembled an encounter in\r\nthe woods between a lion and a couple of mighty elephants, with rent\r\ntemples. The mighty son of Yajnasena forcibly struck king Valhika in that\r\nbattle with fierce and sharp shafts capable of penetrating into the very\r\nvitals. Valhika also filled with wrath, deeply pierced Yajnasena's son\r\nwith nine straight shafts of golden wings and whetted on stone. And that\r\nbattle between those two warriors became exceedingly fierce,\r\ncharacterised as it was by dense showers of shafts and darts. And it\r\nenhanced the fears of the timid and the joy of heroes. The arrows shot by\r\nthem entirely covered the welkin and all the points of the compass, so\r\nthat nothing could any longer be discerned. And Saivya, the king of the\r\nGovasanas on the head of the troops, fought in that battle with the\r\nmighty car-warrior, the prince of the Kasis, like an elephant battling\r\nwith another. The king of the Valhikas, excited with wrath, fighting,\r\nagainst those (five) mighty car-warriors, viz., the son of Draupadi,\r\nlooked resplendent, like the mind contending against the five senses. And\r\nthose five princes also, O foremost of embodied beings, fought with that\r\nantagonist of theirs, shooting their arrows from all sides, like the\r\nobjects of the senses for ever battling with the body. Thy son Duhsasana,\r\nstruck Satyaki of Vrishni's race with nine straight shafts of keen\r\npoints. Deeply pierced by that strong and great bowman, Satyaki of\r\nprowess incapable of being baffled, was partially deprived of his senses.\r\nComforted soon, he, of Vrishni's race, then quickly pierced thy son, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, with ten shafts winged with Kanka feathers. Piercing\r\neach other deeply and afflicted with each other's shafts, they looked\r\nsplendid, O king, like two Kinsukas decked with flowers. Afflicted with\r\nthe arrows of Kuntibhoja, Alamvusha, filled with wrath looked like a\r\nbeautiful Kinsuka graced with its flowering burthen. The Rakshasa then\r\nhaving pierced Kuntibhoja with many arrows, uttered awful shouts at the\r\nhead of thy host. And as those heroes fought with each other in that\r\nbattle, they seemed to all the troops to resemble Sakra and the Asura\r\nJambha in days of old. The two sons of Madri, filled with wrath, fiercely\r\nground with their shafts the Gandhara prince Sakuni who had offended\r\nagainst them greatly. The carnage, O monarch, that set in was awful.\r\nOriginated by thee, nurtured by Karna, and kept up by thy sons, the fire\r\nof wrath (of the Pandavas) hath swollen now, O monarch, and is ready to\r\nconsume the whole earth. Forced to turn his back on the field by the two\r\nsons of Pandu with their shafts, Sakuni unable to put forth his valour,\r\nknew not what to do. Beholding him turn back, those mighty car-warriors,\r\nviz., the two sons of Pandu, once more showered their arrows on him like\r\ntwo masses of clouds pouring torrents of rain on a mighty hill. Struck\r\nwith countless straight shafts, the son of Suvala fled towards the\r\ndivision of Drona, borne by his swift steeds. The brave Ghatotkacha\r\nrushed towards the Rakshasa Alamvusha in that battle, with impetuosity\r\nmuch short of what he was capable. The battle between those two became\r\nfearful to behold, like that which in days of yore had taken place\r\nbetween Rama and Ravana. King Yudhishthira, having in that battle pierced\r\nthe ruler of the Madras with five hundred arrows, once more pierced him\r\nwith seven. Then commenced that battle between them which was exceedingly\r\nwonderful, O monarch, which resembled that, in days of yore, between the\r\nAsura Samvara and the chief of the celestials. The sons Vivinsati and\r\nChitrasena and Vikarna, surrounded by a large force, battled with\r\nBhimasena.'\""

Bhimasena rushed against the mighty-armed\r\nJalasandha, and Yudhishthira, at the head of his troops rushed, in that\r\nbattle, against Kritavarman. And Dhrishtadyumna, O king, scattering the\r\nshafts, like the sun shooting his rays, rushed against Drona. Then\r\ncommenced that battle between all the bowmen, eager for the encounter, of\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas, excited with wrath. And during the progress\r\nof that terrible carnage, when all the warriors were battling with one\r\nanother fearlessly the mighty Drona fought with the mighty prince of the\r\nPanchalas. And the clouds of arrows he shot in that encounter filled all\r\nspectators with wonder. And Drona and the prince of the Panchalas,\r\ncutting off the heads of men by thousands, scattered them on the field of\r\nbattle, making the latter resemble a forest of lotuses. In every\r\ndivision, were soon strewn on the ground robes and ornaments and weapons,\r\nand standards and coats of mail. And golden coats of mail, dyed with\r\nblood, looked like clouds charged with lightning. Other mighty\r\ncar-warriors, drawing their large bows measuring full six cubits long,\r\nfelled with their shafts, elephants and steeds and men. In that dreadful\r\nencounter of arms between brave and high-souled warriors, swords and\r\nshields, bows and heads and coats of mail were seen lying scattered\r\nabout. Innumerable headless trunks wore seen to rise up, O king, in the\r\nmidst of that fierce battle. And vultures and Kankas and jackals and\r\nswarms of other carnivorous animals, O sire, were seen there, eating the\r\nflesh of fallen men and steeds and elephants, of drinking their blood, or\r\ndragging them by the hair, or licking or pecking, O king, at their\r\nmarrow, or dragging their bodies and severed limbs, or rolling their\r\nheads on the ground. Warriors, skilled in battle, accomplished in\r\nweapons, and firmly resolved in fight, struggled vigorously in the\r\ncombat, solicitous only of fame. Many were the combatants that careered\r\nover the field, performing the diverse evolutions, of swordsmen. With\r\nsabres and darts and lances and spears and axes, with maces and spiked\r\nclubs and other kinds of weapons, and with even bare arms, men who had\r\nentered the arena of battle, filled with rage, slew one another. And\r\ncar-warriors fought with car-warriors, and horsemen with horsemen, and\r\nelephants with foremost of elephants, and foot-soldiers with\r\nfoot-soldiers. And many infuriated elephants, as if perfectly mad,\r\nuttered loud shrieks and slew one another, after the manner they do in\r\nsporting arenas.\r\n\r\n\"During the progress, O king, of that battle in which the combatants\r\nfought without any regard for one another, Dhrishtadyumna caused his own\r\nsteeds to be mixed up with those of Drona. Those steeds endued with the\r\nspeed of the wind, that were white as pigeons and red as blood, thus\r\nmixed with one another in battle, looked exceedingly beautiful. Indeed,\r\nthey looked resplendent like clouds charged with lightning. Then that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, viz., heroic Dhrishtadyumna, the son of\r\nPrishata, beholding Drona, O Bharata, arrived so near, cast off his bow\r\nand took up his sword and shield, for achieving a difficult feat. Seizing\r\nthe shaft of Drona's car, he entered into it. And he stayed sometimes on\r\nthe middle of the yoke, and sometimes on its joints and sometimes behind\r\nthe steeds. And while he was moving, armed with swords, quickly upon the\r\nbacks of those red steeds of Drona, the latter could not detect an\r\nopportunity for striking him.[139] All this seemed wonderful to us.\r\nIndeed, like the sweep of a hawk in the woods from desire of food, seemed\r\nthat sally of Dhrishtadyumna from his own car for the destruction of\r\nDrona. Then Drona cut off, with a hundred arrows, the shield, decked with\r\na hundred moons, of Drupada's son, and then his sword, with ten others.\r\nAnd mighty Drona then, with four and sixty arrows, slew the steeds of his\r\nantagonist. And with a couple of broad-headed shafts he cut off the\r\nlatter's standard and umbrella also, and then slew both his Parshni\r\ncharioteers. And then with great speed drawing his bow-string to his ear,\r\nhe shot at him a fatal shaft, like the wielder of the thunder hurling the\r\nthunder (at a foe). But soon Satyaki, with four and ten sharp shafts, cut\r\noff that fatal arrow of Drona. And thus the Vrishni hero, O sire, rescued\r\nDhrishtadyumna, who had been seized by that lion among men, the foremost\r\nof preceptors, like a deer seized by the king of the forests. Even thus\r\ndid that bull amongst the Sinis, the prince of the Panchalas. Beholding\r\nSatyaki to rescue the prince of the Panchalas in the dreadful battle,\r\nDrona quickly shot at him six and twenty arrows. The grandson of Sini\r\nthen, in return, pierced Drona in the centre of the chest with six and\r\ntwenty arrows, while the latter was engaged in devouring the Srinjayas.\r\nThen all the Panchala car-warriors, desirous of victory upon the Satwata\r\nhero, proceeding against Drona, quickly withdrew Dhrishtadyumna from the\r\nbattle.'\""

Then that subjugator of\r\nhostile cities, that hero of Sini's race invincible in battle, beholding\r\nthat irresistible Drona cloud having showers of arrows for its watery\r\ndownpour, the rattle of car-wheels for its roar, the out-stretched bow\r\nfor its volume, long shafts for its lightning-flashes, darts and swords\r\nfor its thunder, wrath for the winds and urged on by those steeds that\r\nconstituted the hurricane (impelling it forwards), rushed towards him,\r\naddressed his charioteer and smilingly said, O Suta, proceed quickly and\r\ncheerfully, urging the steeds to their greatest speed, against that\r\nheroic Brahmana, fallen off from the duties of his order, that refuge of\r\nDhritarashtra's son, that dispeller of the (Kuru) king's sorrows and\r\nfear, that preceptor of all the princes, that warrior ever boastful of\r\nhis prowess.' Then the excellent steeds of silvery hue belonging to him\r\nof Madhu's race, endued with the speed of the wind, quickly proceeded\r\ntowards Drona. Then those two chastisers of foes, viz., Drona and Sini's\r\ngrandson, fought with each other, each striking the other with thousands\r\nof shafts. Those two bulls among men filled the welkin with their arrowy\r\nshowers. Indeed, the two heroes covered the ten points of the compass\r\nwith their shafts. And they poured on each other their shafts like two\r\nclouds pouring their contents (on the earth) on the expiration of summer.\r\nThe sun became invisible. The very wind ceased to blow. And in\r\nconsequence of those showers of shafts filling the welkin, a continuous\r\nand thick gloom was caused there that became unbearable to the other\r\nheroes. And when the shafts of Drona and Sini's grandson had caused that\r\ngloom there, none beheld any cessation in shooting in either of them.\r\nThey were both quick in the use of weapons, and they were both looked\r\nupon as lions among men. The sound produced by those torrents of arrows,\r\nshot by both striking against each other was heard to resemble the sound\r\nof the thunder hurled by Sakra. The forms of heroic warriors pierced with\r\nlong shafts looked like those of snakes, O Bharata, hit by snakes of\r\nvirulent poison. Brave warriors incessantly heard the twangs of their\r\nbows and the sounds of their palms to resemble the sound of thunder\r\nfalling upon summits of mountains. The cars of both of those warriors, O\r\nking, their steeds, and their charioteers pierced with shafts of golden\r\nwings, became beautiful to behold. Fierce was the downpour, O monarch, of\r\nshafts that were bright and straight and that looked resplendent like\r\nsnakes of virulent poison freed from their sloughs. The umbrellas of both\r\nwere cut off, as also the standards of both. And both of them were\r\ncovered with blood, and both were inspired with the hope of victory. With\r\nblood trickling down every limb of theirs, they resembled a couple of\r\nelephants with secretions trickling down their bodies. And they continued\r\nto strike each other with fatal shafts. The roars and shouts and other\r\ncries of the soldiers, the blare of conchs and the beat of drums ceased,\r\nO king, for none uttered any sound. Indeed, all the divisions became\r\nsilent, and all the warriors stopped fighting. People, filled with\r\ncuriosity became spectators of that single combat. Car-warriors and\r\nelephant riders and horsemen and foot-soldiers, surrounding those two\r\nbulls among men, witnessed their encounter with steadfast eyes. And the\r\nelephant-divisions stood still and so also the horse-divisions, and so\r\nalso the car-divisions. All stood still, disposed in array. Variegated\r\nwith pearls and corals, decked with gems and gold, adorned with standards\r\nand ornaments, with coats of mail made of gold, with triumphal banners\r\nwith rich caparisons of elephants, with fine blankets, with bright and\r\nsharp weapons, with yak-tails, ornamented with gold and silver, on the\r\nheads of steeds, with garlands, round the frontal globes of elephants and\r\nrings round their tusks, O Bharata, the Kuru and the Pandava hosts then\r\nlooked like a mass of clouds at the close of summer, decked with rows of\r\ncranes and myriads of fire-flies (under them) and adorned with rainbows\r\nand flashes of lightning. Both our men and those of Yudhishthira, beheld\r\nthat battle between Yuyudhana and high-souled Drona; the gods also,\r\nheaded by Brahma and Soma, and the Siddhas, and the Charanas, and the\r\nVidyadharas, and the great Snakes, saw it, stationed on their foremost of\r\nsky-ranging cars. And beholding the diverse motion, forward and backward,\r\nof those lions among men, and their acts of striking each other, the\r\nspectators were filled with wonder. And both endued with great strength,\r\nDrona and Satyaki, displaying their lightness of hand in the use of\r\nweapons, began to pierce each other with shafts. Then he of Dasarha's\r\nrace, with his mighty shafts, cut off those of the illustrious Drona in\r\nthat battle, and then, within a moment, the latter's bow also. Within,\r\nhowever, the twinkling of an eye, the son of Bharadwaja took up another\r\nbow and strung it. Even that bow of his was cut off by Satyaki. Drona\r\nthen, with utmost quickness waited with another bow in hand. As often,\r\nhowever, as Drona strung his bow, Satyaki cut it off. And this he did\r\nfull nine and seven times. Beholding then that superhuman feat of\r\nYuyudhana in battle, Drona, O monarch, thought in his mind, 'This force\r\nof weapons that I see in this foremost one among the Satwatas exists in\r\nRama and Dhananjaya and was seen also in Kartavirya and that tiger among\r\nmen, viz., Bhishma. The son of Bharadwaja, therefore, mentally applauded\r\nthe prowess of Satyaki. Beholding that lightness of hand equal unto that\r\nof Vasava himself, that foremost of regenerate ones, that first of all\r\npersons conversant with weapons, was highly gratified with Madhava. And\r\nthe gods also, with Vasava at their head, were gratified with it. The\r\ngods and the Gandharvas, O monarch, had never before witnessed that\r\nlightness of hand of the quickly moving Yuyudhana, although they and the\r\nSiddhas and the Charanas had been acquainted with the feats of which\r\nDrona was capable. Then Drona, that foremost of persons acquainted with\r\nweapons, that grinder of Kshatriyas, taking up another bow, aimed some\r\nweapons. Satyaki, however, baffling those weapons with the illusion of\r\nhis own weapon struck him with some sharp shafts. All this seemed highly\r\nwonderful. Beholding that superhuman feat of his in battle, that feat of\r\nwhich nobody else was capable, and which displayed very great skill,\r\nthose amongst thy warriors that were judges of skill, applauded it.\r\nSatyaki shot the same weapons that Drona shot. Beholding this, that\r\nscorcher of foes, viz., the preceptor, fought with a little less\r\nboldness, than usual. Then that master of military science, O king,\r\nfilled with wrath, invoked celestial weapons for the destruction of\r\nYuyudhana. Beholding that terrible foe-slaughtering Agneya weapon,\r\nSatyaki, that mighty bowman, invoked another celestial weapon, viz., the\r\nVaruna. Seeing them both take up celestial weapons, loud cries of Oh and\r\nAlas arose there. The very creatures having the sky for their element\r\nceased to range through it. Then the Varuna and the Agneya weapons which\r\nhad thus been grafted on their shafts coming against each other became\r\nfruitless.[140] Just at that time, the sun passed down in his course.\r\nThen king Yudhishthira and Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, and Nakula, and\r\nSahadeva, desirous of protecting Satyaki, and the Matsyas, and the\r\nSalweya troops, speedily proceeded towards Drona. Then thousands of\r\nprinces placing Duhsasana at their head, hastily proceeded towards Drona\r\n(for protecting him) who was surrounded by foes. Then, O king, commenced\r\na fierce battle between them and thy bowmen. The earth was covered with\r\ndust and with showers of arrows shot (by both sides). And everything\r\nbeing thus covered, nothing could any longer be discerned. Indeed, when\r\nthe troops were thus overwhelmed with dust, the battle proceeded in utter\r\ndisregard (of persons and rules).'\""

As regards the\r\nsoldiers, some rested, some fought on, some returned to the encounter,\r\ndesirous of victory. And while the troops, inspired with hope of victory,\r\nwere thus engaged, Arjuna and Vasudeva proceeded towards the place where\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus was. The son of Kunti, by means of his shafts,\r\nmade (through the hostile soldiers) a way sufficiently wide for his car.\r\nAnd it was in this way that Janardana proceeded, (guiding the car).\r\nThither where the car of the high-souled son of Pandu proceeded, thither\r\nthy troops, O monarch, broke and yielded a way. And he of Dasarha's race,\r\nendued with great energy, displayed his skill in driving car by showing\r\ndiverse kinds of circling motions. And the shafts of Arjuna, engraved\r\nwith his name, well-tempered, resembling the Yuga-fire, tied round with\r\ncatgut, of straight joints, thick, far-reaching, and mace either of\r\n(cleft) bamboo (or their branches) or wholly of iron, taking the lives of\r\ndiverse foes, drank in that battle, with the birds (of prey assembled\r\nthere), the blood of living creatures. Standing on his car, as Arjuna\r\nshot his shafts full two miles ahead, those shafts pierced and despatched\r\nhis foes just as that car itself came up to the spot.[141] Hrishikesa\r\nproceeded, borne by those yoke-bearing steeds endued with the speed of\r\nGaruda or the wind, with such speed that he caused the whole universe to\r\nwonder at it. Indeed, O king, the car of Surya himself, or that of Rudra\r\nor that of Vaisravana, never goeth so fast. Nobody else's car had ever\r\nbefore moved with such speed in battle as Arjuna's car, moving with the\r\ncelerity of a wish cherished in the mind. Then Kesava, O king, that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, having taken the car of battle quickly urged\r\nthe steeds, O Bharata, through the (hostile) troops. Arrived in the midst\r\nof that throng of cars, those excellent steeds bore Arjuna's car with\r\ndifficulty, suffering as they did from hunger, thirst, and toil, and\r\nmangled as they had been with the weapons of many heroes delighting in\r\nbattle. They frequently, however, described beautiful circles as they\r\nmoved, proceeding over the bodies of slain steeds and men, over broken\r\ncars, and the bodies of dead elephants, looking like hills by thousands.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile O king, the two heroic brothers of Avanti, (viz., Vinda and\r\nAnuvinda), at the head of their forces, beholding the steeds of Arjuna to\r\nbe tired, encountered him. Filled with joy, they pierced Arjuna with four\r\nand sixty shafts, and Janardana with seventy, and the four steeds (of\r\nArjuna's car) with a hundred arrows. Then Arjuna, O king, filled with\r\nwrath, and having a knowledge of the vital parts of the body, struck them\r\nboth in the battle, with nine straight shafts, every one of which was\r\ncapable of penetrating into the very vitals. Thereupon, the two brothers,\r\nfilled with rage, covered Vibhatsu and Kesava with showers of shafts and\r\nuttered leonine roars. Then Partha of white steeds, with a couple of\r\nbroad-headed shafts, quickly cut off in that battle the beautiful bows of\r\nthe two brothers and then their two standards, bright as gold. Vinda and\r\nAnuvinda then, O king, taking up to other bows and becoming infuriated\r\nwith anger, began to grind the son of Pandu with their arrows. Then\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Pandu, exceedingly enraged, once more, with a\r\ncouple of shafts quickly cut off those two bows also of his foes. And\r\nwith a few other arrows whetted on stone and equipped with wings of gold,\r\nArjuna then slew their steeds, their charioteers, and the two combatants\r\nthat protected their rear, with those that followed the latter. And with\r\nanother broad-headed arrow, sharp as a razor, he cut off the head of the\r\neldest brother, who fell down on the earth, deprived of life, like a tree\r\nbroken by the wind. The mighty Anuvinda then endued with great prowess,\r\nbeholding Vinda slain left his steedless car, having taken up a mace.\r\nThen that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the brother of Vinda,\r\napparently dancing as he advanced with that mace in his arms, proceeded\r\nin that battle for avenging the slaughter of his elder brother. Filled\r\nwith rage, Anuvinda struck Vasudeva on the forehead with that mace. The\r\nlatter, however, trembled not, but stood still like the mountain Mainaka.\r\nThen Arjuna with six arrows, cut off his neck and two legs and two arms\r\nand head. Thus cut off (into fragments, the limbs of) Anuvinda fell down\r\nlike so many hills. Beholding them both stain, their followers, O king,\r\nfilled with rage rushed (towards Arjuna), scattering hundreds of arrows.\r\nSlaying them soon, O bull of Bharata's race, Arjuna looked resplendent\r\nlike a fire consuming a forest on the expiry of winter. Passing over\r\nthose troops with some difficulty, Dhananjaya then shone brightly like\r\nthe risen sun, transgressing the clouds under which it was hid. Beholding\r\nhim, the Kauravas were filled with fright. But recovering soon enough,\r\nthey rejoiced once more and rushed at him from all sides. O bull of\r\nBharata's race! Understanding that he was tired and that the ruler of the\r\nSindhus was yet at a distance, they surrounded him, uttering leonine\r\nroars. Beholding them, tilled with wrath, Arjuna, that bull among men,\r\nsmilingly, addressed him of Dasarha's race in soft words, and said, 'Our\r\nsteeds are afflicted with arrows and tired. The ruler of the Sindhus is\r\nstill at a distance. What do you think to be the best that should be done\r\nnow? Tell me, O Krishna, truly. Thou art always the wisest of persons.\r\nThe Pandavas having thee for their eyes, will vanquish their foes in\r\nbattle. That which seems to me should be done next, truly shall I say\r\nunto thee. Unyoking the steeds to their case, pluck off their arrows, O\r\nMadhava!' Thus addressed by Partha, Kesava replied unto him, 'I am, also\r\nO Partha, of the opinion which thou hast expressed.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna then said, 'I will hold in check the whole army, O Kesava! Do\r\nthou properly perform that which should be done next.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Alighting then from the terrace of his car,\r\nDhananjaya, taking up his bow, Gandiva, fearlessly stood there like an\r\nimmovable hill. Beholding Dhananjaya standing on the ground, and\r\nregarding it a good opportunity, the Kshatriyas, desirous of victory and\r\nuttering loud shouts, rushed towards him. Him standing along, they\r\nsurrounded with a large throng of cars, all stretching their bows and\r\nshowering their shafts on him. Filled with wrath, they displayed diverse\r\nkinds of weapons and entirely shrouded Partha with their shafts like the\r\nclouds shrouding the sun. And the great Kshatriya warriors impetuously\r\nrushed against that bull among Kshatriyas, that lion among men, like\r\ninfuriated elephants rushing towards a lion. The might then that we\r\nbeheld, of Partha's arms was exceedingly great, since, filled with rage,\r\nalone, he succeeded in resisting those countless warriors. The puissant\r\nPartha, baffling with his own weapons those of the foes, quickly covered\r\nall of them with countless shafts. In that part of the welkin, O monarch,\r\nin consequence of the clash Of those dense showers of shafts, a fire was\r\ngenerated emitting incessant sparks. There, in consequence of hostile\r\nheroes, countless in number, all filled with wrath, and all great bowmen\r\nunited together for a common Purpose, seeking victory in battle, aided by\r\nsteeds, covered with blood and breathing hard, and by infuriated and\r\nfoe-grinding elephants, uttering loud shrieks, the atmosphere became\r\nexceedingly hot. That uncrossable, wide, and limitless ocean of cars,\r\nincapable of being agitated, had arrows for its current, standards for\r\nits eddies, elephants for its crocodiles, foot-soldiers for its countless\r\nfishes, the blare of conchs and the beat of drums for its roar, cars for\r\nits surging waves, head-gears of combatants for its tortoises, umbrellas\r\nand banners for its froth, and the bodies of slain elephants for its\r\n(submarine) rocks: Partha resisted with his arrows, the approach of the\r\nsea like a continent. Then, in course of that battle, the mighty-armed\r\nJanardana, fearlessly addressing that dear friend of his, that foremost\r\nof men, viz., Arjuna, said unto him. 'There is no well here in the field\r\nof battle, O Arjuna, for the steeds to drink from. The steeds want water\r\nfor drink, but not for a bath.' Thus addressed by Vasudeva, Arjuna\r\ncheerfully said, 'Here it is!' And so saying, he pierced the earth with a\r\nweapon and made an excellent lake from which the steeds could drink. And\r\nthat lake abounded in swans and ducks, and was adorned with Chakravakas.\r\nAnd it was wide and full of transparent water, and abounded in full-blown\r\nlotuses of the finest species. And it teemed with diverse kinds of fish.\r\nAnd fathomless in depth, it was the resort of many a Rishi. And the\r\ncelestial Rishi, Narada, came to have a look at that lake created there\r\nin a moment. And Partha, capable of achieving wonderful works like (the\r\ncelestial artificer) Tvashtri himself, also constructed there an arrowy\r\nhall, having arrows for its beams and rafters, arrows for its pillars,\r\nand arrows for its roof. Then Govinda smiling in joy, said, 'Excellent,\r\nExcellent,' upon seeing the high-souled Partha create that arrowy hall.'\""

Although throngs upon throngs of cars, and myriads of\r\nelephants and steeds, rushed towards him, yet Partha felt no fear but\r\nfought on, prevailing upon all his foes. And the (hostile) kings shot\r\nshowers of shafts at the son of Pandu. That slayer of hostile heroes,\r\nhowever, viz., the son of Vasava, of virtuous soul, felt no anxiety\r\nwhatever. Indeed, the valiant Partha received hundreds of arrowy showers\r\nand maces and lances coming towards him as the ocean receives hundreds\r\nupon hundreds of rivers flowing towards it. With the impetuous might of\r\nhis own weapons and strength of his arms, Partha received the foremost of\r\nshafts shot at him by those foremost of kings. Although staying on the\r\nground, and alone, he succeeded yet in baffling all those kings on their\r\ncars, like that one fault, avarice, destroying a host of accomplishments.\r\nThe Kauravas, O king, applauded the highly wonderful prowess of Partha as\r\nalso of Vasudeva, saying, 'What more wonderful incident hath ever taken\r\nplace in this world, or will ever take place than this, viz., that Partha\r\nand Govinda, in course of battle, have unyoked their steeds? Displaying\r\nfierce energy on the field of battle and the greatest assurance, those\r\nbest of men have inspired us with great thoughts.' Then Hrishikesa, of\r\neyes like lotus-petals, smiling with the coolest assurance, as if, O\r\nBharata, he was in the midst of an assembly of women (and not armed\r\nfoes), after Arjuna had created in the field of battle that hall, made of\r\narrows, led the steeds into it, in the very sight. O monarch, of all thy\r\ntroops. And Krishna, who was well-skilled in grooming horses, then\r\nremoved their fatigue, pain, froth, trembling and wounds.[142] Then\r\nplucking out their arrows and rubbing those steeds with his own hands,\r\nand making them trot duly, he caused them to drink. Having caused them to\r\ndrink, and removed their fatigue and pain, he once more carefully yoked\r\nthem to that foremost of cars. Then, that foremost one among all wielders\r\nof weapons, viz., Sauri, of great energy, mounting on that car with\r\nArjuna, proceeded with great speed. Beholding the car of that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors once more equipped with these steeds, whose thirst had been\r\nslaked, the foremost ones among the Kuru army once more became cheerless.\r\nThey began to sigh, O king, like snakes whose fangs had been pulled out.\r\nAnd they said, 'Oh, fie, fie on us! Both Partha and Krishna have gone, in\r\nthe very sight of all the Kshatriyas, riding on the same car, and clad in\r\nmail, and slaughtering our troops with as much ease as boys sporting with\r\na toy. Indeed, those scorchers of foes have gone away in the very sight\r\nof all the kings displaying the prowess and unimpeded by our shouting and\r\nstruggling combatants.' Seeing them gone away, other warriors said, 'Ye\r\nKauravas, speed ye for the slaughter of Krishna and the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna). Yoking his steeds unto his car in the very sight of all (our)\r\nbowmen, he of Dasarha's race is proceeding towards Jayadratha,\r\nslaughtering us in battle.' And some lords of earth there, O king,\r\namongst themselves, having seen that highly wonderful incident in battle\r\nnever seen before said, 'Alas, through Duryodhana's fault, these warriors\r\nof king Dhritarashtra, the Kshatriyas, and the whole earth, fallen into\r\ngreat distress, are being destroyed. King Duryodhana understands it not.'\r\nThus spoke many Kshatriyas. Others, O Bharata, said, 'The ruler of the\r\nSindhus hath already been despatched to Yama's abode. Of narrow sight and\r\nunacquainted with means, let Duryodhana now do what should be done for\r\nthat king.[143] Meanwhile, the son of Pandu, seeing the sun coursing\r\ntowards the Western hills, proceeded with greater speed towards the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, on his steeds, whose thirst had been slaked. The (Kuru)\r\nwarriors were unable to resist that mighty-armed hero, that foremost of\r\nall wielders of weapons, as he proceeded like the Destroyer himself in\r\nwrath. That scorcher of foes, viz., the son of Pandu, routing the\r\nwarriors (before him), agitated that army, like a lion agitating a herd\r\nof deer, as he proceeded for getting at Jayadratha. Penetrating into the\r\nhostile army, he, of Dasarha's race, urged the steeds with great speeds,\r\nand blew his conch, Panchajanya, which was of the hue of the clouds. The\r\nshafts shot before by the son of Kunti began to fall behind him, so\r\nswiftly did those steeds, endued with the speed of the wind, drew that\r\ncar. Then many kings, filled with rage, and many other Kshatriyas\r\nsurrounded Dhananjaya who was desirous of slaying Jayadratha. When the\r\n(Kuru) warriors thus proceeded towards that bull, among men (viz.,\r\nArjuna) who had stopped for a moment, Duryodhana, proceeding quickly,\r\nfollowed Partha in that great battle. Many warriors, beholding the car\r\nwhose rattle resembled the roar of clouds, and which was equipped with\r\nthat terrible standard bearing the ape and whose banner floated upon the\r\nwind, became exceedingly cheerless. Then when the sun was almost\r\ncompletely shrouded by the dust (raised by the combatants), the (Kuru)\r\nwarriors, afflicted with shafts, became incapable of even gazing, in that\r\nbattle, at the two Krishnas.'\""

I beholding Vasudeva and Dhananjaya penetrate\r\ninto their host, having already pierced through many divisions, the kings\r\nof the army, fled away in fear. A little while after, however, those\r\nhigh-souled ones, filled with rage and shame, and urged on by their\r\nmight, became cool and collected, and proceeded towards Dhananjaya. But\r\nthose, O king, who filled with rage and vindictiveness, proceeded against\r\nthe son of Pandu in battle, returned not, like rivers never returning\r\nfrom the ocean. Seeing this, many ignoble Kshatriyas incurred sin and\r\nhell by flying away from battle, like atheists turning away from the\r\nVedas.[144] Transgressing that throng of cars those two bulls among men,\r\nat last, issued out of it, and looked like the sun and the moon freed\r\nfrom the jaws of Rahu. Indeed, the two Krishnas, their fatigue dispelled,\r\nhaving pierced through that vast host, looked like two fishes that had\r\npassed through a strong net. Having forced through that impenetrable\r\ndivision of Drona, the way through which was obstructed by dense showers\r\nof weapons, those two high-souled heroes looked like Yuga-suns risen (on\r\nthe welkin). Piercing through those dense showers of weapons and freed\r\nfrom that imminent danger, those high-souled heroes, themselves\r\nobstructing the welkin with thick clouds of weapons, seemed like persons\r\nescaped from a raging conflagration, or like two fishes from the jaws of\r\na makara. And they agitated the (Kuru) host like a couple of makaras\r\nagitating the ocean. Thy warriors and thy sons, while Partha and Krishna\r\nwere in the midst of Drona's division, had thought that those two would\r\nnever be able to issue out of it. Beholding, however, those two heroes of\r\ngreat splendour issue out of Drona's division, they no longer, O monarch,\r\nhoped for Jayadratha's life. Hitherto they had strong hopes of\r\nJayadratha's life, for they had thought, O king, that the two Krishnas\r\nwould never be able to escape from Drona and Hridika's son. Frustrating\r\nthat hope, those two scorchers of foes had, O monarch, crossed the\r\ndivision of Drona, as also the almost uncrossable division of the Bhojas.\r\nBeholding them, therefore, ford through those divisions and look like two\r\nblazing fires, thy men became possessed with despair and no longer hoped\r\nfor Jayadratha's life. Then those two fearless heroes, viz., Krishna and\r\nDhananjaya, those enhancers of the fears of foes, began to converse\r\nbetween themselves about the slaughter of Jayadratha. And Arjuna said,\r\n'This Jayadratha hath been placed in their midst by six of the foremost\r\ncar-warriors among the Dhartarashtras. The ruler of the Sindhus, however,\r\nshall not escape me if once he is seen by me. If Sakra himself, with all\r\nthe celestials, become his protector in battle, yet shall we slay him.\r\nThus did the two Krishnas talk. Even so, O mighty-armed one, did they\r\nconverse amongst themselves, while looking after the ruler of the\r\nSindhus. (Having heard what they said), thy sons set up a loud wail.\r\nThose two chastisers of foes then looked like a couple of thirsty\r\nelephants of great quickness of motion, refreshed by drinking water,\r\nafter having passed through a desert. Beyond death and above decrepitude,\r\nthey then looked like two merchants that have passed over a mountainous\r\ncountry abounding with tigers and lions and elephants. Indeed, beholding\r\nthem freed (from Drona and Kritavarman), thy warriors regarded the colour\r\nof Partha's and Krishna's face to be dreadful; and thy men then, from all\r\nsides, set up a loud wail. Freed from Drona who resembled a snake of\r\nvirulent poison or a blazing fire, as also from the other lords of the\r\nearth, Partha and Krishna looked like two blazing suns. Indeed, those two\r\nchastisers of foes, freed from Drona's division, which resembled the very\r\nocean, seemed to be filled with joy like persons that have safely crossed\r\nthe vasty deep. Freed from those dense showers of weapons, from those\r\ndivisions protected by Drona and Hridika's son, Kesava and Arjuna looked\r\nlike Indra and Agni, or blazing effulgence. The two Krishnas, pierced\r\nwith sharp shafts of Bharadwaja's son, and with bodies dripping with\r\nbloods, looked resplendent like two mountains decked with flowering\r\nKarnikaras. Having forded that wide lake, of which Drona constituted the\r\nalligator, darts formed the fierce snakes, shafts, the Makaras, and\r\nKshatriyas, the deep waters, and having issued out of that cloud,\r\nconstituted by Drona's weapons, whose thunders were the twang of bows and\r\nthe sound of palms, and whose lightning flashes were constituted by maces\r\nand swords, Partha and Krishna looked like the sun and moon freed from\r\ndarkness. Having crossed the region obstructed by the weapons of Drona,\r\nall creatures regarded those mighty and famous bowmen viz., the two\r\nKrishnas, as persons who had forded, with the aid of their arms, the five\r\nrivers, (viz., the Satadru, the Vipasa, the Ravi, the Chandrabhaga, and\r\nthe Vitasta) having the ocean for their sixth, when full of water during\r\nthe season of rains, and abounding with alligators. Casting their eyes,\r\nfrom desire of slaughter, on Jayadratha who was not far off from them,\r\nthe two heroes looked like two tigers waiting from desire of falling upon\r\na Ruru deer. Such was then the colour of their faces, that thy warriors,\r\nO monarch, regarded Jayadratha as one already slain. Possessed of red\r\neyes, O mighty-armed one, and staying together, Krishna and the son of\r\nPandu, at the sight of Jayadratha were filled with joy and roared\r\nrepeatedly. Indeed, O monarch, the splendour then of Sauri, standing with\r\nreins in hand, and of Partha armed with bow, was like that of the sun or\r\nfire. Freed from the division of Drona, their joy, at sight of the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, was like that of a couple of hawks at the sight of a\r\npiece of flesh. Beholding the ruler of the Sindhus not far off, they\r\nrushed in wrath towards him like a couple of hawks swooping down towards\r\na piece of meat. Seeing Hrishikesa and Dhananjaya transgress (the\r\ndivisions of Drona), thy valiant son, king Duryodhana, whose armour had\r\nbeen bound on his person by Drona, and who was well-versed in grooming\r\nand guiding horses, rushed, on a single car, O lord, for the protection\r\nof the Sindhus. Leaving those mighty bowmen, viz., Krishna and Partha,\r\nbehind, thy son, O king, turned back, facing Kesava of lotus-like eyes.\r\nWhen thy son thus outran Dhananjaya, diverse musical instruments were\r\njoyfully blown and beat among all thy troops. And leonine roars were\r\nuttered mingled with the blare of conchs, beholding Duryodhana staying in\r\nthe face of the two Krishnas. They also, O king, resembling blazing\r\nfires, that stood as the protectors of Jayadratha, were filled with joy\r\nupon beholding thy son in battle. Seeing Duryodhana transgress them with\r\nhis followers, Krishna, O monarch, said unto Arjuna these words suited to\r\nthe occasion.'\""

His arrows are far-reaching. He is a great\r\nbowman. Accomplished as he is in weapons, it is exceedingly difficult to\r\nvanquish him in battle. The mighty son of Dhritarashtra strikes hard, and\r\nis conversant with all modes of warfare. Brought up in great luxury, he\r\nis much regarded by even the foremost of car-warriors. He is\r\nwell-accomplished, and, O Partha, he always hates the Pandavas. For these\r\nreasons, O sinless one, I think, thou shouldst now fight with him. Upon\r\nhim resteth, as upon a stake at dice, victory or the reverse. Upon him, O\r\nPartha, vomit that poison of thy wrath which thou hast cherished so long.\r\nThis mighty car-warrior is the root of all the wrongs on the Pandavas. He\r\nis now within reach of thy shafts. Look after thy success. Why hath king\r\nDuryodhana, desirous as he is of kingdom, come to battle with thee? By\r\ngood luck, it is that he is now arrived within reach of thy arrows. Do\r\nthat, O Dhananjaya, by which he may be deprived on his very life. Reft of\r\nhis senses through pride of affluence, he hath never felt any distress. O\r\nbull among men, he doth not know also thy prowess in battle. Indeed, the\r\nthree worlds with the celestials, the Asuras, and human beings, cannot\r\nventure to vanquish thee in battle. What need be said, therefore, of\r\nsingle Duryodhana? By good luck it is, O Partha, that he hath approached\r\nthe vicinity of thy car. O mighty-armed one, slay him as Purandara slew\r\nVritra. O sinless one, this Duryodhana hath endeavoured to bring evil on\r\nyou. By deceit he cheated king Yudhishthira at dice. O giver of honours,\r\nsinless though you all are, this prince of sinful soul has always done\r\nvarious evil acts towards him. Nobly resolved upon battle, O Partha, slay\r\nwithout any scruple this wicked wight, who is ever wrathful and ever\r\ncruel, and who is the very embodiment of avarice. Remembering the\r\ndeprivation of your kingdom by deceit, your exile into the woods, and the\r\nwrongs of Krishna, put forth thy prowess, O son of Pandu! By good luck,\r\nit is that he stayeth within the range of the shafts. By good luck, it is\r\nthat staying before thee he endeavours to resist thy purpose. By good\r\nluck, it is that he knows today that he will have to fight with thee in\r\nthe battle. By good luck, it is that all your purposes, even those that\r\nare not presently entertained by you, will be crowned with fruition.\r\nTherefore, Partha, slay this wretch of his race, viz., the son of\r\nDhritarashtra, in battle, as Indra had in days of yore, slain the Asura\r\nJambha in the battle between the celestials and the Asuras. If he is\r\nslain by thee, thou canst then pierce through this masterless host. Cut\r\nthe very root of these wicked-souled wretches. Let the avabhritha[145] of\r\nthis hostility be now accomplished.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, Partha replied unto Kesava\r\nsaying--'So be it. Even this should be done by me. Disregarding\r\neverything else, proceed thither where Duryodhana is. Putting forth my\r\nprowess in battle, I will cut off the head of that wretch who hath for\r\nsuch a long period enjoyed our kingdom without a thorn on his side. Shall\r\nI not succeed, O Kesava, in avenging myself of the insult, in the shape\r\nof dragging her by the hair, offered unto Draupadi, undeserving as she\r\nwas of that wrong.' Thus conversing with each other, the two Krishnas\r\nfilled with joy, urged those excellent white steeds of theirs, desirous\r\nof getting at king Duryodhana. As regards thy son, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, having approached the presence of Partha and Krishna, he\r\nentertained no fear, although, O sire, every circumstance was calculated\r\nto inspire fear. And the Kshatriyas there, on thy side, highly applauded\r\nhim then, for he proceeded to face Arjuna and Hrishikesa for resisting\r\nthem. Indeed, beholding the king in battle, a loud shout was heard there,\r\nO monarch, uttered by the entire Kuru army. What that terrible and awful\r\nshout arose there, thy son, pressing his foe hard, opposed his progress.\r\nHeld in check by thy son armed with bow, the son of Kunti became filled\r\nwith rage, and that chastiser of foes, Duryodhana, also became highly\r\nenraged with Partha. Beholding both Duryodhana and Dhananjaya enraged\r\nwith each other, all the Kshatriyas, of fierce forms, began to look at\r\nthem from all sides. Seeing Partha and Vasudeva both filled with rage,\r\nthy son, O sire, desirous of battle, smilingly challenged them, then he\r\nof Dasarha's race became filled with joy, and Dhananjaya also, the son of\r\nPandu, became cheerful. Uttering loud roars, they both blew their\r\nforemost of conchs. Seeing them thus cheerful, all the Kauravas became\r\nhopeless of thy son's life. Indeed, all the Kauravas, and many even\r\namongst the enemy, became possessed with grief, and regarded thy son as a\r\nlibation already poured into the mouth of the (sacred) fire. Thy\r\nwarriors, seeing Krishna and the Pandava so cheerful I loudly exclaimed,\r\nafflicted with fear, 'The king is slain.' 'The king is slain.' Hearing\r\nthat loud uproar of the warriors, Duryodhana said, 'Let your fears be\r\ndispelled. I will despatch the two Krishnas unto the region of death.'\r\nHaving told all his warriors these words, king Duryodhana. then,\r\nexpectant of success, addressed Partha angrily and said these words: 'If,\r\nO Partha, thou art begotten by Pandu apply upon me, without loss of time,\r\nall the weapons, celestial and earthly, that Kesava also hath of either,\r\nupon me. I wish to see thy manliness. They speak of many feats achieved\r\nby thee out of our view. Show me those feats that have won the applause\r\nof many endued with great heroism!'\""

And with four others he pierced the four steeds of his foe.\r\nAnd he pierced Vasudeva in the centre of the chest with ten shafts, and\r\ncutting off, with a broad-headed arrow, the whip in the latter's hands,\r\nhe felled it on the ground. Then Partha, coolly and without losing a\r\nmoment, shot at him four and ten shafts whetted on stone and equipped\r\nwith beautiful feathers. All those shafts, however, were repelled by\r\nDuryodhana's armour. Beholding their fruitlessness, Partha once more sped\r\nat him nine and five arrows of keen points. But these too were repelled\r\nby Duryodhana's armour. Seeing eight and twenty arrows of his become\r\nabortive, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., Krishna said unto Arjuna,\r\nthese words: 'I see a sight never before witnessed by me, like the\r\nmovements of the hills. Shafts sped by thee, O Partha, are becoming\r\nabortive. O bull of Bharata's race, hath thy Gandiva decayed in power?\r\nHave the might of thy grasp and the power of thy arms become less than\r\nwhat they were. Is not this to be thy last meeting with Duryodhana? Tell\r\nme, O Partha, for I ask thee. Great hath been my amazement, O Partha,\r\nupon seeing all these shafts of thine fall towards Duryodhana's car,\r\nwithout producing the slightest effect. Alas, what misfortune is this\r\nthat these terrible shafts of thine that are endued with the might of the\r\nthunder and that always pierce the bodies of foes, fail in producing any\r\neffect.'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'I think, O Krishna, that this armour hath been put on\r\nDuryodhana's body by Drona. This armour, tied as it hath been, is\r\nimpenetrable to my weapons. In this armour, O Krishna, inhereth the might\r\nof the three worlds. Only Drona knoweth it, and from that best of men I\r\nalso have learnt. This armour is not capable of being pierced by my\r\nweapons. Maghavat himself, O Govinda, cannot pierce it with his thunder.\r\nKnowing it all, O Krishna, why seekest thou to confound me? That which\r\noccurred in the three worlds, that which, O Kesava, exists now, and which\r\nis in the womb of futurity, are all known to thee. Indeed, O slayer of\r\nMadhu, no one else knoweth this better than thou dost. This Duryodhana, O\r\nKrishna, cased by Drona in this armours, is staying fearlessly in battle,\r\nwearing this coat of mail. That however, which one wearing such armour\r\nshould do, is not known to him, O Madhava! He weareth it only like a\r\nwoman. Behold now, O Janardana, the might of my arms and that of my bow\r\ntoo. Though protected by such a coat of mail, I will still vanquish the\r\nKuru prince. The chief of the celestials gave this effulgent armour to\r\nAngiras. From the latter it was obtained by Vrihaspati. And from\r\nVrihaspati it was got by Purandara. The Lord of the celestials once more\r\ngave it to me with the mantras to be uttered in wearing it. Even if this\r\narmour were divine, if it were created by Brahma himself, still the\r\nwretch, Duryodhana, struck with my arrows, shall not be protected by it.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, Arjuna inspired some arrows\r\nwith mantras, and began to draw them on the bow-string. And while he was\r\nthus drawing them on the bow-string, the son of Drona cut them off with a\r\nweapon that was capable of baffling every weapon. Beholding those shafts\r\nof his thus frustrated from a distance by that utterer of Brahma\r\n(Aswatthaman), Arjuna, owning white steeds, filled with amazement\r\nrepresented unto Kesava, saying, 'I cannot, Janardana, twice use this\r\nweapon, for if do so, it will slay my own self and my own troops.\r\nMeanwhile, Duryodhana, O king, pierced each of the Krishnas in that\r\nbattle with nine shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison. And once\r\nmore the Kuru king showered his shafts on Krishna and the son of Pandu.\r\nBeholding these showers of arrows (shot by their king), thy warriors were\r\nfilled with joy. They beat their musical instrument and uttered leonine\r\nroar. Then Partha, excited with rage in that battle, licked the corners\r\nof his mouth. Casting his eyes on his enemy's body, he saw not any part\r\nthat was not well-covered with that impenetrable armour. With some\r\nsharp-pointed shafts then, well-shot from his bow, and each of which\r\nresembled Death himself, Arjuna slew his antagonist's steeds and then his\r\ntwo Parshni charioteers. And soon also the valiant Partha cut off\r\nDuryodhana's bow and the leathern fence of his fingers. Then, Savyasachin\r\ncommenced to cut off his enemy's car in fragments. And with a couple of\r\nkeen arrows he made Duryodhana carless. And then Arjuna pierced both the\r\npalms of the Kuru king. Beholding that great bowman afflicted with the\r\nshafts of Dhananjaya and fallen into great distress, many warriors rushed\r\nto the spot, desirous of rescuing him. These, with many thousands of\r\ncars, well-equipped elephants and horses, as also with large bodies of\r\nfoot-soldiers, excited with wrath, encompassed by large bodies of men,\r\nneither that car of theirs nor of Arjuna and Govinda could any longer be\r\nseen. Then Arjuna, by the might of his weapons, began to slaughter that\r\nhost. And car-warriors and elephants, by hundreds, deprived of limbs,\r\nfell fast on the field. Slain, or in the act of being slain, those failed\r\nto reach the excellent car. Indeed, the car on which Arjuna rode, stood\r\nmotionless full two miles from the besieging force on every side. Then\r\nthe Vrishni hero (Krishna), without taking any time, said unto Arjuna\r\nthese words: Draw thy bow quickly and with great force, for I will blow\r\nmy conch.' Thus addressed, Arjuna drawing his bow Gandiva with great\r\nforce, began to slaughter the foe, shooting dense showers of shafts and\r\nmaking a loud noise by stretching the bowstring with his fingers. Kesava\r\nmeanwhile forcibly and very loudly blew his conch Panchajanya, his face\r\ncovered with dust. In consequence of the blare of that conch and of the\r\ntwang of Gandiva, the Kuru warriors, strong or weak, all fell down on the\r\nground. The car of Arjuna then freed from that press, looked resplendent\r\nlike a cloud driven by the wind. (Beholding Arjuna) the protectors of\r\nJayadratha, with their followers, became filled with rage. Indeed, those\r\nmighty bowmen, the protectors of the ruler of Sindhus, suddenly beholding\r\nPartha, uttered loud shouts, filling the earth with that noise. The whiz\r\nof their arrows were mingled with other fierce noises and the loud blare\r\nof their conchs. Those high-souled warriors uttered leonine shouts.\r\nHearing that awful uproar raised by thy troops, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya\r\nblew their conchs. With their loud blare (of their conchs), the whole\r\nearth, with her mountains and seas and islands and the nether regions, O\r\nmonarch, seemed to be filled. Indeed, that blare, O best of Bharatas,\r\nfilled all the points of the compass, and was echoed back by both the\r\narmies. Then thy car-warriors, beholding Krishna and Dhananjaya, became\r\nvery much frightened. Soon, however, they recovered and put forth their\r\nactivity. Indeed, the great car-warriors of thy host, beholding the two\r\nKrishnas, those highly blessed persons, cased in mail rushed towards. The\r\nsight thus presented became a wonderful one.'\""

Their cars drawn by foremost steeds\r\nof great fleetness were of diverse countries and of diverse species, some\r\nbred in mountainous regions, some in rivers, and some in the country of\r\nthe Sindhus, many foremost of car-warriors among the Kurus desirous, O\r\nking, of rescuing thy son quickly rushed towards Dhananjaya's car from\r\nevery side. Those foremost of men, taking up their conchs blew them,\r\nfilling O king, the welkin and the earth with her seas (with that blare).\r\nThen those foremost ones among the gods, viz., Vasudeva and Dhananjaya,\r\nalso blew their foremost of conchs on earth. The son of Kunti blew\r\nDevadatta, and Kesava blew Panchajanya. The loud blast of Devadatta, sent\r\nforth by Dhananjaya, filled the earth, the welkin, and ten points of the\r\ncompass. And so Panchajanya also blown by Vasudeva, surpassing all\r\nsounds, filled the sky and the earth. And while that awful and fierce\r\nnoise continued, a noise that inspired the timid with fear and the brave\r\nwith cheers, and while drums and Jharjharas, and cymbals and Mridangas, O\r\ngreat king, were beat by thousands, great car-warriors invited to the\r\nKuru side and solicitous of Dhananjaya's welfare, those great bowmen,\r\nfilled with rage and unable to bear the loud blast of Arjuna's and\r\nKrishna's conchs, those kings from diverse realms supported by their\r\nrespective troops, in rage blew their great conchs, desiring to answer\r\nwith their own blasts the blasts of Kesava and Arjuna. The Kuru army\r\nthen, urged forward by that blare of conchs, had its car-warriors,\r\nelephants, and steeds filled with anxiety and fear. Indeed, O lord, that\r\nhost looked as if they that comprised it were ill. The agitated Kuru\r\nhost, echoing with that blare of conchs blown by brave warriors, seemed\r\nto be like the welkin resounding with the noise of thunder and fallen\r\ndown (through some convulsion of nature).[146] That loud uproar, O\r\nmonarch, resounded through the ten points and frightened that host like\r\ncritical incidents at the end of the Yuga frightening all living\r\ncreatures. Then, Duryodhana and those eight great car-warriors appointed\r\nfor the protection of Jayadratha all surrounded the son of Pandu. The son\r\nof Drona struck Vasudeva with three and seventy shafts, and Arjuna\r\nhimself with three broad-headed shafts, and his standard and (four)\r\nsteeds with five others. Beholding Janardana pierced, Arjuna, filled with\r\nrage, struck Aswatthaman with hundred shafts. Then piercing Karna with\r\nten arrows and Vrishasena with three, the valiant Dhananjaya cut off\r\nSalya's bow with arrows fixed on the string, at the handle. Salya then,\r\ntaking up another bow, pierced the son of Pandu. And Bhurisravas pierced\r\nhim with three arrows whetted on stone, and equipped with golden wings.\r\nAnd Karna pierced him with two and thirty arrows, and Vrishasena with\r\nseven. And Jayadratha pierced Arjuna with three and seventy shafts and\r\nKripa pierced him with ten. And the ruler of the Madras also pierced\r\nPhalguna in that battle with ten arrows. And the son of Drona pierced him\r\nwith sixty arrows. And he, once more, pierced Partha with five arrows,\r\nand Vasudeva with twenty. Then the tiger among men, viz., Arjuna owning\r\nwhite steeds and having Krishna for his driver, pierced each of those\r\nwarriors in return, displaying the lightness of his hand. Piercing Karna\r\nwith a dozen shafts and Vrishasena with three, Partha cut off Salya's bow\r\nat the handle. And piercing the son of Somadatta with three arrows and\r\nSalya with ten, he pierced Kripa with five and twenty arrows, and the\r\nruler of the Sindhus with a hundred, Partha struck Drona's son with\r\nseventy arrows. Then Bhurisravas filled with rage, cut off the goad in\r\nKrishna's hand, and struck Arjuna with three and twenty shafts. Then\r\nDhananjaya, of white steeds, filled with rage, mangled those enemies of\r\nhis with hundreds upon hundreds of arrows, like a mighty tempest tearing\r\nmasses of clouds.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra, said, 'Describe to me, O Sanjaya, the diverse kinds of\r\nstandards resplendent with great beauty, of both the Partha and our\r\nwarriors (in that battle).'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, of the diverse kinds of standards of those\r\nhigh-souled warriors. Listen to me as I describe their forms and names.\r\nIndeed, O king, upon the cars of those foremost of car-warriors were seen\r\ndiverse kinds of standards that shone like blazing flames of fire. Made\r\nof gold, or decked with gold, or adorned with strings of gold and each\r\nlooking like the golden mountain (Meru), diverse kinds of standards were\r\nthere that were highly beautiful. And those standards of the warriors had\r\nattached all around them excellent banners. Indeed, having banners of\r\ndiverse hues attached to them all around, those standards looked\r\nexceedingly beautiful. Those banners, again, moved by the wind, looked\r\nlike fair ladies dancing in the midst of a sporting arena. Endued with\r\nthe splendour of the rainbow, those banners, O bull of Bharata's race, of\r\nthose car-warriors, floating in the breeze, highly adorned their cars.\r\nThe standard, bearing the sign of the ape of fierce face and tail, like\r\nthat of the lion, belonging to Dhananjaya, seemed to inspire fear in that\r\nbattle. That standard, O king of the wielder of Gandiva, bearing that\r\nforemost of apes, and adorned with many banners, frightened the Kuru\r\nhost. Similarly, the lion-tail standard-top of Drona's son, O Bharata, we\r\nsaw, was endued with the effulgence of the rising sun Decked with gold,\r\nfloating in the breeze, possessed of the splendour of the rainbow, the\r\nstandard mark of Drona's son appeared on high, inspiring the foremost of\r\nKuru warriors with joy. The standard of Adhiratha's son bore the mark of\r\nan elephant-rope made of gold. It seemed, O king, in battle to fill the\r\nwhole welkin. The banner, adorned with gold and garlands, attached to the\r\nstandard of Karna in battle, shaken by the wind, seemed to dance upon his\r\ncar. The preceptor of the Pandavas, that Brahmana, given to ascetic\r\npenances, viz., Kripa the son of Gotama, had for his mark an excellent\r\nbovine bull. That high-souled one, O king, with that bovine bull, looked\r\nas resplendent, as the Destroyer of the three cities[147] looks\r\nresplendent with his bull. Vrishasena has a peacock made of gold and\r\nadorned with jewels and gems. And it stood on his standard, as if in the\r\nact of crowing, and always adorned the wan of the army. With that\r\npeacock, the car of the high-souled Vrishasena shone, like the car, O\r\nking, of Skanda (the celestial generalissimo) shining 'with his peacock\r\nunrivalled and beautiful ploughshare made of gold and looking like flame\r\nof fire. That ploughshare, O sire, looked resplendent on his car. Salya,\r\nthe ruler of the Madras, we saw, had on his standard-top an image like\r\nthe presiding goddess of corn, endued with beauty and producing every\r\nseed. A silver boar adorned the standard-top of the ruler of the Sindhus.\r\nDecked with golden chains, it was of the splendour of a white\r\ncrystal.[148] With that silver mark on his barrier, the ruler of the\r\nSindhus looked as resplendent, as Surya in days of yore in the battle\r\nbetween the celestials and the Asuras. The standard of Somadatta's son,\r\ndevoted to sacrifices, bore the sign of the sacrificial stake. It was\r\nseen to shine like the sun or the moon. That sacrificial stake made of\r\ngold, O king of Somadatta's son, looked resplendent like the tall stake\r\nerected in the foremost of sacrifices called the Rajasuya. The standard\r\nof Salya, O monarch, bearing a huge silver-elephant was adorned, on all\r\nsides, with peacocks made of gold. The standard, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, adorned thy troops like the huge white elephant adorning the host\r\nof the celestial king. On the standard decked with gold, of king\r\nDuryodhana, was an elephant adorned with gems. Tinkling with the sound of\r\na hundred bells, O king, that standard stood upon the excellent car of\r\nthat hero. And, O king, thy son, that bull among the Kurus, looked\r\nresplendent, O monarch, with that tall standard in battle. These nine\r\nexcellent standards stood erect among thy divisions. The tenth standard\r\nseen there was of Arjuna, decked with that huge ape. And with that\r\nstandard Arjuna looked highly resplendent, like Himavat with a blazing\r\nfire (on its top). Then many mighty car-warriors, all chastisers of foes,\r\nquickly took up their beautiful, bright and large bows for the sake of\r\n(resisting) Arjuna. Similarly, Partha also, that achiever of celestial\r\nfeats, took up his foe-destroying bow Gandiva, in consequence, O king, of\r\nthy evil policy. Many royal warriors, O king, were then slain in that\r\nbattle owing to thy fault. Rulers of men came from different realms\r\ninvited (by thy sons). And with them perished many steeds and many\r\nelephants. Then those mighty car-warriors headed by Duryodhana (on one\r\nside) and that bull amongst the Pandavas on the other, uttered loud roars\r\nand began the encounter. And the feat that Kunti's son, having Krishna\r\nfor his charioteer, achieved there, was highly wonderful, inasmuch as,\r\nalone, he encountered fearlessly all those warriors united together. And\r\nthat mighty-armed hero looked resplendent as he stretched his bow\r\nGandiva, desirous of vanquishing all those tigers among men for slaying\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus. With his shafts shot in thousands, that tiger\r\namong men, viz., Arjuna, that scorcher of foes, made all those warriors\r\ninvisible (by means of his arrowy showers). On their side, those tigers\r\namong men, those mighty car-warriors, also made Partha invisible by means\r\nof their clouds of shafts shot from all sides. Beholding Arjuna, that\r\nbull of Kuru's race covered by those lions among men with their shafts,\r\nloud was the uproar made by thy troops.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION CV\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Arjuna had got the ruler of the Sindhus\r\nwithin sight, what, O Sanjaya, did the Panchalas, attacked by\r\nBharadwaja's son, do, encountering the Kurus?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, In the afternoon of that day, O monarch, in the battle\r\nthat took place between the Panchalas and the Kurus, Drona became, as it\r\nwere, the stake (for which each fought on to win or lose). The Panchalas,\r\nO sire, desirous of slaying Drona, cheerfully uttered loud roars and shot\r\ndense showers of arrows. Indeed, that encounter between the Panchalas and\r\nthe Kurus, fierce, awful, and highly wonderful as it was, resembled that\r\nin days of yore between the gods and the Asuras. Indeed, all the\r\nPanchalas with the Pandavas, obtaining Drona's car (within reach) used\r\nmany mighty weapons, desirous of piercing through his array. Car-warriors\r\nstationed on their cars, causing the earth to shake under them, and\r\nshowering their arrowy downpours, rushed towards Drona's car, without\r\nmuch speed. Then that mighty car-warrior among the Kaikeyas, viz.,\r\nVrihatkshatra, incessantly scattering keen shafts that resembled the\r\nthunder in force, proceeded towards Drona. Then Kshemadhurti of great\r\nfame quickly rushed against Vrihatkshatra, shooting keen arrows by\r\nthousands. Beholding this, that bull among the Chedis, viz.,\r\nDhrishtaketu, endued with great might, quickly proceeded against\r\nKshemadhurti, like Mahendra proceeding against the Asura Samvara. Seeing\r\nhim rush with great impetuosity, like the Destroyer himself with\r\nwide-open mouth, that mighty bowman viz., Viradhanwan, proceeded against\r\nhim with great speed. King Yudhishthira staying there at the head of his\r\ndivision from desire of victory, was resisted by valiant Drona himself.\r\nThy son Vikarna, O lord, endued with great prowess, proceeded against the\r\nrushing Nakula of great prowess, that warrior accomplished in battle.\r\nThat scorcher of foes, viz., Durmukha, covered the advancing Sahadeva\r\nwith many thousands of swiftly-coursing shafts. The heroic Vyughradatta\r\nresisted that tiger among men, viz., Satyaki making him repeatedly\r\ntremble by means of his sharp and keen-pointed shafts. The son of\r\nSomadatta resisted the (five) sons of Draupadi, those tigers among men,\r\nthose great car-warriors, wrathfully shooting mighty shafts. That mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Rishyasringa's fierce son (the Rakshasa Alamvusha), of\r\nawful mien, resisted the advancing Bhimasena filled with wrath. The\r\nencounter that then took place between that man and Rakshasa resembled, O\r\nking, the battle in days of yore between Rama, and Ravana. Then, O\r\nBharata, Yudhishthira, that chief of the Bharatas, struck Drona with\r\nninety straight shafts in all his vital parts. Enraged by the famous son\r\nof Kunti, Drona struck him in return, O chief of the Bharatas, in the\r\ncentre of the chest with five and twenty shafts. And once more, in the\r\nvery sight of all the bowmen, Drona struck him, with his steeds,\r\ncharioteer, and standard, with twenty shafts. Pandu's son, of virtuous\r\nsoul, displaying great lightness of hand, baffled with his own arrowy\r\nshowers those arrows shot by Drona, Then that great bowman Drona, filled\r\nwith rage, cut off the bow of the high souled king Yudhishthira the just.\r\nThen that great car-warrior (viz., the son of Bharadwaja) speedily\r\ncovered the bowless Yudhishthira with many thousands of shafts. Beholding\r\nthe king made invisible by the shafts of Bharadwaja's son, all thought\r\nthat Yudhishthira was dead, and some thought that the king had fled\r\nbefore Drona. And many cried out, O king, saying, 'Alas the king hath\r\nbeen slain by the high-souled Brahmana.' Then, king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, fallen into great distress, having laid aside that bow cut off by\r\nBharadwaja's son in battle took up another excellent, bright and tougher\r\nbow. And that hero then cut off in that encounter all those shafts shot\r\nin thousands by Drona. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Having cut\r\noff those shafts, O king, Yudhishthira, with eyes red in wrath, took up\r\nin that battle a dart, capable of riving even a mountain. Equipped with a\r\ngolden staff, of awful mien, having eight bells attached to it, and\r\nexceedingly terrible, the mighty Yudhishthira, taking it up, uttered a\r\nloud roar. And with that roar, O Bharata, the son of Pandu inspired all\r\ncreatures with fear. Beholding that dart upraised by king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, all creatures, as if with one accord, said, 'Good be to Drona!'\r\nHurled from the king's arms, that dart resembling a snake just freed from\r\nits slough, coursed towards Drona, illumining the welkin and all the\r\ndirections cardinal and subsidiary, like a she-snake with fiery mouth,\r\nBeholding it coursing towards him impetuously, O king, Drona, that\r\nforemost of all persons acquainted with weapons invoked into existence\r\nthe weapon called Brahma. That weapon, reducing that dart of terrible\r\nmien into dust, coursed towards the car of the illustrious son of Pandu.\r\nThen, O sire, king Yudhishthira of' great wisdom baffled that weapon of\r\nDrona, thus coursing towards him by himself invoking the Brahma weapon.\r\nAnd then piercing Drona himself in that battle with five straight shafts,\r\nhe cut off, with a sharp razor-faced shaft, the large bow of Drona. Then\r\nDrona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, throwing aside that broken bow, hurled\r\nwith great force, O sire, a mace at the son of Dharma. Beholding that\r\nmace impetuously coursing towards him, Yudhishthira, O chastiser of foes,\r\nfilled with rage, took up a mace. Then those two maces, both hurled with\r\ngreat force, encountering each other in mid-air, produced by their\r\ncollision sparks of fire and then fell down on the earth. Then Drona,\r\nfilled with fury, slew, O sire, the steeds of Yudhishthira, with four\r\nexcellent shafts of keen points. And with another broad-headed shaft he\r\ncut off he king's bow resembling a pole erected to the honour of Indra.\r\nAnd with another shaft he cut off the standard of Yudhishthira, and with\r\nthree he afflicted the Pandava himself. Then king Yudhishthira, speedily\r\njumping down from that steedless car, stood weaponless and with arms\r\nupraised, O bull of Bharata's race! Beholding him carless, and especially\r\nweaponless, Drona, O lord, stupefied his foes, rather the whole army.\r\nFirmly adhering to his vow, and endued with great lightness of hands,\r\nDrona shot showers of sharp shafts and rushed towards the king, like a\r\nfurious lion towards a deer. Beholding Drona, that slayer of foes, rush\r\ntowards him, cries of Oh and Alas suddenly rose from the Pandava army.'\r\nAnd many cried out, saying, 'The king is slain by Bharadwaja's son.' Loud\r\nwails of this kind were heard, O Bharata, among the Pandava troops.\r\nMeanwhile, king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, getting up on the car of\r\nSahadeva, retreated from the field, borne away by swift steeds.'\""

King Vrihatkshatra then, O monarch, desirous of\r\npiercing through Drona's division, quickly struck his antagonist with\r\nninety straight shafts. Kshemadhurti, however, filled with rage, cut off,\r\nwith a sharp well-tempered, and broad-headed shaft, the bow of that\r\nhigh-souled prince of the Kaikeyas. Having cut off his bow, Kshemadhurti\r\nthen, with a keen and straight shaft, quickly pierced in that encounter\r\nthat foremost of all bowmen. Then Vrihatkshatra, taking up another bow\r\nand smiling (at his foe), soon made the mighty car-warrior Kshemadhurti\r\nsteedless and driverless and carless. And with another broad-headed shaft\r\nthat was well-tempered and sharp, he cut off, from the trunk of his royal\r\nantagonist his head blazing with (a pair of) ear-rings. That head, graced\r\nwith only locks and a diadem, suddenly cut off, fell down on the earth\r\nand looked resplendent like a luminary fallen from the firmament. Having\r\nslain his foe, the mighty car-warrior Vrihatkshatra became filled with\r\njoy and fell with great force upon thy troops for the sake of the\r\nParthas. The great bowman Viradhanwan, O Bharata, endued with great\r\nprowess, resisted Dhrishtaketu who was advancing against Drona.\r\nEncountering each other, those two heroes having arrows for their fangs,\r\nand both endued with great activity, struck each other with many\r\nthousands of arrows. Indeed, those two tigers among men fought with each\r\nother, like two leaders of elephantine herds in the deep woods with fury.\r\nBoth endued with great energy, they fought, each desirous of slaying the\r\nother, like two enraged tigers in a mountain-cave. That combat, O\r\nmonarch, became exceedingly fierce. Deserving to be witnessed, it became\r\nhighly wonderful. The very Siddhas and the Charanas, in large numbers,\r\nwitnessed it with wonder-waiting eyes. Then Viradhanwan, O Bharata, with\r\na laugh, cut off in rage Dhrishtaketu's bow in twain by means of\r\nbroad-headed arrows. Abandoning that broken bow, the ruler of the Chedis,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior took up a fierce dart made of iron and equipped\r\nwith a golden staff. Bending with his hands, O Bharata, that dart of\r\nfierce energy towards the car of Viradhanwan, Dhrishtaketu hurled it\r\ncarefully and with great force. Struck with great force by that\r\nhero-slaying dart, and his heart pierced by it through, Viradhanwan,\r\nquickly fell down on the earth from his car. Upon the fall of that hero,\r\nthat mighty car-warrior among the Trigartas, thy army, O lord, was broken\r\nby the Pandavas. (Thy son) Durmukha sped sixty shafts at Sahadeva, and\r\nuttered a loud shout in that battle, challenging that son of Pandu. The\r\nson of Madri, then., filled with rage, pierced Durmukha with many keen\r\narrows, smiling the while, the brother striking the brother. Be. holding\r\nthe mighty Durmukha fighting furiously, Sahadeva, then, O Bharata, once\r\nmore struck him with nine shafts. Endued with great strength, Sahadeva\r\nthen cut off Durmukha's standard with a broad-headed arrow and struck\r\ndown his four steeds with four other arrows. And then with another broad.\r\nheaded arrow, well-tempered and sharp, he cut off, from his trunk, the\r\nhead of Durmukha's charioteer that shone with a pair of ear-rings. And\r\ncutting off Durmukha's large bow with a razor-faced arrow, Sahadeva\r\npierced Durmukha himself in that battle with five arrows. Durmukha\r\nfearlessly jumping down from that steedless car, mounted the car, O\r\nBharata, of Niramitra. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz.,\r\nSahadeva, filled with rage slew in that great battle Niramitra in the\r\nmidst of his division with a broad-headed arrow. Thereupon, prince\r\nNiramitra, the son of the ruler of the Trigartas, fell down from his car,\r\nafflicting thy army with great grief. Slaying him, the mighty-armed\r\nSahadeva looked resplendent like Rama, the son of Dasaratha, after\r\nslaying the mighty (Rakshasa) Khara. Beholding that mighty car-warrior,\r\nviz., prince Niramitra slain, loud cries of Oh and Alas arose, O monarch,\r\namong the Trigarta warriors. Nakula, O king, in a moment vanquished thy\r\nson Vikarna of large eyes. This seemed highly wonderful. Vyaghradatta, by\r\nmeans of his straight shafts, made Satyaki invisible with his steeds and\r\ndriver and standard in the midst of his division. The brave grandson of\r\nSini, baffling those shafts with great lightness of hand, felled\r\nVyaghradatta by means of his arrows, with his steeds and driver and\r\nstandard. Upon the fall, O lord, of that prince of the Magadhas, the\r\nlatter, struggling vigorously, rushed against Yuyudhana from all sides.\r\nScattering their shafts and lances by thousands, and sharp arrows and\r\nspears and mallets and thick clubs, those brave warriors fought in that\r\nbattle with that invincible hero of the Satwata race. Endued with great\r\nmight, invincible Satyaki, that bull among men, with the greatest ease\r\nand laughing the while, vanquished them all. The Magadhas were nearly\r\nexterminated. A small remnant flew from the field. Beholding this, thy\r\narmy, already afflicted with the arrows of Yuyudhana, broke, O lord! Then\r\nthat foremost one of Madhu's race, having slaughtered ill battle thy\r\ntroops, that illustrious hero, looked resplendent as he shook his bow.\r\nThe army, O king, was thus routed by that high-souled one of the Satwata\r\nrace. Indeed, frightened by that hero of long arms, none approached him\r\nfor fight. Then Drona filled with rage and rolling his eyes, himself\r\nrushed impetuously towards Satyaki, of feats incapable of being baffled.'\""

Much afflicted, O lord, by that fierce warrior, they were\r\nstupefied and knew not for some time what to do. Then that crusher of\r\nfoes, Satanika, the son of Nakula, piercing Somadatta's son, that bull\r\namong men, with a couple of arrows, uttered in joy a loud roar. The other\r\nbrothers then, struggling vigorously, quickly pierced the wrathful son of\r\nSomadatta, each with three straight shafts. Then the illustrious son of\r\nSomadatta, O monarch, sped at them five shafts, piercing each of them in\r\nthe chest with one shaft. Then those five brothers, thus pierced by that\r\nhigh-souled warrior with his shafts, surrounded that hero on every side\r\nand began to pierce him deeply with their shafts. Then the son of Arjuna,\r\nfilled with rage, despatched with keen shafts, the four steeds of\r\nSaumadatti to the region of Yama. And the son of Bhimasena, cutting off\r\nthe bow of the illustrious son of Somadatta, uttered a loud shout and\r\npierced his foe with many sharp arrows. The son of Yudhishthira then,\r\ncutting off Saumadatti's standard, felled it en the earth, while the son\r\nof Nakula felled the enemy's charioteer from his niche in the car. Then\r\nthe son of Sahadeva, ascertaining the foe to be on the point of leaving\r\nthe field in consequence of the brothers, cut off, with a razor-faced\r\narrow, the head of that illustrious warrior. That head, decked with\r\near-rings of gold, fell on the earth and adorned the field like the sun\r\nof brilliant effulgence that rises at the end of the Yuga. Beholding the\r\nhead of the high-souled son of Somadatta thus fallen on the ground, thy\r\ntroops, O king, overcome with fear, fled in all directions.\r\n\r\n\"The Rakshasa Alamvusha in that battle, filled with rage, fought with the\r\nmighty Bhimasena, like Ravana's son (Indrajit) with (Rama's brother)\r\nLakshmana. Beholding that Rakshasa and that human warrior engaged in\r\nfight, all creatures experienced both joy and wonder. Then Bhima, O king,\r\nlaughing the while, pierced that wrathful prince of Rakshasa, viz.,\r\nRishyasringa's son (Alamvusha), with nine keen shafts. Then that\r\nRakshasa, thus pierced in battle, uttered a loud and awful sound, and\r\nrushed, with all his followers, against Bhima. Piercing Bhima then with\r\nfive straight shafts, he quickly destroyed in that battle, thirty cars\r\nsupporting Bhima. And once more destroying four hundred cars of\r\nBhimasena, the Rakshasa pierced Bhimasena himself with winged arrows.\r\nThen the mighty Bhima deeply pierced by the Rakshasa, sat down on the\r\nterrace of his car, overcome by a swoon. The son of the Wind-god then,\r\nrecovering his senses, became filled with rage. Drawing his excellent and\r\nterrible bow that was capable of bearing a great strain, he afflicted\r\nAlamvusha, in every part of his body, with keen shafts. Thereupon, the\r\nRakshasa who resembled a huge mass of antimony, looked resplendent O\r\nking, like a flowering Kinsuka. Whilst being struck in that battle with\r\nthose shafts sped from the bow of Bhima, the Rakshasa recollected the\r\nslaughter of his brother (Vaka) by the illustrious Pandava. Assuming then\r\nan awful form, he addressed Bhima, saying, 'Wait a little in this battle,\r\nO Partha! Behold today my prowess. O thou of wicked understanding, that\r\nforemost of Rakshasas, viz., the mighty Vaka, was my brother. It is true\r\nhe was slain by thee. But that took place out of my sight.' Having said\r\nthese words unto Bhima, Alamvusha made himself invisible, and began to\r\ncover Bhimasena with a dense shower of arrows. Upon the disappearance of\r\nthe Rakshasa, Bhima, O monarch, covered the welkin with straight shafts.\r\nThus afflicted by Bhima, Alamvusha soon returned to his car. And soon\r\nagain, he entered into the bowels of the earth and once more becoming\r\nlittle he suddenly soared into the sky. Alamvusha, assumed countless\r\nforms. Now becoming subtle and now huge and gross, he began to roar like\r\nthe clouds. And he uttered diverse kinds of words and speeches all\r\naround. And from the welkin there fell thousands of arrowy torrents, as\r\nalso darts, and Kunapas, and lances, and spiked maces, and short arrows,\r\nand scimitars, and swords, and thunders also. That awful downpour of\r\narrows caused by the Rakshasa, slew the troops of Pandu's son on the\r\nfield of battle. And in consequence of that arrowy downpour, many\r\nelephants also of the Pandava army were slain, and many steeds also, O\r\nking, and many foot-soldiers. And a river was caused there, whose waters\r\nwere blood and whose eddies were constituted by cars. And it abounded\r\nwith elephants that constituted its alligators. And the umbrellas of\r\ncar-warriors constituted its swans, and the flesh and marrow of animals,\r\nits mire. And it teemed with the (cut off) arms of human beings that\r\nconstituted its snakes. And it was haunted by many Rakshasas and other\r\ncannibals. And it wafted away, O king, countless Chedis and Panchalas and\r\nSrinjayas. Beholding him, O monarch, careering so fearlessly in that\r\nbattle and seeing his prowess, the Pandavas became filled with anxiety;\r\nand joy filled the hearts of thy troops then. And amongst the latter,\r\nloud and terrible sounds of musical instruments, making the hair stand on\r\nend, arose. Hearing that loud uproar made by thy troops, the son of Pandu\r\ncould not bear it, as a snake cannot bear the clap of human palms. With\r\neyes red as copper in rage, with glances that like fire consumed every\r\nthing, the son of the Wind-god, like Tvashtri himself, aimed the weapon\r\nknown by the name of Tvashtri. From that weapon were produced thousands\r\nof arrows on all sides. And in consequence of those arrows, a universal\r\nrout was seen among thy troops.' That weapon, shot in battle by\r\nBhimasena, destroying the effective illusion produced by the Rakshasa,\r\ngreatly afflicted the Rakshasa himself. Struck in every part of his body\r\nby Bhimasena, the Rakshasa, then abandoning Bhimasena, fled towards the\r\ndivision of Drona. Upon the defeat of that prince of Rakshasa by the\r\nhigh-souled Bhima, the Pandavas caused every point of the compass to\r\nresound with their leonine roars. And filled with joy, they worshipped\r\nthe mighty son of Marut, like the Maruts worshipping Sakra after the\r\ndefeat in battle of Prahlada.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Having fled away from Bhima, Alamvusha, in another part\r\nof the field, careered fearlessly in battle. And while he was thus\r\nfearlessly careering in battle, the son of Hidimva rushed impetuously at\r\nhim and pierced him with keen shafts. The battle between those two lions\r\namong Rakshasas became terrible. Both of them invoked into existence\r\nillusions like Sakra and Samvara (in days of old). Alamvusha, excited\r\nwith rage, attacked Ghatotkacha. Indeed, that encounter between those two\r\nforemost of Rakshasas resembled that of old between Rama and Ravana, O\r\nlord! Then Ghatotkacha having pierced Alamvusha, in the centre of the\r\nchest with twenty long shafts, repeatedly roared like a lion. Smilingly,\r\nO king, Alamvusha also, repeatedly piercing the invincible son of\r\nHidimva, uttered loud roars in joy, filling the entire welkin. Then,\r\nthose two foremost of Rakshasas, endued with great might, became filled\r\nwith rage. They fought with each other, displaying their powers of\r\nillusion, but without any of them getting any advantage over the other.\r\nEach, creating a hundred illusions, stupefied the other. Both\r\naccomplished in producing' illusions, O king, that Ghatotkacha displayed\r\nin battle, were all destroyed, O monarch, by Alamvusha, producing similar\r\nillusions of his own. Beholding that prince of Rakshasas, viz.,\r\nAlamvusha, who was accomplished in producing illusions, fight in that\r\nmanner, the Pandavas became filled with anxiety, they then caused him to\r\nbe surrounded by many foremost of car-warriors. Bhimasena and others, O\r\nmonarch, all rushed in rage against him. Hemming him, O sire, on all\r\nsides by means of numberless cars, they shrouded him from every side with\r\nshafts, like men in a forest encompassing an elephant with blazing\r\nbrands. Baffling that shower of weapons by means of the illusion of his\r\nown weapons, freed himself from that press of cars like an elephant from\r\na forest conflagration. Then drawing his terrible bow whose twang\r\nresembled the thunder of Indra, he pierced the son of the Wind-god with\r\nfive and twenty shafts, and Bhimasena's son with five, and Yudhishthira\r\nwith three, and Sahadeva with seven, and Nakula with three and seventy,\r\nand each of the five sons of Draupadi with five shafts, and uttered a\r\nloud roar. Then Bhimasena pierced him in return with nine shafts, and\r\nSahadeva with five. And Yudhishthira pierced the Rakshasa with a hundred\r\nshafts. And Nakula pierced him with three shafts. The son of Hidimva\r\nhaving pierced him with five hundred shafts, Alamvusha once more pierced\r\nhim with seventy, and that mighty warrior uttered a loud roar. With that\r\nloud roar of Ghatotkacha the earth shook, O king, with her mountains and\r\nforests and with her trees and waters. Deeply pierced on all sides by\r\nthose great bowmen and mighty car-warriors, Alamvusha pierced each of\r\nthem in return with five arrows. Then that Rakshasa, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, viz., the son of Hidimva, filled with rage, pierced that other\r\nangry Rakshasa in battle with many shafts. Then that mighty prince of\r\nRakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, deeply pierced, quickly shot countless shafts\r\nequipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone. Those shafts, perfectly\r\nstraight, all entered the body of Ghatotkacha, like angry snakes of great\r\nstrength entering a mountain summit. Then the Pandavas, O king, filled\r\nwith anxiety, and Hidimva's son Ghatotkacha, also sped at their foe from\r\nevery side clouds of keen shafts. Thus struck in battle by the Pandavas,\r\ndesirous of victory, Alamvusha mortal as he was, did not know what to do.\r\nThen that delighter in battle, viz., the mighty son of Bhimasena,\r\nbeholding that state of Alamvusha, set his heart upon his destruction. He\r\nrushed with great impetuosity towards the car of the prince of Rakshasas,\r\nthat car which resembled a burnt mountain summit or a broken heap of\r\nantimony. The son of Hidimva, inflamed with wrath, flew from his own car\r\nto that of Alamvusha, and seized the latter. He then took him up from the\r\ncar, like Garuda taking up a snake. Thus dragging him up with his arms,\r\nhe began to whirl him repeatedly, and then crushed him into pieces,\r\nhurling him down on the earth, like a man crushing an earthen pot into\r\nfragments by hurling it against a rock. Endued with strength and\r\nactivity, possessed of great prowess, the son of Bhimasena, inflamed with\r\nwrath in battle, inspired all the troops with fear. All the limbs broken\r\nand bones reduced to fragments, the frightful Rakshasa Alamvusha, thus\r\nslain by the heroic Ghatotkacha, resembled a tall Sala uprooted and\r\nbroken by the wind. Upon the slaughter of that wanderer of the night, the\r\nParthas became very cheerful. And they uttered leonine roars and waved\r\ntheir garments. Thy brave warriors, however, beholding that mighty prince\r\nor Rakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, slain and lying like a crushed mountain,\r\nuttered cries, O monarch, of Oh and Alas. And people, possessed with\r\ncuriosity, went to view that Rakshasa lying helplessly on the earth like\r\na piece of charcoal (no longer capable of burning). The Rakshasa\r\nGhatotkacha, then, that foremost of mighty beings, having thus slain his\r\nfoe, uttered a loud shout, like Vasava after slaying (the Asura) Vala.\r\nHaving achieved that exceedingly difficult feat, Ghatotkacha, was much\r\napplauded by his sires as also by his relatives. Indeed, having felled\r\nAlamvusha, like an Alamvusha fruit, he rejoiced exceedingly with his\r\nfriends. There arose then a loud uproar (in the Pandava army) of conchs\r\nand of diverse kinds of arrows. Hearing that noise the Kauravas uttered\r\nloud shouts in reply, filling the whole earth with its echoes.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, how Yuyudhana rushed against\r\nthe son of Bharadwaja in battle. I feel a great curiosity to hear it.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O thou of great wisdom, to the account of that\r\nbattle, that makes the hair stand on end, between Drona and the Pandayas\r\nheaded by Yuyudhana. Beholding the (Kuru) army slaughtered, O sire, by\r\nYuyudhana, Drona himself rushed towards that warrior of unbaffled\r\nprowess, called also by the name of Satyaki. Satyaki pierced that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, thus advancing against him,\r\nwith five and twenty small arrows. Drona also, possessed of great prowess\r\nin battle, with deliberate aim, quickly pierced Yuyudhana, with five\r\nwhetted arrows, equipped with wings of gold. Those arrows, piercing the\r\nhard mount of the foe and drinking his life-blood, entered the earth, O\r\nking, like hissing snakes. The long-armed Satyaki then, inflamed with\r\nrage like an elephant struck with the hook, pierced Drona with fifty long\r\narrows that resembled flames of fire. Then Bharadwaja's son, thus quickly\r\npierced in battle by Yuyudhana, pierced carefully exerting Satyaki in\r\nreturn with many arrows. Then that great bowman, endued with great might,\r\nand filled with rage, once more afflicted that hero of the Satwata race\r\nwith many straight shafts. Thus struck in that battle by the son of\r\nBharadwaja, Satyaki, O monarch, knew not what to do. Then, O king,\r\nYuyudhana's face became cheerless, seeing the son of Bharadwaja shoot\r\ncountless keen arrows. Beholding Satyaki thus situated, thy sons and\r\ntroops, O king, becoming exceedingly cheerful, repeatedly uttered leonine\r\nroars. Hearing that terrible uproar and beholding that hero of Madhu's\r\nrace thus afflicted, king Yudhishthira, O monarch, addressing all his\r\nsoldiers, said, 'That foremost one among the Vrishnis, viz., the brave\r\nSatyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled, is about to be devoured\r\nby the heroic Drona, like the sun by Rahu. Go and rush ye to the spot\r\nwhere Satyaki is battling.' The king, addressing Dhrishtadyumna. of the\r\nPanchala race, said, Rush thou with speed at Drona. Why dost thou tarry,\r\nO son of Prishata! Seest thou not the great danger to ourselves that has\r\nalready arisen from Drona? Drona is a great bowman. He is sporting with\r\nYuyudhana, in battle, like a boy with a bird bound in a string. Let all\r\nof you, headed by Bhimasena, and accompanied by others proceed thither\r\nwhere Satyaki's car is. Behind you I will follow with my troops. Rescue\r\nSatyaki today who is already within the jaws of the Destroyer.' Having\r\nsaid these words, O Bharata, king Yudhishthira with all his troops rushed\r\ntowards Drona for the sake of Yuyudhana. Blessed be thou, great was the\r\nuproar made there by the Pandavas and the Srinjayas all fighting with\r\nDrona only. Together approaching, O tiger among men, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, they covered with showers of\r\nkeen arrows equipped with the feathers of Kankas and peacocks. Drona,\r\nhowever, received all those heroes smilingly, like a householder\r\nreceiving guests arrived of their own will, with seats and water. With\r\nthe shafts of Bharadwaja's bow-wielding son, those heroes were\r\nwell-gratified like guest, O king, with the hospitality they receive in\r\nthe houses (of good hosts). And none of them, O lord, could even gaze at\r\nthe son of Bharadwaja who then resembled the thousand-rayed sun at\r\nmidday. Indeed, Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, scorched\r\nall those great bowmen with showers of arrows like the sun scorching\r\n(everything below) with his burning rays. Thus struck, O king, by Drona,\r\nthe Pandavas and the Srinjayas beheld no protector, like elephants sunk\r\nin a morass. The mighty arrows of Drona, as they coursed (through the\r\nwelkin), looked like the rays of the sun blasting everything around. In\r\nthat encounter, five and twenty warriors among the Panchalas were slain\r\nby Drona, who were all regarded as Maharathas and all approved (as such)\r\nby Dhrishtadyumna. And amongst all the troops of the Pandavas and the\r\nPanchalas, men quietly beheld brave Drona slaying the foremost of\r\nwarriors in succession. Having slain a hundred warriors amongst the\r\nKekayas and routing them on all sides, Drona stood, O monarch, like the\r\nDestroyer himself with wide-open mouth. The mighty-armed Drona vanquished\r\nthe Panchalas, the Srinjayas, the Matsyas and the Kekayas, O monarch, by\r\nhundreds and thousands. Pierced by the arrows of Drona, the clamour made\r\nby them resembled that made in the woods by the denizens of the forest\r\nwhen encompassed by a conflagration. The gods, Gandharvas, and the\r\nPitris, said, 'Behold, the Panchalas, and the Pandavas, with all their\r\ntroops, are flying away.' Indeed, when Drona was thus engaged in\r\nslaughtering the Somakas in battle, none ventured to advance against him\r\nand none succeeded in piercing him. And while that dreadful encounter, so\r\ndestructive of great heroes, continued, Pritha's son (Yudhishthira)\r\nsuddenly heard the blare of Panchajanya. Blown by Vasudeva, that best of\r\nconchs gave loud blasts. Indeed, while the heroic protectors of the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus were fighting, and while the Dhartarashtras were roaring\r\nin front of Arjuna's car, the twang of Gandiva could not be heard. The\r\nroyal son of Pandu repeatedly swooned, and thought, 'Without doubt, all\r\nis not well with Partha, since that prince of conchs (Panchajanya) is\r\nyielding such blasts and since the Kauravas also, filled with joy, are\r\nincessantly uttering such shouts.' Thinking in this way, with an anxious\r\nheart, Ajatasatru, the son of Kunti, said unto him of the Satwata race\r\n(viz., Satyaki) these words in a voice choked with tears. Though\r\nrepeatedly stupefied, king Yudhishthira, however, did not lose sight of\r\nwhat was to be done next. Addressing Sini's grandson, that bull of his\r\nclan, (Yudhishthira said), 'O grandson of Sini, the time for that eternal\r\nduty which the righteous ones of old have indicated (for friends) towards\r\nfriends in seasons of distress, hath now come. O bull amongst the Sinis,\r\nreflecting within myself, I do not, O Satyaki, see amongst all my\r\nwarriors one who is a greater well wisher to us than thou art. He who is\r\nalways well-affected, he who is always obedient, I think, he should be\r\nappointed to a grave commission in times of distress. As Kesava is ever\r\nthe refuge of the Pandavas even, so art thou, O thou of Vrishni's race,\r\nwho art like Kesava in prowess. I will, therefore, lay a burthen on thee.\r\nIt behoveth thee not to frustrate my purpose. Arjuna is thy brother,\r\nfriend, and preceptor, O bull among men, in this battle render him aid in\r\ntime of distress. Thou art devoted to truth. Thou art a hero. Thou art\r\nthe dispeller of the fears of friends. Thou art celebrated in the world,\r\nin consequence of thy acts, O hero, as one that is truthful in speech.\r\nHe, O grandson of Sini, who casteth away his body while fighting in\r\nbattle for friends, is equal to him who giveth away to Brahmanas the\r\nwhole earth. We have heard of various kings gone to heaven, having given\r\naway the whole of this earth unto Brahmanas with due rites. O thou of\r\nvirtuous soul, I beg of thee, with joined hands, even this viz., that, O\r\nlord, attain thou the fruit of giving away (unto Brahmanas) the whole\r\nearth, or something higher than that by incurring danger to thy life\r\nitself for helping Arjuna. There is one, viz., Krishna, that dispeller of\r\nthe fears of friends, who is ever willing to cast away his life in battle\r\n(for the sake of friends). Thou, O Satyaki, art the second. None but a\r\nhero can render aid unto a hero, exerting valorously in battle, from\r\ndesire of fame. An ordinary person cannot do so. In this matter, here is\r\nnone else but thee who can protect Arjuna. On one occasion, while\r\napplauding thy numerous feats, Arjuna, giving me great pleasure\r\nrepeatedly recited them. He said of thee that thou art endued with\r\nextreme lightness of hand, that thou art conversant with all modes of\r\nwarfare, that thou art possessed of great activity and great prowess. He\r\nsaid, 'Satyaki is endued with great wisdom, is acquainted with every\r\nweapon, is a hero, and is never stupefied in battle. Of broad neck and\r\nbroad chest, of mighty arms and broad cheeks, or great strength and great\r\nprowess, Satyaki is a high-souled Maharatha. He is my disciple and\r\nfriend; I am dear to him and he is dear to me. Becoming my ally,\r\nYuyudhana will crush the Kauravas. Even if Kesava and Rama, and\r\nAniruddha, and the mighty car-warrior Pradyumna, and Gada, and Sarana,\r\nand Samva, with all the Vrishnis, case themselves in mail for assisting\r\nus, O king, in the field of battle, I shall yet appoint that tiger among\r\nmen viz., Satyaki of unbaffled prowess, for our aid, since there is none\r\nequal to him.' Even this is what Dhananjaya told me in the Dwaita woods,\r\nin thy absence, while truly describing thy merits in an assembly of\r\nrighteous persons. It behoveth thee not, O thou of the Vrishni race, to\r\nfalsify that expectation of Dhananjaya, and also of myself and Bhima!\r\nWhen, returning from various tirthas, I proceeded to Dwaraka; there I\r\nwitnessed thy reverence for Arjuna. While we were at Upaplavya I did not\r\nmark anybody else, O grandson of Sini, who showed us such affection as\r\nthou didst. Thou art of noble lineage and feelest reverence for us. For\r\nshowing kindness, therefore, to one who is thy friend and preceptor, it\r\nbehoveth thee, O thou of mighty arms, to act in a way deserving, O great\r\nbowman, of thy friendship and prowess and noble parentage and\r\ntruthfulness. O thou of Madhu's race! Suyodhana, cased in armour by Drona\r\nhimself, hath suddenly gone, following Arjuna! The other great\r\ncar-warriors of Kauravas have, before that followed Arjuna. Loud uproars\r\nare being heard against Arjuna's car. O grandson of Sini, it behoveth\r\nthee, O giver of honours, to go thither quickly. Bhimasena and ourselves,\r\nwell-equipped and with all our forces, will resist Drona if he advances\r\nagainst thee. Behold, O Grandson of Sini, the Bharata troops are flying\r\naway in battle, and as they are flying away, they are tittering loud\r\nwails. Like the very ocean at full tide agitated by a mighty tempest, the\r\nDhartarashtra host, O sire, is agitated by Savyasachin. Behold, in\r\nconsequence of countless cars and men and steeds moving quickly, the\r\nearthly dust raised is gradually spreading (over the field). See, that\r\nslayer of hostile hosts, Phalguna, is encompassed by the Sindhu-Sauviras,\r\narmed with spikes and lances and adorned with many horses in their ranks.\r\nWithout vanquishing this force it will not be possible to vanquish\r\nJayadratha. These warriors are prepared to lay down their lives for the\r\nsake of the ruler of the Sindhus. Behold the invincible Dhartarashtra\r\nforce, stationed there, that bristles with arrows and darts and tall\r\nstandards, and that teems with steeds and elephants. Hear the beat of\r\ntheir drums and the loud blare of their conchs, the tremendous leonine\r\nshouts uttered by them, and the rattle of their car-wheels. Hear the\r\ngrunt of their elephants, the heavy tread of their foot-soldiers, and the\r\nstamping of their rushing cavalry which all seem to shake the very earth\r\nitself. Before him is the division of Jayadratha, and behind is that of\r\nDrona. So great is the number of the foes that he is capable of\r\nafflicting the chief of the celestials himself. Sunk in the midst of the\r\nfathomless host, Arjuna may lose his life. If he be slain in battle, how\r\ncan one like me live? Is this calamity to befall me when thou art alive?\r\nDark-blue in colour, young in years, of curled locks and exceedingly\r\nhandsome is that son of Pandu. Active in the use of weapons, and\r\nconversant with every mode of warfare, the mighty-armed Arjuna hath, O\r\nsire, penetrated into the Bharata host at sunrise. The day is about to\r\nend. O thou of Vrishni's race, I do not know whether he liveth or not.\r\nThe vast Kuru host is like ocean. O sire, Vibhatsu hath penetrated into\r\nit all alone. That army is incapable of being resisted by the very gods\r\nin battle. In today's battle, I fail to keep my judgment clear. Drona\r\nalso is, with great might, afflicting my forces! Thou seest, O\r\nmighty-armed one, how that regenerate one is careering in battle. When\r\nseveral tasks present themselves together, thou art well-skilled in\r\nselecting that which would be first attended to. It behoveth thee, O\r\ngiver of honours, to accomplish with activity that task which is the\r\ngravest of all. Amongst all these tasks, I myself think, that this\r\n(aiding Arjuna) is the first that demands our attention. The rescue of\r\nArjuna in battle should be first undertaken. I do not grieve for him of\r\nDasarha's race. He is the Protector and the Lord of the Universe. I tell\r\nthee truly that tiger among men, O sire, is able to vanquish in battle\r\nthe three worlds assembled together. What need I say, therefore, of this\r\nweak Dhritarashtra host? Arjuna, however, O thou of Vrishni's race, is\r\nbeing afflicted by countless odds in battle. He may yield up his life. It\r\nis for this that I am so cheerless. O thou then go in his track, since\r\npersons like thee should follow a person like him, at such a season,\r\nurged on by one like me. Amongst the foremost ones of the Vrishni race,\r\ntwo are regarded as Atirathas. They are mighty-armed Pradyumna and\r\nthyself, O Satwata, that are so famous. In weapons, thou art equal to\r\nNarayana himself, and in strength to Sankarshana. In bravery, thou art\r\nequal to Dhananjaya, O tiger among men, and surpassest Bhishma and Drona\r\nand every one accomplished in battle. O tiger among men, the wise speak\r\nof thee, saying. O Madhava, 'There is nothing unachievable by Satyaki.' O\r\nthou of great strength, do thou, therefore, that which I say unto thee,\r\nviz., obey the wishes of all here, of myself and of Arjuna. It behoveth\r\nthee not, O mighty-armed one, to frustrate that wish. Reckless of thy\r\nvery life, career thou in battle like a hero. O grandson of Sini, the\r\nscions of Dasarha's race never care to protect their lives in battle.\r\nAvoiding battle, or fighting from behind breast-works, or flying away\r\nfrom battle,--those practices of cowards and wretches are never practised\r\nby the Dasarhas. The virtuous-souled Arjuna is thy superior, O bull among\r\nthe Sinis! Vasudeva is the superior of both thyself and intelligent\r\nArjuna, Casting my eyes on these two reasons, I say unto thee these\r\nwords. Do not discard my words, I am the superior of thy superiors. That\r\nwhich I am saying unto thee is approved as also by Arjuna. I tell thee\r\nthis truly. Go then to the spot where Dhananjaya is. Attending to these\r\nwords of mine, O thou of prowess incapable of being baffled, penetrate in\r\nthis host of the wicked son of Dhritarashtra. Having penetrated into it\r\nduly, encounter the great car-warriors, and display, O Satwata, such\r\nfeats as are worthy of thyself!'\""

As regards myself, I am prepared to cast away my\r\nlife for the sake of Dhananjaya. Commanded, again, by thee, what is there\r\nI would not do in great battle? What need I say of this weak\r\n(Dhritarashtra) force? Urged by thee, I am prepared, O best of men, to\r\nbattle with three worlds including the gods, the Asuras, and men. Today I\r\nwill fight with the entire army of Suyodhana and vanquish it in battle.\r\nTruly do I say this unto thee, O king! Safely shall I reach Dhananjaya\r\nhimself in safety, and after Jayadratha is slain, I shall, O king, come\r\nback into thy presence. I must, however, O king, inform thee of the words\r\nof Vasudeva as also those of the intelligent Arjuna. I was strongly and\r\nrepeatedly solicited by Arjuna in the midst of all our warriors and in\r\nthe hearing also of Vasudeva (in these words), Today, O Madhava, nobly\r\nresolved in battle, protect thou the king carefully, till I slay\r\nJayadratha! Making over the monarch to thee, O mighty-armed one, or to\r\nthat great car-warrior Pradyumna, I can go with an easy heart towards\r\nJayadratha. Thou knowest Drona in battle, that warrior who is regarded as\r\nthe foremost one among the Kurus. Thou knowest also the vow made by him\r\nin the presence of all, O lord! The son of Bharadwaja is always eager to\r\nseize the king. He is competent also in afflicting king Yudhishthira in\r\nbattle. Charging thee with the protection of that best of men, viz., king\r\nYudhishthira the just, I will proceed today for the destruction of the\r\nruler of the Sindhus. Slaying Jayadratha, I shall soon come back, O\r\nMadhava! See that Drona may not succeed in forcibly seizing king\r\nYudhishthira the just in battle. If Yudhishthira be seized by\r\nBharadwaja's son, O Madhava, I shall not succeed in slaying Jayadratha,\r\nand great will be my grief. If that best of men, the truthful son of\r\nPandu, be seized, it is evident that we shall have again to go into\r\nwoods. My success, therefore, over Jayadratha, it is plain, will be\r\nproductive of no benefit, if Drona, inflamed with rage, succeeds in\r\nseizing Yudhishthira in battle. O mighty-armed one, for doing what is\r\nagreeable to me, therefore, O Madhava, as also for the sake of my success\r\nand fame, protect the king in battle.' Thou seest, therefore, O king,\r\nthou hast been made over to me as a trust by Savyasachin, O lord, in\r\nconsequence of his constant fear of Bharadwaja's son. O mighty-armed one,\r\nI myself daily see, O lord, that there is none, save Rukmini's son\r\n(Pradyumna), who can be a match for Drona in battle. I also am regarded\r\nto be a match for the intelligent son of Bharadwaja in battle. It is\r\nplain, therefore, I cannot dare falsify that reputation which I have, or\r\ndisregard the commands of my preceptor (Arjuna), or leave thee, O king!\r\nThe preceptor (Drona), cased as he is in impenetrable mail, in\r\nconsequence of his lightness of arms, obtaining thee in battle, will\r\nsport with thee as a child with a little bird. If Krishna's son, bearing\r\nthe Makara on his banner, were here, I could then have made over to him,\r\nfor he would have protected thee as Arjuna himself. Thou shouldst protect\r\nthyself. When I am gone, who will protect thee, who that is, that will\r\nadvance against Drona while I proceed towards Arjuna? O king, let no fear\r\nbe thine today on Arjuna's account. He never becomes cheerless under any\r\nburden howsoever heavy. Those warriors that are opposed to him, viz., the\r\nSauvirakas, the Sindhava-Pauravas, they from the north, they from the\r\nsouth, and they, O king, headed by Karna, that are regarded as foremost\r\nof car-warriors, do not together come up to a sixteenth part of Arjuna.\r\nThe whole earth rising against him, with the gods, the Asuras, and men,\r\nwith all the tribes of Rakshasas, O king, with the Kinnaras, the great\r\nsnakes, and in fact, all the mobile and the immobile creatures assembled\r\ntogether, is no match for Arjuna in battle. Knowing this, O king, let thy\r\nfear on Dhananjaya's account be dispelled. There where those two heroes\r\nand great bowmen, viz., the two Krishnas, of prowess incapable of being\r\nbaffled, are, there the slightest obstacle cannot happen to their\r\npurpose. Think of the celestial puissance, the accomplishment in weapons,\r\nthe resourcefulness, the wrath in battle, the gratefulness, and the\r\ncompassion of thy brother. Think also, O king, of the wonderful knowledge\r\nof weapons that Drona will display in battle when I leave this place for\r\ngoing to Arjuna. The preceptor, O monarch, is eagerly solicitous of\r\nseizing thee. He is eagerly desirous also, O king, of making good his\r\nvow, O Bharata! Be attentive, O king, to thy own protection. Who will\r\nprotect thee when I am gone, who is he that is, confiding on whom I may\r\ngo towards Pritha's son, Phalguna? I tell thee truly, O great king, that\r\nwithout making thee over to somebody in this great battle, I will not\r\nsurely go towards Arjuna, O thou of Kuru's race! Reflecting on this, from\r\nevery point of view, with the aid of thy intelligence, O foremost of all\r\nintelligent persons, and ascertaining with thy intelligence what is for\r\nthy highest good, command me, O king!'\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira hearing these words said, 'It is even so, O mighty-armed\r\none, as thou sayest, O Madhava! For all that, however, O sire, my heart\r\ndoth not become easy on Arjuna's account. I shall take the greatest\r\nprecaution in protecting myself. Commanded by me, go thou thither where\r\nDhananjaya hath gone. Weighing, with my judgment, my own protection in\r\nbattle with the necessity of your going towards Arjuna, the latter seems\r\nto me preferable, Make thyself ready, therefore, to go thither whither\r\nDhananjaya hath gone. The mighty Bhima will protect me. Prishata's son,\r\nwith all his uterine brothers, and all the mighty kings, and the sons of\r\nDraupadi, will without doubt, protect me. The five Kekaya brothers, and\r\nthe Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and Virata, and Drupada, and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Sikhandin and Dhrishtaketu of great strength, and Kuntibhoja,\r\nO sire, Nakula, and Sahadeva, and the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas,--all\r\nthese, O sire, will without doubt, very carefully protect me. Drona at\r\nthe head of his troops, and Kritavarman also, in battle, will not succeed\r\nin beating us or afflicting me. That scorcher of foes, viz.,\r\nDhrishtadyumna, displaying his prowess, will resist the angry Drona, like\r\nthe continent resisting the sea. There where Prishata's son, that slayer\r\nof hostile heroes, will remain, there Drona will never be able to\r\nforcibly transgress our troops. This Dhristadyumna sprang from the fire,\r\nfor the destruction of Drona, clad in mail, armed with bow and arrows and\r\nsword, and decked with costly ornaments. Go, O grandson of Sini, with an\r\neasy heart, do not be anxious on my account. Dhrishtadyumna will resist\r\nangry Drona in battle.'\""

Seeing, however, the certainty of an imputation of cowardice by the\r\npeople (if he disobeyed Yudhishthira), he said to himself, 'Let not\r\npeople say that I am afraid of proceeding towards Arjuna.' Reflecting\r\nrepeatedly on this, Satyaki, that hero invincible in battle, that bull\r\namong men, said these words unto king Yudhishthira the just, 'If thou\r\nthinkest that these arrangements will suffice for thy protection, O\r\nmonarch, I will then do thy bidding and follow Vibhatsu. I tell thee\r\ntruly, O king, that there is none in the three worlds who is dearer to me\r\nthan Phalguna. I will follow in his track at the command, O giver of\r\nhonours. There is nothing that I will not do for thy sake. O best of men,\r\nthe commands of my preceptor are always of weight with me. But thy\r\ncommands are still weightier with me, O lord! Thy brothers, viz., Krishna\r\nand Dhananjaya, are always engaged in doing what is agreeable to thee.\r\nTaking thy command on my head for the sake of Arjuna, O lord, I will\r\nproceed, O bull among men, piercing through this impenetrable host.\r\nDarting wrathfully through this force of Drona, like a fish through the\r\nsea, I will go thither, O monarch, where king Jayadratha, depending upon\r\nhis troops, stayeth, in fear of the son of Pandu, protected by those\r\nforemost of car-warriors, viz., Drona's son Karna and Kripa! The distance\r\nfrom here, O king, is three Yojanas. I think, of that spot where Partha\r\nstayeth, ready to slay Jayadratha! But though Partha is three Yojanas\r\ndistant I shall yet follow in his track with a stout heart, and stay with\r\nhim, O king, till Jayadratha's slaughter. What man is there that goes to\r\nbattle without the commands of his superiors? And when one is commanded,\r\nO king, as I have been by thee, who is there like me that would not\r\nfight? I know that place whither I shall have to go, O lord! Teeming as\r\nthis ocean-like host doth with ploughshare and darts and maces and\r\nshields and scimitars and swords and lances and foremost of shafts, I\r\nwill today agitate this ocean. This elephant division, consisting of a\r\nthousand elephants, that thou seest, all belonging to the breed known by\r\nthe name of Anjana and all endued with great prowess, which are all\r\nmounted by a large number of Mlecchas, delighting in battle and\r\naccomplished in smiting,--these elephants, O king, that are shedding\r\ntheir juicy secretions like rain-pouring clouds,--these never retreat if\r\nurged forward by those upon their backs. They cannot be vanquished, O\r\nking, unless they are slaughtered. Then again, those car-warriors\r\nnumbering thousands., that thou seest, are all of royal lineage and are\r\nall Maharathas. They are called Rukmarathas.[149] They are accomplished\r\nin weapons and battling from cars, as also in fighting from the backs of\r\nelephants. O monarch! Thorough masters of the science of weapons, they\r\nare accomplished in fighting with their fists. Skilled in battling with\r\nmaces, masters also of the art of close fight, they are equally clever in\r\nstriking with scimitars and in falling upon the foe with sword and\r\nshield. They are brave and learned, and animated by a spirit of rivalry.\r\nEvery day, O king, they vanquish a vast number of men in battle. They are\r\ncommanded by Karna and devoted to Duhsasana. Even Vasudeva applauds them\r\nas great car-warriors. Always solicitous of Karna's welfare, they are\r\nobedient to him. It is at Karna's command, O king, that returning from\r\ntheir pursuit of Arjuna and, therefore, unfatigued and unworn, those\r\nbrave warriors, cased in impenetrable armour and armed with strong bows,\r\nare certainly waiting for me, ordered by Duryodhana also. Crushing them\r\nin battle for thy good, O Katirava, I shall then follow in the track of\r\nSavyasachin. Those other elephants, O king, seven hundred in number, that\r\nthou seest, all cased in armour and ridden by Kiratas, and decked with\r\nornaments, the king of the Kiratas, desirous of his life, had formerly\r\npresented to Savyasachin together with many servants in their train.\r\nThese, O king, were formerly employed in doing thy business. Behold the\r\nvicissitudes that time brings about, for these are now battling against\r\nthee. Those elephants are ridden by Kiratas difficult of defeat in\r\nbattle. They are accomplished in fighting from elephants, and are all\r\nsprung from the race of Agni. Formerly, they were all vanquished in\r\nbattle by Savyasachin. They are now waiting for me carefully, under the\r\norders of Duryodhana. Slaying with my shafts, O king, these Kiratas\r\ndifficult of defeat in battle, I shall follow in the track of Arjuna who\r\nis intent on the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus. Those (other)\r\nhuge elephants, sprung from the race of Arjuna, of impenetrable hides,\r\nwell-trained, and adorned, and from whose mouths the juicy secretions are\r\ntrickling down, and which are well-adorned with armour made wholly of\r\ngold are very formidable in battle and resemble Airavata himself. They\r\nhave come from the northern hills, and are ridden by fierce robbers that\r\nare of strong limbs, that are all foremost of warriors, and that are\r\ncased in steel coats of mail. There, amongst them, are persons born of\r\nthe cow, or the ape, or of diverse other creatures, including those born\r\nof men. That division of the assembled Mlecchas that are all sinful and\r\nthat come from the fastnesses of Himavat, seem at a distance to be of\r\nsmoky colour. Obtaining these, and countless Kshatriyas, as also Kripa\r\nand that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona and the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, and the Karna, he thinks lightly of the Pandavas. Impelled by\r\nfate, he regards himself crowned with success. Those I have named will,\r\nhowever, today be within reach of my arrows. They shall not escape me, O\r\nson of Kunti, even if they be endued with the speed of the mind. Much\r\nregarded always by Duryodhana, that prince who dependeth upon the prowess\r\nof others, those warriors, afflicted with my clouds of shafts, will meet\r\nwith destruction. Those other car-warriors, O king, whom thou seest, and\r\nwho have golden standards and are difficult of being resisted, are called\r\nKamvojas. They are brave and accomplished, and firmly devoted to the\r\nscience of weapons. Desiring one another's welfare they are all firmly\r\nunited. They constitute a full Akshauhini of wrathful warriors, O\r\nBharata, and are staying carefully for my sake, well-protected by the\r\nKuru heroes. They are on the alert, O king, with their eyes on me. I\r\nshall certainly destroy them all, like fire destroying a heap of straw.\r\nTherefore, O king, let those that equip cars, place quivers and all\r\nnecessaries on my car in proper places. Indeed, in such a dreadful\r\nbattle, diverse kinds of weapons ought to be taken. Let the car be\r\nequipped (with necessaries) five times more than what professors of\r\nmilitary science direct, for I shall have to encounter the Kamvojas who\r\nresemble fierce snakes of virulent poison. I shall have also to encounter\r\nthe Kiratas who are armed with diverse weapons of warfare, who resemble\r\nvirulent poison, who are accomplished in smiting, who have always been\r\nwell-treated by Duryodhana, and who on that account are always intent on\r\nDuryodhana's welfare. I shall also have to encounter the Sakas endued\r\nwith prowess equal to that of Sakra himself, who are fierce as tire, and\r\ndifficult to put out like a blazing conflagration. Indeed, O king, I\r\nshall have to encounter in battle many warriors difficult of being\r\nresisted. For this let well-known steeds of best breed and graced with\r\nauspicious marks be yoked to my car, after causing their thirst to be\r\nslaked and after grooming them duly!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'After this, Yudhishthira caused quivers full of\r\nshafts, and diverse kinds o weapons, and, indeed, all necessaries, to be\r\nplaced on Satyaki's car. Then, people caused his four well-harnessed and\r\nexcellent steeds to drink and walk, bathe and eat, and having adorned\r\nthem with golden chains and plucked out their arrows, those animals, that\r\nhad (for these operations) been freed from the yoke, and that were of the\r\nhue of gold and well-trained and endued with great speed and cheerful and\r\nexceedingly docile, were duly yoked again unto his car. And upon that car\r\nwas set up a tall standard bearing a lion of golden maces. And that\r\nstandard had attached round it banners of the hue of white clouds and\r\ndecked with gold was also placed upon that vehicle bearing a heavy weight\r\nof weapons. After those steeds, adorned with trappings of gold, had been\r\nyoked to that car, the younger brother of Daruka, who was the charioteer\r\nand the dear friend of Satyaki, came and represented unto the latter that\r\nthe car had been duly equipped, like Matali representing the equipment of\r\nthe car unto Vasava himself. Satyaki then, having taken a bath and\r\npurified himself and undergone every auspicious ceremony, gave nishkas of\r\ngold unto a thousand Snataka Brahmanas who uttered benedictions upon him.\r\nBlessed with those benedictions Satyaki that foremost of handsome men,\r\nthat hero worthy of worship, having drunk kairata, honey, shone\r\nresplendent, with reddened eyes rolling in intoxication. Having touched a\r\nbrazen mirror and filled with great joy, his energy became doubled, and\r\nhimself looked like a blazing fire. Taking upon his shoulders his bow\r\nwith arrows, that foremost of car-warriors, eased in armour and decked in\r\nornaments, had the regenerate ones perform for him the rites of\r\npropitiation. And fair maidens honoured him by showering upon him fried\r\npaddy and perfumes and floral garlands. And the hero then, with joined\r\nhands, worshipped the feet of Yudhishthira, and the latter smelt his\r\nhead. And having undergone all these rites, he then mounted his foremost\r\nof cars. Then those steeds, cheerful and strong and fleet as the wind,\r\nand invincible, and belonging to the Sindhu breed, bore him on that\r\ntriumphant car. Similarly, Bhimasena also, honoured by king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, and reverentially saluting the monarch, set out with Satyaki.\r\nBeholding those two chastisers of foes on the point of penetrating thy\r\nhost, their enemies, viz., thy troops, all stood still with Drona at\r\ntheir head. Then Satyaki, seeing Bhima cased in mail and following him,\r\nsaluted that hero and spoke unto him these delightful words. Indeed,\r\nheroic Satyaki, with every limb filled with joy, said unto Bhima, 'Do\r\nthou, O Bhima, protect the king. Even this is thy duty above all things.\r\nPiercing through this host whose hour hath come. I will proceed. Whether\r\nnow or hence, the protection of the king is thy highest duty. Thou\r\nknowest my prowess, thou desirest my good, return, O Bhima!' Thus\r\naddressed by Satyaki, Bhima replied, Go then, for the success of thy\r\nobject. O best of men, I will protect the king.' Thus addressed, he of\r\nMadhu's race answered Bhima, saying, 'Go back, O son of Pritha! My\r\nsuccess is certain, since won over by my merits, thus, O Bhima, art today\r\nobedient to my wishes. Indeed, O Bhima, as these auspicious omens tell\r\nme, my victory is assured. After the sinful ruler of the Sindhus has been\r\nslain by the high-souled son of Pandu, I shall embrace king Yudhishthira\r\nof virtuous soul.' Having said these words unto Bhima and dismissing him\r\nwith an embrace that illustrious warrior eyed thy troops, like a tiger\r\neyeing a herd of deer. Beholding him thus looking at thy army, O king,\r\nthy troops become once more stupefied and began to tremble violently.\r\nThen, O king, Satyaki desirous of seeing Arjuna at the command of king\r\nYudhishthira the just, suddenly dashed against thy troops.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'O king, when Yuyudhana, from desire of battle proceeded\r\nagainst thy troops, king Yudhishthira, surrounded by his forces, followed\r\nYuyudhana for reaching the car of Drona. Then the son of the king of the\r\nPanchalas, viz., the invincible warrior Dhrishtadyumna, the king\r\nVasudana, both loudly exclaimed with the Pandava host, 'Come, smite\r\nquickly, and rush against the foe, so that Satyaki, that warrior\r\ninvincible battle, in might pass easily (through the Kaurava host). Many\r\nmighty car-warriors will struggle for vanquishing him.' The great\r\ncar-warriors (of the Pandava army). saying this, fell impetuously upon\r\ntheir foes. Indeed, they all rushed, saying, 'We will vanquish those that\r\nwill endeavour to vanquish Satyaki.' Then a loud uproar was heard about\r\nthe car of Satyaki. Thy son's host, however, covered with Satyaki's\r\nshafts, fled away. Indeed, O king that host was broken into a hundred\r\nstruggling bodies by him of the Satwata race. And while that force was\r\nbreaking, that mighty car-warrior, viz., the (grandson) of Sini, crushed\r\nseven heroic and great bowmen in the front rank of the foe. And, O\r\nmonarch, with his shafts that resembled blazing flames of fire, he\r\ndespatched many other heroes, kings of diverse realms, unto the region of\r\nYama. He sometimes pierced a hundred warriors with one shaft, and\r\nsometimes one warrior with a hundred shafts. Like the great Rudra\r\ndestroying creatures, he slew elephant-riders and car-warriors with\r\nsteeds and drivers. None amongst thy troops ventured to advance against\r\nSatyaki who was displaying such lightness of hand and who showered such\r\nclouds of shafts. Struck with panic and crushed grounded thus by that\r\nhero of long arms, those brave warriors all left the field at the sight\r\nof that proud hero. Although alone, they saw him multiplied manifold, and\r\nwere stupefied by his energy. And the earth looked exceedingly beautiful\r\nwith crushed cars and broken nidas,[150] O sire, and wheels and fallen\r\numbrellas and standards and anukarshas, and banners, and headgears decked\r\nwith gold, and human arms smeared with sandal-paste and adorned with\r\nAngadas, O king, and human thighs, resembling trunks of elephants or the\r\ntapering bodies of snakes, and faces, beautiful as the moon and decked\r\nwith ear-rings, of large-eyed warriors lying all about the field. And the\r\nground there looked exceedingly beautiful with the huge bodies of fallen\r\nelephants, cut off in diverse ways, like a large plain strewn with hills.\r\nCrushed by that hero of long arms, steeds, deprived of life and fallen\r\ndown on the ground, looked beautiful in their traces made of burnished\r\ngold and decked with rows of pearls, and in their carcasses of handsome\r\nmake and design. Having slain diverse kinds of thy troops, he of the\r\nSatwata race entered into thy host, agitating and routing thy army. Then\r\nSatyaki desired to go by that very track by which Dhananjaya had gone\r\nbefore him. Then Drona came and resisted him. Encountering the son of\r\nBharadwaja, Yuyudhana., filled with rage, stopped not like a vast expanse\r\nof water upon encountering on embankment. Drona, however, checking in\r\nthat battle the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, pierced him with five keen\r\nshafts, capable of penetrating into the very vitals. Satyaki, however, O\r\nking, in that battle pierced Drona with seven shafts whetted on stone,\r\nequipped with golden wings and the feathers of the Kanka and the peacock.\r\nThen Drona, afflicted Satyaki, his steeds and the drivers, with six\r\nshafts. The mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana could not brook that feat of\r\nDrona. Uttering a leonine shout, he then pierced Drona with ten shafts,\r\nand then with six, and then with eight others. And once more Yuyudhana\r\npierced Drona with ten shafts, his charioteer with one and his four\r\nsteeds with four. And with another shaft, O sire, Satyaki struck Drona's\r\nstandard. Then, Drona speedily covered Satyaki, his car, steeds, driver,\r\nand standard, with swiftly coursing shafts, countless in number like a\r\nflight of locusts. Similarly, Yuyudhana fearlessly covered Drona with\r\ncountless shafts of great speed. Then Drona, addressing Yuyudhana, said,\r\n'Thy preceptor (Arjuna) hath, like a coward, gone away, leaving the\r\nbattle, avoiding me who was fighting with him, proceeding by my flank. O\r\nthou of Madhu's race, if like thy preceptor, thou too dost not quickly\r\navoid me in this battle, thou shalt not escape me with life today,\r\nengaged as I am in battle with thee.\r\n\r\n\"Satyaki, hearing these words, answered, 'At the command of king\r\nYudhishthira the just, I shall follow in the track of Dhananjaya. Blessed\r\nbe thou, O Brahmana, I would lose time (if I fight with thee). A disciple\r\nshould always tread in the way trod by his preceptor. I shall, therefore\r\nfollow in the track that has been trod by my preceptor.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said this much, the grandson of Sini avoided\r\nthe preceptor and suddenly proceeded onwards, O king! And addressing his\r\ncharioteer, he said, 'Drona will, by every means, endeavour to check my\r\nprogress. Proceed carefully, O Suta, in battle and listen to these grave\r\nwords of mine. Yonder is seen the host of great splendour of Avantis.\r\nNext to them, is the mighty host of the Southerners. And next to it, is\r\nthe great host of the Valhikas. By the side of the Valhikas, stands\r\nresolved for fight the mighty host commanded by Karna. O charioteer, all\r\nthese hosts are different from one another, but relying upon one another,\r\nthey protect one another on the field of battle. Arrived at the space\r\nleft open between these divisions cheerfully urge thou the steed. Indeed,\r\nO charioteer, bear me thither, making the steeds adopt a tolerable\r\nspeed,--thither, that is, where are seen the Valhikas with diverse\r\nweapons uplifted in their arms, and the countless Southerners headed by\r\nthe Suta's son and whose division is seen to present a serried array of\r\nelephants and steeds and cars and in which stand foot-soldiers from\r\nvarious realm.' Having said this much unto his driver, avoiding the\r\nBrahmana (Drona), he proceeded, telling his charioteer, Pass through the\r\nopen space between those two divisions towards the fierce and mighty host\r\nof Karna.' Drona, however, excited with wrath, pursued him from behind,\r\nshooting at him countless shafts. Indeed, the preceptor closely followed\r\nhighly blessed Yuyudhana who advanced without any desire of turning back.\r\nSmiting the great host of Karna with whetted arrows, Satyaki penetrated\r\ninto the vast and limitless army of the Bharatas. When Yuyudhana,\r\nhowever, entered the army, the troops (opposed to him) fled away. At\r\nthis, wrathful Kritavarman came forward to resist Satyaki. The valiant\r\nSatyaki striking the advancing Kritavarman with six shafts, quickly slew\r\nhis four steeds with four other shafts. And once again, he pierced\r\nKritavarman in the centre of the chest with four other shafts. And once\r\nagain, he pierced Kritavarman in the centre of the chest with sixteen\r\nstraight shafts of great speed. Thus encountered; O monarch; with many\r\nshafts of fierce energy by him of the Satwata race, Kritavarman was\r\nunable to brook it. Aiming then a calf-toothed shaft resembling a shake\r\nof virulent poison and endued With the speed of the wind, and drawing the\r\nbow-string, O monarch, to his ear, he pierced Satyaki in the chest. That\r\nshaft, equipped with beautiful feathers, penetrating through his armour\r\nand body, and dyed in blood, entered the earth. Then, O king,\r\nKritavarman, that warrior equipped with the highest weapons, shooting\r\nmany shafts, cut off the bow of Satyaki with arrows fixed thereon. And\r\nexcited with rage, he then, in that battle, O king, pierced Satyaki of\r\nunbaffled prowess in the centre of the chest with ten shafts of great\r\nkeenness. Upon his bow being broken, the foremost of mighty men, viz.,\r\nSatyaki, hurled a dart at the right arm of Kritavarman. And taking up and\r\ndrawing a tougher bow, Yuyudhana quickly shot at his foe, shafts by\r\nhundreds and thousands and entirely shrouded Kritavarman and his car with\r\nthat arrowy downpour. Having thus shrouded the son of Hridika, O monarch,\r\nin that battle, Satyaki cut of, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of\r\nhis foe's charioteer from his trunk. The charioteer of Hridika's son\r\nthen, thus slain, fell down from that great car. At this, the steeds of\r\nKritavarman, deprived of a driver, ran away with great speed. The ruler\r\nof the Bhojas, then, in great agitation, himself checked those steeds.\r\nThat heroic warrior then, bow in hand, stood upon his car (ready for\r\nbattle). Beholding this feat, his troops applauded it highly. Resting for\r\na short space of time, Kritavarman then urged those good steeds of his.\r\nHimself devoid of fear, he inspired his foes with great fear. Satyaki,\r\nhowever, had by that time, left him behind, while Kritavarman himself now\r\nrushed against Bhimasena without pursuing Satyaki. Thus issuing out of\r\nthe division of the Bhojas, Satyaki proceeded with great speed towards\r\nthe mighty division of the Kamvojas. Resisted there by many brave and\r\nmighty car-warriors, Yuyudhana, of prowess incapable of being thwarted,\r\ncould not then, O monarch, proceed a step. Meanwhile, Drona, having\r\nplaced his troops in a proper position and made over the burthen of their\r\nprotection to the ruler of the Bhojas, firmly resolved, proceeded with\r\ngreat speed towards Yuyudhana from desire of battle. Then the foremost\r\nwarriors of the Pandava host, beholding Drona thus pursuing Yuyudhana\r\nfrom behind, cheerfully began to resist him. The Panchalas, however, who\r\nwere headed by Bhimasena, having approached the son of Hridika, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, all became cheerless. The heroic Kritavarman, O\r\nking, displaying his prowess, resisted all those warriors who, although\r\nthey had become a little heartless, struggled yet with great vigour.\r\nFearlessly he weakened, by means of his arrowy showers, the animals of\r\nhis foes. The brave warriors, however, (of the Pandava army), though thus\r\nafflicted by the ruler of the Bhojas, stood, like high-born soldiers that\r\nthey were, resolved to fight with the division of the Bhojas itself, from\r\na desire of great renown.'\""

Having been\r\nexamined duly, they have been entertained on pay and not for the sake of\r\nlineage, nor from favour, nor from relationship. They are not a rabble\r\ncome of their own accord, nor have they been admitted into my army\r\nwithout pay. My army consists of well-born and respectable men, who are,\r\nagain, contented, well-fed, and submissive. They are sufficiently\r\nrewarded. They are all famous and endued with great intelligence. They\r\nare, again, O son, protected by many of our foremost counsellors and\r\nothers of righteous deeds, all of whom are best of men, resembling the\r\nvery Regents of the world. Innumerable rulers of earth, seeking to do\r\nwhat is agreeable to us, and who have of their own well sided with us\r\nwith their forces and followers, also protect them. Indeed, our army is\r\nlike the vast ocean filled with the waters of innumerable rivers running\r\nfrom all directions. It abounds in steeds and cars which, though\r\ndestitute of wings, still resemble the winged tenants of the air. It\r\nseems also with elephants adorned whose cheeks flow with juicy\r\nsecretions. What can it, therefore, be but Destiny that even such an army\r\nshould be slain? (Ocean-like it is) vast number of combatants constitute\r\nits interminable waters, and the steeds and other animals constitute its\r\nterrible waves. Innumerable swords and maces and darts and arrows and\r\nlances constitute the oars (plied on that ocean).[152] Abounding in\r\nstandards and ornaments, the pearls and gems (of the warriors) constitute\r\nthe lotuses that deck it. The rushing steeds and elephants constitute the\r\nwinds that agitate it into fury. Drona constitutes the fathomless cave of\r\nthat ocean, Kritavarman its vast vortex. Jalasandha its mighty alligator,\r\nand Karna the rise of the moon that makes it swell with energy and pride.\r\nWhen that bull amongst the Pandavas, on his single car, hath speedily\r\ngone, piercing through that army of mine vast (though it be) like the\r\nocean, and when Yuyudhana also hath followed him, I do not, O Sanjaya,\r\nsee the prospect of even a remnant of my troops being left alive by\r\nSavyasachin, and that foremost of car-warriors belonging to the Satwata\r\nrace. Beholding those two exceedingly active heroes pierce through (the\r\ndivisions placed in the van), and seeing the ruler of the Sindhus also\r\nwithin reach of the shafts from Gandiva, what, indeed, was the measure\r\nadopted by the Kaurava impelled by fate? At that time, when all were\r\nfighting intently, what became of them? O sire, I regard the assembled\r\nKurus to be overtaken by Death himself. Indeed, their prowess also in\r\nbattle is no longer seen to be what it once was. Krishna and the son of\r\nPandu have both entered the (Kuru) host unwounded. There is none in that\r\nhost, O Sanjaya, capable of resisting them. Many combatants that are\r\ngreat car-warriors were admitted by us after examination. They are all\r\nhonoured (by us) with pay as each deserves, and others with agreeable\r\nspeeches. There is none, O son, amongst my troops who is not honoured\r\nwith good offices (done to him). Each receives his assigned pay and\r\nrations according to the character of his services. In my army, O\r\nSanjaya, there is none who is unskilled in battle, none who receives pay\r\nless than what he deserves, or none who does not receive any pay. The\r\nsoldiers are adored by me, according to the best of my powers, with gifts\r\nand honours and seats. The same conduct is followed towards them by my\r\nsons, my kinsmen, and my friends. Yet on the very approach of\r\nSavyasachin, have they been vanquished by him and by the grandson of\r\nSini. What can it be but Destiny? They who are protecting them, all\r\nfollow the same road, the protected with the protectors! Beholding Arjuna\r\narrived at the front of Jayadratha, what measure was adopted by my\r\nfoolish son? Beholding Satyaki also entering the host, what step did\r\nDuryodhana think suitable to that occasion? Indeed, beholding those two\r\nforemost of car-warriors who are beyond the touch of all weapons, enter\r\nmy host, what resolution was formed by my warriors in battle? I think,\r\nbeholding Krishna of Dasarha's race and that bull of Sini's race also\r\nboth engaged for Arjuna's sake my sons are filled with grief. I think,\r\nseeing both Satwata and Arjuna pass through my army and the Kurus flying\r\naway, my sons are filled with grief. I think, seeing their car-warriors\r\nretreat in despair of subjugating the foe and set their hearts upon\r\nflying away from the field, my sons are filled with grief. Their steeds\r\nand elephants and cars and heroic combatants by thousands flying away\r\nfrom the field in anxiety, my sons are filled with grief I think, seeing\r\nmany huge elephants fly away, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna, and\r\nothers fallen and falling, my sons are filled with grief. I think, seeing\r\nsteeds deprived of riders and warriors deprived of cars by Satyaki and\r\nPartha, my sons are filled with grief. I think, large bodies of steeds\r\nslain or routed by Madhava and Partha, my sons are filled with grief. I\r\nthink, seeing large bodies of foot-soldiers flying away in all\r\ndirections, my sons, despairing of success, are filled with grief. I\r\nthink, seeing those two heroes pass through Drona's division unvanquished\r\nwithin a moment, my sons are filled with grief. Stupefied am I, O son,\r\nupon hearing that Krishna and Dhananjaya, those two heroes of unfading\r\nglory, have both, with Satwata, penetrated into my host. After that\r\nforemost of car-warriors among the Sinis, had entered my host, and after\r\nhe had passed through the division of the Bhojas, what did the Kauravas\r\ndo? Tell me also, O Sanjaya, how did the battle take place there where\r\nDrona afflicted the Pandavas on the field. Drona is endued with great\r\nmight, is the foremost of all persons, is accomplished in weapons, and is\r\nincapable of being defeated in battle. How could the Panchalas pierce\r\nthat great bowman in the fight? Desirous of Dhananjaya's victory, the\r\nPanchalas are inveterate foes of Drona. The mighty car-warrior Drona also\r\nis an inveterate foe of theirs. Thou art skilled in a narration, O\r\nSanjaya! Tell me, therefore, everything about what Arjuna did for\r\ncompassing the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'O bull of Bharata's race, overtaken by a calamity that is\r\nthe direct result of thy own fault, thou shouldst not, O hero, indulge in\r\nsuch lamentations like an ordinary person. Formerly, many of thy wise\r\nwell-wishers, numbering Vidura amongst them, had told thee, 'Do not, O\r\nking, abandon the sons of Pandu.' Thou didst not then heed those words.\r\nThe man that heedeth not the counsels of well-wishing friends, weepeth,\r\nfalling into great distress, like thyself. He of Dasarha's race, O king,\r\nhad formerly begged thee for peace. For all that, Krishna of world-wide\r\nfame, obtained not his prayer. Ascertaining thy worthlessness, and thy\r\njealousy towards the Pandavas, and understanding also thy crooked\r\nintentions towards the sons of Pandu, and hearing thy delirious\r\nlamentations, O best of kings, that puissant Lord of all the worlds, that\r\nBeing, acquainted with the truth of everything in all the worlds, viz.,\r\nVasudeva, then caused the flame of war to blaze forth among the Kurus.\r\nThis great and wholesale destruction hath come upon thee, brought about\r\nby thy own fault. O giver of honours, it behoveth thee not to impute the\r\nfault to Duryodhana. In the development of these incidents no merit of\r\nthine is to be seen in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. This\r\ndefeat is entirely owing to thee. Therefore, knowing as thou dost the\r\ntruth about this world, be quiet and hear how this fierce battle,\r\nresembling that between the gods and the Asuras, took place. After the\r\ngrandson of Sini, that warrior of prowess incapable of being baffled, had\r\nentered into thy host, the Parthas headed by Bhimasena also rushed\r\nagainst thy troops. The mighty car-warrior Kritavarman, however, alone,\r\nresisted, in that battle the Pandavas thus rushing in fury and wrath with\r\ntheir followers against thy host. As the continent resists the surgings,\r\neven so did the son of Hridika resist the troops of the Pandavas in that\r\nbattle. The prowess that we then beheld of the son of Hridika was\r\nwonderful, inasmuch as the united Parthas succeeded not in transgressing\r\nhis single self. Then the mighty-armed Bhima, piercing Kritavarman with\r\nthree shafts, blew his conch, gladdening all the Pandavas. Then Sahadeva\r\npierced the son of Hridika with twenty shafts, and Yudhishthira the just\r\npierced him with five and Nakula pierced him with a hundred. And the sons\r\nof Draupadi pierced him with three and seventy shafts, Ghatotkacha\r\npierced him with seven. And Virata and Drupada and Drupada's son\r\n(Dhrishtadyumna) each Pierced him with five shafts, and Sikhandin, having\r\nonce pierced him with five, again pierced him smilingly with five and\r\ntwenty shafts. Then Kritavarman, O king, pierced every one of those great\r\ncar-warriors with five shafts, and Bhima again with seven. And the son of\r\nHridika felled both the bow and the standard of Bhima from the latter's\r\ncar. Then that mighty car-warrior, with great speed, wrathfully struck\r\nBhima, whose bow had been cut off with seventy keen shafts in the chest.\r\nThen mighty Bhima, deeply pierced with those excellent shafts of\r\nHridika's son, trembled on his car like a mountain during an earthquake.\r\nBeholding Bhimasena in that condition, the Parthas headed by king\r\nYudhishthira the just afflicted Kritavarman, O king, shooting at him many\r\nshafts. Encompassing that warrior there with throngs of cars, O sire,\r\nthey cheerfully began to pierce him with their shafts, desiring to\r\nprotect the Wind-god's son in that battle. Then mighty Bhimasena\r\nrecovering consciousness, took up in that battle a dart made of steel and\r\nequipped with a golden staff, and hurled it with great speed from his own\r\ncar at the car of Kritavarman. That dart resembling a snake freed from\r\nits slough, hurled from Bhima's hands, fierce-looking, blazed forth as it\r\nproceeded towards Kritavarman. Beholding that dart endued with the\r\nsplendour of the Yuga-fire coursing towards him, the son of Hridika cut\r\nit in twain with two shafts. Thereupon, that dart decked with gold, thus\r\ncut off, fell down on the earth, illumining the ten points of the\r\ncompass, O king, like a large meteor falling from the firmament. Seeing\r\nhis dart baffled, Bhima blazed forth in wrath. Then taking tip another\r\nbow which was tougher and whose twang was louder, Bhimasena, filled with\r\nwrath, attacked the son of Hridika in that battle. Then O king, Bhima, of\r\nterrible might, struck Kritavarman, in the centre of the chest with five\r\nshafts, in consequence of thy evil policy, O monarch! The ruler of the\r\nBhoja then, mangled in every limb, O sire, by Bhimasena, shone\r\nresplendent in the field like a red Asoka covered with flowers. Then that\r\nmighty bowman, viz., Kritavarman, filled with rage, smilingly struck\r\nBhimasena with three shafts, and having struck him forcibly, pierced in\r\nreturn every one of those great car-warriors struggling vigorously in\r\nbattle, with three shafts. Each of the latter then pierced him in return\r\nwith seven shafts. Then that mighty car-warrior of the Satwata race,\r\nfilled with rage, cut off, smiling in that battle, with a razor-faced\r\nshaft the bow of Sikhandin. Sikhandin then, seeing his bow cut off,\r\nquickly took up a sword and a bright shield decked with a hundred moons.\r\nWhirling his large shield, decked with gold, Sikhandin sent that sword\r\ntowards the car of Kritavarman. That large sword, cutting off, O king,\r\nKritavarman's bow with arrow fixed thereon, fell down on the earth, like.\r\nO monarch, a bright luminary loosened from the firmament. Meanwhile,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors quickly and deeply pierced Kritavarman with\r\ntheir shafts in that battle. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz.,\r\nthe son of Hridika, casting off, that broken bow, and taking up another,\r\npierced each of the Pandavas with three straight shafts. And he pierced\r\nSikhandin at first with three, and then with five shafts. Then the\r\nillustrious Sikhandin, taking up another bow, checked the son of Hridika\r\nwith many swift-flying shafts, furnished with heads like tortoise nails.\r\nThen, O king, the son of Hridika, inflamed with rage in that battle,\r\nrushed impetuously at that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of\r\nYajnasena, that warrior, O monarch, who was the cause of the illustrious\r\nBhishma's fall in battle. Indeed, the heroic Kritavarman rushed at\r\nSikhandin, displaying his might, like a tiger at an elephant. Then those\r\ntwo chastisers of foes, who resembled a couple of huge elephants or two\r\nblazing fires, encountered each other with clouds of shafts. And they\r\ntook their best of bows and aimed their arrows, and shot them in hundreds\r\nlike a couple of suns shedding their rays. And those two mighty\r\ncar-warriors scorched each other with their keen shafts, and shone\r\nresplendent like two Suns appearing at the end of the Yuga. And\r\nKritavarman in that battle pierced that mighty car-warrior viz.,\r\nYajnasena's son, with three and seventy shafts and once more with seven.\r\nDeeply pierced therewith, Sikhandin sat down in pain on the terrace of\r\nhis car, throwing aside his bow and arrows, and was overtaken by a swoon.\r\nBeholding that hero in a swoon, thy troops, O bull among men, worshipped\r\nthe son of Hridika, and waved their garments in the air. Seeing Sikhandin\r\nthus afflicted with the shafts of Hridika's son his charioteer quickly\r\nbore that mighty car-warrior away from the battle. The Parthas, beholding\r\nSikhandin lying senseless on the terrace of his car, soon encompassed\r\nKritavarman in that battle with crowds of cars. The mighty car-warrior,\r\nKritavarman, then achieved a most wonderful feat there, inasmuch as,\r\nalone, he held in check all the Parthas with their followers. Having thus\r\nvanquished the Parthas, that mighty car-warrior then vanquished the\r\nChedis, the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, and the Kekayas, all of whom are\r\nendued with great prowess. The forces of the Pandavas then, thus\r\nslaughtered by the son of Hridika began to run in all directions, unable\r\nto stay coolly in battle. Having vanquished the sons of Pandu headed by\r\nBhimasena himself, the son of Hridika stayed in battle like a blazing\r\nfire. Those mighty car-warriors, afflicted with torrents of shafts and\r\nrouted by Hridika's son in battle, ventured not to face him.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen with undivided attention, O king. After the rout\r\nof that force by the high-souled son of Hridika, and upon the Parthas\r\nbeing humiliated with shame and thy troops elated with joy, he that\r\nbecame protector of the Pandavas who were solicitous of protection while\r\nsinking in that fathomless sea of distress, that hero, viz., the grandson\r\nof Sini, hearing that fierce uproar, of thy army in that terrible fight,\r\nquickly turned back and proceeded against Kritavarman. Hridika's son,\r\nKritavarman, then excited with wrath, covered the grandson of Sini with\r\nclouds of sharp shafts. At this, Satyaki also became filled with rage.\r\nThe grandson of Sini then quickly sped at Kritavarman a sharp and\r\nbroad-headed arrow in the encounter and then four other arrows. These\r\ntour arrows slew the steeds of Kritavarman, and the other cut off\r\nKritavarman's bow. Then Satyaki pierced the charioteer of his foe and\r\nthose that protected the latter's rear, with many keen shafts, to afflict\r\nhis antagonist's forces. The hostile division then, afflicted with\r\nSatyaki's arrows, broke down. Thereupon, Satyaki of prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, quickly proceeded on his way. Hear now, O king, what that\r\nhero of great valour then did unto thy troops. Having, O monarch, forded\r\nthe ocean constituted by Drona's division, and filled with joy at having\r\nvanquished Kritavarman in battle, that hero then addressed his\r\ncharioteer, saying, 'Proceed slowly without fear.' Beholding, however,\r\nthat army of thine that abounded with cars, steeds, elephants and\r\nfoot-soldiers, Satyaki once more told his charioteer, 'That large\r\ndivision which thou seest on left of Drona's host, and which looks dark\r\nas the clouds, consists of the elephants (of the foe). Rukmaratha is its\r\nleader. Those elephants are many, O charioteer, and are difficult of\r\nbeing resisted in battle. Urged by Duryodhana, they wait for me, prepared\r\nto cast away their lives. All those combatants are of princely birth, and\r\ngreat bowmen, and capable of displaying great prowess in battle,\r\nbelonging to the country of the Trigartas, they are all illustrious\r\ncar-warriors, owning standards decked with gold. Those brave warriors are\r\nwaiting, desirous of battle with me. Urge the steeds quickly, O\r\ncharioteer and take me thither. I shall fight with the Trigartas in the\r\nvery sight of Bharadwaja's son.' Thus addressed, the charioteer, obedient\r\nto Satwata's will, proceeded slowly. Upon that bright car of solar\r\neffulgence, equipped with standard, those excellent steeds harnessed\r\nthereto and perfectly obedient to the driver, endued with speed of the\r\nwind, white as the Kunda flower, or the moon, or silver, bore him (to\r\nthat spot). As he advanced to battle, drawn by those excellent steeds of\r\nthe hue of a conch, those brave warriors encompassed him on all sides\r\nwith their elephants, scattering diverse kinds of keen arrows capable of\r\neasily piercing everything. Satwata also fought with that elephant\r\ndivision, shooting his keen shafts, like a mighty cloud at the end of\r\nsummer pouring torrents of rain on a mountain breast. Those elephants\r\nslaughtered with those shafts, whose touch resembled thunder sped by that\r\nforemost one among the Sinis began to fly away from the field, their\r\ntusks broken, bodies covered with blood, heads and frontal globes split\r\nopen, ears and faces and trunks cut off, and themselves deprived of\r\nriders, and standards cut down, riders slain, and blankets loosened, ran\r\naway, O king, in all directions. Many amongst them, O monarch, mangled by\r\nSatwata with long shafts and calf-tooth-headed arrows and broad-headed\r\narrows and Anjalikas and razor-faced arrows and crescent-shaped ones fled\r\naway, with blood flowing down their bodies, and themselves ejecting urine\r\nand excreta and uttering loud and diverse cries, deep as the roar of\r\nclouds. And some amongst the others wandered, and some limped, and some\r\nfell down, and some became pale and cheerless. Thus afflicted by\r\nYuyudhana, with shafts that resembled the sun or fire, that elephant\r\ndivision fled away in all directions. After that elephant division was\r\nexterminated, the mighty Jalasandha, exerting himself coolly, led his\r\nelephant before Yuyudhana's car drawn by white steeds. Cased in golden\r\nAngadas, with ear-rings and diadem, armed with sword, smeared with red\r\nsandal-paste, his head encircled with a blazing chain of gold, his breast\r\ncovered with a cuirass, his neck adorned with a bright chain (of gold),\r\nthat hero of sinless soul, stationed on the heads of his elephant,\r\nshaking his bow decked with gold, looked resplendent, O king, like a\r\ncloud charged with lightning. Like the continent resisting the surging\r\nsea, Satyaki checked that excellent elephant of the ruler of the Magadhas\r\nthat approached him with such fury. Beholding the elephant checked by the\r\nexcellent shafts of Yuyudhana, the mighty Jalasandha became filled with\r\nrage. Then, O king, the enraged Jalasandha, pierced Sini's grandson on\r\nhis broad chest with some shafts of great force. With another sharp and\r\nwell tempered broad-headed arrow, he cut off the bow of the Vrishni hero\r\nwhile the latter was drawing it. And then, O Bharata, smiling the while,\r\nthe heroic ruler of the Magadhas pierced the bowless Satyaki with five\r\nkeen shafts. The valiant and mighty-armed Satyaki, however, though\r\npierced with many shafts by Jalasandha, trembled not in the least. All\r\nthis seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then mighty Yuyudhana without any\r\nfear, thought of the shafts (he should use). Taking up another bow,\r\naddressed Jalasandha, saying, 'Wait, Wait!' Saying this much, the\r\ngrandson of Sini deeply pierced Jalasandha on his broad breast with sixty\r\narrows, smiling the while. And with another razor-faced arrow of great\r\nsharpness he cut off Jalasandha's bow at the handle, and with three more\r\nshafts he pierced Jalasandha himself. Then Jalasandha, casting aside that\r\nbow of his with an arrow fixed thereon, hurled a lance, O sire, at\r\nSatyaki. That terrible lance, passing through the left arm of Madhava in\r\nfierce battle, entered the earth, like a hissing snake of gigantic\r\nproportion. And his left arm had thus been pierced. Satyaki, of prowess\r\nincapable of being baffled, struck Jalasandha with thirty keen shafts.\r\nThen mighty Jalasandha taking up his scimitar and large shield made of\r\nbull's hide and decked with a hundred moons whirled the former for a\r\nwhile and hurled it at Satwata. Cutting off the bow of Sini's grandson,\r\nthat scimitar fell down on the earth, and looked resplendent like a\r\ncircle of fire, as it lay on the earth. Then Yuyudhana took up another\r\nbow capable of piercing everybody, large as a Sala-offshoot, and of twang\r\nresembling the roar of Indra's thunder, and filled with rage, stretched\r\nin and then pierced Jalasandha with a single shaft. And then Satyaki,\r\nthat foremost one of Madhu's race, smiling the while, cut off, with a\r\npair of razor-faced arrows, the two arms, decked with ornaments, of\r\nJalasandha. Thereupon, those two arms, looking like a couple of spiked\r\nmaces, fell down from that foremost of elephants, like a couple of\r\nfive-headed snakes falling down from a Mountain. And then, with a third\r\nrazor-headed arrow, Satyaki cut off his antagonist's large head endued\r\nwith beautiful teeth and adorned with a pair of beautiful ear-rings. The\r\nheadless and armless trunk, of fearful aspect, dyed Jalasandha's elephant\r\nwith blood. Having slain Jalasandha, in battle, Satwata quickly felled\r\nthe wooden structure, O king, from that elephant's back. Bathed in blood,\r\nthe elephant of Jalasandha bore that costly seat, hanging down from his\r\nback. And afflicted with the arrows of Satwata, the huge beast crushed\r\nfriendly ranks as it ran wildly, uttering fierce cries of pain. Then, O\r\nsire, wails of woe arose among thy troops, at the sight of Jalasandha\r\nslain by that bull among the Vrishnis. Thy warriors then, turning their\r\nfaces, fled away in all directions. Indeed, despairing of success over\r\nthe foe, they set their hearts on flight. Mean. while, O king, Drona,\r\nthat foremost of all wielders of bows, approached the mighty car-warrior\r\nYuyudhana, borne by his swift coursers. Many bulls among the Kurus,\r\nbeholding Sini's grandson swelling (with rage-and pride), rushed at him\r\nwith fury, accompanied by Drona. Then commenced a battle, O king, between\r\nthe Kurus and Drona (on one side) and Yuyudhana (on the other), that\r\nresembled the awful battle of old between the gods and the Asuras.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Shooting clouds of arrows, all those warriors,\r\naccomplished in smiting, carefully, O monarch, encountered Yuyudhana.\r\nDrona struck him with seven and seventy shafts of great keenness. And\r\nDurmarshana struck him with a dozen, Duhsasana, struck him with ten\r\nshafts. And Vikarna also pierced him on the left side as also on the\r\ncentre of the chest with thirty keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers.\r\nAnd Durmukha struck him with ten shafts, and Duhsasana with eight,\r\nChitrasena, O sire, pierced him with a couple of shafts. And Duryodhana,\r\nO king, and many other heroes, afflicted that mighty car-warrior with\r\ndense showers of shafts in that battle. Though checked on all sides by\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, viz., thy sons, Yuyudhana of Vrishni's race\r\npierced each of them separately with his straight shafts. Indeed, he\r\npierced the son of Bharadwaja with three shafts, and Duhsasana with nine,\r\nand Vikarna with five and twenty, and Chitrasena with seven, and\r\nDurmarshana with a dozen, and Vivinsati with eight, and Satyavrata with\r\nnine, and Vijaya with ten shafts. And having pierced Rukmangada also that\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., Satyaki, shaking his bow, speedily proceeded\r\nagainst thy son (Duryodhana). And Yuyudhana, in the sight of all men,\r\ndeeply pierced with his arrows the king, that greatest of car-warriors in\r\nthe whole world. Then commenced a battle between those two. Both shooting\r\nkeen arrows and both aiming countless shafts, each of those mighty\r\ncar-warriors made the other invisible in that battle. And Satyaki,\r\npierced by the Kuru king, looked exceedingly resplendent as blood\r\ncopiously ran adown his body, like a sandal tree shedding its juicy\r\nsecretions. Thy son also pierced by Satwata with clouds of shafts, looked\r\nbeautiful like a stake set up (at a sacrifice) decked all over with gold.\r\nThen Madhava, O king, in that battle, cut off with razor-faced arrow,\r\nsmiling the while, the bow of the Kuru king. And then he pierced the\r\nbowless king with countless arrows. Pierced with arrows by that foe of\r\ngreat activity, the king could not brook this indication of the enemy's\r\nsuccess. Duryodhana then, taking up another formidable bow, the back of\r\nwhose staff was decked with gold, speedily pierced Satyaki with a hundred\r\narrows. Deeply pierced by thy mighty son armed with the bow, Yuyudhana\r\nbecame inflamed with wrath and began to afflict thy son. Beholding the\r\nking thus afflicted, thy sons, those mighty car-warriors, shrouded\r\nSatyaki with dense showers of arrows, shot with great force. Whilst being\r\nthus shrouded by those mighty car-warriors, viz., thy multitude of sons,\r\nYuyudhana pierced each of them with five arrows, and once more with\r\nseven. And soon he pierced Duryodhana with eight swift arrows and,\r\nsmiling the while, cut off the latter's bow that frightened all foes. And\r\nwith a few arrows he also felled the king's standard adorned with a\r\njewelled elephant. And slaying then the four steeds of Duryodhana with\r\nfour arrows, the illustrious Satyaki felled the king's charioteer with a\r\nrazor-faced shaft. Meanwhile, Yuyudhana, filled with joy, pierced the\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., the Kuru king, with many arrows capable of\r\npenetrating into the very vitals. Then, O king, thy son Duryodhana, while\r\nbeing thus struck in that battle with those excellent arrows of Sini's\r\ngrandson, suddenly fled away. And the king, quickly mounted the car of\r\nChitrasena, armed with the bow. Beholding the king thus attacked by\r\nSatyaki in battle, and reduced to the position of Soma in the firmament\r\nwhile seized by Rahu, cries of woe arose from every section of the Kuru\r\nhost. Hearing that uproar, the mighty car-warrior Kritavarman quickly\r\nproceeded to that spot where the puissant Madhava. was battling. And\r\nKritavarman proceeded, shaking his bow, and urging his steeds, and urging\r\nhis charioteer with the words, 'Go with speed, Go with speed!' Beholding\r\nKritavarman rushing towards him like the Destroyer himself with wide-open\r\nmouth, Yuyudhana, O king, addressed his driver, saying, 'That\r\nKritavarman, armed with arrows, is rushing in his car towards me with\r\nspeed. Then, with his steeds urged to their greatest speed, and on his\r\ncar duly equipped, Satyaki came upon the ruler of the Bhojas, the\r\nforemost of all bowmen. Then those two tigers among men, both inflamed\r\nwith rage, and both resembling fire encountered each other like two\r\ntigers endued with great activity. Kritavarman pierced Sini's grandson\r\nwith six and twenty whetted arrows of keen points, and the latter's\r\ndriver with five arrows. And skilled in battle, the son of Hridika\r\npierced, with four mighty shafts, the four excellent and well-broken\r\nsteeds of Satyaki that were of the Sindhu breed. Owning a standard decked\r\nwith gold, and adorned with golden mail, Kritavarman, shaking his\r\nformidable bow, whose staff was decked with gold, thus checked, Yuyudhana\r\nwith shafts equipped with golden wings. Then the grandson of Sini,\r\ndesirous of seeing Dhananjaya, sped with great activity eight arrows at\r\nKritavarman. That scorcher of foes, then, deeply pierced by that mighty\r\nfoe,--that invincible warrior,--began to tremble like a hill during an\r\nearthquake. After this, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled,\r\nspeedily pierced Kritavarman's four steeds with three and sixty keen\r\narrows, and his driver also with seven. Indeed, Satyaki, then aiming\r\nanother arrow of golden wings, that emitted blazing flames and resembled\r\nan angry snake, or the rod of the Destroyer himself, pierced Kritavarman.\r\nThat terrible arrow, penetrating through his antagonist's effulgent\r\narmour decked with gold, entered the earth, dyed with blood. Afflicted\r\nwith the shafts of Satwata, and bathed in blood in that battle,\r\nKritavarman throwing aside his bow with arrow, fell upon his car. That\r\nlion-toothed hero of immeasurable prowess, that bull among men, afflicted\r\nby Satyaki with his arrows, fell on his knees upon the terrace of his\r\ncar. Having thus resisted Kritavarman who resembled the thousand-armed\r\nArjuna of old, or Ocean himself of immeasurable might, Satyaki proceeded\r\nonwards. Passing through Kritavarman's division bristling with swords and\r\ndarts and bows, and abounding in elephants and steeds and cars, and out\r\nof the ground rendered awful in consequence of the blood shed by foremost\r\nKshatriyas numbering by hundreds, that bull among the Sinis proceeded\r\nonwards in the very sight of all the troops, like the slayer of Vritra\r\nthrough the Asura array. Meanwhile, the mighty son of Hridika, taking up\r\nanother huge bow, stayed where he was, resisting Pandavas in battle.'\""

The encounter that then took\r\nplace between Drona and Satwata in the very sight of all the troops was\r\nextremely fierce, like that between Vali and Vasava (in days of old).\r\nThen Drona pierced the grandson of Sini on the forehead with three\r\nbeautiful arrows made entirely of iron and resembling' snakes of virulent\r\npoison. Thus pierced on the forehead with those straight shafts,\r\nYuyudhana, O king, looked beautiful like a mountain with three summits.\r\nThe son of Bharadwaja always on the alert for an opportunity, then sped\r\nin that battle many other arrows of Satyaki which resembled the roar of\r\nIndra's thunder. Then he of Dasarha's race, acquainted with the highest\r\nweapons, cut off all those arrows shot from Drona's bow, with two\r\nbeautifully winged arrows of his. Beholding that lightness of hand (in\r\nSatyaki), Drona, O king, smiling the while, suddenly pierced that bull\r\namong the Sinis with thirty arrows. Surpassing by his own lightness the\r\nlightness of Yuyudhana, Drona, once more, pierced the latter with fifty\r\narrows and then with a hundred. Indeed, those mangling arrows, O king,\r\nissued from Drona's car, like vigorous snakes in wrath issuing through an\r\nant-hill. Similarly, blood-drinking arrows shot by Yuyudhana in hundreds\r\nand thousands covered the car of Drona. We did not mark any difference,\r\nhowever, between the lightness of hand displayed by that foremost of\r\nregenerate ones and that displayed by him of the Satwata race. Indeed, in\r\nthis respect, both those bulls among men were equal. Then Satyaki,\r\ninflamed with wrath, struck Drona with nine straight arrows. And he\r\nstruck Drona's standard also with many sharp shafts. And in the sight of\r\nBharadwaja's son, he pierced the latter's driver also with a hundred\r\narrows. Beholding the lightness of hand displayed by Yuyudhana, the\r\nmighty car-warrior Drona piercing Yuyudhana's driver with seventy shafts,\r\nand each of his (four) steeds with three, cut off with a single arrow the\r\nstandard that stood on Madhava's car. With another broad-headed arrow,\r\nequipped with feathers and with wings of gold, he cut off in that battle\r\nthe bow of that illustrious hero of Madhu's race. Thereupon, the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki, excited with wrath, laid aside that, taking up a\r\nhuge mace, hurled it at the son of Bharadwaja. Drona, however, with many\r\narrows of diverse forms, resisted that mace, made of iron and twined\r\nround with strings, as it coursed impetuously towards him. Then Satyaki,\r\nof prowess incapable of being baffled, took up another bow and pierced\r\nthe heroic son of Bharadwaja with many arrows whetted on stone. Piercing\r\nDrona thereby in that battle, Yuyudhana uttered a leonine shout. Drona,\r\nhowever, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, was unable to brook\r\nthat roar. Taking up a dart made of iron and equipped with golden staff\r\nDrona sped it quickly at the car of Madhava. That dart, however, fatal as\r\nDeath, without touching the grandson of Sini, pierced through the\r\nlatter's car and entered the earth with a fierce noise. The grandson of\r\nSini then, O king, pierced Drona with many winged arrows. Indeed,\r\nstriking him on the right arm, Satyaki, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nafflicted him greatly. Drona also, in that battle, O king, cut off the\r\nhuge bow of Madhava with a crescent-shaped arrow and smote the latter's\r\ndriver with a dart. Struck with that dart, Yuyudhana's driver swooned\r\naway and for a while lay motionless on the terrace of the car. Then, O\r\nMonarch, Satyaki, acting as his own driver, achieved a superhuman feat,\r\ninasmuch as he continued to fight with Drona and hold the reins himself.\r\nThen the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana struck that Brahmana with a hundred\r\narrows in that battle, and rejoiced exceedingly, O monarch, at the feat\r\nhe had achieved. Then Drona, O Bharata, sped at Satyaki five arrows.\r\nThose fierce arrows, piercing Satyaki's armour, drank his blood in that\r\nbattle. Thus pierced with those frightful arrows, Satyaki became inflamed\r\nwith wrath. In return, that hero shot many shafts at him of the golden\r\ncar. Then felling on the earth with a single shaft, the driver of Drona,\r\nhe caused next, with his arrows, those driverless steeds of his\r\nantagonist to fly away. Thereupon that car was dragged to a distance.\r\nIndeed, the bright chariot of Drona, O king, began to trace a thousand\r\ncircles in the field of battle like a sun in motion. Then all the kings\r\nand princes (of the Kaurava host) made a loud uproar, exclaiming, 'Run,\r\nRush, Seize the steeds of Drona.' Quickly abandoning Satyaki in that\r\nbattle, O monarch, all those mighty car-warriors rushed to the place\r\nwhere Drona was. Beholding those car-warriors run away afflicted with the\r\narrows of Satyaki, thy troops once more broke down and became exceedingly\r\ncheerless. Meanwhile, Drona, once more proceeding to the gate of the\r\narray, took up his station there, borne away (from Satyaki's presence) by\r\nthose steeds, fleet as the wind, that had been, afflicted with the shafts\r\nof the Vrishni hero. The valiant son of Bharadwaja, beholding the array\r\nbroken (in his absence) by the Pandavas and the Panchalas, made no\r\nendeavour to follow the grandson of Sini, but employed himself in\r\nprotecting his (broken) array. Checking the Pandavas and the Panchalas\r\nthen, the Drona fire, blazing up in wrath stayed there, consuming\r\neverything, like the sun that rises at the end of the Yuga.'\""

In vanquishing them (again), we have only been the (ostensible)\r\nmeans. Already slain by that bull among men, viz., the son of the\r\ncelestial chief, we have but slain the dead.' Saying these words unto his\r\ncharioteer, that bull amongst the Sinis, that foremost of bowmen, that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, that mighty warrior, scattering with great\r\nforce his arrows all around in that dreadful battle, proceeded like a\r\nhawk in search of prey. The Kuru warriors, although they attacked him\r\nfrom all sides, succeeded not in resisting that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nresembling the sun himself of a thousand rays, that foremost of men, who,\r\nhaving pierced the Kaurava ranks, was proceeding, borne by those\r\nexcellent steeds of his that were white as the moon or a conch.

Then that foremost of kings, viz.,\r\nSudarsana, conversant with all modes of warfare, clad in golden coat of\r\nmail, armed with bow and arrows and filled with rage, advanced against\r\nthe rushing Satyaki and endeavoured to check his course. Then the\r\nencounter that took place between them was fierce in the extreme. And\r\nboth thy warriors and the Somakas, O king highly applauded the encounter\r\nas between Vritra and Vasava. Sudarsana endeavoured to pierce that\r\nforemost one of the Satwata's in that battle with hundreds of keen shafts\r\nbefore they could reach him. Similarly, Sudarsana, stationed on his\r\nforemost of cars, cut off, by means of his own excellent shafts in two or\r\nthree fragments all the shafts that Satyaki, resembling Indra himself,\r\nsped at him. Beholding his shafts baffled by the force of Satyaki's\r\nshafts, Sudarsana of fierce energy, as if to consume (his foe),\r\nwrathfully shot beautiful arrows winged with gold. And once more he\r\npierced his enemy with three beautiful arrows resembling fire itself and\r\nequipped with wings of gold, shot from his bow-string drawn to the ear.\r\nThose piercing through Satyaki's armour, penetrated into the latter's\r\nbody. Similarly, that (prince, viz., Sudarsana), aiming four other\r\nblazing arrows, smote therewith the four steeds of Satyaki that were\r\nwhite as silver in hue. Thus afflicted by him the grandson of Sini,\r\nendued with great activity and possessed of prowess equal to that of\r\nIndra himself speedily slew with his keen shafts the steeds of Sudarsana\r\nand uttered a loud roar. Then cutting off with a broad-headed arrow\r\nendued with the force of Sakra's thunder, the head of Sudarsana's driver,\r\nthe foremost one amongst the Sinis. with a razor-faced arrow resembling\r\nthe Yuga-fire, cut off from Sudarsana's trunk his head graced with\r\near-rings, resembling the moon at full, and decked with an exceedingly\r\nradiant face, like the wielder of the thunder, O king, in days of old,\r\nforcibly cutting off the head of the mighty Vala in battle.

Behold, the track by which the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna), that foremost one among the Pandavas, hath gone,\r\nis rendered uneven with large bodies of foot-soldiers and steeds and\r\ncar-warriors and elephants lying slain on the ground. Behold, routed by\r\nthat high-souled warrior, the Kaurava army is flying away. Behold, O\r\ncharioteer, a dark brown dust is raised by those retreating cars and\r\nelephants and steeds. I think, I am very near to Arjuna of white steeds\r\nhaving Krishna for his charioteer. Hark, the well-known twang of Gandiva\r\nof immeasurable energy is being heard. From the character of the omens\r\nthat appear to my view, I am sure that Arjuna will slay the ruler of the\r\nSindhus before the sun sets. Without causing their strength to be spent,\r\nurge the steeds slowly to where those hostile ranks are staying, that is,\r\nto where yonder warriors headed by Duryodhana, their hands cased in\r\nleathern fences, and yonder Kamvojas of fierce deeds, clad in mail and\r\ndifficult of being defeated in battle, and those Yavanas armed with bow\r\nand arrows and skilled in smiting, and under Sakas and Daradas and\r\nBarbaras and Tamraliptakas, and other countless Mlecchas, armed with\r\ndiverse weapons, are,--to the spot (I repeat) where, indeed, yonder\r\nwarriors headed by Duryodhana, their hands cased in leathern fences,--are\r\nwaiting with their faces turned towards me and inspired with the\r\nresolution of battling with me. Regard me to have already passed through\r\nthis fierce fastness, O Suta, having slain in battle all these combatants\r\nwith cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers that are amongst\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\"The charioteer, thus addressed, said, 'O thou of Vrishni's race, fear I\r\nhave none, O thou of prowess that cannot be baffled! If thou hast before\r\nthe Jamadagni's son himself in wrath, or Drona, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, or the ruler of the Madras himself, even then fear doth not\r\nenter my heart, O thou of mighty arms, as long as I am under the shadow\r\nOf thy protection, O slayer of foes, countless Kamvojas, clad in mail, of\r\nfierce deeds, and difficult to defeat in battle, have already been\r\nvanquished by thee, as also many Yavanas armed with bow and arrows and\r\naccomplished in smiting, including Sakas and Daradas and Tamraliptakas,\r\nand many other Mlecchas armed with various weapons. Never before did I\r\nexperience fear in any battle. Why shall I, therefore, O thou of great\r\ncourage, experience any fear in this miserable fray? O thou that art\r\nblessed with length of days, by which way shall I take thee to where\r\nDhananjaya is? With whom hast thou been angry, O thou of Vrishni's race?\r\nWho are they that will fly away from battle, beholding thee endued with\r\nsuch a prowess, resembling the Destroyer himself as he appears at the end\r\nof the Yuga, and putting forth that prowess of thine (against thy foes)?\r\nO thou of mighty arms, who are they of whom king Vaivaswata is thinking\r\ntoday?'\r\n\r\n\"Satyaki said, 'Like Vasava destroying the Danavas, I shall slay these\r\nwarriors with shaved heads. By slaying these Kamvojas I will fulfil my\r\nvow. Bear me thither. Causing a great carnage amongst these, I shall\r\ntoday repair to the dear son of Pandu. The Kauravas, with Suyodhana at\r\ntheir head, will today behold my prowess, when this division of Mlecchas,\r\nof shaved heads, will have been exterminated and the whole Kaurava army\r\nput to the greatest distress. Hearing the loud wails of the Kaurava host,\r\ntoday, mangled and broken by me in battle Suyodhana will be inspired with\r\ngrief.

Beholding\r\ntoday thousands of foremost warriors slain with my arrows, king\r\nDuryodhana will be plunged into great grief. The Kauravas will today\r\nbehold the bow in my hands to resemble a circle of fire when,\r\nlight-handed, I will stretch the bowstring for shooting my host of\r\nshafts. Beholding the incessant slaughter of his troops today, their\r\nbodies covered with blood and pierced all over with my shafts, Suyodhana\r\nwill be filled with grief.

Slaying thousands of kings\r\ntoday, I will show my love and devotion to those high-souled ones, viz.,\r\nthe royal sons of Pandu.

Those excellent animals, endued with the speed of the wind or\r\nthought, proceeded, devouring the very skies, and bore Yuyudhana to the\r\nspot where those Yavanas were. Thereupon, the Yavanas, many in number and\r\nendued with lightness of hands, approaching unretreating Satyaki, covered\r\nhim with showers of arrows. The rushing Satyaki, however, O king, cut off\r\nby means of his own straight arrows, all those shafts and weapons of the\r\nYavanas. Inflamed with wrath, Yuyudhana. then, with his straight shafts\r\nof great sharpness, winged with gold and vulture's feathers, cut off the\r\nheads and arms of those Yavanas. Many of those arrows, again, piercing\r\nthrough their coats of mail, made of iron and brass, entered the earth.\r\nStruck by the brave Satyaki in that battle, the Mlecchas began to fall\r\ndown on the earth in hundreds, deprived of life. With his arrows shot in\r\ncontinuous lines from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, that hero\r\nbegan to slay five, six, seven, or eight Yavanas at a time. Thousands of\r\nKamvojas, and Sakas, and Barbaras, were similarly slain by Satyaki.\r\nIndeed, the grandson of Sini, causing a great carnage among thy troops,\r\nmade the earth impassable and miry with flesh and blood. The field of\r\nbattle was strewn with the head-gears of those robbers and their shaved\r\nheads too that looked, in consequence of their long beards, like\r\nfeatherless birds. Indeed, the field of battle covered with headless\r\ntrunks dyed all over with blood, looked beautiful like the welkin covered\r\nwith coppery clouds. Slain by Satwata by means of his straight shafts\r\nwhose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, the Yavanas covered the\r\nsurface of the earth. The small remnant of those mail-clad troops\r\nvanquished in battle, O king, by Satwata, becoming cheerless, their lives\r\non the point of being taken, broke and urging their steeds with goads and\r\nwhips to their utmost speed, fled from fear in all directions. Routing\r\nthe invincible Kamvoja host in battle, O Bharata, as also that host of\r\nthe Yavanas and that large force of the Sakas, that tiger among men who\r\nhad penetrated into thy army, viz., Satyaki, of prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, crowned with victory, urged his charioteer, saying,\r\n'Proceed!' Beholding that feat of his in battle, never before achieved by\r\nany one else, the Charanas and the Gandharvas applauded him highly.\r\nIndeed, O king, the Charanas, as also thy warriors, beholding Yuyudhana\r\nthus proceeded for aiding Arjuna, became filled with delight (at his\r\nheroism).'"

Like a hunter slaying deer, that\r\ntiger among men, (Satyaki), endued with beautiful teeth, clad in\r\nexcellent armour, and owning a beautiful standard, slew the Kaurava\r\ntroops and inspired them with fear. Proceeding on his car, he shook his\r\nbow with great force, that bow, the back of whose staff was decked with\r\ngold, whose toughness was great, and which was adorned with many golden\r\nmoons. His arms decked with golden Angadas, his head-gear adorned with\r\ngold; his body clad in golden mail, his standard and bow also was so\r\nembellished with gold, that he shone like the summit of Meru. Himself\r\nshedding such effulgence, and bearing that circular bow in his hand, he\r\nlooked like a second sun in autumn, That bull among men, possessing the\r\nshoulders and the tread and eyes of a bull, looked in the midst of thy\r\ntroops, like a bull in a cow-pen. Thy warriors approached him from desire\r\nof slaughter like a tiger approaching the leader, with rent temples, of\r\nan elephant-herd, standing proudly in the midst of his herd, resembling\r\nas he did and possessed as he was of the tread of an infuriated elephant.\r\nIndeed, after he had passed through Drona's division, and the unfordable\r\ndivision of the Bhojas, after he had forded through the sea of\r\nJalasandha's troops as also the host of the Kamvojas, after he had\r\nescaped the alligator constituted by Hridika's son, after he had\r\ntraversed those ocean-like host, many car-warriors of thy army, excited\r\nwith wrath, surrounded Satyaki. And Duryodhana and Chitrasena and\r\nDuhsasana and Vivinsati, and Sakuni and Duhsaha, and the youthful\r\nDurdharshana, and Kratha, and many other brave warriors well-conversant\r\nwith weapons and difficult of defeat, wrathfully followed Satyaki from\r\nbehind as he proceeded onwards. Then, O sire, loud was the uproar that\r\narose among thy troops, resembling that of the ocean itself at full tide\r\nwhen lashed into fury by the tempest. Beholding all those warriors\r\nrushing at him, that bull among the Sinis smilingly addressed his\r\ncharioteer, saying, 'Proceed slowly. The Dhartarashtra force, swelling\r\n(with rage and pride), and teeming with elephants and steeds and cars and\r\nfoot-soldiers, that is rushing with speed towards me, filling the ten\r\npoints of the compass with deep roar of its cars, O charioteer, and\r\ncausing the earth, the welkin, and the very seas, to tremble,\r\ntherewith,--this sea of troops, O driver, I will resist in great battle,\r\nlike the continent resisting the ocean swelling to its utmost height at\r\nfull moon. Behold, O charioteer, my prowess which is equal to that of\r\nIndra himself in great battle. I will consume this hostile force by means\r\nof my whetted arrows. Behold these foot-soldiers and horsemen and\r\ncar-warriors, and elephants slain by me in thousands, their bodies\r\npierced with my fiery arrows.' While saying these words (unto his\r\ncharioteer), those combatants from desire of battle, speedily came before\r\nSatyaki of immeasurable prowess. They made a loud noise, saying as they\r\ncame, 'Slay, Rush, Wait, See, See!' Of those brave warriors that said\r\nthese words, Satyaki, by means of his sharp arrows, slew three hundred\r\nhorsemen and four hundred elephants. The passage at arms between those\r\nunited bowmen (on the one side) and Satyaki (on the other) was\r\nexceedingly fierce, resembling that between the gods and the Asuras (in\r\ndays of old). An awful carnage set in. The grandson of Sini received with\r\nhis shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison that force, O sire, of\r\nthy son which looked like a mass of clouds. Shrouding every side, in that\r\nbattle with his arrowy downpours, that valiant hero, O monarch,\r\nfearlessly slew a large number of thy troops. Exceedingly wonderful, O\r\nking, was the sight that I witnessed there, viz., that not an arrow even,\r\nO lord, of Satyaki failed in effect. That sea of troops, abounding in\r\ncars and elephants and steeds, and full of waves constituted by\r\nfoot-soldiers, stood still as soon as it came in contact with the Satyaki\r\ncontinent. That host consisting of panic-stricken combatants and\r\nelephants and steeds, slaughtered on all sides by Satyaki with his shafts\r\nrepeatedly turned round, and wandered hither and thither as if afflicted\r\nwith the chilling blasts of winter. We saw not foot-soldiers or\r\ncar-warriors or elephants or horsemen or steeds that were not struck with\r\nYuyudhana's arrows. Not even Phalguna, O king, had caused such a carnage\r\nthere as Satyaki, O monarch, then caused among those troops. That bull\r\namong men, viz., the dauntless grandson of Sini, endued with great\r\nlightness of hand and displaying the utmost skill, fighteth, surpassing\r\nArjuna himself. Then king Duryodhana pierced the charioteer of Satwata\r\nwith three keen shafts and his four steeds with four shafts. And he\r\npierced Satyaki himself with three arrows and once again with eight. And\r\nDuhsasana pierced that bull among the Sinis with sixteen arrows. And\r\nSakuni pierced him with five and twenty arrows and Chitrasena with five.\r\nAnd Duhsasana pierced Satyaki in the chest with five and ten arrows. That\r\ntiger amongst the Vrishnis then, thus struck with their arrows, proudly\r\npierced every one of them, O monarch, with three arrows. Deeply piercing\r\nall his foes with shafts endued with great energy, the grandson of Sini,\r\npossessed of great activity and prowess, careered on the field with the\r\ncelerity of a hawk. Cutting off the bow of Suvala's son and the leathern\r\nfence that cased his hand. Yuyudhana pierced Duryodhana in the centre of\r\nthe chest with three shafts. And he pierced Chitrasena with a hundred\r\narrows, and Duhsaha with ten. And that bull of Sini's race then pierced\r\nDuhsasana with twenty arrows. Thy brother-in-law (Sakuni) then, O king,\r\ntaking up another bow, pierced Satyaki with eight arrows and once more\r\nwith five. And Duhsasana pierced him with three. And Durmukha, O king,\r\npierced Satyaki with a dozen shafts. And Duryodhana, having pierced\r\nMadhava with three and seventy arrows, then pierced his charioteer with\r\nthree keen shafts. Then Satyaki pierced each of those brave and mighty\r\ncar-warriors vigorously contending in battle together with five shafts in\r\nreturn. Then the foremost of car-warriors, (viz., Yuyudhana) speedily\r\nstruck thy son's charioteer with a broad-headed shaft; whereupon, the\r\nlatter deprived of life, fell down on the earth. Upon the fall of the\r\ncharioteer, O lord, thy son's car was taken away from the battle by the\r\nsteeds yoked thereto, with the speed of the wind. Then thy sons, O king,\r\nand the other warriors, O monarch, setting their eyes, on the king's car\r\nfled away in hundreds. Beholding that host fly away, O Bharata, Satyaki\r\ncovered it with showers of keen shafts whetted on stone and equipped with\r\nwings of gold. Routing all thy combatants counting by thousands, Satyaki,\r\nO king, proceeded towards the car of Arjuna. Indeed, thy troops\r\nworshipped Yuyudhana, beholding him shooting arrows and protecting his\r\ncharioteer and himself as he fought in battle.'\""

When Yuyudhana who 'is equal to\r\nSavyasachin himself was before them, how, indeed, could those wretches,\r\nthat were at the point of death, set their hearts upon battle? What also\r\ndid all those Kshatriyas, vanquished in battle, then, do? How, indeed,\r\ncould Satyaki of world-wide renown pass through them in battle? How also,\r\nO Sanjaya, when my sons were alive, could the grandson of Sini go to\r\nbattle? Tell me all this. This is exceedingly wonderful, O sire, that I\r\nhave heard from thee, viz., this encounter between one and the many, the\r\nlatter, again, being all mighty car-warriors. O Suta, I think, Destiny is\r\nnow unpropitious to my sons, since so many mighty car-warriors have been\r\nslain by that one warrior of the Satwata race, Alas, O Sanjaya, my army\r\nis no match for even one warrior, viz., Yuyudhana inflamed with wrath.\r\nLet all the Pandavas hang up these weapons. Vanquishing in battle Drona\r\nhimself who skilled in weapons and conversant with all modes of warfare,\r\nSatyaki will slay my sons, like a lion slaying smaller animals. Numerous\r\nheroes, of whom Kritavarman is the first, contending vigorously in\r\nbattle, could not slay Yuyudhana. The latter, without doubt, will slay my\r\nsons. Phalguna himself fought not in the manner in which the renowned\r\ngrandson of Sini has fought.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'All this, O king, has been brought about by thy evil\r\ncounsels and the acts of Duryodhana. Listen attentively to what, O\r\nBharata, I say unto thee. At the command of thy son, the Samsaptakas,\r\nrallying, all resolved upon fighting fiercely. Three thousand bowmen\r\nheaded by Duryodhana, with a number of Sakas and Kamvojas and Valhikas\r\nand Yavanas and Paradas, and Kalingas and Tanganas and Amvashtas and\r\nPisachas and Barbaras and mountaineers, O monarch, inflamed with rage and\r\narmed with stone, all rushed against the grandson of Sini like insects\r\nagainst a blazing fire. Five hundred other warriors, O king, similarly\r\nrushed against Satyaki. And another mighty body consisting of a thousand\r\ncars, a hundred great car-warriors, a thousand elephants, two thousand\r\nheroes, and countless foot-soldiers, also rushed against the grandson of\r\nSini. Duhsasana, O Bharata, urging all those warriors, saying, 'Slay him,\r\nsurrounded Satyaki therewith. Grand and wonderful was the conduct that we\r\nthen beheld of Sini's grandson, inasmuch as alone he fought fearlessly\r\nwith those innumerable foes. And he slew that entire body of car-warriors\r\nand that elephant force, and all those horsemen and that entire body of\r\nrobbers. Like the autumnal firmament bespangled with stars, the field of\r\nbattle there became strewn with car-wheels broken and crushed by means of\r\nhis mighty weapons with innumerable Akshas and beautiful cart-shafts\r\nreduced to fragments, with crushed elephants and fallen standards, with\r\ncoats of mail and shields scattered all about, with garlands and\r\nornaments and robes and Anuskarshas, O sire! Many foremost of elephants,\r\nhuge as hills, and born of the race of Anjana or Vamana, O Bharata, or of\r\nother races, many foremost of tuskers, O king, lay there on the ground,\r\ndeprived of life. And Satyaki slew, O monarch, many foremost of steeds of\r\nthe Vanayu, the mountain, the Kamvoja and the Valhika breeds. And the\r\ngrandson of Sini also slew foot-soldiers there, in hundreds and\r\nthousands, born in various realms and belonging to various nations.\r\nWhilst those soldiers were being thus slaughtered, Duhsasana, addressing\r\nthe robbers said, 'Ye warriors unacquainted with morality, fight! Why do\r\nyou retreat?' Beholding them run away without paying any heed to his\r\nwords, thy soil Duhsasana urged on the brave mountaineers, skilled in\r\nfighting with stones, saying, 'Ye are accomplished in battling with\r\nstones. Satyaki is ignorant of this mode of warfare. Stay ye, therefore,\r\nthat warrior who, though desirous of battle, is ignorant of your mode of\r\nfight. The Kauravas also are all unacquainted with this mode of battle.\r\nRush ye at Satyaki. Do not fear. Satyaki will not be able to approach\r\nyou.' Thus urged, those Kshatriyas dwelling on the mountains, all\r\nacquainted with the method of fighting with stones, rushed towards the\r\ngrandson of Sini like ministers towards a king. Those denizens of the\r\nmountain then, with stones huge as elephants' heads uplifted in their\r\nhands, stood before Yuyudhana in that battle. Others, urged by thy son,\r\nand desirous of slaying Satwata, encompassed the latter on all sides,\r\narmed with missiles. Then, Satyaki, aiming at those warriors rushing at\r\nhim from desire of fighting with stones, sped at them showers of keen\r\nshafts. That bull amongst the Sinis, with those shafts looking like\r\nsnakes, cut into fragments that dense shower of stones thrown by the\r\nmountaineers. The fragments of those stones, looking like a swarm of\r\nblazing fire-flies, slew many combatants there, whereupon, O sire, cries\r\nof oh and alas arose on the field. Then, again, five hundred brave\r\nwarriors with huge stones uplifted in their hands, fell down, O king, on\r\nthe ground, their arms cut off. And once more a full thousand, and again\r\na hundred thousand, amongst others, fell down without being able to\r\napproach Satyaki, their arms with stones still in grasp cut off by him.\r\nIndeed, Satyaki slew many thousands of those warriors fighting with\r\nstones. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then many of them,\r\nreturning to the fight, hurled at Satyaki showers of stones, And armed\r\nwith swords and lances many Daradas and Tanganas and Khasas and Lampakas\r\nand Pulindas, hurled their weapons at him. Satyaki however,\r\nwell-conversant with the application of weapons, cut off those stones and\r\nweapons by means of his shafts. Those stones while being pierced, broken\r\nin the welkin by Satyaki's whetted shafts, produced a fierce noise, at\r\nwhich many car-warriors and steeds and elephants fled away from battle.\r\nAnd struck with the fragments of those stones, men and elephants and\r\nsteeds, became incapable of staying in battle, for they felt as if they\r\nwere bit by wasps. The small remnant of the elephants (that had attacked\r\nSatyaki), covered with blood, their heads, and frontal globes split open,\r\nthen fled away from, Yuyudhana's car. Then there arose among thy troops,\r\nO sire, while they were being thus ground by Madhava a noise like that of\r\nthe ocean at full tide. Hearing that great uproar, Drona, addressing his\r\ncharioteer, said, 'O Suta, that great car-warrior of the Satwata race,\r\nexcited with wrath, is tearing our army into diverse fragments, and\r\ncareering in battle like the Destroyer himself. Take thou the car to that\r\nspot whence this furious uproar is coming. Without doubt, Yuyudhana is\r\nengaged with the mountaineers who battle with stones, Our car-warriors\r\nare seen also to be borne away by their wildly running steeds. Many\r\namongst them, weaponless and armourless and wounded, are falling down.\r\nThe charioteers are unable to check their steeds as these are rushing\r\nwildly.' Hearing these words of Bharadwaja's son, the charioteer said\r\nunto Drona, that foremost of wielders of weapons, 'Thou blest with length\r\nof days, the Katirava troops are flying away. Behold, our warriors,\r\nrouted (by the foe), are flying in all directions. There, again, those\r\nheroes, viz., the Panchalas, and the Pandavas, united together, are\r\nrushing from all sides from desire of slaughtering thee, O chastiser of\r\nfoes, do thou determine which of these tasks should first demand\r\nattention. Should we stay here (to meet the advancing Pandava), or should\r\nwe proceed (towards Satyaki)? As regards Satyaki, he is now far ahead of\r\nus.' While the charioteer, O sire, was speaking thus unto Bharadwaja's\r\nson, the grandson of Sini suddenly appeared to the view, engaged in\r\nslaughtering a large number of car-warriors. Those troops of thine, while\r\nbeing thus slaughtered by Yuyudhana, in battle, fled away from\r\nYuyudhana's car towards where Drona's division was. Those (other)\r\ncar-warriors also with whom Duhsasana had proceeded, all struck with\r\npanic, similarly rushed to the spot where Drona's car was seen."

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Duhsasana's car staying near his, the son of\r\nBharadwaja, addressing Duhsasana, said these words, 'Why, O Duhsasana,\r\nare all these cars flying away? Is the king well? Is the ruler of the\r\nSindhus yet alive? Thou art a prince. Thou art a brother of the king.\r\nThou art a mighty car-warrior. Why dost thou fly away from battle?\r\n(Securing the throne to thy brother), become thou that Prince-Regent.\r\nThou hadst formerly said unto Draupadi, 'Thou art our slave, having been\r\nwon by us at dice. Without being confined to thy husbands, cast aside thy\r\nchastity. Be thou a bearer of robes to the king, my eldest brother. Thy\r\nhusbands are all dead. They are as worthless as grains of sesamum without\r\nkernel.' Having said these words then, why, O Duhsasana, dost thou fly\r\nfrom battle now? Having thyself provoked such fierce hostilities with the\r\nPanchalas and the Pandavas, why art thou afraid in battle in the presence\r\nof Satyaki alone? Taking up the dice on the occasion of the gambling\r\nmatch, couldst thou not divine that those dice then handled by thee would\r\nsoon transform themselves into fierce shafts resembling snakes of\r\nvirulent poison? It was thou that hadst formerly applied diverse abusive\r\nepithets towards the Pandavas. The woes of Draupadi have thee for their\r\nroot. Where now is that pride, that insolence, that brag of thine? Why\r\ndost thou fly, having angered the Pandavas, those terrible snakes of\r\nvirulent poison? When thou that art a brave brother of Suyodhana, are\r\nintent on flight, without doubt, O hero, thou shouldst today protect,\r\nrelying on the energy of thy own arms, this routed and panic-stricken\r\nKaurava host. Without doing this, thou, however, forsakest the battle in\r\nfear and enhancest the joy of thy foes. O slayer of foes, when thou that\r\nart the leader of thy host, fliest away thus, who else will stay in\r\nbattle? When thou, its refuge, art frightened, who is there that will not\r\nbe frightened? Fighting with a single warrior of the Satwata race, thy\r\nheart is inclined towards flight from battle. What, however, O Kaurava,\r\nwilt thou do when thou wilt see the wielder of Gandiva in battle, or\r\nBhimasena, or the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva)? The shafts of Satyaki,\r\nfrightened by which thou seekest safety in flight, are scarcely equal to\r\nthose of Phalguna in battle that resemble the sun or fire in splendour.\r\nIf thy heart is firmly bent on flight, let the sovereignty of the earth\r\nthen, upon the conclusion of peace, be given to king Yudhishthira the\r\nJust. Before the shafts of Phalguna, resembling snakes freed from their\r\nsloughs, enter thy body, make peace with the Pandavas. Before the\r\nhigh-souled Parthas, slaying thy hundred brothers in battle, wrest the\r\nearth by force, make peace with the Pandavas. Before king Yudhishthira is\r\nenraged, and Krishna also, that delighter in battle, makes peace with the\r\nPandavas. Before the mighty-armed Bhima, penetrating into this vast host,\r\nseizes thy brothers, make peace with the Pandavas. Bhishma formerly told\r\nthy brother Suyodhana, 'The Pandavas are unconquerable in battle. O\r\namiable one, make peace with them.' Thy wicked brother Suyodhana however,\r\ndid not do it. Therefore, setting thy heart firmly on battle, fight\r\nvigorously with the Pandavas. Go quickly on thy car to the spot where\r\nSatyaki is. Without thee, O Bharata, this host will fly away. For the\r\nsake of thy own self, fight in battle with Satyaki, of prowess incapable\r\nof being baffled.' Thus addressed (by Drona), thy son said not a word in\r\nreply. Feigning not to have heard the words (of Bharadwaja's son),\r\nDuhsasana proceeded to the place where Satyaki was. Accompanied by a\r\nlarge force of unretreating Mlecchas, and coming upon Satyaki in battle,\r\nDuhsasana fought vigorously with that hero. Drona also, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, excited with wrath, rushed against the Panchalas and the\r\nPandavas, with moderate speed. Penetrating into the midst of the Pandava\r\nhost in that battle, Drona began to crush their warriors by hundreds and\r\nthousands. And Drona, O king, proclaiming his name in that battle, caused\r\na great carnage among the Pandavas, the Panchalas, and the Matsyas. The\r\nillustrious Viraketu, the son of the ruler of the Panchalas, rushed\r\nagainst the son of Bharadwaja who thus engaged in vanquishing the Pandava\r\nranks. Piercing Drona with five straight shafts, that prince then pierced\r\nDrona's standard with one shaft, and then his charioteer with seven. The\r\nsight that I then beheld, O monarch, in that battle, was exceedingly\r\nwonderful, inasmuch as Drona, though exerting himself vigorously could\r\nnot approach the prince of the Panchalas. Then, O sire, the Panchalas,\r\nbeholding Drona checked in battle, surrounded the latter on all sides, O\r\nking, from desire of king Yudhishthira's victory. And those warriors then\r\ncovered Drona along with showers of fiery shafts and strong lances and\r\nvarious other kinds of weapons, O king! Baffling then those dense showers\r\nof weapons by means of his own numerous shafts like the wind driving away\r\nfrom the welkin masses of clouds, Drona looked exceedingly resplendent.\r\nThen that slayer of hostile heroes (the son of Bharadwaja), aimed a\r\nfierce shaft endued with the effulgence of the sun or the fire, at the\r\ncar of Viraketu. The shaft, O monarch, piercing through the prince of\r\nPanchala, quickly entered the earth, bathed in blood and blazing like a\r\nflame of fire. Then the prince of the Panchalas quickly fell down from\r\nhis car, like a Champaka tree uprooted by the wind, falling down from a\r\nmountain summit. Upon the fall of that great bowman, that prince endued\r\nwith great might, the Panchalas speedily encompassed Drona on every side.\r\nThen Chitraketu, and Sudhanwan, and Chitravarman, O Bharata, and\r\nChitraratha also, all afflicted with grief on account of their (slain)\r\nbrother, together rushed against the son of Bharadwaja, desirous of\r\nbattling with him, and shooting shafts (at him) like the clouds (pouring)\r\nat the end of summer. Struck from all sides by those mighty car-warriors\r\nof royal lineage, that bull among Brahmanas mustered all his energy and\r\nwrath for their destruction. Then Drona, shot showers of shafts at them.\r\nStruck with those shafts of Drona shot from his bow to its fullest\r\nstretch those princess. O best of monarchs, became confounded and know\r\nnot what to do. The angry Drona, O Bharata, beholding those princes\r\nstupefied, smilingly deprived them of their steeds and charioteers and\r\ncars in that battle. Then the illustrious son of Bharadwaja, by means of\r\nhis sharp arrows and broad-headed shafts, cut off their heads, like a\r\nperson plucking flowers from a tree. Deprived of life, those princes\r\nthere, O king of great splendour, fell down from their cars on the earth,\r\nlike the (slain) Daityas and Danavas in the battle between the gods and\r\nthe Asuras in days of old. Having slain them in battle, O king, the\r\nvaliant son of Bharadwaja shook his invincible bow, the back of whose\r\nstaff was decked with gold. Beholding those mighty car-warriors,\r\nresembling the very celestials among the Panchalas slain, Dhrishtadyumna\r\ninflamed with rage, shed tears in that battle. Excited with wrath, he\r\nrushed, in that encounter, against Drona's car. Then, O king, cries of\r\nwoe suddenly arose there at the sight of Drona covered with arrows by the\r\nprince of Panchala. Completely shrouded by the high-souled son of\r\nPrishata, Drona, however, suffered no pain. On the other hand, he\r\ncontinued to fight, smiling the while. The prince of the Panchalas then,\r\nfurious with rage, struck Drona in the chest with many straight shafts.\r\nDeeply pierced by that mighty warrior, the illustrious son Of Bharadwaja\r\nsat down on the terrace of his car and fell into a swoon. Beholding him\r\nin that condition, Dhrishtadyumna endued with great Prowess and energy,\r\nlaid aside his bow and quickly took up a sword. That mighty car-warrior\r\nthen, speedily jumping down from his own car, Mounted that of Bharadwaja,\r\nO 'sire, in no time, his eyes red in wrath and impelled by the desire of\r\ncutting Drona's head from off his trunk. Meanwhile, the valiant Drona,\r\nregaining his senses, took up his bow and seeing Dhrishtadyumna arrived\r\nso near him from desire of slaughter, began to pierce that mighty\r\ncar-warrior with shafts measuring a span only in length and therefore,\r\nfit to be used in close fight. Those arrows of the measure of a span and\r\nfit to be used in close fight, were known to Drona, O king! And with them\r\nhe succeeded in weakening Dhrishtadyumna. The mighty Dhrishtadyumna,\r\nstruck with a large number of those arrows, quickly jumped down from\r\nDrona's car. Then, that hero of great prowess, his impetuosity baffled,\r\nmounted upon his own car and once more took up his large bow. And the\r\nmighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna once more began to pierce Drona in that\r\nbattle. And Drona also, O monarch, began to pierce the son of Prishata\r\nwith his arrows. There. upon, the battle that took place between Drona\r\nand the prince of the Panchalas was wonderful in the extreme, like that\r\nbetween Indra and Prahlada, both desirous of the sovereignty of the three\r\nworlds. Both conversant with the ways of battle, they careered over the\r\nfield, displaying diverse motions of their cars and mangling each other\r\nwith their shafts, And Drona and Prishata's son, stupefying the mind of\r\nthe warriors, shot showers of shafts like two mighty clouds (pouring\r\ntorrents of rain) in the rainy season. And those illustrious warriors\r\nshrouded with their shafts the welkin, the points of the compass, and the\r\nearth. And all creatures, viz., the Kshatriyas, O king, and all the other\r\ncombatants there, highly applauded that battle between them. And the\r\nPanchalas, O king, loudly exclaimed, 'Without doubt, Drona, having\r\nencountered Dhrishtadyumna in battle, will succumb to us. Then Drona, in\r\nthat battle, quickly cut off the head of Dhristadyumna's charioteer like\r\na person plucking a ripe fruit from a tree. Then the steeds, O king, of\r\nthe high-souled Dhrishtadyumna ran away and after those steeds had\r\ncarried away Dhrishtadyumna from the field, Drona, endued with great\r\nprowess, began to rout the Panchalas and the Srinjayas in that battle.\r\nHaving vanquished the Pandus and the Panchalas, Bharadwaja's son of great\r\nprowess, that chastiser of foes, once more took up his station in the\r\nmidst of his own array. And the Pandavas, O lord, ventured not to\r\nvanquish him in battle.'"

Having pierced Satyaki with sixty arrows and once more\r\nwith sixteen, he failed to make that hero tremble, for the latter stood\r\nit, battle, immovable as the Mainaka mountain. Accompanied by a large\r\nthrong of cars hailing from diverse realms, that foremost one of\r\nBharata's race shot numberless arrows, and filled all the points of the\r\ncompass with roars deep as those of the clouds. Beholding the Kaurava\r\ncoming to battle, Satyaki of mighty arms rushed towards him and shrouded\r\nhim with his shafts. They that were at the van of Duhsasana, thus covered\r\nwith those arrowy showers, all fled away in fear, in the very sight of\r\nthy son. After they had fled away, O monarch, thy son Duhsasana, O king,\r\nremained fearlessly in battle and began to afflict Satyaki with arrows.\r\nAnd piercing the four steeds of Satyaki with four arrows, his charioteer\r\nwith three, and Satyaki himself with a hundred in that battle, Duhsasana\r\nuttered a loud roar, Then, O monarch, Madhava, inflamed with rage, soon\r\nmade Duhsasana's car and driver and standard and Duhsasana himself\r\ninvisible by means of his straight arrows. Indeed, Satyaki entirely\r\nshrouded the brave Duhsasana with arrows. Like a spider entangling a gnat\r\nwithin reach by means of its threads, that vanquisher of foes quickly\r\ncovered Duhsasana with his shafts. Then King Duryodhana, seeing Duhsasana\r\nthus covered with arrows, urged a body of Trigartas towards the car of\r\nYuyudhana. Those Trigarta car-warriors, of fierce deeds, accomplished in\r\nbattle, and numbering three thousand, proceeded towards Yuyudhana. Firmly\r\nresolved upon battle and swearing not to retreat, all of them encompassed\r\nYuyudhana with a large throng of cars, Soon, however, Yuyudhana struck\r\ndown five hundred of their foremost warriors stationed in the van of the\r\nforce as it advanced towards him in battle, shooting showers of arrows at\r\nhim. Speedily slain by that foremost one amongst the Sinis with his\r\nshafts, these fell down, like tall trees from mountain-tops uprooted by a\r\ntempest. And the field of battle, strewn with mangled elephants, O\r\nmonarch, and fallen standards, and bodies of steeds decked in trappings\r\nof gold, and torn and lacerated with the shafts of Sini's grandson and\r\nweltering in blood, looked beautiful, O king, like a plain overgrown with\r\nflowering Kinsukas. Those soldiers of thine, thus slaughtered by\r\nYuyudhana, failed to find a protector like elephants sunk in a morass.\r\nThen all of them turned towards the spot where Drona's car was, like\r\nmighty snakes making towards holes from fear of the prince of birds.\r\nHaving slain those five hundred brave warriors by in means of his shafts,\r\nresembling snakes of virulent poison, that hero slowly proceeded towards\r\nthe place where Dhananjaya was. And as that foremost of men was thus\r\nproceeding thy son Duhsasana quickly pierced him with nine straight\r\narrows. That mighty bowman then (Yuyudhana), pierced Duhsasana, in\r\nreturn, with five straight and sharp arrows equipped with golden wings\r\nand vulturine feather. Then Duhsasana, O Bharata, smiling the while,\r\npierced Satyaki, O monarch, with three arrows, and once more with five.\r\nThe grandson of Sini, then, striking thy Son with five arrows and Cutting\r\noff his bow proceeded smilingly towards Arjuna. Then Duhsasana, inflamed\r\nwith wrath and desirous of slaying the Vrishni hero, hurled at him, as he\r\nproceeded, a dart made wholly of iron. Satyaki, however, O king, cut off,\r\nwith his shafts, equipped with Kanka feathers, that fierce dart Of thy\r\nson. Then, O ruler of men, then, thy son, taking up another bow, pierced\r\nSatyaki with some arrows and uttered a loud roar. Then Satyaki excited\r\nwith wrath, stupefying thy son in that battle, struck him in the centre\r\nof the chest with some shafts that resembled flames of fire. And once\r\nmore, he pierced Duhsasana with eight shafts made wholly of iron and\r\nhaving very keen points. Duhsasana, however, pierced Satyaki in return\r\nwith twenty arrows. Then, the highly-blessed Satyaki, O monarch, pierced\r\nDuhsasana in the centre of the chest with three straight arrows. And the\r\nmighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, with some straight shafts slew the steeds\r\nof Duhsasana; inflamed with wrath he slew, with some straight arrows,\r\nthat the latter's charioteer also. With one broad-headed arrow he then\r\ncut off thy son's bow, and with five arrows he cut the leathern fence\r\nthat encased his hand. Acquainted as he was with highest weapons,\r\nSatyaki, then, with a couple of broad-headed shafts, cut off Duhsasana's\r\nstandard and the wooden shafts of his car. And then with a number of keen\r\narrows he slew both the Parshni charioteers of thy son. The latter, then,\r\nbowless and carless and steedless and driverless, was taken up by the\r\nleader of the Trigarta warriors on his car. The grandson of Sini, then, O\r\nBharata, pursuing him a moment, restrained himself and slew him not, for\r\nthe mighty-armed hero recollected the words of Bhimasena. Indeed,\r\nBhimasena, O Bharata, vowed in the midst of the assembly the destruction\r\nof all thy sons in battle. Then, O lord, Satyaki, having thus vanquished\r\nDuhsasana, quickly proceeded, O king, along the track by which Dhananjaya\r\nhad gone before him.'\""

Then Bhimasena and\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O sire, and Nakula and Sahadeva and king Yudhishthira the\r\nJust, loudly shouted, 'Come, Strike, Rush! The brave Madhava and Arjuna\r\nhave entered the hostile army! Do that quickly by which they may easily\r\ngo to where Jayadratha's car is.' Saying this, they urged their soldiers.\r\nAnd they continued, 'If Satyaki and Arjuna be slain, Kurus will have\r\nachieved their objects, and ourselves shall be defeated. All of you,\r\ntherefore, uniting together, quickly agitate this ocean-like army (of the\r\nfoe) like impetuous winds agitating the deep.' The warriors, O king, thus\r\nurged by Bhimasena and the prince of the Panchalas, smothered the\r\nKauravas, becoming reckless of their very lives. Endued with great\r\nenergy, all of them, desiring death in battle, at the point or the edge\r\nof weapons in expectation of heaven, showed not the least regard for\r\ntheir lives in fighting for their friends. Similarly, thy warriors, O\r\nking, desirous of great renown, and nobly resolved upon battle, stood on\r\nthe field, determined to fight. In that fierce and terrible battle,\r\nSatyaki having vanquished all the combatants proceeded towards Arjuna.\r\nThe rays of the sun being reflected from the bright armour of the\r\nwarriors, the combatants were obliged to withdraw their eyes from those.\r\nDuryodhana also, O king, penetrated the mighty host of the high-souled\r\nPandavas vigorously struggling in battle. The encounter that took place\r\nbetween him on the one side and them on the other, was exceedingly\r\nfierce, and great was the carnage that occurred there on the occasion.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Pandava host was thus proceeding to\r\nbattle, Duryodhana, in penetrating it, must have been placed in great\r\ndistress. I hope, he did not turn his back upon the field, O Suta! That\r\nencounter between one and the many in dreadful battle, the one, again,\r\nbeing a king, seems to me to have been very unequal. Besides, Duryodhana\r\nhath been brought up in great luxury, in wealth and possessions, he is a\r\nking of men. Alone encountering many, I hope he did not turn back from\r\nfight.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Listen to me, O king, as I describe, O Bharata, that\r\nwonderful battle fought by thy son, that encounter between one and the\r\nmany. Indeed, the Pandava army was agitated by Duryodhana in that battle,\r\nlike an assemblage of lotus-stalks in a lake by an elephant. Seeing then\r\nthat army thus smitten by thy son, O king, the Panchalas headed by\r\nBhimasena rushed at them. Then Duryodhana pierced Bhimasena with ten\r\narrows and each of the twins with three and king Yudhishthira with seven.\r\nAnd he pierced Virata and Drupada with six arrows, and Sikhandin with a\r\nhundred. And piercing Dhrishtadyumna with twenty arrows, he struck each\r\nof the five sons of Draupadi with three arrows. With his fierce shafts he\r\ncut off hundreds of other combatants in that battle, including elephants\r\nand car-warriors, like the Destroyer himself in wrath exterminating\r\ncreatures. In consequence of his skill cultured by practice and of the\r\npower of his weapons, he seemed, as he was engaged in striking down his\r\nfoes, to bend his bow incessantly drawn to a circle whether when aiming\r\nor letting off his shafts. Indeed, that formidable bow of his, the back\r\nof whose staff was decked with gold, was seen by people to be drawn into\r\na perpetual circle as he was employed in slaying his enemies. Then king\r\nYudhishthira, with a couple of broad-headed shafts, cut off the bow of\r\nthy son, O thou of Kuru's race, as the latter struggled in fight. And\r\nYudhishthira also pierced him deeply with ten excellent and foremost of\r\nshafts. Those arrows, however, touching the armour of Duryodhana, quickly\r\nbroke into pieces. Then the Parthas, filled with delight surrounded\r\nYudhishthira, like the celestials and great Rishis in days of old\r\nsurrounding Sakra on the occasion of the slaughter of Vritra. Thy valiant\r\nson then, taking up another bow, addressed king Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nPandu, saying, 'Wait, Wait,' and rushed against him. Beholding thy son\r\nthus advancing in great battle, the Panchalas, cheerfully and with hopes\r\nof victory, advanced to receive him. Then Drona, desirous of rescuing the\r\n(Kuru) king, received the rushing Panchalas, like a mountain receiving\r\nmasses of rain-charged clouds driven by tempest. The battle then, O king,\r\nthat took place there was exceedingly fierce, making the hair stand on\r\nend, between the Pandavas, O thou of mighty arms, and thy warriors.\r\nDreadful was the carnage of all creatures that then took place,\r\nresembling the sport of Rudra himself (at the end of the Yuga). Then\r\nthere arose a loud uproar at the place where Dhananjaya was. And that\r\nuproar, O lord, making the hair stand on end, rose above all other\r\nsounds. Thus, O mighty-armed one, progressed the battle between Arjuna\r\nand thy bowmen. Thus progressed the battle between Satyaki and thy men in\r\nthe midst of thy army. And thus continued the fight between Drona and his\r\nenemies at the gate of the array. Thus, indeed, O lord of the earth,\r\ncontinued that carnage on the earth, when Arjuna and Drona and the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Satyaki were all excited with wrath.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'In the afternoon of that day, O king, a dreadful battle,\r\ncharacterised by roars, deep as those of the clouds, once more occurred\r\nbetween Drona and the Somakas. That foremost of men, Drona, mounted on\r\nhis car of red steeds, and intent on battle rushed against the Pandavas,\r\nwith moderate speed. The valiant son of Bharadwaja, that great bowman\r\nendued with mighty strength, that hero born in an excellent pot, engaged\r\nin doing what was agreeable to thee, O king, and striking down, O\r\nBharata, many foremost of warriors with his whetted arrows, equipped with\r\nbeautiful wings, seemed to sport in that battle. Then that mighty\r\ncar-warrior of the Kaikeyas, Vrihatkshatra, irresistible in battle, and\r\nthe eldest of five brothers, rushed against him. Shooting many keen\r\nshafts, he greatly afflicted the preceptor, like a mighty mass of clouds\r\npouring torrents of rain on the mountain of Gandhamadana. Then Drona, O\r\nking, excited with wrath sped at him five and ten shafts whetted on stone\r\nand equipped with wings of gold. The prince of the Kekayas, however,\r\ncheerfully cut off every one of those shafts shot by Drona, and which\r\nresembled angry snakes of virulent poison, with five shafts of his own.\r\nBeholding that lightness of hand displayed by him that bull among\r\nBrahmanas, then, sped at him eight straight shafts. Seeing those shafts\r\nshot from Drona's bow, swiftly coursing towards him, Vrihatkshatra in\r\nthat battle resisted them with as many sharp shafts of his. Beholding\r\nthat exceedingly difficult feat achieved by Vrihatkshatra, thy troops, O\r\nking, were filled with amazement. Then Drona, O monarch, applauding\r\nVrihatkshatra, invoked into existence the irresistible and celestial\r\nweapon called Brahma in that battle. The prince of the Kekayas, seeing it\r\nshot by Drona in battle, baffled that Brahma weapon, O monarch, by a\r\nBrahma weapon of his own. After that weapon had been thus baffled,\r\nVrihatkshatra, O Bharata, pierced the Brahmana with sixty shafts whetted\r\non stone and equipped with wings of gold. Then Drona, that foremost of\r\nmen, pierced the prince of the Kekayas with a powerful shaft which,\r\npenetrating through the latter's armour, (passed through his body and)\r\nentered the earth. As a black cobra, O best of kings, pierces through an\r\nant-hill, even so did that shafts enter the earth, having pierced through\r\nthe body of the Kekaya prince in that battle. Deeply pierced, O monarch,\r\nwith the shafts of Drona, the prince of the Kekayas, filled with rage,\r\nand rolling his beautiful eyes, pierced Drona with seventy arrows whetted\r\non stone and equipped with wings of gold. And with another arrow he\r\ngreatly afflicted Drona's charioteer in this very vitals. Pierced by\r\nVrihatkshatra, O sire, with arrows, Drona shot showers of keen shafts at\r\nthe car of the Prince of the Kekayas. Depriving the mighty car-warrior,\r\nVrihatkshatra, of his coolness, Drona then, with four-winged arrows, slew\r\nthe four steeds of the former. With another arrow he felled\r\nVrihatkshatra's charioteer from his niche in the car. And felling on the\r\nearth, with two other arrows, his enemy's standard and umbrella, that\r\nbull among Brahmanas, with a third shaft well-shot from his bow, pierced\r\nVrihatkshatra himself in the chest. Thereupon, the latter, thus struck in\r\nthe chest, fell down from his car.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the slaughter, O king, of Vrihatkshatra, that mighty car-warrior\r\namong the Kaikeyas, the son of Sisupala, filled with rage, addressed his\r\ncharioteer, saying, 'O charioteer, proceed to the spot where Drona\r\nstayeth, clad in armour and engaged in slaying the Kaikeya and the\r\nPanchala hosts.' Hearing these words of his, the charioteer soon took\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors unto Drona, by means of those fleet steeds\r\nof the Kamvoja breed. Then Dhrishtaketu, that bull among the Chedis,\r\nswelling with might, rushed towards Drona for his own destruction like an\r\ninsect upon a blazing fire. Soon he pierced Drona and his steeds and car\r\nand standard with sixty shafts. And once more he struck him with many\r\nother keen shafts like a man rousing a sleeping tiger. Then Drona, with a\r\nsharp razor-faced arrow winged with vulturine feathers, cut off the\r\nmiddle of the bow of that mighty warrior struggling in battle. Then that\r\npowerful car-warrior, viz., the son of Sisupala, taking up another bow,\r\npierced Drona with many shafts winged with the feathers of Kankas and\r\npeacocks. Drona then, slaying with four shafts the four steeds of\r\nDhrishtaketu, smilingly cut off the head of the latter's charioteer from\r\nhis trunk. And then he pierced Dhrishtaketu himself with five and twenty\r\narrows. The prince of the Chedis then, quickly jumping down from his car,\r\ntook up a mace, and hurled it at the son of Bharadwaja like an angry\r\nsnake. Beholding that heavy mace, endued with the strength of adamant and\r\ndecked with gold, coursing towards him like Death, the son of Bharadwaja\r\ncut it off with many thousands of whetted arrows. That mace, cut off by\r\nBharadwaja's son, O sire, with many shafts, fell down, O Kaurava, making\r\nthe earth echo with its noise. Beholding his mace baffled, the wrathful\r\nand brave Dhrishtaketu hurled a lance and then a dart decked with gold.\r\nCutting off that lance with five shafts, Drona cut off that dart also\r\nwith five arrows. Both those missiles, thus cut off, fell down on the\r\nearth, like a couple of snakes mangled and torn by Garuda. The valiant\r\nson of Bharadwaja then, in that battle, sped for his destruction a keen\r\nshaft at Dhrishtaketu who was battling for the destruction of Bharadwaja\r\nhimself. That shaft, piercing through the armour and breast of\r\nDhrishtaketu of immeasurable energy, entered the earth, like a swan\r\ndiving into a lake overgrown with lotuses. As a hungry jay seizes and\r\ndevours a little insect, even so did the heroic Drona swallows up\r\nDhrishtaketu in that great battle. Upon the slaughter of the ruler of the\r\nChedis, his son who was conversant with the highest weapons, excited with\r\nwrath, sought to bear the burthen of his sire. Him also, Drona, smiling,\r\ndespatched to the abode of Yama by means of his shafts, like a huge and\r\nmighty tiger in the deep woods slaying an infant deer.\r\n\r\n\"While the Pandavas, O Bharata, were thus being thinned, the heroic, son\r\nof Jarasandha rushed towards Drona. Like the clouds shrouding the sun, he\r\nquickly made the mighty-armed Drona invisible in that battle by means of\r\nhis arrowy showers. Beholding that lightness of hand in him, Drona, that\r\ngrinder of Kshatriyas, quickly shot his shafts by hundreds and thousands.\r\nCovering (with his arrows) in that battle that foremost of car-warriors\r\nstationed on his car, Drona speedily slew the son Of Jarasandha in the\r\nvery sight of all bowmen. Indeed, Drona, resembling the Destroyer\r\nhimself, swallowing up every one who approached him then, like the\r\nDestroyer himself, swallowing up creatures when their hour arrives. Then\r\nDrona, O monarch, proclaiming his name in that battle, covered the\r\nPandavas with many thousands of shafts. Those shafts shot by Drona,\r\nwhetted on stone and engraved with his name, slew in that battle men and\r\nelephants and steeds by hundreds. Thus slaughtered by Drona, like the\r\nAsuras by Sakra, the Panchalas began to tremble like a herd of kine\r\nafflicted with cold. Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, when the Pandava\r\narmy was thus being slaughtered by Drona, there arose an awful wail of\r\nwoe from it. Scorched by the sun and slaughtered by means of those\r\narrows, the Panchalas then became filled with anxiety. Stupefied by\r\nBharadwaja's son with his arrowy showers in that battle the mighty\r\ncar-warriors among the Panchalas felt like persons whose thighs had been\r\nseized by alligators. Then, O king, the Chedis, the Srinjayas, the Kasis,\r\nand the Kosalas, rushed cheerfully against the son of Bharadwaja from\r\ndesire of battle. And the Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas\r\naddressed one another, saying, 'Drona is slain! Drona is slain!' Saying\r\nthese words, they rushed at that hero. Indeed, all these tigers among men\r\nfell with their utmost might upon the illustrious Drona, desirous of\r\ndespatching him to the abode of Yama. Then the son of Bharadwaja, by\r\nmeans of his shafts, despatched those brave warriors struggling\r\nvigorously in battle, especially those forest ones among the Chedis, into\r\nthe presence of the King of the dead. After those foremost ones among the\r\nChedis had been exterminated, the Panchalas, afflicted with the shafts of\r\nDrona, began to tremble. Beholding, O sire, those feats of Drona, they\r\nloudly called after Bhimasena and Dhrishtadyumna, O Bharata, and said,\r\n'This Brahmana hath, without doubt, practised the austerest of penances\r\nand acquired great ascetic merit. Inflamed with rage in battle, he\r\nconsumeth the foremost of Kshatriyas. A Kshatriya's duty is battle; a\r\nBrahmana's, the highest asceticism. A Brahmana endued with ascetic merit\r\nand learning, is capable of burning everything by his glances only. Many\r\nforemost of Kshatriyas, having approached the uncrossable and fierce fire\r\nof Drona's weapons, have, O Bharata, been blasted and consumed. The\r\nillustrious Drona, to the measure of his might, courage, and\r\nperseverance, stupefies all creatures and slays our troops!' Hearing\r\nthese words of theirs, the mighty Kshatradharman, rightly observant of\r\nthe duties of a Kshatriya, wrathfully cut off with a crescent-shaped\r\narrow the bow of Drona with arrow fixed thereon. Then Drona, that grinder\r\nof Kshatriyas, becoming more angry still, took up another bright bow,\r\ntougher than the one he had laid aside. Fixing on it a keen arrow,\r\ndestructive of hostile ranks, the preceptor, endued with great strength,\r\nsped it at the prince, drawing the bowstring to his ear. That arrow,\r\nslaying Kshatradharman entered the earth. His breast pierced through, he\r\nfell down from his vehicle on the earth. Upon the slaughter of\r\nDhrishtadyumna's son, the (Pandava) troops began to tremble. Then the\r\nmighty Chekitana fell upon Drona, Piercing Drona with ten arrows, he once\r\nmore pierced him with a shaft in the centre of his chest. And he pierced\r\nDrona's charioteer with four arrows and his four steeds also with four.\r\nThe Preceptor then pierced the right arm of Chekitana with sixteen\r\narrows, and his standard with sixteen, and his charioteer with seven.\r\nUpon the charioteer being slain, Chekitana's steeds fled away, dragging\r\nthe car after them. Beholding the steeds of Chekitana pierced with the\r\narrows of Bharadwaja's son, and his car also deprived of driver, the\r\nPanchalas and the Pandavas were filled with great fear. Drona then, O\r\nsire, routing on all sides the Panchalas and the Srinjayas united\r\ntogether in battle looked exceedingly resplendent. The venerable Drona,\r\nfull five and eighty years of age, dark in hue and with white locks\r\ndescending to his cars, careered in battle like a youth of sixteen.\r\nIndeed, O king, enemies regarded the foe-slaying Drona, as he fearlessly\r\ncareered in battle, to be none else than Indra himself armed with the\r\nthunder. Then, O monarch, the mighty-armed Drupada of great intelligence\r\nsaid, 'This one (Drona) is slaying the Kshatriyas like a hungry tiger\r\nslaying smaller animals. The sinful Duryodhana of wicked soul will\r\nassuredly obtain the most miserable regions (in the next world). It is\r\nthrough his covetousness that many foremost of the Kshatriyas, slain in\r\nbattle, lay prostrate on the field, like mangled bulls, weltering in\r\nblood and becoming the food of dogs and jackals.' Saying these words, O\r\nmonarch, Drupada, that master of an Akshauhini of troops, placing the\r\nParthas at his head, rushed with speed towards Drona.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'When the army of the Pandavas was thus agitated on all\r\nsides, the Parthas and the Panchalas and the Somakas, retreated to a\r\ngreat distance. During the progress of that fierce battle, making the\r\nhair stand on end, and that universal carnage like to what happens, O\r\nBharata, at that end of the Yuga, when, indeed, Drona of great prowess\r\nwas repeatedly uttering leonine shouts, and when the Panchalas were being\r\nweakened and the Pandavas slaughtered, king Yudhishthira the Just,\r\nfailing in that battle to find any refuge in that distress, began, O\r\nking, to think how the matter would end. Casting his eyes around in\r\nexpectation of seeing Savyasachin, Yudhishthira, however, saw neither\r\nthat son of Pritha nor Madhava. Not seeing that tiger among men viz., the\r\nape-bannered Arjuna, and not hearing also the twang of Gandiva, the\r\nmonarch became filled with anxiety, not seeing Satyaki also, that\r\nforemost of car-warriors among the Vrishnis, king Yudhishthira the Just\r\nbecame equally anxious. Indeed, not seeing those two foremost of men,\r\nYudhishthira knew no peace. The high-souled king Yudhishthira the Just,\r\nof mighty arms, fearing the evil opinion of the world, began to think of\r\nSatyaki's car. Sini's grandson Satyaki, of true prowess, that dispeller\r\nof the fears of friends, hath been sent by me in the track of Phalguna. I\r\nhad only one source of anxiety before, but now I have two. I should have\r\ntidings of both Satyaki and Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu. Having\r\ndespatched Satyaki to follow in the track of Arjuna, whom shall I now\r\nsend in the track of Satyaki? If by every means I endeavour to obtain\r\nintelligence of my brother only, without enquiring after Yuyudhana, the\r\nworld will reproach me. They will say that, 'Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nDharma, having enquired after his brother, leaves Satyaki of Vrishni's\r\nrace, that hero of unfailing prowess, to his fate!' Fearing, as I do, the\r\nreproach of the world, I should therefore, send Vrikodara, the son of\r\nPritha, in the track of the high-souled Madhava. The love I bear to the\r\nVrishni hero, to that invincible warrior of the Satwata race, (viz.,\r\nSatyaki), is not less than the love I bear to Arjuna, that slayer of\r\nfoes. The delighter of the Sinis hath again, been set by me to a very\r\nheavy task. That mighty warrior, however, hath, either for the sake of a\r\nfriend's request or for that of honour, penetrated into the Bharata army\r\nlike a Makara into the ocean. Loud is the noise I hear of unretreating\r\nheroes, fighting together against that Vrishni hero of great\r\nintelligence. Without doubt, they are too many for him. The time,\r\ntherefore, is come when I should think of his rescue. It seems to me that\r\narmed with the bow, Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, should go there where\r\nthose two mighty car-warriors are. There is nothing on earth that Bhima\r\ncannot bear. If he struggles with resolution, he is a match in battle for\r\nall the bowmen in the world. Depending on the might of his own arms, he\r\ncan stand against all foes. Relying on the strength of arms of that\r\nhigh-souled warrior, we have been able to come back from our exile in the\r\nwoods and we have never been vanquished in battle. If Bhimasena, the son\r\nof Pandu, proceedeth hence to Satyaki, both Satyaki and Phalguna will\r\nderive real aid. Without doubt, I should not feel any anxiety for Satyaki\r\nand Phalguna. Both of them are accomplished in weapons, and Vasudeva\r\nhimself is protecting them. (For all that, I feel anxious on their\r\naccount), I should certainly seek to remove my anxiety. I shall,\r\ntherefore, set Bhima to follow in the wake of Satyaki. Having done this,\r\nI should regard my arrangements complete for the rescue of Satyaki.'\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma, having settled this in his mind,\r\naddressed his charioteer and said, 'Take me to Bhima.' Hearing the\r\ncommand of king Yudhishthira the Just, the charioteer who was versed in\r\nhorse-lore, took that car decked with gold to where Bhima was. Arrived at\r\nthe presence of Bhima, the king, remembering the occasion, became\r\nunmanned by grief, and pressed Bhima with diverse solicitations. Indeed,\r\noverwhelmed with grief, the monarch addressed Bhima. And these were the\r\nwords, O king, that Yudhishthira the son of Kunti then said unto him, 'O\r\nBhima, I do not behold the standard of that Arjuna, who on a single car\r\nhad vanquished all the gods, the Gandharvas and Asuras!' Then Bhimasena,\r\naddressing king Yudhishthira the Just who was in that plight, said,\r\n'Never before did I see, or hear thy 'Words afflicted with such\r\ncheerlessness. Indeed, formerly, when we were smitten with grief, it was\r\nthou who hadst been our comforter. Rise, Rise, O king of kings, say what\r\nI am to do for thee. O giver of honours, there is nothing that I cannot\r\ndo. Tell me what your commands are, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Do not\r\nset your heart on grief.' Unto Bhimasena then, the king with a sorrowful\r\nface and with eyes bathed in tears, said, sighing the while like a black\r\ncobra, 'The blasts of the conch Panchajanya, wrathfully blown by Vasudeva\r\nof world-wide renown, are being heard. It seems, from this, that thy\r\nbrother Dhananjaya lieth today on the field, deprived of life. Without\r\ndoubt, Arjuna having been slain, Janardana is fighting. That hero of\r\ngreat might, relying on whose prowess the Pandavas are alive, he to whom\r\nwe always turn in times of fear like the celestials towards their chief\r\nof a thousand eyes, that hero hath, in search after the ruler of Sindhus,\r\npenetrated into the Bharata host. I know this, O Bhima, viz., that he\r\nhath gone, but he hath not yet returned. Dark in complexion, youthful in\r\nyears, of curly locks, exceedingly handsome mighty car-warrior, of broad\r\nchest and long arms, possessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, of\r\neyes of the colour of burnished copper and like those a chakra, that\r\nbrother of thine enhances the fears of foes. Blessed be thou, even this\r\nis the cause of my grief, O chastiser of foes! For Arjuna's sake, O thou\r\nof mighty arms, as also for the sake of Satwata, my grief increaseth like\r\na blazing fire fed with libations of clarified butter. I do not see his\r\nstandard. For this am I stupefied with sorrow. Without doubt, he hath\r\nbeen slain, and Krishna, skilled in battle, is fighting. Know also that\r\nthe tiger among men, that mighty car-warrior, Satwata is slain. Alas!\r\nSatyaki hath followed in the wake of that other mighty car-warrior, with\r\nthy brother. Without seeing Satyaki also, I am stupefied by grief.\r\nTherefore, O son of Kunti, go thither, where Dhananjaya is and Satyaki\r\nalso of mighty energy, if, of course, thou thinkest it thy duty to obey\r\nmy words, O thou that art acquainted with duty.' Remember that I am thy\r\neldest brother. Thou shouldst think Satyaki to be dearer to thee than\r\nArjuna himself. O son of Pritha, Satyaki hath gone, from desire of doing\r\ngood to me, in the track of Arjuna, a track that is incapable of being\r\ntrod by persons of vile souls. Beholding the two Krishnas and Satyaki\r\nalso of the Satwata race sound and whole, send me a message, O son of\r\nPandu, by uttering a leonine roar.'\""

Indeed,\r\nBhimasena of mighty strength addressing Dhrishtadyumna, said, 'It is\r\nknown to thee, O thou of mighty arms, how the mighty car-warrior Drona is\r\nalways on the alert to seize king Yudhishthira the Just by all means in\r\nhis power. Indeed, O son of Prishata, I should never place my going (to\r\nArjuna and Satyaki) above my duty of protecting the king. King\r\nYudhishthira, however, hath commanded me to go, I dare not contradict\r\nhim. I shall go thither where the ruler of the Sindhus stayeth, at the\r\npoint of death.

Thus addressed by Vrikodara, O monarch,\r\nDhrishtadyumna replied, 'I shall do what thou wishest. Go, O son of\r\nPritha, without any anxiety of the kind. Without slaying Dhrishtadyumna\r\nin battle, Drona will never be able to humiliate king Yudhishthira in the\r\nfight.' Thus making the royal son of Pandu over to Dhrishtadyumna, and\r\nsaluting his elder brother, Bhimasena, proceeded towards the spot where\r\nPhalguna was. Before dismissing him, however, king Yudhishthira the Just,\r\nO Bharata, embraced Bhimasena and smelt his head and pronounced\r\nauspicious blessings upon him. After circumambulating a number of\r\nBrahmanas, gratified with worship and presents, and touching the eight\r\nkinds of auspicious articles, and quaffing Kairataka honey, that hero,\r\nthe corners of whose eyes had become red in intoxication, felt his might\r\nto be doubled. The Brahmanas performed propitiatory ceremonies for him.\r\nVarious omens, indicative of success, greeted him. Beholding them, he\r\nfelt the delight of anticipated victory. Favourable winds began to blow\r\nand indicate his success. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, the foremost\r\nof car-warriors, clad in mail, decked with earrings and Angadas, and his\r\nhands cased in leathern fences, mounted on his own excellent car. His\r\ncostly coat of mail, made of black steel and decked with gold, looked\r\nlike a cloud charged with lightning. His body Was beautifully covered\r\nwith yellow and red and black and white robes. Wearing a coloured cuirass\r\nthat protected also his neck, Bhimasena looked resplendent like a cloud\r\ndecked with a rainbow.\r\n\r\n\"While Bhimasena was on the point of setting out against thy troops from\r\ndesire of battle, the fierce blasts of Panchajanya were once more heard.\r\nHearing those loud and terrible blasts, capable of filling the three\r\nWorlds with fear, the son of Dharma once more addressed Bhimasena,\r\nsaying, 'There, the Vrishni hero is fiercely blowing his conch. Indeed,\r\nthat Prince of conchs is filling the earth and the welkin with its sound.\r\nWithout doubt, Savyasachin having fallen into great distress, the bearer\r\nof the discus and the mace is battling with all the Kurus. Without doubt,\r\nthe venerable Kunti, and Draupadi, and Subhadra, are all, with their\r\nrelatives and friends, beholding today exceedingly inauspicious omens.\r\nTherefore, O Bhima, go thither with speed where Dhananjaya is. All the\r\npoints of the compass, O Partha, seem empty to my eyes in consequence of\r\nmy (unsatisfied) desire to see Dhananjaya and owing also to Satwata.,\r\nRepeatedly urged by his superior to go, the valiant son of Pandu, viz.,\r\nBhimasena, O king, casing his hands in leathern fence, took up his bow.\r\nUrged by his eldest brother, that brother, Bhimasena, who was devoted to\r\nhis brother's good, caused drums to be beat. And Bhima forcibly blew his\r\nconch also and uttering leonine roars, began to twang his bow. Damping\r\nthe hearts of hostile heroes by those leonine roars, and assuming a\r\ndreadful form, he rushed against his foes. Swift and well-broken steeds\r\nof the foremost breed neighing furiously, bore him. Endued with the speed\r\nof the wind or thought, their reins were held by Visoka. Then the son of\r\nPritha, drawing the bowstring with great force, began to crush the head\r\nof the hostile array, mangling and piercing the combatants there. And as\r\nthat mighty-armed hero proceeded, the brave Panchalas and the Somakas\r\nfollowed him behind, like the celestials following Maghavat. Then the\r\nbrothers Duhsasana and Chitrasena. and Kundabhedin and Vivinsati, and\r\nDurmukha and Duhsaha and Sala, and Vinda and Anuvinda and Sumukha and\r\nDirghavahu and Sudarsana, and Suhasta and Sushena. and Dirghalochana, and\r\nAbhaya and Raudrakarman and Suvarman and Durvimochana, approaching,\r\nencompassed Bhimasena. These foremost of car-warriors, these heroes, all\r\nlooking resplendent, with their troops and followers, firmly resolved\r\nupon battle, rushed against Bhimasena. That heroic and mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Kunti's son Bhimasena of great prowess, thus\r\nencompassed, cast his eyes on them, and rushed against them with the\r\nimpetuosity of a lion against smaller animals. Those heroes, displaying\r\ncelestial and mighty weapons, covered Bhima with shafts, like clouds\r\nshrouding the risen sun. Transgressing all those warriors with\r\nimpetuosity, Bhimasena rushed against Drona's division, and covered the\r\nelephant-force before him with showers of arrows. The son of the\r\nWind-god, mangling with his shafts almost in no time that elephant\r\ndivision dispersed it in all directions. Indeed, like animals terrified\r\nin the forest at the roar of a Sarabha, those elephants all fled away,\r\nuttering frightful cries. Passing over that ground with speed, he then\r\napproached the division of Drona. Then the preceptor checked his course,\r\nlike the continent resisting the surging sea. Smilingly, he struck the\r\nson of Pandu in his forehead with a shaft. Thereupon, the son of Pandu\r\nlooked resplendent like the sun with upward rays. The preceptor thought\r\nthat Bhima would show him reverence as Phalguna had done before.\r\nAddressing Vrikodara, therefore, he said, 'O Bhimasena, it is beyond thy\r\npower to enter into the hostile host, without vanquishing me, thy foe, in\r\nbattle, O thou of mighty strength! Although Krishna with thy younger\r\nbrother hath penetrated this host with my permission, thyself, however,\r\nwill never succeed in doing so.' Hearing these words of the preceptor,\r\nthe dauntless Bhima, excited with wrath, and his eyes red as blood or\r\nburnished copper, quickly replied unto Drona, saying, 'O wretch of a\r\nBrahmana, it cannot be that Arjuna hath entered this host with thy\r\npermission. He is invisible. He would penetrate into the host commanded\r\nby Sakra himself. If he offered thee reverential worship, it was only for\r\nhonouring thee. But know, O Drona, that myself, I am not compassionate\r\nlike Arjuna. On the other hand, I am Bhimasena, thy foe. We regard thee\r\nas our father, preceptor, and friend. Ourselves we look upon as thy sons.\r\nThinking so we always humble ourselves to thee. When, however, thou usest\r\nsuch words towards us today, it seems that all that is altered. If thou\r\nregardest thyself as our foe, let it be as thou thinkest. Being none else\r\nthan Bhima, I will presently act towards thee as I should towards a foe.'\r\nSaying this, Bhima whirling a mace, like the Destroyer himself whirling\r\nhis fatal rod, hurled it, O king, at Drona. Drona, however, had quickly\r\njumped down from his car, (and that proved his safety). For that mace\r\npressed down into the earth the car of Drona, with its steeds, driver,\r\nand standard. Then Bhima crushed numerous warriors like the tempest\r\ncrushing trees with its force. Then those sons of thine once more\r\nencompassed that foremost of car-warriors. Meanwhile, Drona, that\r\nforemost of smiters mounting another chariot, proceeded to the gate of\r\nthe array and stayed there for battle. Then, O king, the angry Bhima of\r\ngreat prowess, covered the car-division in his front with showers of\r\nshafts. Then those mighty car-warriors, viz., thy sons, thus struck in\r\nbattle, endued as they were with great strength fought with Bhima from\r\ndesire of victory. Then Duhsasana, excited with wrath, hurled at\r\nBhimasena a keen dart made entirely of iron, wishing to slay the son of\r\nPandu. Bhima however, cut in twain that fierce dart hurled by thy son, as\r\nit coursed towards him. This feat seemed exceedingly wonderful. The\r\nmighty son of Pandu, then, with three other keen shafts, slew the three\r\nbrothers Kundabhedin and Sushena and Dirghanetra. And, again, amongst\r\nthose heroic sons of thine battling with him, Bhima slew heroic\r\nVrindaraka, that enhancer of the fame of the Kurus. And again, with three\r\nother shafts, Bhima slew three other sons of thine, viz., Abhaya and\r\nRaudrakarman and Durvimochana. Thus slaughtered, O king, by that mighty\r\nwarrior, thy sons surrounded, Bhima, that foremost of smiters on all\r\nsides. They then showered their arrows upon that son of Pandu, of\r\nterrible deeds, like the cloud at the end of summer pouring torrents of\r\nrain on the mountain-breast. That slayer of hosts, the heir of Pandu,\r\nreceived that arrowy shower, like a mountain receiving a shower of\r\nstones. Indeed, the heroic Bhima felt no pain. Then the son of Kunti,\r\nsmiling the while, despatched by means of his shafts thy son Vinda and\r\nAnuvinda and Suvarman to the abode of Yama. Then the son of Pandu, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race, quickly pierced in that battle thy heroic son\r\nSudarsan. The latter, thereupon, fell down and expired. Within a very\r\nshort time, the son of Pandu, casting his glances on that car-force\r\ncaused it by his shafts to fly away in all directions. Then like a herd\r\nof deer frightened at the clatter of car-wheels, or a loud shout, thy\r\nsons, in that battle, O king, afflicted with the fear of Bhimasena,\r\nsuddenly broke and fled. The son of Kunti, however, pursued that large\r\nforce of thy sons, and began, O king, to pierce the Kauravas from every\r\nside. Thy soldiers, O monarch, thus slaughtered by Bhimasena, fled away\r\nfrom battle, avoiding the son of Pandu and urging their own excellent\r\nsteeds to their greatest speed. The mighty Bhimasena then, having\r\nvanquished them in battle, uttered leonine roars and made a great noise\r\nby slapping his armpits. And the mighty Bhima, having made also a fierce\r\nnoise with his palms, and thereby frightened that car-force and the\r\nforemost of warriors that were in it, passed towards the division of\r\nDrona, transgressing that car-force (which he had vanquished.)'"

Stupefying thy force then with his\r\npowers of illusion, and drinking, as it were, those shafts shot from the\r\nbow of Drona, Bhimasena rushed against those brothers (viz., thy sons).\r\nThen many kings, that were all great bowmen, urged by thy sons, rushing\r\nimpetuously, began to surround him. Encompassed by them, O Bharata, Bhima\r\nsmiling the while and uttering a leonine roar, took up and hurled at them\r\nwith great force a fierce mace destructive of hostile ranks. That mace of\r\nadamantine strength, hurled like Indra's thunder by Indra himself,\r\ncrushed, O king, thy soldiers in battle. And it seemed to fill, O king,\r\nthe whole earth with loud noise. And blazing forth in splendour, that\r\nfierce mace inspired thy sons with fear. Beholding that mace of impetuous\r\ncourse and endued with lightning flashes, coursing towards them, thy\r\nwarriors fled away, uttering frightful cries. And at the unbearable\r\nsound, O sire, of that fierce mace, many men fell down where they stood,\r\nand many car-warriors also fell down from their cars. Slaughtered by\r\nBhimasena armed with the mace, thy warriors fled away in fear from\r\nbattle, like the deer attacked by a tiger. The son of Kunti, routing in\r\nbattle those valorous foes of his, impetuously crossed that force like\r\nGaruda of beautiful feathers.\r\n\r\n\"While Bhimasena, that leader of leaders of car-divisions, was engaged in\r\nsuch carnage, Bharadwaja's son, O king, rushed at him. And Drona,\r\nchecking Bhima by means of his arrowy showers, suddenly uttered a leonine\r\nroar that inspired the Pandavas with fear. The battle that took place\r\nbetween Drona and the high-souled Bhima was, O king, furious and terrible\r\nand resembled the encounter between the gods and the Asuras of old.\r\nHeroic warriors by hundreds and thousands in that battle slain by the\r\nkeen shafts shot from the bow of Drona. The son of Pandu then, jumping\r\ndown from his car shut his eyes, O king, and rushed on foot with great\r\nspeed towards the car of Drona. Indeed, as a bovine bull easily bears a\r\nheavy shower of rain, even so that tiger among men, viz., Bhima, bore\r\nthat arrowy downpour from Drona's bow. Struck in that battle, o sire, by\r\nDrona, the mighty Bhima, seizing Drona's car by the shaft, threw it down\r\nwith great force. Thus thrown down in battle, O king, Drona, however,\r\nquickly mounting another car, proceeded towards the gate of the array,\r\nhis driver urging his steeds at that time with great speed. That feat, O\r\nthou of Kuru's race, achieved by Bhimasena, seemed exceedingly wonderful.\r\nThe mighty Bhima, then, mounting upon his own car, rushed impetuously\r\ntowards the army of thy son. And he crushed the Kshatriyas in battle,\r\nlike a tempest crushing rows of trees. Indeed, Bhima proceeded, resisting\r\nthe hostile warriors like the mountain resisting the surging sea. Coming\r\nthen upon the Bhoja-troops that were protected by the son of Hridika,\r\nBhimasena, O king, ground it greatly, and passed through it. Frightening\r\nthe hostile soldiers with the sound of his palms, O sire, Bhima\r\nvanquished them all like a tiger vanquishing a herd of bovine bulls.\r\nPassing through the Bhoja division and that of the Kamvojas also, and\r\ncountless tribes of Mlecchas too, who were all accomplished in fight, and\r\nbeholding that mighty car-warriors, Satyaki, engaged in fight, Bhimasena,\r\nthe son of Kunti, O monarch proceeded resolutely and with great speed,\r\ndesirous of having a sight of Dhananjaya. Transgressing all thy warriors\r\nin that battle, the son of Pandu then sighted the mighty car-warrior\r\nArjuna engaged in the fight. The valiant Bhima, that tiger among men,\r\nbeholding Arjuna putting forth his prowess for the slaughter of the ruler\r\nof the Sindhus, uttered a loud shout, like, O monarch, the clouds roaring\r\nin the season of rains. Those terrible shouts of the roaring Bhimasena\r\nwere, O thou of Kuru's race, heard by both Arjuna and Vasudeva in the\r\nmidst of the battle. Both those heroes, simultaneously hearing that shout\r\nof the mighty Bhima, repeatedly shouted from desire of beholding\r\nVrikodara Then Arjuna uttering loud roar, and Madhava also doing the\r\nsame, careered in battle like a couple of roaring bulls. Hearing then\r\nthat roar of Bhimasena, as also that of Phalguna armed with the bow,\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma, O king, became highly gratified. And\r\nking Yudhishthira, hearing those sounds of Bhima and Arjuna, had his\r\ngrief dispelled. And the lord Yudhishthira repeatedly wished success to\r\nDhananjaya in battle.\r\n\r\n\"While the fierce Bhima was thus roaring, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira,\r\nthe son of Dharma, that foremost of virtuous men, smilingly reflected a\r\nwhile and thus worded the thoughts that inspired his heart, 'O Bhima,\r\nthou hast truly sent me the message. Thou hast truly obeyed the commands\r\nof thy superior. They, O son of Pandu, can never have victory that have\r\nthee for their foe. By good luck it is that Dhananjaya, capable of\r\nshooting the bow with (even) his left hand, still liveth. By good luck,\r\nthe heroic Satyaki also, of prowess incapable of being baffled, is safe\r\nand sound. By good luck, it is that I hear both Vasudeva and Dhananjaya\r\nuttering these roars. He who having vanquished Sakra himself in battle,\r\nhad gratified the bearer of sacrificial libations, that slayer of foes,\r\nviz., Phalguna, by good luck, still liveth in this battle. He, relying\r\nupon the might of whose arms all of us are alive, that slayer of hostile\r\narmies, Phalguna, by good luck, liveth still. He by whom with the aid of\r\na single bow the Nivatakavachas were vanquished, those Danavas, that is,\r\nthat were incapable of being defeated by the very gods, he, viz., Partha,\r\nby good luck, liveth still. He who had vanquished in Matsya's city all\r\nthe Kauravas assembled together for seizing Virata's kine, that Partha,\r\nby good luck, liveth still. He who, by the might of his arms, slew\r\nfourteen thousands of Kalakeyas, that Partha, by good luck, liveth still.\r\nHe who, for Duryodhana's sake, had vanquished, by the energy of his\r\nweapons, the mighty king of the Gandharvas, that Partha, by good luck,\r\nliveth still. Decked with diadem and garlands (of gold), endued with\r\ngreat strength, having white steeds (yoked to his car) and Krishna\r\nhimself for his charioteer, that Phalguna, always dear to me, by good\r\nluck, liveth still. Burning with grief on account of the death of his\r\nson, endeavouring to achieve a most difficult feat, and even now seeking\r\nto slaughter Jayadratha, alas, he that hath made that vow, viz.,\r\nDhananjaya, will he succeed in slaying the ruler of the Sindhus in\r\nbattle? After he, protected by Vasudeva, will have accomplished that vow\r\nof his, shall I behold that Arjuna again, before the sun sets? Shall the\r\nruler of the Sindhus who is devoted to Duryodhana's welfare, slain by\r\nPhalguna, gladden his foes? Shall king Duryodhana, beholding the ruler of\r\nthe Sindhus slain in battle make peace with us? Beholding his brother\r\nslain in battle by Bhimasena shall the wicked Duryodhana make peace with\r\nus? Beholding other great warriors lying prostrate on the surface of the\r\nearth, shall wicked Duryodhana give way to remorse? Shall not our\r\nhostilities cease with the single sacrifice of Bhishma? Shall that\r\nSuyodhana, make peace with us for saving the remnant (of what is still\r\nleft to him and us)? Diverse reflections of this kind passed through the\r\nmind of king Yudhishthira who was overwhelmed with compassion. Meanwhile,\r\nthe battle (between the Pandavas and the Kauravas) raged furiously.'\""

I do not behold that warrior, O Sanjaya, in\r\nthe three worlds, who is capable of staying before the enraged Bhimasena\r\nin battle. I do not, O son, behold him that can stay on the field of\r\nbattle before Bhimasena armed with mace and resembling Death himself. Who\r\nwill stand before that Bhima, not excepting Sakra himself, that destroys\r\na car with a car and an elephant with an elephant?[153] Who, amongst\r\nthose devoted to Duryodhana's welfare stood in battle before Bhimasena\r\nexcited with rage and engaged in slaughtering my sons? Who were those men\r\nthat stood in battle in front of Bhimasena, engaged in consuming my sons\r\nlike a forest conflagration consuming dry leaves and straw? Who were they\r\nthat surrounded Bhima in battle, beholding my sons slain by him one after\r\nanother like Death himself cutting off all creatures? I do not fear\r\nArjuna so much, or Krishna so much, or Satyaki so much, or him (viz.,\r\nDhrishtadyumna) so much who was born of the sacrificial fire, as I fear\r\nBhima. Tell me, O Sanjaya, who were those heroes that rushed against that\r\nblazing fire, represented by Bhima, which so consumed my sons?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya, said, 'While the mighty car-warriors Bhimasena was uttering\r\nthose roars, mighty Karna, unable to bear them, rushed at him with a loud\r\nshout, stretching his bow with great force. Indeed, the mighty Karna,\r\ndesirous of battle, displayed his strength and checked Bhima's course\r\nlike a tall tree withstanding tempest. The heroic Bhima also, beholding\r\nVikartana's son before him, suddenly blazed up in wrath and sped at him\r\nwith great force many shafts whetted on stone. Karna received all those\r\nshafts and sped many in return. At that encounter between Bhima and\r\nKarna, hearing the sounds of their palms, the limbs of all the struggling\r\ncombatants, car-warriors, and horsemen, began to tremble. Indeed, hearing\r\nthe terrible roars of Bhimasena on the field of battle, even all the\r\nforemost of Kshatriyas regarded the whole earth and the welkin to be\r\nfilled with that noise. And at the fierce peals uttered by the\r\nhigh-souled son of Pandu, the bows of all warriors in that battle dropped\r\non the earth. And steeds and elephants, O king, dispirited, ejected urine\r\nand excreta. Various frightful omens of evil then made their appearance.\r\nThe welkin was covered with flights of vultures and Kankas during that\r\nterrific encounter between Bhima and Karna. Then Karna struck Bhima with\r\ntwenty arrows, and quickly pierced the latter's charioteer also with\r\nfive. Smiling the while, the mighty and active Bhima then, in that\r\nbattle, quickly sped at Karna four and sixty arrows. Then Karna, O king,\r\nsped four shafts at him. Bhima, by means of his straight shafts, cut them\r\ninto many fragments, O king, displaying his lightness of hand. Then Karna\r\ncovered him with dense showers of arrows. Thus covered by Karna, the\r\nmighty son of Pandu, however, cut off Karna's bow at the handle and then\r\npierced Karna with ten straight arrows. The Suta's son then, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior of terrible deeds, taking up another bow and stringing it\r\nquickly, pierced Bhima in that battle (with many shafts). Then Bhima,\r\nexcited with rage, struck the Suta's son with great force on the chest\r\nwith three straight shafts. With those arrows sticking at his breast,\r\nKarna looked beautiful, O bull of Bharata's race, like a mountain with\r\nthree tall summits. Thus pierced with mighty shafts, blood began to flow\r\nfrom his wounds, like torrents of liquid red-chalk down the breast of a\r\nmountain. Afflicted with those shafts shot with great force, Karna became\r\nagitated a little. Fixing an arrow then on his bow, he pierced Bhima,\r\nagain, O sire! And once more he began to shoot arrows by hundreds and\r\nthousands. Suddenly shrouded with shafts by that firm bowman, viz.,\r\nKarna, the son of Pandu, smiling the while, cut off Karna's bow-string.\r\nAnd then with a broad-headed arrow, he despatched Karna's charioteer to\r\nthe abode of Yama. And that mighty car-warrior, viz., Bhima, deprived the\r\nfour steeds also of Karna of their lives. The mighty car-warrior Karna\r\nthen speedily jumping down, O king, from his steedless car, mounted the\r\ncar of Vrishasena. The valiant Bhimasena then, having vanquished Karna in\r\nbattle, uttered a loud shout deep as the roar of the clouds. Hearing that\r\nroar, O Bharata, Yudhishthira became highly gratified, knowing that Karna\r\nhad been vanquished by Bhimasena. And the combatants of the Pandava army\r\nblew their conchs from every side, Their enemies, viz., thy warriors,\r\nhearing that noise, roared loudly. Arjuna stretched Gandiva, and Krishna\r\nblew Panchajanya. Drowning, however, all those sounds, the noise made by\r\nthe roaring Bhima, was, O king, heard by all the combatants, O sire! Then\r\nthose two warriors, viz., Karna, and Bhima, each struck the other with\r\nstraight shafts. The son of Radha, however, shot shafts mildly, but the\r\nson of Pandu shot his with great force.'\""

And Duryodhana went to the\r\npreceptor, on his single car, thinking, by the way, of diverse duties.\r\nThat car of thy son, endued with the speed of the wind or thought,\r\nproceeded with great celerity towards Drona. With eyes red in wrath, thy\r\nson addressed the preceptor and said, 'O grinder of foes, Arjuna and\r\nBhimasena, and unvanquished Satyaki, and many mighty car-warriors,\r\ndefeating all our troops, have succeeded in approaching the ruler of the\r\nSindhus. Indeed, those mighty car-warriors, who vanquished all the\r\ntroops, themselves unvanquished, are fighting even there. O giver of\r\nhonours, how hast thou been transgressed by both Satyaki and Bhima? O\r\nforemost of Brahmanas, this thy defeat at the hands of Satwata, of\r\nArjuna, and of Bhimasena, is like the drying of the ocean, exceedingly\r\nwonderful in this world. People are loudly asking, 'How, indeed, could\r\nDrona, that master of the science of arms, be vanquished?' Even thus all\r\nthe warriors are speaking in depreciation of thee. Destruction is certain\r\nfor my luckless self in battle, when three car-warriors, O tiger among\r\nmen, have if, succession transgressed thee. When, however, all this hath\r\nhappened, tell us what thou hast to say on the business that awaits us.\r\nWhat hath happened, is past. O giver of honours, think now of what is\r\nremaining. Say quickly what should next be done for the ruler of the\r\nSindhus on the present occasion, and let what thou sayest be quickly and\r\nproperly carried out.'\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, 'Listen, O great king, to what I, having reflected much, say\r\nunto thee about what should now be done. As yet only three great\r\ncar-warriors among the Pandavas have transgressed us. We have as much to\r\nfear behind those three as we have to dread before them.[154] There,\r\nhowever, where Krishna and Dhananjaya are, our fear must be greater. The\r\nBharata army hath been attacked both on the front and from behind. In\r\nthis pass, I think, the protection of the ruler of the Sindhus is our\r\nfirst duty. Jayadratha, afraid of Dhananjaya, deserves of everything else\r\nto be protected by us. The heroic Yuyudhana and Vrikodara have both gone\r\nagainst the ruler of the Sindhus. All this that hath come is the fruit of\r\nthat match at dice conceived by Sakuni's intellect. Neither victory nor\r\ndefeat took place in the (gaming) assembly. Now that we are engaged in\r\nthis sport, there will be victory or defeat. Those innocent things with\r\nwhich Sakuni had formerly played in the Kuru assembly and which he\r\nregarded as dice, were, in reality, invincible shafts. Truly, there\r\nwhere, O sire, the Kauravas were congregated, they were not dice but\r\nterrible arrows capable of mangling your bodies. At present, however, O\r\nking, know the combatants for players, these shafts for dice, and the\r\nruler of the Sindhus, without doubt, O monarch, as the stake, in this\r\ngame of battle. Indeed, Jayadratha is the great stake about which we are\r\nplaying today with the enemy. Under the circumstances, therefore, O\r\nmonarch, all of us becoming reckless of our very lives, should make due\r\narrangements for the protection of the ruler of the Sindhus in battle.\r\nEngaged as we are in our present sport, it is here that we shall have\r\nvictory or defeat, here, that is, where those great bowmen are protecting\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus. Go thither, therefore, with speed, and protect\r\nthose protectors (of Jayadratha). As regards myself, I will stay here,\r\nfor despatching others (to the presence of Jayadratha) and checking the\r\nPanchalas, the Pandus and the Srinjayas united together. Thus commanded\r\nby the preceptor, Duryodhana quickly proceeded (to the place indicated)\r\nwith his followers, resolutely setting himself to (the accomplishment of)\r\na fierce task. The two protectors of the wheels of Arjuna's car, viz.,\r\nthe Panchala princes, Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, were at that time\r\nproceeding towards Savyasachin by the skirts of the Kuru array. Thou\r\nmayest remember, O king, that formerly while Arjuna penetrated thy host\r\nfrom desire of battle, those two princes, O monarch, had been checked in\r\ntheir progress by Kritavarman. Now, the Kuru king beheld them proceeding\r\nby the skirts of his host. The mighty Duryodhana of Bharata's race lost\r\nno time in engaging in a fierce battle with those two brothers thus\r\nrushing furiously. Those two foremost of Kshatriyas, reputed as mighty\r\ncar-warriors, then rushed in that battle at Duryodhana, with outstretched\r\nbows. Yudhamanyu pierced Duryodhana with twenty, and his four steeds with\r\nfour shafts. Duryodhana, however, with a single shaft, cut off\r\nYudhamanyu's standard. And thy son then cut off the former's bow also\r\nwith another shaft. And then with a broad-headed arrow, the Kuru king\r\nfelled Yudhamanyu's charioteer from his niche in the car. And then he\r\npierced the four steeds of the latter with four shafts. Then Yudhamanyu,\r\nexcited with wrath, quickly sped, in that battle, thirty shafts at the\r\ncentre of thy son's chest. Then Uttamaujas also, excited with wrath,\r\npierced Duryodhana's charioteer with shafts decked with gold, and\r\ndespatched him to Yama's abode. Duryodhana also, O monarch, then slew the\r\nfour steeds as also the two Parshni charioteers of Uttamaujas, the prince\r\nof Panchalas. Then Uttamaujas, in that battle, becoming steedless and\r\ndriverless, quickly ascended the car of his brother, Yudhamanyu.\r\nAscending on the car of his brother, he struck Duryodhana's steeds with\r\nmany shafts. Slain therewith, those steeds fell down on the earth. Upon\r\nthe fall of his steeds, the valiant Yudhamanyu then, by a mighty weapon,\r\nquickly cut off Duryodhana's bow and then (with another shaft), his\r\nleathern fence. That bull among men then, viz., thy son, jumping down\r\nfrom that steedless and driverless car, took up a mace and proceeded\r\nagainst the two princes of Panchala. Beholding that subjugator of hostile\r\ntown, thus advancing in wrath, both Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas jumped down\r\nfrom the terrace of their car. Then Duryodhana armed as he was with a\r\nmace, pressed down into the earth with that mace that foremost of cars\r\nfurnished with gold, with steeds and driver and standard. Thy son then,\r\nthat scorcher of foes, having thus crushed that car, steedless and\r\ndriverless as he himself was, quickly ascended the car of the king of the\r\nMadras. Meanwhile, those two mighty car-warriors, viz., those two\r\nforemost Panchala princes, ascending on two other cars, proceeded towards\r\nArjuna.'\""

O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, proceeded against Bhima for battle, like an infuriated elephant in\r\nthe forest proceeding against another infuriated elephant.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'How raged that battle, in the neighbourhood of\r\nArjuna's car, between those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhima and\r\nKarna, both of whom are endued with great strength? Once before Karna had\r\nbeen vanquished by Bhimasena in battle. How, therefore, could the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Karna again proceed against Bhima? How also could Bhima\r\nproceed against the Suta's son, that mighty warrior who is reckoned as\r\nthe greatest of car-warriors on earth? Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,\r\nhaving prevailed over Bhishma and Drona, did not fear anybody else so\r\nmuch as the bowman Karna. Indeed, thinking of the mighty car-warrior\r\nKarna, he passeth his nights sleeplessly from fear. How, then, could\r\nBhima encounter that Suta's son in battle? Indeed, O Sanjaya, how could\r\nBhima fight with Karna, that foremost of warriors, that hero devoted to\r\nthe Brahmanas endued with energy and never retreating from battle? How,\r\nindeed, did those two heroes, viz., the Suta's son and Vrikodara, fight\r\nwith each other in that encounter which took place in the vicinity of\r\nArjuna's car? Informed before of his brotherhood (with the Pandavas), the\r\nSuta's son is again, compassionate. Remembering also his words to Kunti,\r\nhow could he fight with Bhima? As regards Bhima also, remembering all the\r\nwrongs formerly inflicted on him by the Suta's son, how did that hero\r\nfight with Karna in battle? My son Duryodhana, O Suta, hopeth that Karna\r\nwill vanquish all the Pandavas in battle. Upon whom my wretched son\r\nresteth his hope of victory in battle, how did he fight with Bhimasena of\r\nterrible deeds? That Suta's son, relying upon whom my sons chose\r\nhostilities with those mighty car-warriors (viz., the sons of Pandu), how\r\ndid Bhima fight with him? Indeed, remembering the diverse wrongs and\r\ninjuries done by him, how did Bhima fight with that son of Suta? How\r\nindeed, could Bhima fight with that son of a Suta, who, endued with great\r\nvalour, had formerly subjugated the whole earth on a single car? How did\r\nBhima fight with that son of a Suta, who was born with a (natural) pair\r\nof ear-rings? Thou art skilled in narration, O Sanjaya! Tell me,\r\ntherefore, in detail how the battle took place between those two, and who\r\namongst them obtained the victory?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Leaving Radha's son, that foremost of car-warriors\r\nBhimasena, desired to proceed to the place where those two heroes, viz.,\r\nKrishna and Dhananjaya were. The son of Radha, however, rushing towards\r\nhim as he proceeded, covered him, O king, with dense showers of arrows,\r\nlike a cloud pouring, torrents of rain on a mountain. The mighty son of\r\nAdhiratha, his face beautiful as a full-blown lotus, lighted up with a\r\nsmile, challenged Bhimasena to battle, as the latter was proceeding. And\r\nKarna said, 'O Bhima, I dreamt not that thou knowest how to fight. Why\r\nthen dost thou show me thy back from desire of meeting with Arjuna? O\r\ndelighter of the Pandavas, this is scarcely fit for a son of Kunti.\r\nStaying, therefore, where thou art, cover me with thy arrows.' Bhimasena,\r\nhearing that challenge of Karna, brooked it not, but wheeling his car a\r\nlittle, began to fight with the Suta's son. The illustrious Bhimasena\r\nshowered clouds of straight shafts. Desiring also to arrive at the end of\r\nthose hostilities by slaying Karna, Bhima began to weaken that hero\r\nconversant with every weapon and clad in mail, and staying before him for\r\nengaging in a single combat. Then mighty Bhima, that scorcher of foes,\r\nthat wrathful son of Pandu, having slain numerous Kauravas, shot diverse\r\nshowers of fierce shafts at Karna, O sire! The Suta's son, endued with\r\ngreat strength, swallowed, by means of the power of his own weapons, all\r\nthose showers of arrows shot by that hero, possessed of the tread of an\r\ninfuriated elephant. Duly favoured by knowledge, that great bowman, viz.,\r\nKarna, began in that battle, O monarch, to career like a preceptor (Of\r\nMilitary science). The wrathful son of Radha, smiling the while, seemed\r\nto mock Bhimasena as the latter was battling with great fury. The son of\r\nKunti brooked not that smile of Karna in the midst of many brave warriors\r\nwitnessing from all sides that fight of theirs. Like a driver striking a\r\nhuge elephant with a hook, the mighty Bhima, excited with rage, pierced\r\nKarna whom he had obtained within reach, with many calf-toothed shafts in\r\nthe centre of the chest. And once more, Bhimasena pierced the Suta's son\r\nof variegated armour with three and seventy well-shot and keen arrows\r\nequipped with beautiful wings and eased in golden armour, each with five\r\nshafts. And soon, within the twinkling of the eye, was seen a network of\r\nshafts about Bhima's car caused by Karna. Indeed, O monarch, those shafts\r\nshot from Karna's bow completely shrouded that car with its standard and\r\ndriver and the Pandava himself. Then Karna pierced the impenetrable\r\narmour of Bhima with four and sixty arrows. And excited with rage he then\r\npierced Partha himself with many straight shafts capable of penetrating\r\ninto the very vitals. The mighty-armed Vrikodara, however, disregarding\r\nthose shafts shot from Karna's bow fearlessly struck the Suta's son.\r\nPierced with those shafts, resembling snakes of virulent poison, shot\r\nfrom Karna's bow, Bhima, O monarch, felt no pain in that battle. The\r\nvaliant Bhima then, in that encounter, pierced Karna with two and thirty\r\nbroad-headed shafts of keen points and fierce energy, Karna, however,\r\nwith the greatest indifference, covered, in return, with his arrows, the\r\nmighty-armed Bhimasena who was desirous of Jayadratha's slaughter.\r\nIndeed, the son of Radha, in that encounter, fought mildly with Bhima,\r\nwhile Bhima, remembering his former wrongs, fought with him furiously.\r\nThe wrathful Bhimasena could not brook that disregard by Karna. Indeed,\r\nthat slayer of foes quickly shot showers of arrows at Radha's son. Those\r\narrows, sped in that encounter by Bhimasena, fell on every limb of Karna\r\nlike cooing birds. Those arrows equipped with golden wings and keen\r\npoints, shot from Bhimasena's bow, covered the son of Radha like a flight\r\nof insects covering a blazing fire. Karna, however, O king, shot showers\r\nof fierce shafts in return, O Bharata. Then Vrikodara cut off, with Many\r\nbroad-headed arrows, those shafts resembling thunderbolts, shot by that\r\nornament of battle, before they could come at him. That chastiser of\r\nfoes, viz., Karna, the son of Vikartana, once more, O Bharata, covered\r\nBhimasena with his arrowy showers. We then, O Bharata, beheld Bhima so\r\npierced in that encounter with arrows as to resemble a porcupine with its\r\nquilts erect on its body.[155] Like the sun holding his own rays, the\r\nheroic Bhima held in that battle all those shafts, whetted on stone and\r\nequipped with wings of gold, that were shot from Karna's bow. All his\r\nlimbs bathed in blood, Bhimasena looked resplendent like an Asoka tree in\r\nspring adorned with its flowery burthen. The mighty-armed Bhima could not\r\nbrook that conduct, in battle, of the mighty-armed Karna. Rolling his\r\neyes ill wrath, he pierced Karna with five and twenty long shafts.\r\nThereupon, Karna looked like a white mountain with many snakes of\r\nvirulent poison (hanging from its sides). And once more, Bhimasena,\r\nendued with the prowess of a celestial, pierced the Suta's son who was\r\nprepared to lay down his life in battle, with six and then with eight\r\narrows. And, again, with another arrow, the valiant Bhimasena quickly cut\r\noff Karna's bow, smiling the while. And he slew also with his shafts the\r\nfour steeds of Karna and then his charioteer, and then pierced Karna\r\nhimself in the chest with a number of long shafts endued with the\r\neffulgence of the sun. Those winged shafts, piercing through Karna's\r\nbody, entered the earth, like the rays of the sun piercing through the\r\nclouds. Afflicted with arrows and his bow cut off, Karna, though proud of\r\nhis manliness, felt great pain and proceeded to another car.'\""

What also, O son, did Karna do after this, beholding\r\nBhimasena in that battle resemble a blazing fire?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Mounting upon another car that was duly equipped Karna\r\nonce more proceeded against the son of Pandu, with the fury of the Ocean\r\ntossed by the tempest. Beholding Adhiratha's son excited with rage, thy\r\nsons, O king, regarded Bhimasena to be already poured as a libation on\r\nthe (Karna) fire. With furious twang of bowstring and terrible sounds Of\r\nhis palms, the son of Radha shot dense showers of shafts towards\r\nBhimasena's car. And once more, O monarch, a terrible encounter took\r\nPlace between the heroic Karna and the high-souled Bhima. Both excited\r\nwith wrath, both endued with mighty arms, each desirous of slaying the\r\nother, those two warriors looked at each other, as if resolved to burn\r\neach O her with their (wrathful) glances. The eyes of both were red in\r\nrage, and both breathed fiercely, like a couple of snakes. Endued with\r\ngreat heroism, those two chastisers of foes approached and mangled each\r\nother. Indeed, they fought with each other like two hawks endued with\r\ngreat activity, or like two Sarabhas excited with wrath. Then that\r\nchastiser of foes, viz., Bhima recollecting all the woes suffered by him\r\non the occasion of the match at dice, and during his exile in the woods\r\nand residence in Virata's city, and bearing in mind the robbing of their\r\nkingdom swelling with prosperity and gems, by thy sons, and the numerous\r\nother wrongs inflicted on the Pandavas by thee and the Suta's son and\r\nremembering also the fact that thou hadst conspired to burn innocent\r\nKunti with her sons, and calling to his memory the sufferings of Krishna\r\nin the midst of the assembly at the hands of those wretches, as also the\r\nseizure of her tresses by Duhsasana, and the harsh speeches uttered, O\r\nBharata, by Karna, to the effect, 'Take thou another husband, for all thy\r\nhusbands are dead: the sons of Pritha have sunk into hell and are like\r\nsesamum seeds without kernel,'--remembering also those other words, O son\r\nof Kuru, that the Kauravas uttered in thy presence, add the fact also\r\nthat thy sons had been desirous of enjoying Krishna as a slave, and those\r\nharsh words that Karna spoke to the sons of Pandu when the latter,\r\nattired in deer-skins were about to be banished to the woods, and the joy\r\nin which thy wrathful and foolish son, himself in prosperity, indulged,\r\nthinking the distressed sons of Pritha as veritable straw, the virtuous\r\nBhima that slayer of foes, remembering these and all the woes he had\r\nsuffered since his childhood, became reckless of his very life.\r\nStretching his invincible and formidable bow, the back of whose staff was\r\ndecked with gold, Vrikodara, that tiger of Bharata's race, utterly\r\nreckless of his life, rushed against Karna. Shooting dense showers of\r\nbright arrows whetted on stone, Bhima shrouded the very light of the sun.\r\nAdhiratha's son, however, smiling the while, quickly baffled, by means of\r\nhis own winged arrows whetted on stone, that arrowy downpour of\r\nBhimasena. Endued with great strength and mighty arms, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, the son of Adhiratha, then pierced Bhima with nine keen\r\narrows. Struck with those arrows, like an elephant struck with the hook.\r\nVrikodara fearlessly rushed against the Suta's son. Karna, however,\r\nrushed against that bull among the Pandavas who was thus rushing towards\r\nhim with great impetuosity and might, like an infuriated elephant against\r\nan infuriated compeer. Blowing his conch then, whose blast resembled the\r\nsound of a hundred trumpets, Karna cheerfully agitated the force that\r\nsupported Bhima, like the raging sea. Beholding that force of his\r\nconsisting of elephants and steeds and cars and foot-soldiers, thus\r\nagitated by Karna, Bhima, approaching the former, covered him with\r\narrows. Then Karna caused his own steeds of the hue of swans to be\r\nmingled with those of Bhimasena's of the hue of bears, and shrouded the\r\nson of Pandu with his shafts. Beholding those steeds of the hue of bears\r\nand fleet as the wind, mingled with those of the hue of swans, cries of\r\noh and alas arose from among the troops of thy sons. Those steeds, fleet\r\nas the wind, thus mingled together, looked exceedingly beautiful like\r\nwhite and black clouds, O monarch, mingled together in the firmament.\r\nBeholding Karna and Vrikodara to be both excited with wrath, great\r\ncar-warriors of thy army began to tremble with fear. The field of battle\r\nwhere they fought soon became awful like the domain of Yama. Indeed, O\r\nbest of Bharatas, it became as frightful to behold as the city of the\r\ndead. The great car, warriors of thy army, looking upon that scene, as if\r\nthey were spectators of a sport in an arena, beheld not any of the two to\r\ngain any advantage over the other in that dreadful encounter. They only\r\nbeheld, O king, that mingling and clash of the mighty weapons of those\r\ntwo warriors, as a result, O monarch, of the evil policy of thyself and\r\nthy son. Those two slayers of foes-continued to cover each other with\r\ntheir keen shafts. Both endued with wonderful prowess, they filled the\r\nwelkin with their arrowy downpours. Those two mighty car-warriors\r\nshooting at each other keen shafts from desire of taking each other's\r\nlife, became exceedingly beautiful to behold like two clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain. Those two chastisers of foes, shooting gold-decked\r\narrows, made the welkin look bright, O king, as if with blazing meteors.\r\nShafts equipped with vulturine feathers, shot by those two heroes, looked\r\nlike rows of excited cranes in the autumn sky. Meanwhile, Krishna and\r\nDhananjaya, those chastisers of foes, engaged in battle with the Suta's\r\nson, thought the burthen too great for Bhima to bear. As Karna and Bhima\r\nfor baffling each other's shafts, shot these arrows at each other, many\r\nelephants and steeds and men deeply struck therewith, fell down deprived\r\nof life. And in consequence of those falling and fallen creatures\r\ndeprived of life counting by thousands, a great carnage, O king, took\r\nplace in the army of thy sons.

Indeed, O Sanjaya, tell me why that Karna, who is\r\ncapable of resisting in battle the very celestials with the Yakshas and\r\nAsuras and men, armed with all kinds of weapons, could not vanquish in\r\nbattle Pandu's son Bhima blazing with resplendence? O tell me, how that\r\nbattle took place between them in which each staked his very life. I\r\nthink that in an encounter between the two, success is within reach of\r\nboth as, indeed, both are liable to defeat.[156] O Suta, obtaining Karna\r\nin battle, my son Suyodhana always ventures to vanquish the sons of\r\nPritha with Govinda and the Satwatas. Hearing, however, of the repeated\r\ndefeat in battle of Karna by Bhimasena of terrible deeds, a swoon seems\r\nto come upon me, I think, the Kauravas to be already slain, in\r\nconsequence of evil policy of my son. Karna will never succeed, O\r\nSanjaya, in vanquishing those mighty bowmen, viz., the sons of Pritha. In\r\nall the battles that Karna has fought with the sons of Pandu, the latter\r\nhave invariably defeated him on the field. Indeed, O son, the Pandavas\r\nare incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava at their\r\nhead. Alas, my wicked son Duryodhana knoweth it not. Having robbed\r\nPritha's son, who is like the Lord of the treasures himself, of his\r\nwealth, my son of little intelligence seeth not the fall like a searcher\r\nof honey (in the mountains). Conversant with deceit, he regardeth it to\r\nbe irrevocably his and always insulteth the Pandavas. Myself also, of\r\nunrefined soul, overcome with affection for my children, scrupled not to\r\ndespise the high-souled sons of Pandu that are observant of morality.\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Pritha, of great foresight, always showed\r\nhimself desirous of peace. My sons, however, regarding him incapable,\r\ndespised him. Bearing in mind all those woes and all the wrongs\r\n(sustained by the Pandavas), the mighty-armed Bhimasena battled with the\r\nSuta's son. Tell me, therefore, O Sanjaya, how Bhima and Karna, those two\r\nforemost of warriors, fought with each other, desirous of taking each\r\nother's life!'\r\n\r\n`Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, how the battle took place between Karna and\r\nBhima which resembled an encounter between two elephants in the forest,\r\ndesirous of slaying each other. The son of Vikartana, O king, excited\r\nwith rage and putting forth his prowess, pierced that chastiser of foes,\r\nviz., the angry Bhima of great prowess with thirty shafts. Indeed, O\r\nchief of Bharata's race, Vikartana's son struck Bhima with many arrows of\r\nkeen points, decked with gold, and endued with great impetuosity. Bhima,\r\nhowever, with three sharp shafts cut off the bow of Karna, as the latter\r\nwas engaged in striking him. And with a broad-headed arrow, the son of\r\nPandu then felled on the earth Karna's charioteer from his niche in the\r\ncar. The son of Vikartana, then desirous of slaying Bhimasena, seized a\r\ndart whose shaft was adorned with gold and stones of lapis lazuli.\r\nGrasping that fierce dart, which resembled a second dart of death, and\r\nuplifting and aiming it, the mighty son of Radha hurled it at Bhimasena\r\nwith a force sufficient to take away Bhima's life. Hurling that dart,\r\nlike Purandara hurling the thunderbolt, Radha's son of great strength\r\nuttered a loud roar. Hearing that roar thy sons became filled with\r\ndelight. Bhima, however, with seven swift arrows, cut off in the welkin\r\nthat dart endued with the effulgence of the sun or fire, hurled from the\r\nhands of Karna. Cutting off that dart, resembling a snake just freed from\r\nits slough, Bhima, O sire, as if on the lookout for taking the\r\nlife-breath of the Suta's son, sped, in great wrath, many shafts in that\r\nbattle that were equipped with peacock-feathers and golden wings and each\r\nof which, whetted of' stone, resembled the rod of Yama. Karna also of\r\ngreat energy, taking up another formidable bow, the back of whose staff\r\nwas adorned with gold, and drawing it with force, shot many shafts. The\r\nson of Pandu, however, cut off all those arrows with nine straight arrows\r\nof his own. Having cut off, O ruler of men those mighty shafts shot by\r\nVasushena, Bhima, O monarch, uttered a loud roar like that of a lion.\r\nRoaring at each other like two mighty bulls for the sake of a cow in\r\nseason, or like two tigers for the sake of the same piece of meat, they\r\nendeavoured to strike each other, each being desirous of finding the\r\nother's laches. At times they looked at each other with angry eyes, like\r\ntwo mighty bulls in a cow-pen. Then like two huge elephants striking each\r\nother with the points of their tusks, they encountered each other with\r\nshafts shot from their bows drawn to the fullest stretch. Scorching each\r\nother, O king, with their arrowy showers, they put forth their prowess\r\nupon each other, eyeing each other in great wrath. Sometimes laughing at\r\neach other, and sometimes rebuking each other, and sometimes blowing\r\ntheir conchs, they continued to fight with each other. Then Bhima once\r\nmore cut Karna's bow at the handle, O sire, and despatched by means of\r\nhis shafts the latter's steeds, white as conchs, to the abode of Yama,\r\nand the son of Pandu also felled his enemy's charioteer from his niche in\r\nthe car. Then Karna, the son of Vikartana, made steedless and driverless,\r\nand covered in that battle (with shafts), became plunged into great\r\nanxiety. Stupefied by Bhima with his arrowy showers, he knew not what to\r\ndo. Beholding Karna placed in the distressful plight, king Duryodhana,\r\ntrembling with wrath, commended (his brother) Durjaya, saying, 'Go, O\r\nDurjaya! There the son of Pandu is about to devour the son of Radha! Slay\r\nthat beardless Bhima soon, and infuse strength into Karna!' Thus\r\naddressed, the son Durjaya, saying unto Duryodhana, 'So be it', rushed\r\ntowards Bhimasena engaged (with Karna) and covered him with arrows. And\r\nDurjaya struck Bhima with nine shafts, his steeds with eight, his driver\r\nwith six, his standard with three, and once more Bhima himself with\r\nseven. Then Bhimasena, excited with wrath, piercing with his shafts the\r\nvery vitals of Durjaya, and his steeds and driver, despatched them of\r\nYama's abode. Then Karna, weeping in grief, circumambulated that son of\r\nthine, who, adorned with ornaments, lay on the earth, writhing like a\r\nsnake. Bhima then, having made that deadly foe of his, viz., Karna,\r\ncarless, smiling by covered him with shafts and made him look like a\r\nSataghni with numberless spikes on it. The Atiratha Karna, however, that\r\nchastiser of foes, though thus pierced with arrows, did not yet avoid the\r\nenraged Bhima in battle.'\""

Then Karna, striking Bhimasena\r\nwith showers of shafts, uttered a loud roar, and once more pierced him in\r\nthe chest. Bhima, however, in return, pierced Karna with ten straight\r\narrows and once more with twenty straight arrows. Then Karna, piercing\r\nBhima, O king, with nine arrows in the centre of the chest, struck the\r\nlatter's standard with a sharp shaft. The son of Pritha then pierced\r\nKarna in return with three and sixty arrows, like a driver striking a\r\nmighty elephant with the hook, or a rider striking a steed with a whip.\r\nDeeply pierced, O king, by the illustrious son of Pandu, the heroic Karna\r\nbegan to lick with his tongue the corners of his mouth, and his eyes\r\nbecame red in rage. Then, O monarch, Karna, sped at Bhimasena, for his\r\ndestruction, a shaft capable of piercing everybody, like Indra hurling\r\nhis thunderbolt.

Indeed, like Indra slaying the Asuras with\r\nhis thunderbolt, that hero of Bharata's race, excited with wrath, slew\r\nwith that mace the well-trained steeds of the foremost breed, of\r\nAdhiratha's son.

Abandoning\r\nthat steedless and driverless and standardless car, Karna. O Bharata,\r\ncheerlessly stood on the earth, drawing his bow. The prowess that we then\r\nbeheld of Radha's son was extremely wonderful, inasmuch as that foremost\r\nof car-warriors, though deprived of car, continued to resist his foe.\r\nBeholding that foremost of men, viz., the son of Adhiratha, deprived of\r\nhis car, Duryodhana, O monarch, said unto (his brother) Durmukha, 'There,\r\nO Durmukha, the son of Radha hath been deprived of his car by Bhimasena.\r\nFurnish that foremost of men, that mighty car-warrior with a car.'\r\nHearing these words of Duryodhana, thy son Durmukha, O Bharata, quickly\r\nproceeded towards Karna and covered Bhima with his shafts. Beholding\r\nDurmukha desirous of supporting the Suta's son in that battle, the son of\r\nthe Wind god was filled with delight and began to lick the corners of his\r\nmouth. Then resisting Karna the while with his shafts, the son of Pandu\r\nquickly drove his car towards Durmukha. And in that moment, O king, with\r\nnine straight arrows of keen points, Bhima despatched Durmukha to Yama's\r\nabode, Upon Durmukha's slaughter, the son of Adhiratha mounted upon the\r\ncar of that prince and looked resplendent, O king, like the blazing sun.\r\nBeholding Durmukha lying prostrate on the field, his very vital pierced\r\n(with shafts) and his body bathed in blood, Karna with tearful eyes\r\nabstained for a moment from the fight. Circumambulating the fallen prince\r\nand leaving him there, the heroic Karna began to breathe long and hot\r\nbreaths and knew not what to do. Seizing that opportunity, O king,\r\nBhimasena shot at the Suta's son four and ten long shafts equipped with\r\nvulturine feathers. Those blood-drinking shafts of golden wings, endued\r\nwith great force illuminating the ten points as they coursed through the\r\nwelkin, pierced the armour of the Suta's son, and drank his life-blood, O\r\nking, and passing through his body, sank into the earth and looked\r\nresplendent like angry snakes, O monarch, urged on by Death himself, with\r\nhalf their bodies inserted within their holes. Then the son of Radha,\r\nwithout reflecting a moment, pierced Bhima in return with four and ten\r\nfierce shafts adorned with gold. Those fierce-winged arrows, piercing\r\nthrough Bhima's right arms, entered the earth like birds entering a grove\r\nof trees. Striking against the earth, those arrows looked resplendent,\r\nlike the blazing rays of the sun while proceeding towards the Asta hills.\r\nPierced in that battle with those all-piercing arrows, Bhima began to\r\nshed copious streams of blood, like a mountain ejecting streams of water.\r\nThen Bhima pierced the Suta's son in return with three shafts endued with\r\nthe impetuosity of Garuda and he pierced the latter's charioteer also\r\nwith seven. Then, O king, Karna thus afflicted by Bhima's might, became\r\nexceedingly distressed. And that illustrious warrior then fled, forsaking\r\nthe battle, borne away by his fleet steeds. The Atiratha Bhimasena,\r\nhowever, drawing his bow adorned with gold, stayed in battle, looking\r\nresplendent like a blazing fire.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'I think, Destiny is supreme. Fie on exertion which\r\nis useless, inasmuch as the son of Adhiratha, though fighting resolutely,\r\ncould not vanquish the son of Pandu. Karna boasts of his competency to\r\nvanquish in battle all the Parthas with Govinda amongst them. I do not\r\nsee in the world, another warrior like Karna! I often heard Duryodhana\r\nspeak in this strain. Indeed, O Suta, the wretched Duryodhana used to\r\ntell me formerly, 'Karna is a mighty hero, a firm bowman, above all\r\nfatigue. If I have that Vasushena for my ally, the very gods will not be\r\na match for me, what need be said, therefore, O monarch, of the sons of\r\nPandu that are weak and heartless?' Tell me therefore, O Sanjaya, what\r\nDuryodhana said, beholding that Karna defeated and looking like a snake\r\ndeprived of its poison and flying away from battle. Alas, deprived of his\r\nsenses, Duryodhana despatched the unsupported Durmukha, unacquainted\r\nthough he was with battle, into that fiery encounter, like an insect into\r\nthe blazing fire. O Sanjaya, even Aswatthaman and the ruler of the Madras\r\nand Kripa, united together, could not stand before Bhimasena. Even these\r\nknow the terrible might, equal to that of ten thousand elephants, of\r\nBhima, endued with the energy of Marut himself, as also his cruel\r\nintents. Why did they provoke the fire in battle, of that hero of cruel\r\ndeeds, that warrior resembling Yama himself as the latter becomes at the\r\nend of the Yuga? It seems that Suta's son, the mighty armed Karna alone,\r\nrelying on the prowess of his own arms, fought in battle with Bhimasena,\r\ndisregarding the latter. That son of Pandu who vanquished Karna in battle\r\nlike Purandara vanquishing an Asura, is capable of being vanquished by\r\nanybody in fight. Who is there that would, hopeful of life, approach that\r\nBhima who, in Arjuna's quest, alone entered my host, having ground Drona\r\nhimself? Who, indeed, is there, O Sanjaya, that would dare stay in the\r\nface of Bhima? Who is there among the Asuras that would venture to stay\r\nbefore the great Indra with the thunderbolt uplifted in his hand?[157] A\r\nman may return having entered the abode of the dead, but none, however,\r\ncan return having encountered Bhimasena! Those men of weak prowess, who\r\nsenselessly rushed against the angry Bhimasena were like insects falling\r\nupon a blazing fire. Without doubt, reflecting upon what the angry and\r\nfierce Bhima had said in the assembly in the hearing of the Kurus about\r\nthe slaughter of my sons, and beholding the defeat of Karna, Duhsasana\r\nand his brothers ceased to encounter Bhima from fear. That wicked son\r\nalso of mine, O Sanjaya, who repeatedly said in the assembly (these\r\nwords, viz.,) Karna and Duhsasana and I myself will vanquish the Pandavas\r\nin battle,'--without doubt, beholding Karna defeated and deprived of his\r\ncar by Bhima, is consumed with grief in consequence of his rejection of\r\nKrishna's suit![158] Beholding his mail-clad brothers slain in battle by\r\nBhimasena, in consequence of his own fault, without doubt, my son is\r\nburning with grief. Who that is desirous of life will make a hostile\r\nadvance against Pandu's son, Bhima, excited with wrath armed with\r\nterrible weapons and standing in battle like Death himself? A man may\r\nescape from the very jaws of the Vadava fire. But it is my belief that no\r\none can escape from before Bhima's face. Indeed, neither Partha, nor the\r\nPanchalas, nor Kesava, nor Satyaki, when excited with wrath in battle,\r\nshows the least regard for (his) life. Alas, O Suta, the very lives of my\r\nsons are in danger.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thou, O Kaurava, that art thus grieving in view of the\r\npresent carnage, thou, without doubt, art the root of this destruction of\r\nthe world! Obedient to the counsels of thy sons, thou hast thyself\r\nprovoked this fierce hostility. Though urged (by well-wishers) thou\r\nacceptest not the proper medicine like a man fated to die. O monarch, O\r\nbest of men, having thyself drunk the fiercest and the most indigestible\r\npoison, take thou all its consequences now. The combatants are fighting\r\nto the best of their might, still thou speakest ill of them. Listen,\r\nhowever, to me as I describe to thee how the battle raged on.\r\n\r\n\"Beholding Karna defeated by Bhimasena, five of thy sons, those uterine\r\nbrothers that were great bowmen, could not, O sire, brook it. They were\r\nDurmarshana and Duhsaha and Durmada and Durdhara and Jaya. Clad in\r\nbeautiful mail, all of them rushed against the son of Pandu. Encompassing\r\nthe mighty-armed Vrikodara, on all sides, they shrouded all the points of\r\nthe compass with their shafts looking like flights of locusts. Bhimasena,\r\nhowever, in the battle, smilingly received those princes of celestial\r\nbeauty thus rushing suddenly against him. Beholding thy sons advancing\r\nagainst Bhimasena, Radha's son, Karna rushed against that mighty warrior,\r\nshooting arrows of keen points that were equipped with golden wings and\r\nwhetted on stone. Bhima, however, quickly rushed against Karna, though\r\nresisted by thy sons. Then the Kurus, surrounding Karna, covered\r\nBhimasena with showers of straight shafts. With five and twenty arrows, O\r\nking, Bhima, armed with his formidable bow, despatched all those bulls\r\namong men to Yama's abode with their steeds and charioteers. Falling down\r\nfrom their cars along with their charioteers, their lifeless forms looked\r\nlike large trees with their weight of variegated flowers uprooted by the\r\ntempest. The prowess that we then beheld of Bhimasena was exceedingly\r\nwonderful, inasmuch as, resisting Adhiratha's son the while, he slew\r\nthose sons of thine. Resisted by Bhima with whetted arrows on all sides,\r\nthe Suta's son, O king, only looked at Bhima. Bhimasena also, with eyes\r\nred in wrath, began to cast angry glances on Karna, stretching his\r\nformidable bow the while.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding thy sons lying (on the field), Karna of great\r\nprowess filled with great wrath, became hopeless about his life. And\r\nAdhiratha's son regarded himself guilty, seeing thy sons slain before his\r\neyes in battle by Bhima. Then Bhimasena, recollecting the wrongs formerly\r\ninflicted by Karna, became filled with rage and began with deliberate\r\ncare to pierce Karna with many keen arrows. Then Karna, piercing Bhima\r\nwith five arrows, smiling the while, once more pierced him with seventy\r\narrows, equipped with golden wings and whetted on stone. Disregarding\r\nthese shafts shot by Karna, Vrikodara pierced the son of Radha in that\r\nbattle with a hundred straight shafts. And once more, piercing him in his\r\nvitals with five keen arrows, Bhima, O sire, cut off with a broad-headed\r\narrow the bow of the Suta's son. The cheerless Karna then, O Bharata,\r\ntaking up another bow shrouded Bhimasena on all sides with his arrows.\r\nThen Bhima, slaying Karna's steeds and charioteer, laughed a laugh,\r\nhaving thus counteracted Karna's feats. Then that bull amongst men, viz.,\r\nBhima, cut off with his arrows the bow of Karna. That bow, O king, of\r\nloud twang, and the back of whose staff was decked with gold, fell down\r\n(from his hand). Then the mighty car-warrior Karna alighted from his car\r\nand taking up a mace in that battle wrathfully hurled it at Bhima.\r\nBeholding that mace, O king, impetuously coursing towards him, Vrikodara\r\nresisted it with his arrows in the sight of all thy troops. Then the son\r\nof Pandu, gifted with great prowess and exerting himself with great\r\nactivity, shot a thousand arrows at the Suta's son, desirous of taking\r\nthe latter's life. Karna, however, in the dreadful battle, resisting all\r\nthose shafts with his own, cut off Bhima's armour also with his arrows.\r\nAnd then he pierced Bhima with five and twenty small shafts in the sight\r\nof all the troops. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then, O\r\nmonarch, Bhima, excited with rage, sped nine straight shafts at the\r\nSuta's son. Those keen shafts, piercing through Karna's coat of mail and\r\nright arm, entered the earth like snakes into an ant-hill. Shrouded with\r\nshowers of shafts shot from Bhimasena's bow, Karna once more turned his\r\nback upon Bhimasena. Beholding the Suta's son turn back and flying away\r\non foot, covered all over with the arrows of Kunti's son, Duryodhana\r\nsaid, 'Go ye quickly from all sides towards the car of Radha's son.'\r\n'Then, O king, thy sons, hearing these words of their brother that were\r\nto them a surprise, rushed towards the son of Pandu for battle, shooting\r\nshowers of shafts. They were Chitra, and Upachitra, and Charuchitra, and\r\nSarasan, and Chitrayudha, and Chitravarman. All of them were well-versed\r\nin every mode of warfare. The mighty car-warrior, Bhimasena, however,\r\nfelled each of those sons of thine thus rushing against him, with a\r\nsingle arrow. Deprived of life, they fell down on the earth like trees\r\nuprooted by a tempest. Beholding those sons of thine, all mighty\r\ncar-warriors, O king, thus slain, Karna, with tearful face, recollected\r\nthe word of Vidura. Mounting upon another car that was duly equipped,\r\nKarna, endued with great prowess, quickly proceeded against the son of\r\nPandu in battle. Piercing each other with whetted arrows, equipped with\r\nwings of gold, the two warriors looked resplendent like two masses of\r\nclouds penetrated by the rays of the sun. Then the son of Pandu, excited\r\nwith rage, cut off the armour of Suta's son with six and thirty\r\nbroad-headed arrows of great sharpness and fierce energy. The\r\nmighty-armed Suta's son also, O bull of Bharata's race, pierced the son\r\nof Kunti with fifty straight arrows. The two warriors then, smeared with\r\nred sandal-paste with many a wound caused by each other's arrows, and\r\ncovered also with gore, looked resplendent like the risen sun and the\r\nmoon. Their coats of mail cut off by means of arrows, and their bodies\r\ncovered with blood, Karna and Bhima then looked like a couple of snakes\r\njust freed from their sloughs. Indeed, those two tigers among men mangled\r\neach other with their arrows, like two tigers mangling each other with\r\ntheir teeth. The two heroes incessantly showered their shafts, like two\r\nmasses of clouds pouring torrents of rain. Those two chastisers of foes\r\ntore each other's body with their arrows, like two elephants tearing each\r\nother with the points of their tusks. Roaring at each other and showering\r\ntheir arrows upon each other, causing their cars to trace beautiful\r\ncircles. They resembled a couple of mighty bulls roaring at each other in\r\nthe presence of a cow in her season. Indeed, those two lions among men\r\nthen looked like a couple of mighty lions endued with eyes red in wrath,\r\nthese two warriors endued with great energy fought on like Sakra and\r\nVirochana's son (Prahlada). Then, O king, the mighty-armed Bhima, as he\r\nstretched his bow with his two hands, looked like a cloud charged with\r\nlightning. Then mighty Bhima-cloud, having the twang of the bow for its\r\nthunder and incessant showers of arrows for its rainy downpour, covered,\r\nO king, the Karna-mountain. And once more Pandu's son, Bhima of terrible\r\nprowess, O Bharata, shrouded Karna with a thousand shafts shot from his\r\nbow. And as he shrouded Karna with his winged shafts, equipped with Kanka\r\nfeathers, thy sons witnessed his extra ordinary prowess. Gladdening\r\nPartha himself and the illustrious Kesava, Satyaki and the two protectors\r\nof (two) wheels (of Arjuna's car), Bhima fought even thus with Karna.\r\nBeholding the perseverance of Bhima who knew his own self, thy sons, O\r\nmonarch, all became cheerless.'\""

Returning for a\r\nmoment from before Bhimasena, Karna cast his eyes upon those sons of\r\nthine that had been slain by Bhimasena, Beholding them, O best of men,\r\nKarna became cheerless and plunged in grief. Breathing hot and long\r\nsighs, he, once more, proceeded against the son of Pandu. With eyes red\r\nas copper, and sighing in wrath like a mighty snake, Karna then, as he\r\nshot his arrows, looked resplendent like the sun scattering his\r\nrays.[159] Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, Vrikodara was then covered\r\nwith the arrows, resembling the spreading rays of the sun that were shot\r\nfrom Karna's bow. The beautiful shafts, equipped with peacock-feathers,\r\nshot from Karna's bow, penetrated into every part of Bhima's body, like\r\nbirds into a tree for roosting there. Indeed, the arrows, equipped with\r\nwings of gold, shot from Karna's bow falling incessantly, resembled\r\ncontinuous rows of cranes. So numerous were the shafts shot by\r\nAdhiratha's son that, these seemed to issue not from his bow alone but\r\nfrom his standard, his umbrella, and the shaft and yoke and bottom of his\r\ncar also. Indeed, Adhiratha's son shot his sky-ranging shafts of\r\nimpetuous energy, decked with gold and equipped with vulturine feathers,\r\nin such a way as to fill the entire welkin with them. Beholding him\r\n(thus) excited with fury and rushing towards him like the Destroyer\r\nhimself, Vrikodara, becoming utterly reckless of his life and prevailing\r\nover his foe, pierced him with nine shafts.[160] Beholding the\r\nirresistible impetuosity of Karna as also that dense shower of arrows,\r\nBhima, endued as he was with great prowess, quailed not in fear. The son\r\nof Pandu then counteracting that arrowy downpour of Adhiratha's son,\r\npierced Karna himself with twenty other sharp shafts. Indeed, as Pritha's\r\nson himself had before been shrouded by the Suta's son, even so was the\r\nlatter now shrouded by the former in that battle. Beholding the prowess\r\nof Bhimasena in battle, thy warriors, as also the Gharanas, filled with\r\njoy; applauded him. Bhurisravas, and Kripa, and Drona's son, and the\r\nruler of the Madras, and Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu, and Kesava, and\r\nArjuna,--these great car-warriors: O king, among both the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas,--loudly cheered Bhima, saying, 'Excellent, Excellent,' and\r\nuttered leonine roars. When that fierce uproar, making the hair stand on\r\nend rose, thy son Duryodhana, O king, quickly said unto all the kings and\r\nprinces and particularly his uterine brothers, these words, 'Blessed be\r\nye, proceed towards Karna for rescuing him from Vrikodara, else the\r\nshafts shot from Bhima's bow will slay the son of Radha. Ye mighty\r\nbowmen, strive ye to protect the Suta's son.' Thus commanded by\r\nDuryodhana, seven of his uterine brothers, O sire, rushing in wrath\r\ntowards Bhimasena, encompassed him on all sides. Approaching the son of\r\nKunti they covered him with showers of arrows, like clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain on the mountain-breast in the season of rains. Excited\r\nwith wrath, those seven great car-warriors began to afflict Bhimasena, O\r\nking, like the seven planets afflicting the moon at the hour of the\r\nuniversal dissolution. The son of Kunti, then, O monarch, drawing his\r\nbeautiful bow with great force and firm grasp, and knowing that his foes\r\nwere but men, aimed seven shafts. And lord Bhima in great rage sped at\r\nthem those shafts, effulgent as solar rays. Indeed, Bhimasena\r\nrecollecting his former wrongs, shot those shafts as if for extracting\r\nthe life from out of the bodies of those sons of thine. Those arrows, O\r\nBharata, whetted on stone and equipped with wings of gold, shot by\r\nBhimasena, piercing through the bodies of those Bharata princes, flew\r\ninto the sky. Indeed, those arrows winged with gold, piercing through the\r\nhearts of thy sons, looked beautiful, O monarch, as they passed into the\r\nsky, like birds of excellent plumage. Decked with gold and covered all\r\nover with blood, those arrows, O king, drinking the blood of thy sons\r\npassed out of their body. Pierced in their vital limbs by means of those\r\narrows, they fell down on the earth from their cars, like tall trees\r\ngrowing on mountain precipices, broken by an elephant. The seven sons of\r\nthine that were thus slain were Satrunjaya, and Satrusaha, and Chitra,\r\nand Chitrayudha, and Dridha, and Chitrasena and Vikarna. Amongst all thy\r\nsons thus slain, Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, grieved bitterly from\r\nsorrow for Vikarna who was dear to him. And Bhima said, 'Even thus was\r\nthe vow made by me, viz., that all of you should be slain by me in\r\nbattle. It is for that, O Vikarna, that thou hast been slain. My vow hath\r\nbeen accomplished. O hero, thou camest to battle, bearing in mind the\r\nduties of a Kshatriya. Thou wert ever engaged in our good, and especially\r\nin that of the king (our eldest brother). It is scarcely proper,\r\ntherefore, for me to grieve for thy illustrious self.' Having slain those\r\nprinces, O king, in the very sight of Radha's son, the son of Pandu\r\nuttered a terrible leonine roar. That loud shout of the heroic Bhima, O\r\nBharata, informed king Yudhishthira the Just that the victory in that\r\nbattle was his. Indeed, hearing that tremendous shout of Bhima armed with\r\nthe bow, king Yudhishthira felt great joy in the midst of that battle.\r\nThe gladdened son of Pandu, then, O king, received that leonine shout of\r\nhis brother with sounds and other musical instruments. And after\r\nVrikodara, had sent him that message by the sign agreed upon,\r\nYudhishthira, that foremost of persons acquainted with weapons, filled\r\nwith joy, rushed against Drona in battle. On the other hand, O king,\r\nbeholding one and thirty of thy sons slain, Duryodhana recollected the\r\nwords of Vidura.-Those beneficial words spoken by Vidura are now\r\nrealised! Thinking even so, king Duryodhana was unable to do what he\r\nshould. All that, during the match at dice, thy foolish and wicked son,\r\nwith Karna (on his side), said unto the princes of Panchala causing her\r\nto be brought into the assembly, all the harsh words, again, that Karna\r\nsaid unto Krishna, in the same place, before thyself, O king, and the\r\nsons of Pandu, in thy hearing and that of all the Kurus, viz., O Krishna,\r\nthe Pandavas are lost and have sunk into eternal hell, therefore, choose\r\nthou other husbands,--alas, the fruit of all that is now manifesting\r\nitself. Then, again, O thou of Kuru's race, diverse harsh speeches, such\r\nas sesamum seeds without kernel, etc., were applied by the wrathful sons\r\nto those high-souled ones, viz., the sons of Pandu. Bhimasena, vomiting\r\nforth the fire of wrath (which these enraged) and which he had restrained\r\nfor thirteen years, is now compassing the destruction of thy sons.\r\nIndulging in copious lamentations, Viduara failed to persuade thee\r\ntowards peace. O chief of the Bharatas, suffer the fruit of all that with\r\nthy sons. Thou art old, patient, and capable of foreseeing the\r\nconsequences of all acts. Being so, when thou didst yet refuse to follow\r\nthe counsels of thy well-wishers, it seems that all this is the result of\r\ndestiny. Do not grieve, O tiger among men! All this is thy great fault.\r\nIn my opinion, thou art thyself the cause of the destruction of thy sons.\r\nO monarch, Vikarna hath fallen, and Chitrasena also of great prowess.\r\nMany other mighty car-warriors and foremost ones among thy sons have also\r\nfallen. Others, again, among thy sons whom Bhima saw come within the\r\nrange of his vision, O mighty-armed one, he slew in a trice. It is for\r\nthee only that I had to see our array scorched in thousands by means of\r\nthe arrows shot by Pandu's son, Bhima and Vrisha (Karna)!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION CXXXVII\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Suta, O Sanjaya, this grievous result that has\r\nnow overtaken us is, I think, certainly due to my evil policy. I had\r\nhitherto thought that what is past. But, O Sanjaya, what measures should\r\nI now adopt? I am now once more calm, O Sanjaya, therefore, tell me how\r\nthis slaughter of heroes is going on, having my evil policy for its\r\ncause.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Indeed, O king, Karna and Bhima, both endued with great\r\nprowess, continued in that battle to pour their arrowy showers like two\r\nrain-charged clouds. The arrows, winged with gold and whetted on stone\r\nand marked with Bhima's name, approaching Karna, penetrated into his\r\nbody, as if piercing into his very life. Similarly, Bhima also, in that\r\nbattle was shrouded with the shafts of Karna in hundreds and thousands,\r\nresembling snakes of virulent poison. With their arrows, O king, failing\r\non all sides, an agitation was produced among the troops resembling that\r\nof the very ocean. Many were the combatants, O chastiser of foes, in thy\r\nhost that were deprived of life by arrows, resembling snakes of virulent\r\npoison shot from Bhima's bow. Strewn with fallen elephants and steeds\r\nmixed with the bodies of men, the field of battle looked like one covered\r\nwith trees broken by a tempest. Slaughtered in battle with the arrows\r\nfrom Bhima's bow, thy warriors fled away, 'saying, What is this?' Indeed,\r\nthat host of the Sindhus, the Sauviras, and the Kauravas, afflicted with\r\nthe impetuous shafts of both Karna and Bhima, was removed to a great\r\ndistance. The remnant of those brave soldiers, with their steeds and\r\nelephants killed, leaving the vicinity of both Karna and Bhima, fled away\r\nin all directions. (And they cried out), 'Verily, for the sake of the\r\nParthas, the gods are stupefying us, since those arrows shot by both\r\nBhima and Karna are slaying our forces. Saying those words, these troops\r\nof thine afflicted with fear avoiding the range of (Karna's and Bhima's)\r\narrows, stood at a distance for witnessing that combat. Then, on the\r\nfield of battle there began to flow a terrible river enhancing the joy of\r\nthe heroes and the fears of the timid. And it was caused by the blood of\r\nelephants and steeds and men. And covered with the lifeless forms of men\r\nand elephants and steeds, with flagstaffs and the bottoms of cars, with\r\nthe adornments of cars and elephants and steeds with broken cars and\r\nwheels and Akshas and Kuveras, with loud-twanged bows decked with gold,\r\nand gold-winged arrows and shafts in thousands, shot by Karna and Bhima,\r\nresembling snakes just freed from their sloughs, with countless lances\r\nand spears and scimitars and battleaxes, with maces and clubs and axes,\r\nall adorned with gold, with standards of diverse shapes, and darts and\r\nspiked clubs, and with beautiful Sataghnis, the earth, O Bharata, looked\r\nresplendent. And strewn all over with earrings and necklaces of gold and\r\nbracelets loosened (from wrists), and rings, and precious gems worn on\r\ndiadems and crowns, and head-gears, and golden ornaments of diverse\r\nkinds, O sire, and coats of mail, and leathern fences, and elephants'\r\nropes, and umbrellas displaced (from their places) and Yak-tails, and\r\nfans with the pierced bodies of elephants and steeds and men, with\r\nblood-dyed arrows, and with diverse other objects, lying about and\r\nloosened from their places, the field of battle looked resplendent like\r\nthe firmament bespangled with stars. Beholding the wonderful,\r\ninconceivable, and superhuman feats of those two warriors, the Charanas\r\nand the Siddhas were exceedingly amazed. As a blazing conflagration,\r\nhaving the wind for its ally, courses through an (extended) heap of dry\r\ngrass, even so, Adhiratha's son, engaged with Bhima, coursed fiercely in\r\nthat battle.[161] Both of them felled countless standards and cars and\r\nslew steeds and men and elephants, like a pair of elephants crushing a\r\nforest of reeds while engaged in battle with other. Thy host looked like\r\na mass of clouds, O king, of men, and great was the carnage caused in\r\nthat battle by Karna and Bhima.'\"[162]"

The mighty-armed Bhimasena,\r\nthe son of Pandu, though thus struck by the Suta's son, showed no signs\r\nof pain but stood immovable like a hill pierced (with arrows). In return,\r\nO sire, in that battle, he deeply pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed\r\narrow, rubbed with oil, of great keenness, and of excellent temper. (With\r\nthat arrow) he felled on the earth the large and beautiful ear-ring of\r\nKarna. And it felled down, O monarch, like a blazing luminary of great\r\neffulgence from the firmament. Excited with wrath, Vrikodara, then,\r\nsmiling the while, deeply pierced the Suta's son in the centre of the\r\nchest with another broad-headed arrow. And once again, O Bharata, the\r\nmighty-armed Bhima quickly shot in that battle ten long shafts that\r\nlooked like snakes of virulent poison just freed from their sloughs. Shot\r\nby Bhima, those shafts, O sire, striking Karna's forehead, entered it\r\nlike snakes entering an ant-hill. With those shafts sticking to his\r\nforehead, the Suta's son looked beautiful, as he did before, while his\r\nbrow had been encircled with a chaplet of blue lotuses. Deeply pierced by\r\nthe active son of Pandu, Karna, supporting himself on the Kuxara of his\r\ncar, closed his eyes. Soon, however, regaining consciousness, Karna, that\r\nscorcher of foes, with his body bathed in blood, became mad with\r\nrage.[163] Infuriated with rage in consequence of his being thus\r\nafflicted by that firm bowman Karna, endued with great impetuosity,\r\nrushed fiercely towards Bhimasena's car. Then, O king, the mighty and\r\nwrathful Karna, maddened with rage, shot at Bhimasena, O Bharata, a\r\nhundred shafts winged with vulturine feathers. The son of Pandu, however,\r\ndisregarding his foe and setting at nought his energy, began to shoot\r\nshowers of fierce arrows at him. Then Karna, O king, excited with rage, O\r\nscorcher of foes, struck the son of Pandu, that embodiment of wrath with\r\nnine arrows in the chest. Then both those tigers among men (armed with\r\narrows and, therefore), resembling a couple of tigers with fierce teeth,\r\npoured upon each other, in that battle, their arrowy showers, like two\r\nmighty masses of clouds. They sought to frighten each other in that\r\nbattle, with sounds of their palms and with showers of arrows of diverse\r\nkinds. Excited with rage, each sought in that battle to counteract the\r\nother's feat. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the mighty-armed\r\nBhima, O Bharata, cutting off, with a razor-faced arrow, the bow of the\r\nSuta's son, uttered a loud shout. Casting off that broken bow, the Suta's\r\nson, that mighty car-warrior, took up another bow that was stronger and\r\ntougher. Beholding that slaughter of the Kuru, the Sauvira, and the\r\nSindhu heroes, and marking that the earth was covered with coats of mail\r\nand standards and weapons lying about, and also seeing the lifeless forms\r\nof elephants, foot-soldiers and horsemen and car-warriors on all sides,\r\nthe body of the Suta's son, from wrath, blazed up with effulgence.\r\nStretching his formidable bow, decked with gold, Radha's son, O king,\r\neyed Bhima with wrathful glances. Infuriated with rage, the Suta's son,\r\nwhile shooting his arrows, looked resplendent, like the autumnal sun of\r\ndazzling rays at mid-day. While employed with his hands in taking up an\r\narrow, fixing it on the bow-string, stretching the string and letting it\r\noff, none could notice any interval between those acts. And while Karna\r\nwas thus engaged in shooting his arrows right and left, his bow\r\nincessantly drawn to a circle, like a terrible circle of fire. The keen\r\npointed arrows, equipped with wings of gold, shot from Karna's bow,\r\ncovered, O king, all the points of the compass, darkening the very light\r\nof the sun. Countless flights were seen, in the welkin, of those shafts\r\nequipped with wings of gold, shot from Karna's bow. Indeed, the shafts\r\nshot from the bow of Adhiratha's son, looked like rows of cranes in the\r\nsky. The arrows that Adhiratha's son shot were all equipped with\r\nvulturine feathers, whetted on stone, decked with gold, endued with great\r\nimpetuosity, and furnished with blazing points. Impelled by the force of\r\nhis bow, those arrows urged by Karna, while coursing in thousands through\r\nthe welkin looked beautiful like successive flights of locusts. The\r\narrows shot from the bow of Adhiratha's son, as they coursed through the\r\nwelkin, looked like one long continuously drawn arrow in the sky. Like a\r\ncloud covering a mountain with torrents of rain, Karna in rage, covered\r\nBhima with showers of arrows. Then thy sons, O Bharata, with their\r\ntroops, beheld the might, energy, prowess and perseverance of Bhima, for\r\nthe latter, disregarding that arrowy downpour, resembling the raging sea,\r\nrushed in wrath against Karna, Bhima, O monarch, was armed with a\r\nformidable bow, the back of whose staff was decked with gold. He\r\nstretched it so quickly that it seemed, like a second bow of Indra,\r\nincessantly drawn to a circle. Shafts issued continuously from it seemed\r\nto fill the welkin. With those straight arrows, equipped with wings of\r\ngold, shot by Bhima, a continuous line was made in the sky that looked\r\neffulgent like a garland of gold. Then those showers of (Karna's) arrows\r\nspread in the welkin, struck by Bhimasena with his shafts, were scattered\r\nin portions and fell down on the earth. Then the sky was covered with\r\nthose showers of gold-winged and swiftly-coursing arrows, of both Karna\r\nand Bhimasena, that produced sparks of fire as they clashed against each\r\nother. The very sun was then shrouded, and the very wind ceased to blow.\r\nIndeed, when the welkin was thus covered with those arrowy showers,\r\nnothing could be seen. Then the Suta's son, disregarding the energy of\r\nthe high-souled Bhima, completely shrouded Bhima with other arrows and\r\nendeavoured to prevail over him. Then, O sire, those arrowy showers shot\r\nby both of them, seemed to clash against each other like two opposite\r\ncurrents of wind. And in consequence of that clash of the arrowy showers\r\nof those two lions among men, a conflagration, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\nseemed to be generated in the sky. Then Karna, desirous of slaying Bhima,\r\nshot at him in rage many whetted arrows equipped with wings of gold and\r\npolished by the hands of the smith. Bhima, however, cut off with his own\r\nshafts every one of those arrows into three fragments, and prevailing\r\nover the Suta's son, he cried out, 'Wait, Wait.' And the wrathful and\r\nmighty son of Pandu, like an all-consuming conflagration, once more shot\r\nin rage showers of fierce shafts. And then in consequence of their\r\nleathern fences striking against their bow-strings, loud sounds were\r\ngenerated. And loud also became the sound of their palms, and terrible\r\ntheir leonine shouts, and fierce the rattle of their car-wheels and the\r\ntwang of their bow-strings. And all the combatants, O king, ceased to\r\nfight, desirous of beholding the prowess of Karna and of the son of\r\nPandu, each of whom was desirous of slaying the other. And the celestial\r\nRishis and Siddhas and Gandharvas, applauded them, saying, \"Excellent,\r\nExcellent!' And the tribes of Vidyadharas rained flowery showers upon\r\nthem. Then the wrathful and mighty-armed Bhima of fierce prowess,\r\nbaffling with his own weapons the weapons of his foe, pierced the Suta's\r\nson with many shafts. Karna also, endued with great might, baffling the\r\nshafts of Bhimasena, sped at him nine long shafts in that battle. Bhima,\r\nhowever, with as many arrows, cut off those shafts of Suta's son in the\r\nwelkin and addressed him, saying, 'Wait, Wait!' Then the mighty-armed and\r\nheroic Bhima, excited with rage, shot at Adhiratha's son an arrow\r\nresembling the rod of Yama or Death himself. Radha's son, however,\r\nsmiling, cut off that arrow, O king, of Pandu's son, however, of great\r\nProwess, with three arrows of his, as it coursed towards him through the\r\nwelkin. The son of Pandu then once more shot showers of fierce shafts.\r\nKarna, however, fearlessly received all those arrows of Bhima. Then\r\nexcited with rage, the Suta's son, Karna, by the power of his weapons,\r\nwith his straight arrows, cut off in that encounter the couple of quivers\r\nand the bow-string of fighting Bhima, as also the traces of his steeds.\r\nAnd then slaying his steeds also, Karna pierced Bhima's charioteer with\r\nfive shafts. The charioteer, quickly running away, proceeded to\r\nYudhamanyu's car. Excited with rage, the son of Radha then, whose\r\nsplendour resembled that of the Yuga-fire, smiling the while, cut off the\r\nflag-staff of Bhima and felled his banner. Deprived of his bow, the\r\nmighty-armed Bhima then seized a dart, such as car-warriors may use.\r\nExcited with wrath, he whirled it in his hand and then hurled it with\r\ngreat force at Karna's car. The son of Adhiratha then, with ten shafts,\r\ncut off, as it coursed towards him with the effulgence of a large meteor,\r\nthe gold-decked dart thus hurled (by Bhima).[164] Thereupon, that dart\r\nfell down, cut off into ten fragments by those sharp shafts of the Suta's\r\nson, Karna, that warrior conversant with every mode of warfare, then\r\nbattling for the sake of his friends. Then, the son of Kunti took up a\r\nshield decked with gold and a sword, desirous of obtaining either death\r\nor victory, Karna, however, O Bharata, smiling the while, cut off that\r\nbright shield of Bhima with many fierce shafts. Then, car-less, Bhima, O\r\nking, deprived of his shield, became mad with rage. Quickly, then, he\r\nhurled his formidable sword at Karna's car. That large sword, cutting off\r\nthe stringed bow of the Suta's son, fell down on the earth, O king, like\r\nan angry snake from the sky. Then Adhiratha's son, excited with rage in\r\nthat battle, smilingly took up another bow destructive of foes, having a\r\nstronger string, and tougher than the one he had lost. Desirous of\r\nslaying the son of Kunti, Karna then began to shoot thousands of arrows,\r\nO king, equipped with wings of gold and endued with great energy. Struck\r\nby those shafts shot from Karna's bow, the mighty Bhima leaped into the\r\nsky, filling Karna's heart with anguish. Beholding the conduct of Bhima,\r\nin battle desirous of victory, the son of Radha beguiled him by\r\nconcealing himself in his car. Seeing Karna concealing himself with an\r\nagitated heart on the terrace of his car, Bhima catching hold of Karna's\r\nflagstaff, waited on the earth. All the Kurus and the Charanas highly\r\napplauded that attempt of Bhima of snatching Karna away from his car,\r\nlike Garuda snatching away a snake. His bow cut off, himself deprived of\r\nhis car, Bhima, observant of the duties of his order, stood still for\r\nbattle, keeping his (broken) car behind him. The son of Radha, then, from\r\nrage, in that encounter, proceeded against the son of Pandu who was\r\nwaiting for battle. Then those two mighty warriors, O king, challenging\r\nas they approached each other, those two bulls among men, roared at each\r\nother, like clouds at the close of summer. And the passage-at-arms that\r\nthen took place between those two engaged lions among men that could not\r\nbrook each other in battle resembled that of old between the gods and the\r\nDanavas. The son of Kunti, however, whose stock of weapons was exhausted,\r\nwas (obliged to turn back) pursued by Karna. Beholding the elephants,\r\nhuge as hills that had been slain by Arjuna, lying (near), unarmed\r\nBhimasena entered into their midst, for impeding the progress of Karna's\r\ncar. Approaching that multitude of elephants and getting into the midst\r\nof that fastness which was inaccessible to a car, the son of Pandu,\r\ndesirous of saving his life, refrained from striking the son of Radha.\r\nDesirous of shelter, that subjugator of hostile cities viz., the son of\r\nPritha, uplifting an elephant that had been slain by Dhananjaya with his\r\nshafts, waited there, like Hanumat uplifting the peak of\r\nGandhamadana.[165] Karna, however, with his shafts, cut off that elephant\r\nheld by Bhima. The son of Pandu, thereupon, hurled at Karna the fragments\r\nof that elephant's body as also car-wheels and steeds. In fact, all\r\nobjects that he saw lying there on the field, the son of Pandu, excited\r\nwith rage, took up and hurled at Karna. Karna, however, with his sharp\r\narrows, cut off every one of those objects thus thrown at him. Bhima\r\nalso, raising his fierce fists that were endued with the force of the\r\nthunder, desired to slay the Suta's son. Soon, however, he recollected\r\nArjuna's vow. The son of Pandu, therefore, though competent, spared the\r\nlife of Karna, from desire of not falsifying the vow that Savyasachin had\r\nmade. The Suta's son, however, with his sharp shafts, repeatedly caused\r\nthe distressed Bhima, to lose the sense. But Karna, recollecting the\r\nwords of Kunti, took not the life of the unarmed Bhima. Approaching\r\nquickly Karna touched him with the horn of his bow. As soon, however, as\r\nBhimasena was touched with the bow, excited with rage and sighing like a\r\nsnake, he snatched the bow from Karna and struck him with it on the head.\r\nStruck by Bhimasena, the son of Radha, with eyes red in wrath, smiling\r\nthe while, said unto him repeatedly these words, viz., 'Beardless eunuch,\r\nignorant fool and glutton.' And Karna said, 'Without skin in weapons, do\r\nnot fight with me. Thou art but a child, a laggard in battle! There, son\r\nof Pandu, where occurs a profusion of eatables and drink, there, O\r\nwretch, shouldst thou be but never in battle. Subsisting on roots,\r\nflowers, and observant of vows and austerities, thou, O Bhima, shouldst\r\npass thy days in the woods for thou art unskilled in battle. Great is the\r\ndifference between battle and the austere mode of a Muni's life.\r\nTherefore, O Vrikodara, retire into the woods. O child, thou art not fit\r\nfor being engaged in battle. Thou hast an aptitude for a life in the\r\nwoods. Urging cooks and servants and slaves in the house to speed, thou\r\nart fit only for reproving them in wrath for the sake of thy dinner, O\r\nVrikodara! O Bhima, O thou of a foolish understanding, betaking thyself\r\nto a Muni's mode of life, gather thou fruits (for thy food). Go to the\r\nwoods, O son of Kunti, for thou art not skilled in battle. Employed in\r\ncutting fruits and roots or in waiting upon guests, thou art unfit, I\r\nthink, to take a part, O Vrikodara, in any passage-at-arms.' And, O\r\nmonarch, all the wrongs done to him in his younger years, were also\r\nreminded by Karna in harsh words. And as he stood there in weakness,\r\nKarna once more touched him with the bow. And laughing loudly, Vrisha\r\nonce more told Bhima those words, 'Thou shouldst fight with others, O\r\nsire, but never with one like me. They that fight with persons like us\r\nhave to undergo this and else! Go thither where the two Krishnas are!\r\nThey will protect thee in battle. Or, O son of Kunti, go home, for, a\r\nchild as thou art, what business hast thou with battle?' Hearing those\r\nharsh words of Karna, Bhimasena laughed aloud and addressing Karna said\r\nunto him these words in the hearing of all, 'O wicked wight, repeatedly\r\nhast thou been vanquished by me. How canst thou indulge, then, in such\r\nidle boast? In this world the ancients witnessed the victory and defeat\r\nof the great Indra himself. O thou of ignoble parentage, engage thyself\r\nwith me in an athletic encounter with bare arms. Even as I slew the\r\nmighty Kichaka of gigantic frame, I would then slay thee in the very\r\nsight of all kings.' Understanding the motives of Bhima, Karna, that\r\nforemost of intelligent men, abstained from that combat in the very sight\r\nof all the bowmen. Indeed, having made Bhima carless, Karna, O king,\r\nreproved him in such boastful language in the sight of that lion among\r\nthe Vrishnis (viz., Krishna) and of the high-souled Partha. Then the\r\nape-bannered (Arjuna), urged by Kesava, shot at the Suta's son, O king,\r\nmany shafts whetted on stone. Those arrows adorned with gold, shot by\r\nPartha's arms and issuing out of Gandiva, entered Karna's body, like\r\ncranes into the Krauncha mountains. With those arrows shot from Gandiva\r\nwhich entered Karna's body like so many snakes, Dhananjaya drove the\r\nSuta's son from Bhimasena's vicinity. His bow cut off by Bhima, and\r\nhimself afflicted with the arrows of Dhananjaya, Karna quickly fled away\r\nfrom Bhima on his great car. Bhimasena also, O bull among men, mounting\r\nupon Satyaki's car, proceeded in that battle in the wake of his brother\r\nSavyasachin, the son of Pandu. Then Dhananjaya, with eyes red in wrath,\r\naiming at Karna, quickly sped a shaft like the Destroyer urging forward\r\nDeath's self. That shaft shot from Gandiva, like Garuda in the welkin in\r\nquest of a mighty snake, quickly coursed towards Karna. The son of Drona,\r\nhowever, that mighty car-warrior, with a winged arrow of his, cut it off\r\nin mid-air, desirous of rescuing Karna from fear of Dhananjaya. Then\r\nArjuna, excited with wrath, pierced the son of Drona with four and sixty\r\narrows, O king, and addressing him, said, 'Do not fly away, O Aswathaman,\r\nbut wait a moment.' Drona's son, however, afflicted with the shafts of\r\nDhananjaya, quickly entered a division of the Kaurava army that abounded\r\nwith infuriated elephants and teemed with cars. The mighty son of Kunti,\r\nthen, with the twang of Gandiva, drowned the noise made in that battle by\r\nall other twangings of bows, of shafts decked with gold. Then, the mighty\r\nDhananjaya followed from behind the son of Drona who had not retreated to\r\na great distance, frightening him all the way with his shafts. Piercing\r\nwith his shafts, winged with the feathers of Kankas and peacocks, the\r\nbodies of men and elephants and steeds, Arjuna began to grind that force.\r\nIndeed, O chief of the Bharatas, Partha, the son of Indra, began to\r\nexterminate that host teeming with steeds and elephants and men.'\""

I think, all this is\r\ndue to the reverse brought about by time. Dhananjaya, excited with rage,\r\nhath penetrated into my host which is protected by Drona's son, and Karna\r\nand which, therefore, is incapable of being penetrated by the very gods.\r\nUnited with those two of blazing energy viz., Krishna and Bhima, as also\r\nwith that bull among the Sinis, his prowess hath been increased. Since I\r\nhave heard of Dhananjaya's entry, grief is consuming my heart, like fire\r\nconsuming a heap of dry grass, I see that all the kings of the earth with\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus amongst them, are affected by evil destiny.\r\nHaving done a great wrong to the diadem-decked (Arjuna), how can the\r\nruler of the Sindhus, if he falls within Arjuna's sight, save his life?\r\nFrom circumstantial inference, I see, O Sanjaya, how can the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, if he falls within Arjuna's sight, save his life? From\r\ncircumstantial inference, I see, O Sanjaya, that the ruler of the Sindhus\r\nis already dead. Tell me, however, truly how the battle raged. Thou art\r\nskilled in narration, O Sanjaya, tell me truly how the Vrishni hero\r\nSatyaki fought, who striving resolutely for Dhananjaya's sake, alone\r\nentered in rage the vast force, disturbing and agitating it repeatedly,\r\nlike an elephant plunging into a lake overgrown with lotuses.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that foremost of men, viz., Bhima, to proceed,\r\nafflicted with Karna's shafts in the midst, O king, or many heroes, that\r\nforemost warrior amongst the Sinis followed him on his car. Roaring like\r\nthe clouds at the close of summer, and blazing like the autumnal sun, he\r\nbegan to slaughter with his formidable bow the host of thy son, causing\r\nit to tremble repeatedly. And as the foremost one of Madhu's race, O\r\nBharata, thus proceeded along the field on his car, drawn by steeds of\r\nthe hue of silver and himself roaring terribly, none amongst thy warriors\r\ncould check his progress. Then that foremost of kings, viz., Alamvusha,\r\nfull of rage, never retreating from battle, armed with bow, and clad in a\r\ngolden coat of mail rushing quickly, impeded the progress of Satyaki,\r\nthat foremost warrior of Madhu's race. The encounter, then, O Bharata,\r\nthat took place between them was such that its like had never been. All\r\nthy warriors and the enemy, abstaining from the fight, became spectators\r\nof that engagement between those two ornaments of battle. Then that\r\nforemost of kings, viz., Alamvusha forcibly pierced Satyaki with ten\r\narrows. That bull of Sini's race, however, with shafts, cut all those\r\narrows before they could reach him. And once more, Alamvusha struck\r\nSatyaki with three sharp arrows equipped with beautiful wings, blazing as\r\nfire, and shot from his bow drawn to the ear. Those piercing through\r\nSatyaki's coat of mail, penetrated into his body. Having pierced\r\nSatyaki's body with those sharp and blazing arrows, endued with the force\r\nof fire or the wind, Alamvusha forcibly struck the four steeds of\r\nSatyaki, white as silver, with four other arrows. The grandson of Sini,\r\nendued with great activity and prowess like that of (Kesava himself), the\r\nbearer of the discus, thus struck by him, slew with four shafts of great\r\nimpetuosity the four steeds of Alamvusha. Having then cut off the head,\r\nbeautiful as the full moon and decked with excellent car-rings with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow, fierce as the Yuga-fire. Having slain that descendant\r\nof many kings in battle, that bull among the Yadus, that hero capable of\r\ngrinding hostile hosts, proceeded towards Arjuna, O king, resisting, as\r\nhe went, the enemy's troops. Indeed, O king, thus careering in the midst\r\nof the foe, the Vrishni hero, while proceeding in the wake (of Arjuna),\r\nwas seen repeatedly to destroy with his shafts the Kuru host, like the\r\nhurricane dispersing gathering masses of clouds. Whithersoever that lion\r\namong men desired to go, thither he was borne by those excellent steeds\r\nof his, of the Sindhu breed, well-broken, docile, white as milk of the\r\nKunda flower or the moon or snow, and adorned with trappings of warriors,\r\nviz., Duhsasana,--their commander. Those leaders of divisions,\r\nencompassing the grandson of Sini on all sides in that battle, began to\r\nstrike him. That foremost one among the Satwatas, that hero, viz.,\r\nSatyaki also, resisted them all with showers of arrows. Quickly checking\r\nall of them by means of his fiery shafts, that slayer of foes, viz., the\r\ngrandson of Sini, forcibly uplifting his bow, O Ajamida, slew the steeds\r\nof Duhsasana. Then, Arjuna and Krishna, beholding that foremost of men,\r\n(viz., Satyaki) in that battle, became filled with joy.\"'"

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Then the great bowmen of the Trigarta country owning\r\nstandards, adorned with gold, encompassed on all sides the mighty-armed\r\nSatyaki, that warrior who accomplished with great activity everything\r\nthat demanded accomplishment and who, having penetrated into that host,\r\nunlimited as the sea, was rushing against Duhsasana's car from desire of\r\nDhananjaya's success. Checking his course with a large throng of cars on\r\nall sides, those great bowmen, excited with rage, covered him with\r\nshowers of arrows. Having penetrated into the midst of the Bharata army\r\nwhich resembled a shoreless sea, and which, filled with the sound of\r\npalms abounded with swords and darts and maces, Satyaki, of prowess\r\nincapable of being baffled, alone vanquished his foes, those fifty\r\n(Trigarta) princes shining brilliantly in that battle. On that occasion\r\nwe saw that the conduct of Sini's grandson in battle was extremely\r\nwonderful. So great was the lightness (of his movements) that having seen\r\nhim on the west, we immediately saw him in the east. North, south, east,\r\nwest, and in the other subsidiary directions, that hero seemed to career\r\ndancingly, as if he constituted a hundred warriors in his single self.\r\nBeholding that conduct of Satyaki, endued with the sportive tread of the\r\nlion, the Trigarta warriors, unable to bear his prowess fled away towards\r\n(the division of) their own (countrymen). Then the brave warriors of the\r\nSurasenas endeavoured to check Satyaki, striking him with showers of\r\nshafts, like a driver striking an infuriated elephant with the hook. The\r\nhigh-souled Satyaki struggled with them for a short space of time and\r\nthen that hero of inconceivable prowess began to fight with the Kalingas.\r\nTransgressing that division of the Kalingas which was incapable of being\r\ncrossed, the mighty-armed Satyaki approached the presence of Dhananjaya,\r\nthe son of Pritha. Like a tired swimmer in water when he reaches the\r\nland, Yuyudhana became comforted on obtaining the sight of Dhananjaya,\r\nthat tiger among men. Beholding him approach, Kesava, addressing Partha,\r\nsaid, 'Yonder cometh the grandson of Sini, O Partha, following in thy\r\nwake. O thou of prowess incapable of being baffled, he is thy disciple\r\nand friend. That bull among men, regarding all the warriors as straw,\r\nhath vanquished them. Inflicting terrible injuries upon the Kaurava\r\nwarriors, Satyaki, who is dear to thee as life, cometh towards thee, O\r\nKiritin! Having with his shafts crushed Drona himself and Kritavarman of\r\nthe Bhoja race, this Satyaki cometh to thee, O Phalguna! Intent on\r\nYudhishthira's good, having slain many foremost of warriors, the brave\r\nSatyaki, skilled in weapons, is coming to thee, O Phalguna! Having\r\nachieved the most difficult feat in the midst of the (Kaurava) troops,\r\nthe mighty Satyaki, desirous of obtaining thy sight cometh to thee, O son\r\nof Pandu! Having on a single car fought in battle many mighty\r\ncar-warriors with the preceptor (Drona) on their head, Satyaki cometh to\r\nthee, O Partha! Despatched by Dharma's son, this Satyaki cometh to thee,\r\nO Partha, having pierced through the Kaurava army, relying on the might\r\nof his own arms. Invincible in battle, that Satyaki, who hath no warrior\r\namongst the Kauravas equal to him, is coming to thee, O son of Kunti!\r\nHaving slain, countless warriors, this Satyaki cometh to thee, O Partha,\r\nfreed from amid the Kaurva troops, like a lion from amid a herd of kine.\r\nHaving strewn the earth with the faces, beautiful as the lotus, of\r\nthousands of kings, this Satyaki is coming to thee, O Partha! Having\r\nvanquished in battle Duryodhana himself with his brothers, and having\r\nslain Jalasandha, Satyaki is coming quickly. Having caused a river of\r\nblood for its mire, and regarding the Kauravas as straw, Satyaki cometh\r\ntowards thee.' The son of Kunti, without being cheerful, said these words\r\nunto Kesava, 'The arrival of Satyaki, O mighty-armed one, is scarcely\r\nagreeable to me. I do not, O Kesava, know how king Yudhishthira the Just\r\nis. Now that he is separated from Satwata, I doubt whether he is alive; O\r\nmighty-armed one, this Satyaki should have protected the king. Why then,\r\nO Krishna, hath this one, leaving Yudhishthira followed in my wake? The\r\nking, therefore, hath been abandoned to Drona. The ruler of the Sindhus\r\nhath not yet been slain. There, Bhurisravas is proceeding against Satyaki\r\nin battle. A heavier burthen hath been cast upon me on account of\r\nJayadratha. I should know how the ling is and I should also protect\r\nSatyaki. I should also slay Jayadratha. The sun hangeth low. As regards\r\nthe mighty-armed Satyaki, he is tired; his weapons also have been\r\nexhausted. His steeds as also their driver, are tired, O Madhava!\r\nBhurisravas, on the other hand, is not tired, he hath supporters behind\r\nhim, O Kesava! Will success be Satyaki's in this encounter? Having\r\ncrossed the very ocean, will Satyaki of unbaffled prowess, will that bull\r\namongst the Sinis, of great energy, succumb, obtaining (before him) the\r\nvestige of a cow's foot?[166] Encountering that foremost one amongst the\r\nKurus, viz., the high-souled Bhurisravas, skilled in weapons, will\r\nSatyaki have good fortune? I regard this, O Kesava, to have been an error\r\nof judgment on the part of king Yudhishthira the Just. Casting of all\r\nfear of the preceptor, he hath despatched Satyaki (from away his side).\r\nLike a sky-ranging hawk after a peace of meat, Drona always endeavoureth\r\nafter the seizure of king Yudhishthira the Just. Will the king be free\r\nfrom all danger?'"

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Satwata, invincible in battle coming (towards\r\nArjuna), Bhurisravas, in rage, O king, suddenly advanced towards him. He\r\nof Kuru's race, then, O king, addressing that bull of Sini's race, said,\r\n'By luck it, is thou that hast today come within the range of my vision.\r\nToday in this; battle, I obtain the wish I had always cherished. If thou\r\ndost not flee away from battle, thou wilt not escape me with life.\r\nSlaying thee today in fight, thou that art ever proud of thy heroism, I\r\nwill, O thou of Dasarha's race, gladden the Kuru king Suyodhana. Those\r\nheroes, viz., Kesava and Arjuna, will today together behold thee lying on\r\nthe field of battle, scorched with my arrows. Hearing that thou hast been\r\nslain by me, the royal son of Dharma, who caused thee to penetrate into\r\nthis host, will today be covered with shame. Pritha's son, Dhananjaya,\r\nwill today behold my prowess when he sees thee slain and lying on the\r\nearth, covered with gore. This encounter with thee hath always been\r\ndesired by me, like the encounter of Sakra with Vali in the battle\r\nbetween the gods and the Asuras in days of old. Today I will give thee\r\ndreadful battle, O Satwata! Thou shalt thence truly understand (the\r\nmeasure of) my energy, might, and manliness. Slain by me in battle, thou\r\nshalt today proceed to the abode of Yama, like Ravana's son (Indrajit)\r\nslain by Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama. Today, Krishna and\r\nPartha and king Yudhishthira the Just, O thou of Madhu's race, witnessing\r\nthy slaughter will, without doubt, be overcome with despondency and will\r\ngive up battle. Causing thy death today, O Madhava, with keen shafts, I\r\nwill gladden the wives of all those that have been slain by thee in\r\nbattle. Having come within the scope of my vision, thou shalt not escape,\r\nlike a small deer from within the range of a lion's vision.' Hearing\r\nthese words of his, Yuyudhana, O king, answered him with a laugh, saying,\r\n'O thou of Kuru's race, I am never inspired with fear in battle. Thou\r\nshalt not succeed in terrifying me with thy words only. He will slay me\r\nin battle who will succeed in disarming me. He that will slay me in\r\nbattle will slay (foes) for all time to come.[167] What is the use of\r\nsuch idle and long-winded boast in words? Accomplish in deed what thou\r\nsayest. Thy words seem to be as fruitless as the roar of autumnal clouds.\r\nHearing, O hero, these roars of thine, I cannot restrain my laughter. Let\r\nthat encounter, O thou of Kuru's race, which has been desired by thee so\r\nlong, take place today. My heart, O sire, inspired as it is with the\r\ndesire of an encounter with thee, cannot brook any delay. Before slaying\r\nthee, I shall not abstain from the fight, O wretch.' Rebuking each other\r\nin such words, those two bulls among men, both excited with great wrath,\r\nstruck each other in battle, each being desirous of taking the other's\r\nlife. Those great bowmen both endued with great might, encountered each\r\nother in battle, each challenging the other, like two wrathful elephants\r\nin rut for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. And those two\r\nchastisers of foes, viz., Bhurisravas and Satyaki, poured upon each other\r\ndense showers of arrows like two masses of clouds. Then Somadatta's son,\r\nhaving shrouded the grandson of Sini with swift coursing shafts, once\r\nmore pierced the latter, O chief of the Bharatas, with many keen shafts,\r\nfrom desire of slaying him. Having pierced Satyaki with ten shafts,\r\nSomadatta's son sped many other keen shafts at that bull amongst the\r\nSinis, from a desire of compassing his destruction. Satyaki, however, O\r\nlord, cut off, with the power of his weapons, all those keen shafts of\r\nBhurisravas, O king, in the welkin, before, in fact, any of them could\r\nreach him. Those two heroes, those two warriors that enhanced the fame of\r\nthe Kurus and the Vrishnis respectively, both of noble lineage, thus\r\npoured upon each other their arrowy showers. Like two tigers fighting\r\nwith their claws or two huge elephants with their tusks they mangled each\r\nother with shafts and darts, such as car-warriors may use. Mangling each\r\nother's limbs, and with blood issuing out of their wounds, those two\r\nwarriors engaged in a gambling match in which their lives were at the\r\nstake, checked and confounded each other. Those heroes of excellent\r\nfeats, those enhancers of the fame of the Kurus and the Vrishnis, thus\r\nfought with each other, like two leaders of elephantine herds. Indeed,\r\nthose warriors, both coveting the highest region, both cherishing the\r\ndesire of very soon attaining the region of Brahman, thus roared at each\r\nother. Indeed, Satyaki and Somadatta's son continued to cover each other\r\nwith their arrowy showers in the sight of the Dhartarashtras filled with\r\njoy. And the people there witnessed that encounter between those two\r\nforemost of warriors who were fighting like two leaders of elephantine\r\nherds for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then each slaying the\r\nother's steeds and cutting off the other's bow, those car-less combatants\r\nencountered each other with swords in a dreadful fight. Taking up two\r\nbeautiful and large and bright shields made of bull's hide, and two naked\r\nswords, they careered on the field. Stalking in circles and in diverse\r\nother kinds of courses duly, those grinders of foes excited with rage,\r\nfrequently struck each other. Armed with swords, clad in bright armour,\r\ndecked with cuirass and Angadas, those two famous warriors showed diverse\r\nkinds of motion. They wheeled about on high and made side-thrusts, and\r\nran about, and rushed forward and rushed upwards. And those chastisers of\r\nfoes began to strike each other with their swords. And each of them\r\nlooked eagerly for the dereliction of the other. And both of those heroes\r\nleapt beautifully and both showed their skill in that battle, began also\r\nto make skilful passes at each other, and having struck each other, O\r\nking, those heroes took rest for a moment in the sight of all the troops.\r\nHaving with their swords cut in pieces each other's beautiful shield, O\r\nking, decked with a hundred moons, those tigers among men, engaged\r\nthemselves in a wrestling encounter. Both having broad chests, both\r\nhaving long arms, both well-skilled in wrestling, they encountered each\r\nother with their arms of iron that resembled spiked maces. And they\r\nstruck each other with their arms, and seized each other's arms, and each\r\nseized with his arms the other's neck. And the skill they had acquired by\r\nexercise, contributed to the joy of all the warriors that stood as\r\nspectators of the encounter. And as those heroes fought with each other,\r\nO king, in that battle, loud and terrible were the sounds produced by\r\nthem, resembling the fall of the thunder upon the mountain breast. Like\r\ntwo elephants encountering each other with the end of their tusks, or\r\nlike two bulls with their horns, those two illustrious and foremost\r\nwarriors of the Kuru and the Satwata races, fought with each other,\r\nsometimes binding each other with their arms, sometimes striking each\r\nother with their heads, sometimes intertwining each other's legs,\r\nsometimes slapping their armpits, sometimes pinching each other with\r\ntheir nails, sometimes clasping each other tightly, sometimes twining\r\ntheir legs round each other's loins, sometimes rolling on the ground,\r\nsometimes advancing, sometimes receding, sometimes rising up, and\r\nsometimes leaping up. Indeed, those two and thirty kinds of separate\r\nmanoeuvres that characterise encounters of that kind.\r\n\r\n\"When Satwata's weapons were exhausted during his engagement with\r\nBhurisravas, Vasudeva said unto Arjuna, 'Behold that foremost of all\r\nbowmen, viz., Satyaki, engaged in battle, deprived of car. He hath\r\nentered the Bharata host, having pierced through it, following in thy\r\nwake, O son of Pandu! He hath fought with all the Bharata warriors of\r\ngreat energy. The giver of large sacrificial presents, viz., Bhurisravas,\r\nhath encountered that foremost of warriors while tired with fatigue.\r\nDesirous of battle, Bhurisravas is about to encounter. Then that warrior\r\ninvincible in battle, viz., Bhurisravas, excited with wrath, vigorously\r\nstruck Satyaki, O king, like an infuriated elephant striking an\r\ninfuriated compeer. Those two foremost of warriors, both upon their cars,\r\nand both excited with wrath, fought on, king, Kesava, and Arjuna\r\nwitnessing their encounter. Then the mighty-armed Krishna, addressing\r\nArjuna, said, 'Behold, that tiger among the Vrishnis and the Andhakas has\r\nsuccumbed to Somadatta's son. Having achieved the most difficult feats,\r\nexhausted with exertion, he hath been deprived of his car. O Arjuna,\r\nprotect Satyaki, thy heroic disciple. See that foremost of men may not,\r\nfor thy sake, O tiger among men, succumb to Bhurisravas, devoted to\r\nsacrifices. O puissant one, speedily do what is needed.' Dhananjaya, with\r\na cheerful heart addressing Vasudeva, said, 'Behold, that bull amongst\r\nthe Rurus and that foremost one among the Vrishnis are sporting with each\r\nother, like a huge elephant mad with rage sporting with a mighty lion in\r\nthe forest. While Dhananjaya the son of Pandu was thus speaking, loud\r\ncries of oh and alas arose among the troops, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nsince the mighty-armed Bhurisravas, exerting vigorously struck Satyaki\r\nand brought him down upon the ground. And like a lion dragging an\r\nelephant, that foremost one of Kuru's race, viz., Bhurisravas, that giver\r\nof profuse presents at sacrifices, dragging that foremost one amongst the\r\nSatwatas, looked resplendent in that battle. Then Bhurisravas in that\r\nencounter, drawing his sword from the scabbard, seized Satyaki by the\r\nhair of his head and struck him at the chest with his feet. Bhurisravas\r\nthen was about to cut off from Satyaki's trunk his head decked with\r\near-rings. For sometime, the Satwata hero rapidly whirled his head with\r\nthe arm of Bhurisravas that held it by the hair, like a potter's wheel\r\nwhirled round with the staff. Beholding Satwata thus dragged in battle by\r\nBhurisravas. Vasudeva once more, O king, addressed Arjuna and said,\r\n'Behold, that tiger among the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, that disciple of\r\nthine, O mighty-armed one, not inferior to thee in bowmanship, hath\r\nsuccumbed to Somadatta's son. O Partha, since Bhurisravas is thus\r\nprevailing over the Vrishni hero, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being\r\nbaffled, the very name of the latter is about to be falsified.[168] Thus\r\naddressed by Vasudeva the mighty-armed son of Pandu, mentally worshipped\r\nBhurisravas in that battle, saying, 'I am glad that, Bhurisravas, that\r\nenhancer of the fame of the Kurus, is dragging Satyaki in battle, as if\r\nin sport. Without slaying Satyaki that foremost one among the heroes of\r\nthe Vrishni race, the Kuru warrior is only dragging him like a mighty\r\nlion in the forest dragging a huge elephant.' Mentally applauding the\r\nKuru warrior thus, O king, the mighty-armed Arjuna, the son of Pritha,\r\nreplied unto Vasudeva, saying, 'My eyes having rested upon of the\r\nSindhus, I could not, O Madhava, see Satyaki. I shall, however, for the\r\nsake of that Yadava warrior, achieve a most difficult feat.' Having said\r\nthese words, in obedience to Vasudeva, the son of Pandu, fixed on Gandiva\r\na sharp razor-headed arrow. That arrow, shot by Partha's hand and\r\nresembling a meteor flashing down from the firmament, cut off the Kuru\r\nwarrior's arm with the sword in the grasp and decked with Angada.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'That arm (of Bhurisravas) decked with Angada and the\r\nsword in its grasp (thus cut off), fell down on the earth to the great\r\ngrief of all living creatures. Indeed, that arm, which was to have cut\r\noff Satyaki's head itself, cut off by the unseen Arjuna, quickly dropped\r\ndown on the earth, like a snake of five heads. The Kuru warrior,\r\nbeholding himself incapacitated by Partha abandoned his hold on Satyaki\r\nand wrathfully reproved the son of Pandu.'\r\n\r\n\"Bhurisravas said, 'Thou hast, O son of Kunti, done a cruel and heartless\r\ndeed, since without being engaged with me, thou hast, unseen by me, cut\r\noff my arm. Shalt thou not have to say unto Yudhishthira, the royal son\r\nof Dharma, even this, viz., 'Bhurisravas, while otherwise engaged, was\r\nslain by me in battle?' Wert thou taught this use of weapons by the\r\nhigh-souled Indra or by Rudra, O Partha, or by Drona, or by Kripa? Thou\r\nart, in this world, better acquainted with the rules about the use of\r\nweapons than all others. Why then hast thou cut off in battle the arm of\r\na warrior who was not engaged with thee? The righteous never strike him\r\nthat is heedless, or him that is terrified, or him that is made carless,\r\nor him that beggeth for life or protection, of him that hath fallen into\r\ndistress. Why, then, O Partha, hast thou perpetrated such an extremely\r\nunworthy deed that is sinful, that is worthy only of a low wretch, and\r\nthat is practised by only a wicked bloke! A respectable person, O\r\nDhananjaya, can easily accomplish a deed that is respectable. A deed,\r\nhowever, that is disrespectable becomes difficult of accomplishment by a\r\nperson that is respectable. A man quickly catches the behaviour of those\r\nwith whom and amongst whom he moves. This is seen in thee, O Partha!\r\nBeing of royal lineage and born, especially, in Kuru's race, how hast\r\nthou fallen off from the duties of a Kshatriya, although thou wert of\r\ngood behaviour and observant of excellent vows. This mean act that thou\r\nhast perpetrated for the sake of the Vrishni warrior, is without doubt,\r\nconformable to Vasudeva's counsels. Such an act does not suit one like\r\nthee. Who else, unless he were a friend of Krishna's, would inflict such\r\na wrong upon lone that is heedlessly engaged with another in battle? The\r\nVrishnis and the Andhakas are bad Kshatriyas, ever engaged in sinful\r\ndeeds, and are, by nature, addicted to disreputable behaviour. Why, O\r\nPartha, hast thou taken them as model? Thus addressed in battle, Partha\r\nreplied unto Bhurisravas, saying, 'It is evident that with the\r\ndecrepitude of the body one's intellect also becomes decrepit, since, O\r\nlord, all those senseless words have been uttered by thee. Although thou\r\nknowest Hrishikesa and myself well, how is it that thou rebukest us thus?\r\nKnowing as I do the rules of battle and conversant as I am with the\r\nmeaning of all the scriptures, I would never do an act that is sinful.\r\nKnowing this well, thou rebukest me yet. The Kshatriyas fight with their\r\nfoes, surrounded by their own followers, their brothers, sires, sons,\r\nrelatives, kinsmen, companions, and friends. These also fight, relying on\r\nthe (strength of) arms of those they follow. Why, then, should I not\r\nprotect Satyaki, my disciple and dear kinsman, who is fighting for our\r\nsake in this battle, regardless of life itself, that is so difficult of\r\nbeing laid down.[169] Invincible in fight, Satyaki, O king, is my right\r\narm in battle. One should not protect one's own self only, when one goes\r\nto battle, he, O king, who is engaged in the business of another should\r\nbe protected (by that other). Such men being protected, the king is\r\nprotected in press of battle. If I had calmly beheld Satyaki on the point\r\nof being slain in great battle (and had not interfered for saying him),\r\nsin would, then, owing to Satyaki's death, have been mine, for such\r\nnegligence! Why then dost thou become angry with me for my having\r\nprotected Satyaki? Thou rebukest me, O king, saying, 'Though engaged with\r\nanother, I have yet been maimed by thee.' In that matter, I answer, I\r\njudged wrongly. Sometimes shaking my armour; sometimes riding on my car,\r\nsometimes drawing the bow-string, I was fighting with my enemies in the\r\nmidst of a host resembling the vast deep, teeming with cars and elephants\r\nand abounding with steeds and foot-soldiers and echoing with fierce\r\nleonine shouts. Amongst friends and foes engaged with one another, how\r\ncould it be possible that the Satwata warrior was engaged with only one\r\nperson in battle? Having fought with many and vanquished many mighty\r\ncar-warriors, Satyaki had been tired. He himself, afflicted with weapons,\r\nhad become cheerless. Having, under such circumstances, vanquished the\r\nmighty car-warrior, Satyaki, and brought him under thy control, thou\r\nsoughtest to display thy superiority. Thou. hadst desired to cut off,\r\nwith thy sword, the head of Satyaki in battle. I could not possibly\r\nbehold with indifference Satyaki reduced to that strait.[170] Thou\r\nshouldst rather rebuke thy own self, since thou didst not take care of\r\nthyself (when seeking to injure another). Indeed, O hero, how wouldst\r\nthou have behaved towards one who is thy dependant?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed (by Arjuna), the mighty-armed and\r\nillustrious Bhurisravas, bearing the device of the sacrificial stake on\r\nhis banner, abandoning Yuyudhana, desired to die according to the vow of\r\nPraya.[171] Distinguished by many righteous deeds, he spread with his\r\nleft hand a bed of arrows, and desirous of proceeding to the region of\r\nBrahman, committed his senses to the care of the deities presiding over\r\nthem. Fixing his gaze on the sun, and setting his cleansed heart on the\r\nmoon, and thinking of (the mantras in) the great Upanishad, Bhurisravas,\r\nbetaking himself to Yoga, ceased to speak. Then all the persons in the\r\nentire army began to speak ill of Krishna and Dhananjaya and applauded\r\nBhurisravas, that bull among men. Though censured, the two Krishnas,\r\nhowever, spoke not a word disagreeable (to the dying hero). The\r\nstake-bannered Bhurisravas also, though thus applauded, felt no joy. Then\r\nPandu's son Dhanajaya, called also Phalguna, incapable of bearing thy\r\nsons speaking in that strain, as also of putting up with their words and\r\nthe words of Bhurisravas, O Bharata, in grief and without an angry heart,\r\nand as if for reminding them all, said these words, 'All the kings are\r\nacquainted with my great vow, viz., that no one shall succeed in slaying\r\nanybody that belongs to our side, as long as the latter is within the\r\nrange of my shafts. Remembering this, O stake-bannered one, it behoveth\r\nthee not to censure me. Without knowing rules of morality, it is not\r\nproper for one to censure others. That I have cut off thy arm while thou,\r\nwell-armed in battle, wert on the point of slaying (the unarmed) Satyaki,\r\nis not all contrary to morality. But what righteous man is there, O sire,\r\nthat would applaud the slaughter of Abhimanyu, a mere child, without\r\narms, deprived of car, and his armour fallen off?' Thus addressed by\r\nPartha, Bhurisravas touched the ground with his left arm the right one\r\n(that had been lopped off). The stake-bannered Bhurisravas, O king of\r\ndazzling effulgence, having heard those words of Partha, remained silent,\r\nwith his head hanging down. Then Arjuna said, 'O eldest brother of Sala,\r\nequal to what I bear to king Yudhishthira the Just, or Bhima, that\r\nforemost of all mighty persons, or Nakula, or Sahadeva, is the love I\r\nbear to thee. Commanded by me as also by the illustrious Krishna, repair\r\nthou to the region of the righteous, even where Sivi, the son of Usinara,\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva also said, 'Thou hast constantly performed sacrifices and\r\nAgnihotras. Go thou then, without delay, into those pure, regions of mine\r\nthat incessantly blaze forth with splendour and that are desired by the\r\nforemost of deities with Brahma as their head, and becoming equal to\r\nmyself, be thou borne on the back to Garuda.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Set free by Somadatta's son, the grandson of Sini,\r\nrising up, drew his sword and desired to cut off the head of the\r\nhigh-souled Bhurisravas. Indeed, Satyaki desired to slay the sinless\r\nBhurisravas, the eldest brother of Sala, that giver of plenty in\r\nsacrifices who was staying with his, senses withdrawn from battle, who\r\nhad already been almost slain by the son of Pandu, who was sitting with\r\nhis arm lopped off and who resembled on that account a trunkless\r\nelephant. All the warriors loudly censured him (for his intention). But\r\ndeprived of reason, and forbidden by Krishna and the high-souled Partha,\r\nBhima, and the two protectors of the two wheels (of Arjuna's car, viz.,\r\nYudhamanyu and Uttamaujas), and Aswatthaman, and Kripa and Karna, and\r\nVrishasena, and the ruler of the Sindhus also, and while the soldiers\r\nwere yet uttering shouts of disapproval, Satyaki stew Bhurisravas while\r\nin the observance of his vow. Indeed, Satyaki, with his sword, cut off\r\nthe head of the Kuru warrior who had been deprived of his arm by Partha\r\nand who was then sitting in Praya for freeing his soul from the body. The\r\nwarriors did not applaud Satyaki for that act of his in slaying that\r\nperpetuator of Kuru's race who had before been almost slain by Partha.\r\nThe Siddhas, the Charanas, and the men there present, as also the gods,\r\nbeholding the Sakra-like Bhurisravas slain in that battle, through\r\nsitting in the observance of that Praya vow, began to applaud him, amazed\r\nat the acts, accomplished by him. Thy soldiers also argued the matter,\r\n'It is no fault of the Vrishni hero. That which was pre-ordained has\r\nhappened. Therefore, we should not give way to wrath. Anger is the cause\r\nof men's sorrow. It was ordained that Bhurisravas would be slain by the\r\nVrishni hero. There is no use of judging of its propriety or otherwise.\r\nThe Creator had ordained Satyaki to be the cause of Bhurisrava's death in\r\nbattle.'\r\n\r\n\"Satyaki said, 'Ye sinful Kauravas, wearing the outward garment of\r\nrighteousness, ye tell me, in words of virtue, that Bhurisravas should\r\nnot be slain. Where, however, did this righteousness of yours go when ye\r\nslew in battle that child, viz., the son of Subhadra, while destitute of\r\narms? I had in a certain fit of haughtiness vowed that he who would,\r\nthrowing me down alive in battle, strike me with his foot in rage, he\r\nwould be slain by me even though that foe should adopt the vow of\r\nasceticism. Struggling in the encounter, with my arms and eyes hale and\r\nsound, ye had yet regarded me as dead. This was an act of folly on our\r\npart. Ye bulls among the Kurus, the slaughter of Bhurisravas,\r\naccomplished by me, hath been very proper! Partha, however, by cutting\r\noff this one's arm with sword in grasp for fulfilling, from his affection\r\nfor me, his own vow (about protecting all on his side), hath simply\r\nrobbed me of glory. That which is ordained must happen. It is destiny\r\nthat works. Bhurisravas hath been slain in press of battle. What sin have\r\nI perpetrated? In days of yore, Valmiki sang this verse on earth, viz.,\r\n'Thou sayest, O ape, that women should not be slain. In all ages,\r\nhowever, men should always, with resolute care, accomplish that which\r\ngives pain to enemies.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, After Satyaki had said these words, none amongst the\r\nPandavas and the Kauravas, O king, said anything. On the other hand, they\r\nmentally applauded Bhurisravas. No one there applauded the slaughter of\r\nSomadatta's illustrious son who resembled an ascetic living in the woods,\r\nor one sanctified with mantras in a great sacrifice, and who had given\r\naway thousands of gold coins. The head of that hero, graced with\r\nbeautiful blue locks and eyes, red as those of pigeons, looked like the\r\nhead of a horse cut off in a Horse-sacrifice and placed on the\r\nsacrificial altar.[172] Sanctified by his prowess and the death he\r\nobtained at the edge of the weapon, the boon-giving Bhurisravas, worthy\r\nof every boon, casting off his body in great battle, repaired to regions\r\non high, filling the welkin with his high virtues.'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Unvanquished by Drona, and Radha's son and Vikarna\r\nand Kritavarman, how could the heroic Satyaki, never before checked in\r\nbattle, having after his promise to Yudhishthira crossed the ocean of the\r\nKaurava troops, being humiliated by the Kuru warrior Bhurisravas and\r\nforcibly thrown on the ground?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, about the origin, in the past times, of\r\nSini's grandson, and of how Bhurisravas also came to be descended. This\r\nwill clear thy doubts. Atri had for son Soma. Soma's son was called\r\nVudha. Vudha had one son, of the splendour of the great Indra, called\r\nPururavas. Pururavas had a son called Ayus. Ayus had for his son Nahusha.\r\nNahusha had for his son Yayati who was a royal sage equal to a celestial.\r\nYayati had by Devayani Yadu for his eldest son. In Yadu's race was born a\r\nson of the name of Devamidha of Yadu's race had a son named Sura,\r\napplauded in the three worlds. Sura had for his son that foremost of men,\r\nviz., the celebrated Vasudeva. Foremost in bowmanship, Sura was equal to\r\nKartavirya in battle. In Sura's race and equal unto Sura in energy was,\r\nborn Sini, O king! About this time, O king, occurred the Swayamvara. of\r\nthe high-souled Devaka's daughter, in which all the Kshatriyas were\r\npresent. In that self-choice, Sini vanquishing all the kings, quickly\r\ntook up on his car the princess Devaki for the sake of Vasudeva.\r\nBeholding the princess Devaki on Sini's car, that bull among men, viz.,\r\nthe brave Somadatta of mighty energy could not brook the sight. A battle,\r\nO king, ensued between the two which lasted for half a day and was\r\nbeautiful and wonderful to behold. The battle that took place between\r\nthose two mighty men was a wrestling encounter. That bull among men,\r\nviz., Somadatta, was forcibly thrown down on the earth by Sini. Uplifting\r\nhis sword and seizing him by the hair, Sini struck his foe with his foot,\r\nin the midst of many thousands of kings who stood as spectators all\r\naround. At last, from compassion, he let him off, saying, 'Live!' Reduced\r\nto that plight by Sini, Somadatta, O sire, under the influence of wrath\r\nbegan to pay his adorations to Mahadeva for inducing the latter to bless\r\nhim. That great lord of all boon-giving deities viz., Mahadeva, became\r\ngratified with him and asked him to solicit the boon he desired. The\r\nroyal Somadatta then solicited the following boon, 'I desire a soon, O\r\ndivine lord, who will strike Sini's son in the midst of thousands of\r\nkings and who will in battle strike him with his foot.' Hearing these\r\nwords, O king, of Somadatta, the god saying, 'So be it,' disappeared then\r\nand there. It was in consequence of the gift of that boon that Somadatta\r\nsubsequently obtained the highly charitable Bhurisravas for son, and it\r\nwas for this, Somadatta's son threw down Sini's descendant in battle and\r\nstruck him, before the eyes of the whole army, with his foot. I have now\r\ntold thee, O king, what thou hadst asked me. Indeed, the Satwata hero is\r\nincapable of being vanquished in battle by even the foremost of men. The\r\nVrishni heroes are all of sure aim in battle, and are conversant with all\r\nmodes of warfare. They are vanquishers of the very gods, the Danavas and\r\nthe Gandharvas. They are never confounded. They always fight, relying\r\nupon their own energy. They are never dependent on others. None, O lord,\r\nare seen in this world to be equal to the Vrishni's. None, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, have been, are, or will be equal in might to the\r\nVrishni's. They never show disrespect to their kinsmen. They are always\r\nobedient to the commands of those that are reverend in years. The very\r\ngods and Asuras and Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Uragas and the Rakshasas\r\ncannot vanquish the Vrishni heroes, what need be said of men, therefore,\r\nin battle? They never covet also the possessions of those that ever\r\nrender them aid on any occasion of distress. Devoted to the Brahmanas and\r\ntruthful in speech, they never display any pride although they are\r\nwealthy. The Vrishnis regard even the strong as weak and rescue them from\r\ndistress. Always devoted to the gods, the Vrishnis are self-restrained,\r\ncharitable, and free from pride. It is for this that the prowess,[173] of\r\nthe Vrishnis is never baffled. A person may remove the mountains of Meru\r\nor swim across the ocean but cannot defeat the Vrishnis. I have told thee\r\neverything about which thou hadst thy doubts. All this, however, O king\r\nof the Kurus, that is happening is due to thy evil policy, O best of\r\nmen!'\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After the Kuru warrior Bhurisravas had been slain\r\nunder those circumstances, tell me, O Sanjaya, how proceeded the battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After Bhurisravas had proceeded to the other world, O\r\nBharata, the mighty-armed Arjuna urged Vasudeva, saying, \"Urge the\r\nsteeds, O Krishna, to greater speed for taking me to the spot where king\r\nJayadratha is. O sinless one, the sun is quickly proceeding towards the\r\nAsta hills. O tiger among men, this great task should be achieved by me.\r\nThe ruler of the Sindhus is, again, protected by many mighty car-warriors\r\namong the Kuru army. Urge thou the steeds, therefore, O Krishna, in such\r\na way that I may, by slaying Jayadratha before the sun sets, make my vow\r\ntrue.' Then the mighty-armed Krishna conversant with horse-lore, urged\r\nthose steeds of silvery hue towards the car of Jayadratha. Then, O king,\r\nmany leaders of the Kuru army, such as Duryodhana and Karna and\r\nVrishasena and the ruler of the Sindhus himself, rushed with speed, O\r\nking, against Arjuna whose shafts were never baffled and who was\r\nproceeding, on his car drawn by steeds of great fleetness. Vibhatsu,\r\nhowever, getting at the ruler of the Sindhus who was staying before him,\r\nand casting his glances upon him, seemed to scorch him with his eyes\r\nblazing with wrath. Then, king Duryodhana, quickly addressed the son of\r\nRadha. Indeed, O monarch, thy son Suyodhana said unto Karna, 'O son of\r\nVikartana, that time of battle hath come at last. O high-souled one,\r\nexhibit now thy might. O Karna, act in such a way that Jayadratha may not\r\nbe slain by Arjuna! O foremost of men, the day is about to expire, strike\r\nnow the foe with clouds of shafts! If the day expire, O foremost of men,\r\nvictory, O Karna, will certainly be ours! If the ruler of the Sindhus can\r\nbe protected till the setting of the sun, then Partha, his vow being\r\nfalsified, will enter into blazing fire. O giver of honours, the\r\nbrothers, then, of Arjuna, with all their followers, will not be able to\r\nlive for even a moment in a world that is destitute of Arjuna! Upon the\r\ndeath of the sons of Pandu, the whole of the earth, O Karna, with her\r\nmountains and waters and forests, we will enjoy without a thorn on our\r\nside! O giver of honours, it seems that Partha, who without ascertaining\r\nwhat is practicable and what is impracticable, made this vow in battle,\r\nwas afflicted by destiny itself, his judgment having taken a misdirected\r\ncourse! Without doubt, O Karna, the diadem-decked son of Pandu must have\r\nmade this vow about the slaughter of Jayadratha for his own destruction!\r\nHow, O son of Radha, when thou art alive will Phalguna succeed in slaying\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus before the sun goes to the Asta hills? How will\r\nDhananjaya slay Jayadratha in battle when the latter is protected by the\r\nking of the Madras and by the illustrious Kripa? How will Vibhatsu, who\r\nseems to have been urged on by Fate, get at the ruler of the Sindhus when\r\nthe latter if protected by Drona's son, by myself, and Duhsasana? Many\r\nare the heroes engaged in fight. The sun is hanging low in the sky.\r\nPartha will not even get at Jayadratha in battle, O giver of honours. Do\r\nthou therefore, O Karna, with myself and other brave and mighty\r\ncar-warriors, with Drona's son and the ruler of the Madras and Kripa\r\nfight with Partha in battle, exerting thyself with the greatest firmness\r\nand resolution.' Thus addressed by thy son, O sire, the son of Radha\r\nreplied unto Duryodhana, that foremost one among the Kurus, in these\r\nwords, 'Deeply hath my body been pierced in battle by the brave bowman\r\nBhimasena, capable of striking vigorously with repeated showers of\r\narrows. O giver of honours, that I am yet present in battle is because\r\nthat one like me should be present here. Scorched with the powerful\r\nshafts of Bhimasena, every limb of mine is suffering from torturing pain\r\nI shall, however, for all that, fight to the best of my powers. My life\r\nitself is for thee. I shall strive my best so that this foremost one of\r\nthe sons of Pandu may not succeed in slaying the ruler of the Sindhus. As\r\nlong as I shall fight, shooting my whetted shafts, the heroic Dhananjaya,\r\ncapable of drawing the bow with even his left hand, will not succeed in\r\ngetting at the ruler of the Sindhus. All that a person, bearing love and\r\naffection to thee and always solicitous of thy good, may do, shall be\r\ndone by me, O thou of Kuru's race! As regards victory, that depends on\r\ndestiny. I shall in battle today exert myself to my utmost for the sake\r\nof the ruler of the Sindhus, and for achieving thy good. O king, victory,\r\nhowever, is dependent on destiny. Relying on my manliness, I shall fight\r\nwith Arjuna today for thy sake, O tiger among men! Victory, however, is\r\ndependent on destiny. O chief of the Kurus, let all the troops behold\r\ntoday the fierce battle, making the very hair stand on end, that takes\r\nplace between myself and Arjuna.' While Karna and the Kuru king were thus\r\ntalking to each other in battle, Arjuna began, with his keen arrows, to\r\nslaughter thy host. With his broad-headed arrows of great sharpness he\r\nbegan to cut off in that battle the arms, looking like spiked clubs or\r\nthe trunks of elephants, of unreturning heroes. And the mighty-armed hero\r\nalso cut off their heads with whetted shafts. And Vibhatsu also cut off\r\nthe trunks of elephants and the necks of steeds and the Akshas of cars\r\nall around, as also blood-dyed horsemen, armed with spears and lances,\r\nwith razor-faced arrows into two or three fragments. And steeds and\r\nforemost of elephants and standards and umbrellas and bows and Yalk-tails\r\nand heads fell fast on all sides. Consuming thy host like a blazing fire\r\nconsuming a heap of dry grass, Partha soon caused the earth to be covered\r\nwith blood. And the mighty and invincible Partha, of prowess incapable of\r\nbeing baffled, causing an immense slaughter in that army of thine, soon\r\nreached the ruler of the Sindhus. Protected by Bhimasena and by Satwata,\r\nVibhatsu, O chief of the Bharatas, looked resplendent like a blazing\r\nfire. Beholding Phalguna in that state, the mighty bowmen of thy army,\r\nthose bulls among men, endued with wealth of energy, could not brook him.\r\nThen Duryodhana and Karna and Vrishasena and the ruler of the Madras, and\r\nAswatthaman and Kripa and the ruler of the Sindhus himself, excited with\r\nwrath and fighting for the sake of the Sindhu king, encompassed the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna on all sides. All those warriors, skilled in battle,\r\nplacing the ruler of the Sindhus at their back, and desirous of slaying\r\nArjuna and Krishna, surrounded Partha, that hero conversant with battle,\r\nwho was then dancing along the track of his car, producing fierce sounds\r\nwith the bowstring and his palms and resembling the Destroyer himself\r\nwith wide-opened mouth. The sun then had assumed a red hue in the sky.\r\nDesirous of his (speedy) setting, the Kaurava warriors, bending their\r\nbows with arms, resembling the (tapering) bodies of snake sped their\r\nshafts in hundreds towards Phalguna, resembling the rays of the sun.\r\nCutting off those shafts thus sped towards him, into two, three, or eight\r\nfragments the diadem-decked Arjuna, invincible in battle, pierced them\r\nall in that encounter. Then Aswatthaman, bearing on his banner the mark\r\nof a lion's tail, displaying his might, began, O king, to resist Arjuna.\r\nIndeed, the son of Saradwata's daughter piercing Partha with ten shafts\r\nand Vasudeva with seven, stayed in the track of Arjuna's car, protecting\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus. Then, many foremost ones among the Kurus, great\r\ncar-warriors, all encompassed Arjuna, on all sides with a large throng of\r\ncars. Stretching their bows and shooting countless shafts, they began to\r\nprotect the ruler of the Sindhus, at the command of thy son. We then\r\nbeheld the prowess of the brave Partha as also the inexhaustible\r\ncharacter of his shafts, and the might, too, of his bow Gandiva. Baffling\r\nwith his own weapons those of Drona's son and Kripa, he pierced every one\r\nof those warriors with nine shafts. Then, Drona's son pierced him with\r\nfive and twenty arrows, and Vrishasena with seven, and Duryodhana pierced\r\nhim with twenty, and Karma and Salya each with three. And all of them\r\nroared at him and continued to pierce him frequently, and shaking their\r\nbows, they surrounded him on all sides. And soon they caused their cars\r\nto be drawn up in a serried line around Arjuna. Desirous of the (speedy)\r\nsetting of the sun, those mighty car-warriors of the Kaurava army, endued\r\nwith great activity, began to roar at Arjuna, and shaking their bows,\r\ncovered him with showers of keen arrows like cloud pouring rain on a\r\nmountain. Those brave warriors, with arms resembling heavy clubs, also\r\ndischarged on that occasion, O king, on Dhananjaya's body celestial\r\nweapons. Having caused an immense slaughter in thy army, the mighty and\r\ninvincible Dhananjaya, of prowess incapable of being baffled came upon\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus. Karna, however, O king, with his arrows,\r\nresisted him in that battle in the very sight, O Bharata, of Bhimasena\r\nand Satwata. The mighty-armed Partha, in the very sight of all the\r\ntroops, pierced the Suta's son, in return, with ten arrows, on the field\r\nof battle. Then Satwata, O sire, pierced Karna with three arrows. And\r\nBhimasena pierced him with three arrows, and Partha himself, once more,\r\nwith seven. The mighty car-warrior, Karna, then pierced each of those\r\nthree warriors with sixty arrows. And thus, O king, raged that battle\r\nbetween Karna alone (on one side) and the many (on the other). The\r\nprowess, O sire, that we then beheld of the Suta's son was wonderful in\r\nthe extreme, since, excited with wrath in battle, he singly resisted\r\nthose three great car-warriors. Then the mighty-armed Phalguna, in that\r\nbattle, pierced Karna, the son of Vikartana, in all his limbs with a\r\nhundred arrows. All his limbs bathed in blood, the Suta's son of great\r\nprowess and bravery, pierced Phalguna in return with fifty arrows.\r\nBeholding that lightness of hand displayed by him in battle, Arjuna\r\nbrooked it not. Cutting off his bow, that hero, viz., Dhananjaya, the son\r\nof Pritha, quickly pierced Karna in the centre of the chest with nine\r\narrows, Then Dhananjaya, with great speed at a time, when speed was\r\nnecessary shot in that battle a shaft of solar effulgence for the\r\ndestruction of Karna. Drona's son, however, with a crescent-shaped arrow,\r\ncut off that shaft as it coursed impetuously (towards Karna). Thus cut\r\noff by Aswatthaman, that shaft fell down on the earth. Endued with great\r\nprowess, the Suta's son, then, O king, took up another bow, and covered\r\nthe son of Pandu with several thousands of arrows. Partha, however, like\r\nthe wind dispersing flight of locusts, dispelled with his own arrows that\r\nextraordinary shower of arrows issuing out of Karna's bow. Then Arjuna,\r\ndisplaying his lightness of hands, covered Karna, in that battle, with\r\nhis arrows, in the very sight of all thy troops. Karna also, that slayer\r\nof hosts, desirous of counteracting Arjuna's feat, covered Arjuna with\r\nseveral thousands of arrows. Roaring at each other like two bulls, those\r\nlions among men, those mighty car-warriors, shrouded the welkin with\r\nclouds of straight shafts. Each rendered invisible by the other's arrowy\r\nshowers, they continued to strike each other. And they roared at each\r\nother and pierced each other with their wordy darts, saying, 'I am\r\nPartha, wait'--or, 'I am Karna, wait', O Phalguna! Indeed these two\r\nheroes fought with each other wonderfully, displaying great activity and\r\nskill. And the sight they presented was such that other warriors became\r\nwitnesses of that battle. And applauded by Siddhas, Charnas and Pannagas,\r\nthey fought with each other, O king, each desirous of slaying the other.\r\nThen Duryodhana, O king addressing thy warriors, said, 'Carefully protect\r\nthe son of Radha! Without slaying Arjuna he would not abstain from\r\nbattle. Even this is what Vrisha told me.' Meanwhile, O monarch,\r\nbeholding the prowess of Karna, Arjuna, of white steeds, with four shafts\r\nshot from the bow-string drawn to the ear, despatched the four steeds of\r\nKarna to Yama's domain. And he also felled with a broad-headed arrow,\r\nKarna's charioteer from his niche in the car. And he covered Karna\r\nhimself with clouds of shafts in the very sight of thy son. Thus shrouded\r\nwith arrows the steedless and driverless Karna, stupefied by that arrowy\r\nshower, knew not what to do. Beholding him made carless, Aswatthaman, O\r\nking, caused him to ride on his car, and continued to fight with Arjuna.\r\nThen the ruler of the Madras pierced the son of Kunti with thirty arrows.\r\nSaradwata's son pierced Vasudeva with twenty arrows. And he struck\r\nDhananjaya also with a dozen shafts. And the ruler of the Sindhus pierced\r\neach with four arrows, and Vrishasena also pierced each of them, O king,\r\nwith seven arrows. Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, pierced all of them in\r\nreturn. Indeed, piercing Drona's son with four and sixty shafts, and the\r\nruler of the Madras with a hundred, and the Sindhu king with ten\r\nbroad-headed arrows, and Vrishasena with three arrows and Saradwata's son\r\nwith twenty, Partha uttered a loud shout. Desirous of baffling the vow of\r\nSavyasachin, thy warriors, excited with wrath, quickly rushed at\r\nDhananjaya from all sides. Then Arjuna, frightening the Dhartarashtras,\r\ninvoked into existence the Varuna weapon on all sides. The Kauravas,\r\nhowever, on their costly cars, pouring showers of arrows, advanced\r\nagainst the son of Pandu. But, O Bharata, in course of that stupefying\r\nand fierce engagement, fraught with the greatest confusion, that price,\r\nviz., Arjuna, decked with diadem and gold chain never lost his senses. On\r\nthe other hand, he continued to pour showers of arrows. Desirous of\r\nrecovering the kingdom and recollecting all the wrongs he had suffered\r\nfor twelve years in consequence of the Kurus, the high-souled and\r\nimmeasurable Arjuna darkened all the points of the compass with shafts\r\nfrom Gandiva. The welkin seemed ablaze with meteors. Innumerable crows,\r\nalighting from the sky, perched on the bodies (of dead combatants).\r\nMeanwhile, Arjuna continued to slay the foe with his Gandiva, like\r\nMahadeva slaying the Asuras with his Pinaka equipped with tawny\r\nstring.[174] Then the illustrious Kiritin, that subjugator of (hostile)\r\nranks, dispersing the shafts of the foe by means of his own formidable\r\nbow, slaughtered with his arrows many foremost ones among the Kurus,\r\nmounted on their foremost of steeds and elephants. Then many kings,\r\ntaking up heavy maces and clubs of iron and swords and darts and diverse\r\nother kinds of powerful weapons, assuming terrible forms, rushed suddenly\r\nagainst Partha in that battle. Then Arjuna, bending with his arms his\r\nformidable bow Gandiva which resembled the bow of Indra himself and whose\r\ntwang was as loud as the roar of the clouds congregating at the end of\r\nthe Yuga, and laughing the while, went on consuming thy troops and\r\nincreasing the population of Yama's kingdom. Indeed, that hero caused\r\nthose enraged warriors with their cars and elephants and with the\r\nfoot-soldiers and bowmen supporting them, to be deprived of their arms\r\nand lives and thus to swell the population of Yama's domain.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing the twang, resembling the loud call of Death\r\nhimself or the frightful peal of Indra's thunder, of Dhananjaya's bow,\r\nwhile he stretched it, that host of thine, O king, anxious with fear and\r\nexceedingly agitated, became like the waters of the sea with fishes and\r\nmakaras within them, ruffled into mountain-like waves and lashed into\r\nfury by the hurricane that arises at the end of the Yuga. Then\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Pritha, careered in battle in such a way that he\r\nwas seen at the same time to be present in all directions, displaying his\r\nwonderful weapons. Indeed, so light-handed was the son of Pandu that we\r\ncould not mark when he took out his shafts, O king, when he fixed them on\r\nthe bow-string, when he stretched the bow, and when he let them off. Then\r\nthe mighty-armed one, O king, excited with wrath, invoked into existence\r\nthe invincible Aindra weapon, frightening all the Bharatas. Hundreds and\r\nthousands of blazing shafts of fiery mouths, inspired by mantras with the\r\nforce of celestial weapons, flowed from it. With those shafts resembling\r\nfire or the rays of the sun, coursing with fierce impetuosity, the welkin\r\nbecame incapable of being gazed at, as if filled with flashing meteors.\r\nThen that darkness which had been caused by the Katirava with their\r\narrows, which was incapable of being dispersed even in imagination by\r\nothers, the son of Pandu, careering around and displaying his prowess,\r\ndestroyed by means of those shafts of his that were inspired by means of\r\nmantras with the force of celestial weapons, like the sun himself\r\nspeedily dispersing at dawn of day the darkness of night by means of his\r\nrays. Then the puissant Arjuna, with those blazing shafts of his, sucked\r\nthe lives of thy warriors like the summer sun sucking with his hot rays\r\nthe waters of tanks and lakes. Indeed, showers of shafts endued with the\r\nforce of celestial weapons, (shot by Arjuna) covered the hostile army\r\nlike the rays of the sun covering the earth. Other arrows of fierce\r\nenergy, sped (by Dhananjaya), quickly entered the hearts of (hostile)\r\nheroes, like dear friends. Indeed, those brave warriors that came in that\r\nbattle before Arjuna, all perished like insects approaching a blazing\r\nfire. Thus crushing the lives of his foes and their fame, Partha careered\r\nin that battle like Death in embodied form. Heads decked with diadems,\r\nmassive arms, adorned with Angadas, and ears with ear-rings of the foes,\r\nPartha, cut off with his shafts. The arms, with spears, of\r\nelephant-riders; those, with lances, of horsemen; those, with shields, of\r\nfoot-soldiers; those with bows, of car-warriors; and those, with whips\r\nand goads, of charioteers the son of Pandu cut off. Indeed, Dhananjaya\r\nlooked resplendent with his shafts of blazing points that seemed to\r\nconstitute his rays, like a blazing fire with incessant sparks and rising\r\nflames. The hostile kings, mustering all their resolution, could not even\r\ngaze at Dhananjaya, that foremost of all bearers of arms, that hero equal\r\nto the chief of the gods himself, that bull among men, seen at the same\r\ntime in all directions on his car, scattering his mighty weapons, dancing\r\nin the tract of his car, and producing deafening sounds with his\r\nbowstring and palms, and resembling the midday sun of scorching rays in\r\nthe firmament. Bearing his shafts of blazing points, the diadem-decked\r\nArjuna looked beautiful like a mighty mass of rain-charged clouds in the\r\nseason of rains decked with a rainbow. When that perfect flood of mighty\r\nweapons was set in motion by Jishnu, many bulls among warriors sank in\r\nthat frightful and unfordable flood. Strewn with infuriated elephants\r\nwhose trunks or tusks had been cut off, with steeds deprived of hoofs or\r\nnecks, with cars reduced to pieces, with warriors having their entrails\r\ndrawn out and others with legs or other limbs cut off, with bodies lying\r\nin hundreds and thousands that were either perfectly still or moving\r\nunconsciously, we beheld the vast field, on which Partha battled,\r\nresembled the coveted arena of Death, O king, enhancing the terrors of\r\nthe timid, or like the sporting ground of Rudra when he destroyed\r\ncreatures in days of old. Portions of the field, strewn with the trunks\r\nof elephants cut off with razor-headed arrows, looked as if strewn with\r\nsnakes. Portions, again, covered with the cut-off heads of warriors,\r\nlooked as if strewn with garlands of lotuses. Variegated with beautiful\r\nhead-gear and crowns, Keyuras and Angadas and car-rings with coats of\r\nmail decked with gold, and with the trappings and other ornaments of\r\nelephants and steeds, and scattered over with hundreds of diadems, lying\r\nhere and there, and the earth looked exceedingly beautiful like a new\r\nbride. Dhananjaya then caused a fierce and terrible river full of fearful\r\nobjects and enhancing the fear of the timid, to flow resembling the\r\nVaitarani itself. The marrow and fat (of men and animals) formed its\r\nmire. Blood formed its current. Full of limbs and bones, it was\r\nfathomless in depth. The hairs of creatures formed its moss and weeds.\r\nHeads and arms formed the stones on its shores. It was decked with\r\nstandards and banners that variegated its aspect. Umbrellas and bows\r\nformed the waves. And it abounded with bodies of huge elephants deprived\r\nof life, and it teemed with cars that formed hundreds of rafts floating\r\non its surface. And the carcases of countless steeds formed its banks.\r\nAnd it was difficult to cross in consequence of wheels and yokes and\r\nshafts and Akshas and Kuveras of cars, and spears and swords and darts\r\nand battle-axes and shafts looking like snakes. And ravens and kankas\r\nformed its alligators. And jackals, forming its Makaras, made in\r\nterrible. And fierce vultures formed its sharks. And it became frightful\r\nin consequence of the howls of jackals. And it abounded with capering\r\nghosts and Pisachas and thousands of other kinds of spirits. And on it\r\nfloated countless bodies of warriors destitute of life. Beholding that\r\nprowess of Arjuna whose visage then resembled that of the Destroyer\r\nhimself, a panic, such as had never occurred before, possessed the Kurus\r\non the field of battle. The son of Pandu, then, baffling with his weapons\r\nthose of the hostile heroes, and engaged in achieving fierce feats, gave\r\nall to understand that he was a warrior of fierce feats. Then Arjuna\r\ntransgressed all those foremost of car-warriors, like the midday sun of\r\nscorching rays in the firmament, no one amongst the creatures there could\r\neven look at him. The shafts issuing out of the bow Gandiva of that\r\nillustrious hero in that battle, seemed to us to resemble a row of cranes\r\nin the welkin. Baffling with his own the weapons of all those heroes, and\r\nshowing by the terrible achievements in which he was engaged that he was\r\na warrior of fierce feats. Arjuna, desirous of slaying Jayadratha,\r\ntransgressed all those foremost of car-warriors, stupefying them all by\r\nmeans of his shafts. Shooting his shafts on all sides, Dhananjaya, having\r\nKrishna for his charioteer, presented a beautiful sight by careering with\r\ngreat speed on the field of battle. The shafts in the welkin, by hundreds\r\nand thousands, of that illustrious hero, seemed to course incessantly\r\nthrough the sky. We never could notice when that mighty bowman took out\r\nhis shafts, when indeed, that son of Pandu aimed them, and when he let\r\nthem off. Then, O king, filling all the points of the compass with his\r\nshafts and afflicting all the car-warriors in battle, the son of Kunti\r\nproceeded towards Jayadratha and pierced him with four and sixty straight\r\narrows. Then the Kuru warriors, beholding the son of Pandu proceeded\r\ntowards Jayadratha, all abstained from battle. In fact, those heroes\r\nbecame hopeless of Jayadratha's life. Every one amongst thy warriors that\r\nrushed in that fierce battle against the son of Pandu, had his body\r\ndeeply pierced, O lord, with a shaft of Arjuna. The mighty car-warrior\r\nArjuna, that foremost of victorious persons, with his shafts blazing as\r\nfire made thy army teem with headless trunks.[175] Indeed, O king, thus\r\ncreating a perfect confusion in thy host consisting of four kinds of\r\nforces, the son of Kunti proceeded towards Jayadratha, And he pierced the\r\nson of Drona. with fifty shafts and Vrishasena with three. And the son of\r\nKunti mildly struck Kripa with nine arrows, and he struck Salya with\r\nsixteen arrows and Karna with two and thirty. And piercing the ruler of\r\nthe Sindhus then with four and sixty arrows, he uttered a leonine shout.\r\nThe ruler of the Sindhus, however, thus pierced by the wielder of Gandiva\r\nwith his arrows, became filled with rage and unable to brook it, like an\r\nelephant when pierced with the hook. Bearing the device of the boar on\r\nhis banner, he quickly sped towards Phalguna's car many straight shafts\r\nequipped with vulturine feathers, resembling angry snakes of virulent\r\npoison, well-polished by the hands of the smith, and shot from his bow\r\ndrawn to the fullest stretch. Then piercing Govinda with three shafts, he\r\nstruck Arjuna with six. And then he pierced the steeds of Arjuna with\r\neight arrows and his standard also with one. Then Arjuna, baffling the\r\nkeen arrows sped by the ruler of the Sindhus, cut off at the same time,\r\nwith a pair of shafts, the head of Jayadratha's driver and the\r\nwell-decked standard also of Jayadratha. Its stay cut off and itself\r\npierced and struck with arrows, that standard fell down like a flame of\r\nfire. Meanwhile, the sun was going down quickly. Janardana then quickly\r\naddressed the son of Pandu and said, 'Behold, O Partha, the ruler of the\r\nSindhus hath, by six mighty and heroic car-warriors, been placed in\r\ntheir-midst! Jayadratha also, O mighty-armed one, is waiting there in\r\nfear! Without vanquishing those six car-warriors in battle, O bull among\r\nmen, thou wilt never be able to slay the ruler of the Sindhus even if\r\nthou exertest thyself without intermission. I shall, therefore, resort to\r\nYoga for shrouding the sun. Then the ruler of the Sindhus will (in\r\nconsequence) behold the sun to have set. Desirous of life, O lord,\r\nthrough joy that wicked wight will no longer, for his destruction,\r\nconceal himself. Availing yourself of that opportunity, thou shouldst\r\nthen, O best of the Kurus, strike him. Thou shouldst not give up the\r\nenterprise, thinking the sun to have really set.' Hearing these words,\r\nVibhatsu replied unto Kesava, saying, 'Let it be so.' Then Krishna\r\notherwise called Hari, possessed of ascetic powers, that lord of all\r\nascetics, having taken recourse to Yoga, created that darkness. Thy\r\nwarriors, O king, thinking the sun to have set were filled with delight\r\nat the prospect of Partha's laying down his life. Indeed, thy warriors,\r\nnot seeing the sun, were filled with gladness. All of them stood, with\r\nheads thrown backwards. King Jayadratha also was in the same attitude.\r\nAnd while the ruler of the Sindhus was thus beholding the sun, Krishna,\r\nonce more addressing Dhananjaya said these words, 'Behold, the heroic\r\nruler of the Sindhus is now looking at the sun, casting off his fear of\r\nthee, O foremost one among the Bharatas! This is the hour, O mighty-armed\r\none, for the slaughter of that wicked-souled wretch. Speedily cut off the\r\nhead and make thy vow true.' Thus addressed by Kesava the valiant son of\r\nPandu began to slaughter thy host with his arrows resembling the sun or\r\nfire in splendour. And he pierced Kripa with twenty arrows and Karna with\r\nfifty. And he struck Salya and Duryodhana each with six. And he pierced\r\nVrishasena with eight arrows and the ruler of the Sindhus himself with\r\nsixty. And the mighty-armed son of Pandu, O king, deeply piercing with\r\nhis arrows the other warriors of thy host, rushed against Jayadratha.\r\nBeholding him in their presence like a swelling fire with its tongue of\r\nflame outstretched, the protectors of Jayadratha were sorely puzzled.\r\nThen all the warriors, O king, desirous of victory bathed the son of\r\nIndra in that battle with torrents of arrows. Shrouded with incessant\r\nshowers of arrows, the son of Kunti, that mighty-armed and unvanquished\r\ndescendant of Kuru, became filled with rage. Then that tiger among men,\r\nviz., the son of Indra, desirous of slaughtering thy host, created a\r\nthick net of arrows. Then those warriors of thine, O king, thus\r\nslaughtered in battle by that hero, abandoned the ruler of the Sindhus in\r\nfear and fled away. And they fled away in such a manner that no two\r\npersons could be seen flying together. The prowess that we then beheld of\r\nKunti's son was extremely wonderful. Indeed, the like of what that\r\nillustrious warrior then did had never been nor will ever be. Like Rudra\r\nhimself slaughtering creatures, Dhananjaya slaughtered elephants and\r\nelephant-riders, horses and horse-riders, and (car-warriors and)\r\ncar-drivers. I did not in that battle, O king, see a single elephant or\r\nsteed or human warrior that was not struck with Partha's shafts. Their\r\nvision blurred by dust and darkness, thy warriors became perfectly\r\ncheerless and unable to distinguish one another. Urged on by fate and\r\nwith their vital limbs cut open and mangled with shafts, they began to\r\nwander or, limp, or fall down. And some amongst them, O Bharata, became\r\nparalysed and some became deathly pale. During that terrible carnage\r\nresembling the slaughter of creatures at the end of the Yuga, in that\r\ndeadly and fierce battle from which few could escape with life, the earth\r\nbecame drenched with gore and the earthy dust that had arisen disappeared\r\nin consequence of the showers of blood that fell and the swift currents\r\nof wind that blew over the field. So deep was that rain of blood that the\r\nwheels of cars sank to their naves. Thousands of infuriated elephants\r\nendued with great speed, O king, of thy army, their riders slain and\r\nlimbs mangled, fled away, uttering cries of pain and crushing friendly\r\nranks with their tread. Steeds destitute of riders and foot-soldiers\r\nalso, O king, fled away, O monarch, from fear, struck with the shafts of\r\nDhananjaya. Indeed, thy soldiers, with dishevelled hair and deprived of\r\ntheir coats of mail, with blood streaming out of their wounds, fled away\r\nin terror, leaving the field of battle. And some, deprived of the power\r\nof motion as if their lower limbs had been seized by alligators, remained\r\non the field. And others concealed themselves behind and under the bodies\r\nof slain elephants Routing thy host thus, O king, Dhananjaya began to\r\nstrike with terrible shafts the protectors of the ruler of the Sindhus\r\nwith his arrowy showers, Karna and Drona's son and Kripa and Salya and\r\nVrishasena and Duryodhana. So quick was he in the use of weapons that no\r\none could mark when Arjuna took out his arrows, when he fixed them on the\r\nbowstring, when he stretched---the bow and let them off. Indeed, while\r\nstriking the foe, his bow was seen incessantly drawn to a circle. His\r\narrows also were seen incessantly issuing out of his bow and scattered in\r\nall directions. Then cutting off Karna's bow as also of Vrishasena's,\r\nArjuna felled Salya's driver from his niche in the car, with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow. With many arrows that foremost of victors, viz.,\r\nDhananjaya, then deeply pierced in that battle Kripa and Aswatthaman,\r\nrelated as uncle and nephew to each other. Sorely afflicting those mighty\r\ncar-warriors of thy army thus, the son of Pandu took up a terrible arrow\r\nof fiery splendour. Looking like the thunderbolt of Indra, and inspired\r\nwith divine mantras, that formidable arrow was capable of bearing any\r\nstrain. And it had been always worshipped with incense and garlands of\r\nflowers. Duly inspiring it (by mantras) with the force of the\r\nthunderbolt, that descendant, of Kuru, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna,\r\nfixed it on Gandiva. When that arrow of fiery effulgence was fixed on the\r\nbowstring, loud shouts, O king, were heard in the welkin. Then Janardana,\r\nonce more addressing Arjuna, quickly said, 'O Dhananjaya, quickly cut off\r\nthe head of the wicked-souled ruler of the Sindhus! The sun is about to\r\nget at the mountain of Asta. Listen, however, to the words I say about\r\nthe slaughter of Jayadratha. The father of Jayadratha is Vriddhakshatra\r\nknown all over the world. It was after a long time that he got\r\nJayadratha, that slayer of foes, for his son. (At the birth of the son)\r\nan incorporeal and invisible voice, deep as that of the clouds or of the\r\ndrum, said unto king Vriddhakshatra. 'This thy son, O lord, amongst men\r\nin this world will become worthy of the two races (viz., the Solar and\r\nthe Lunar) in respect of blood, behaviour, self-restraint and the other\r\nattributes. He will become one of the foremost of Kshatriyas, and will\r\nalways be worshipped by heroes. But while struggling in battle, some bull\r\namong the Kshatriyas, some conspicuous person in the world, excited with\r\nwrath, will cut off this one's head.' That chastiser of foes, viz., the\r\n(old) ruler of the Sindhus, hearing these words, reflected for sometime.\r\nOverwhelmed with affection for his son, he summoned all his kinsmen and\r\nsaid, 'That man who will cause the head of my son to fall on the earth\r\nwhile the latter, struggling in battle, will be bearing a great burthen,\r\nI say that the head of that man will certainly crack into a hundred\r\npieces.' Having spoken these words and installed Jayadratha on the\r\nthrone, Vriddhakshatra, repairing to the woods, devoted himself to\r\nascetic austerities. Endued with great energy, he is still engaged in the\r\nobservance of the austerest of penances outside this very\r\nSamantapanchaka, O ape-bannered one! Therefore, cutting off Jayadratha's\r\nhead in this dreadful battle, thou, O slayer of foes, shouldst, O\r\nBharata, by thy fierce celestial weapon of wonderful feats, quickly throw\r\nthat head decked with car-rings upon the lap of Vriddhakshatra himself, O\r\nyounger brother of the son of the Wind-god! If thou fellest Jayadratha's\r\nhead on the earth, thy own head, then, without doubt, will crack into a\r\nhundred fragments. Aided by thy celestial weapon, do thee deed in such a\r\nway that the lord of earth viz., the old Sindhu king, may not know that\r\nit is done. Truly, O Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds which\r\nthou canst not achieve or do, O son of Vasava!' Hearing these words (of\r\nKrishna), Dhananjaya, licking the corners of his mouth, quickly shot that\r\narrow which he had taken up for Jayadratha's slaughter, that arrow, viz.,\r\nwhose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, which was inspired with\r\nmantras and converted into a celestial weapon, which was capable of\r\nbearing any strain, and which had always been worshipped with incense and\r\ngarlands. That shaft, sped from Gandiva, coursing swiftly, snatched\r\nJayadratha's head away, like a hawk snatching away a smaller bird from\r\nthe top of a tree. Dhananjaya, then, with his shafts, sent that head\r\nalong in the welkin (without allowing it to fall down). For grieving his\r\nfoes and gladdening his friends, the son of Pandu, by shooting his shafts\r\nrepeatedly at it, sent that head outside the limits of Samantapanchaka.\r\nMeanwhile, king Vriddhakshatra, the father of thy son-in-law, endued with\r\ngreat energy, was, O sire, engaged in his evening prayers. Decked with\r\nblack locks and adorned with ear-rings, that head of Jayadratha was\r\nthrown upon Vriddhakshatra's lap, as the latter was saying his prayers in\r\na sitting posture. Thus thrown on his lap, that head decked with\r\ncar-rings, O chastiser of foes, was not seen by king Vriddhakshatra. As\r\nthe latter, however, stood up after finishing his prayers it suddenly\r\nfell down on the earth. And as the head of Jayadratha fell down on the\r\nearth, the head of Vriddhakshatra, O chastiser of foes, cracked into a\r\nhundred pieces. At the sight of this, all creatures were filled with\r\nwonder. And all of them applauded Vasudeva and the mighty Vibhatsu.\r\n\r\n\"After, O king, the ruler of the Sindhus had been slain by the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, that darkness, O bull of Bharata's race, was\r\nwithdrawn by Vasudeva. Thy sons with their followers, O king, thus, came\r\nto know subsequently that the darkness, they had seen, had all been an\r\nillusion produced by Vasudeva. Even thus, O king, was thy son-in-law, the\r\nruler of the Sindhus, having caused eight Akshauhinis to be slaughtered,\r\nhimself slain by Partha of inconceivable energy. Beholding Jayadratha,\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus slain, tears of sorrow fell from the eyes of thy\r\nsons. After Jayadratha, O king, had been slain by Partha, Kesava blew his\r\nconch and that scorcher of foes, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna also blew\r\nhis; Bhimasena also, in that battle, as if for sending a message to\r\nYudhishthira, filled the welkin with a tremendous leonine shout.\r\nYudhishthira, the son of Dharma, bearing that tremendous shout understood\r\nthat the ruler of the Sindhus had been slain by the high-souled Phalguna.\r\nWith sounds of drums and other instruments he gladdened the warriors of\r\nhis own army, and proceeded against the son of Bharadwaja from desire of\r\nbattle. Then commenced, O king, after the sun had set, a fierce battle\r\nbetween Drona and the Somakas, that made the very hair stand on end.\r\nDesirous of slaying him, those mighty car-warriors after the fall of\r\nJayadratha, fought with the son of Bharadwaja, exerting themselves to\r\ntheir utmost. Indeed, the Pandavas, having got the victory by slaying the\r\nruler of the Sindhus fought with Drona, intoxicated with success. Arjuna,\r\nalso, O king, having slain king Jayadratha, fought with many mighty\r\ncar-warriors of thy army. Indeed, that hero decked with diadem and\r\ngarlands, having accomplished his former vow, began to destroy his foes\r\nlike the chief of the celestials destroying the Danavas, or the sun\r\ndestroying darkness.'"

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, what did my warriors do after\r\nthe heroic ruler of the Sindhus had been slain, by Arjuna.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the ruler of the Sindhus, O sire, slain in\r\nbattle by Partha, Kripa, the son of Saradwat, under the influence of\r\nwrath, covered the son of Pandu with a dense shower of arrows. Drona's\r\nson also, on his car, rushed against Phalguna, the son of Pritha. Those\r\ntwo foremost of car-warriors began from their cars to shower from\r\nopposite directions upon the son of Pandu their keen arrows. That\r\nforemost of car-warriors, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna, afflicted by\r\nthose arrowy showers of (Kripa and Drona's son) felt great pain. Without\r\ndesiring, however, to slay his preceptor (Kripa) as also the son of (his\r\nother preceptor) Drona, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, began to act like a\r\npreceptor in arms. Baffling with his own weapons those of both\r\nAswatthaman and Kripa, he sped at them, without desiring to slay them,\r\nshafts that coursed mildly. Those shafts, however (though mildly), shot\r\nby Jaya struck the two with great force, and in consequence of their\r\nnumber, caused great pain to Kripa and his nephew. Then Saradwat's son, O\r\nking, thus afflicted with the arrows of Arjuna, lost all strength and\r\nswooned away on the terrace of his car. Understanding his master\r\nafflicted with shafts to be deprived of his senses, and believing him to\r\nbe dead, the driver of Kripa's car bore Kripa away from the fight. And\r\nafter Kripa, the son of Saradwat, had thus been borne away from the\r\nbattle, Aswatthaman also, from fear, fled away from the son of Pandu.\r\nThen the mighty bowman, Partha, beholding the son of Saradwat afflicted\r\nwith shafts and in a swoon, began to indulge, on his car, in piteous\r\nlamentations. With a tearful face and in great dejection of heart, he\r\nuttered these words: Beholding all this (in his mental vision), Vidura of\r\ngreat wisdom had, on the birth of the wretched Suyodhana, that\r\nexterminator of his race, said unto Dhritarashtra, 'Let this wretch of\r\nhis race be soon killed. Owing to him, a great calamity will overtake the\r\nforemost ones of Kuru's race.` Alas, these words of the truth-telling\r\nVidura have come to be true. It is for him that I behold my preceptor\r\ntoday lying on a bed of arrows. Fie on the practices of Kshatriya! Fie on\r\nmy might and prowess! Who else like me would fight with a Brahmana that\r\nis, besides his preceptor? Kripa is the son of a Rishi; he is, again, my\r\npreceptor; he is also the dear friend of Drona. Alas, he lieth stretched\r\non the terrace of his car, afflicted with my arrows. Though not wishing\r\nit, I have still been the means of crushing him with my shafts. Lying\r\nsenseless on the terrace of his car, he paineth my heart exceedingly.\r\nEven though he afflicted me with shafts, I should still have only looked\r\nat that warrior of dazzling splendour (without striking him in return).\r\nStruck with numerous shafts of mine, he hath gone the way of all\r\ncreatures. By that he hath pained me more than even the slaughter of my\r\nown son. Behold, O Krishna, to what plight he hath been reduced, thus\r\nlying miserably and in a senseless state on his own car. Those bulls\r\namong men that give desirable objects unto their preceptors after\r\nobtaining knowledge from them, attain to godhead. Those lowest of mortals\r\non the other hand, who, after obtaining knowledge from their preceptors\r\nstrike the latter, those wicked men, go to hell. Without doubt, this act\r\nthat I have done will lead me to hell. I have deeply pierced my preceptor\r\non his car with showers of arrows. While studying the science of arms at\r\nhis feet, Kripa told me in those days, 'Do not, O thou of Kuru's race,\r\never strike thy preceptor. That command of my righteous and high-souled\r\npreceptor I have not obeyed, for I have struck, the very Kripa himself\r\nwith my shafts. I bow to that worshipful son of Gotama, to that\r\nunretreating hero. Fie on me, O thou of Vrishni's race, since I have\r\nstruck even him.' While Savyasachin was thus lamenting for Kripa, the son\r\nof Radha, beholding the ruler of the Sindhu slain, rushed towards him.\r\nSeeing the son of Radha thus rushing towards Arjuna the two Panchala\r\nprinces and Satyaki suddenly rushed towards him. The mighty car-warrior,\r\nPartha, beholding the son of Radha advancing, smilingly addressed the son\r\nof Devaki and said, 'Yonder cometh the son of Adhiratha against the car\r\nof Satyaki. Without doubt, he is unable to bear the slaughter of\r\nBhurisravas in battle. Urge my steeds, O Janardana, towards the spot\r\nwhither Karna cometh. Let not Vrisha (Karna) cause the Satwata hero to\r\nfollow in the wake of Bhurisravas.' Thus addressed by Savyasachin, the\r\nmighty-armed Kesava, endued with great energy, replied in these opportune\r\nwords, 'The mighty-armed Satyaki is singly a match for Karna, O son of\r\nPandu! How much superior then will this bull among the Satwatas be when\r\nhe is united with the two sons of Drupada! For the present, O Partha, it\r\nis not proper for thee to fight with Karna. The latter hath with him the\r\nblazing dart, like a fierce meteor, that Vasava gave him. O slayer of\r\nhostile heroes, he hath kept it for thy sake, worshipping it with\r\nreverence. Let Karna then freely proceed against the Satwata hero. I\r\nknow, O son of Kunti, this wicked wight's hour, when, indeed, thou wilt,\r\nwith keen shafts, throw him down from his car.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, how the battle took place\r\nbetween the heroic Karna and Satyaki of the Vrishni race, after the fall\r\nof Bhurisravas and of the ruler of the Sindhus. Satyaki had been carless,\r\nupon what car then was he mounted? And how also did the two protectors of\r\nthe wheels (of Arjuna's car), viz., the two Panchala princes, fight?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'I will describe to thee all that happened in that\r\ndreadful battle. Listen patiently to (the consequences of) thy own evil\r\nconduct. Before even the encounter, Krishna knew it in his heart that the\r\nheroic Satyaki would be vanquished by the stake-bannered (Bhurisravas).\r\nJanardana, O king, knoweth both the past and the future. For this,\r\nsummoning his charioteer, Daruka, he had commanded him, saying, 'Let my\r\ncar be kept equipped tomorrow.' Even this had been the command of that\r\nmighty one. Neither the gods, nor the Gandharvas, nor the Yakshas, nor\r\nthe Uragas, nor the Rakshasas, nor human beings, are capable of\r\nconquering the two Krishnas. The gods with the Grandsire at their head,\r\nas also the Siddhas, know the incomparable prowess of those two. Listen,\r\nhowever, now to the battle as it happened. Beholding Satyaki carless and\r\nKarna ready for battle Madhava blew his conch of loud blare in the\r\nRishabha note.[176] Daruka, hearing the blare of (Kesava's) conch,\r\nunderstood the meaning, and soon took that car, equipped with a lofty\r\nstandard of gold, to where Kesava was. With Kesava's permission, upon\r\nthat car guided by Daruka, and which resembled the blazing fire or the\r\nsun in effulgence, ascended the grandson of Sini. Ascending upon the car\r\nwhich resembled a celestial vehicle and unto which were yoked those\r\nforemost of steeds, capable of going everywhere at will, viz., Saivya and\r\nSugriva and Meghapushya and Valahaka, and which were adorned with\r\ntrappings of gold, Satyaki rushed against the son of Radha, scattering\r\ncountless shafts. The two protectors of (Arjuna's) car-wheels, viz.,\r\nYudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, abandoning Dhananjaya's car, proceeded against\r\nthe son of Radha. Radha's son also, O king, shooting showers of shafts,\r\nangrily rushed, in that battle, against the invincible grandson of Sini.\r\nThe battle that took place between them was such that its like had never\r\nbeen heard to have taken place on earth or in heaven between gods,\r\nGandharvas, Asuras, Uragas, or Rakshasas. The entire host consisting of\r\ncars, steeds, men, and elephants, abstained from the fight, Beholding, O\r\nmonarch, the stunning feats of two warriors. All became silent spectators\r\nof that superhuman battle between those two human heroes, O king, and of\r\nthe skill of Daruka in guiding the car. Indeed, beholding the skill of\r\nthe charioteer Daruka standing on the car, as he guided the vehicle\r\nforwards, backwards, sidelong, now wheeling in circles and now stopping\r\noutright, all were amazed. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the Danavas, in\r\nthe welkin, intently watched that battle between Karna and the grandson\r\nof Sini. Both of them endued with great might, each challenging the\r\nother, those two warriors put forth their prowess for the sake of their\r\nfriends. Karna who looked like a celestial, and Yuyudhana, O king, rained\r\nupon each other showers of shafts. Indeed, Karna ground the grandson of\r\nSini with his arrowy downpours, unable to put up with the slaughter (by\r\nSatyaki) of the Kuru hero, Jalasandha. Filled with grief and sighing like\r\na mighty snake, Karna, casting angry glances on the grandson of Sini in\r\nthat battle, and as if burning him therewith, rushed at him furiously\r\nagain and again, O Chastiser of foes! Beholding him filled with rage,\r\nSatyaki pierced him in return, shooting dense showers of arrows, like an\r\nelephant piercing (with his tusks) a rival elephant. Those two tigers\r\namong men, endued with the activity of tigers and possessed of\r\nincomparable prowess, mangled each other furiously in that battle. The\r\ngrandson of Sini, then, with shafts made entirely of iron, repeatedly\r\npierced Karna, that chastiser of foes, in all his limbs. And he also\r\nfelled, with a broad-headed arrow, the charioteer of Karna from his niche\r\nin the car. And with his keen shafts, he slew the four steeds, white in\r\nhue, of Adhiratha's son. And then cutting into a hundred fragments the\r\nstandard of Karna with a hundred arrows, that bull among men made Karna\r\ncarless in the very sight of thy son. Then all thy warriors, O king,\r\nbecame cheerless. Then Vrishasena, the son of Karna, and Salya, the ruler\r\nof the Madras, and Drona's son, encompassed the grandson of Sini from all\r\nsides. Then a confusion set in, and nothing could be seen. Indeed, when\r\nthe heroic Karna was made carless by Satyaki, cries of Oh and Alas arose,\r\namong all thy troops. Karna also, O king, pierced by Satwata with his\r\narrows and exceedingly weakened ascended the car of Duryodhana, sighing\r\ndeeply, remembering his friendship for thy son from his childhood and\r\nhaving striven to realise the promise he had made about the bestowal of\r\nsovereignty on Duryodhana. After Karna hath been made carless, thy brave\r\nsons, headed by Duhsasana, O king, were not slain by the self-restrained\r\nSatyaki because the latter wished not to falsify the vow made by\r\nBhimasena. Desirous also of not falsifying the vow formerly made by\r\nPartha (about the slaughter of Karna), Satyaki simply made those warriors\r\ncarless and weakened them exceedingly, but did not deprive them of life.\r\nIt is Bhima that hath vowed the slaughter of thy sons, and it is Partha\r\nthat, at the time of the second match at dice, vowed the slaughter of\r\nKarna. Although all those warriors headed by Karna made strong efforts\r\nfor slaying Satyaki, yet those foremost of car-warriors, failed to slay\r\nhim. Drona's son and Kritavarman and other mighty car-warriors, as also\r\nhundreds of foremost Kshatriyas, were all vanquished by Satyaki with only\r\none bow. That hero fought, desirous of benefiting king Yudhishthira the\r\nJust, and of attaining to heaven. Indeed, Satyaki, that crusher of foes,\r\nis equal to either of the two Krishnas in energy. Smiling the while, he\r\nvanquished all thy troops, O best of men! In this world, there are only\r\nthree mighty bowmen, viz., Krishna, Partha, and Satyaki. There is no\r\nfourth to be seen.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Ascending on the invincible car of Vasudeva that\r\nhad Daruka for its driver, Satyaki, proud of the might of his arms and\r\nequal in battle unto Vasudeva himself, made Karna carless. Did Satyaki\r\nride any other car (after his encounter with Karna was over)? I am\r\ndesirous of hearing this, O Sanjaya! Thou art skilled in narration. I\r\nregard Satyaki to be endued with unbearable prowess. Tell me all, O\r\nSanjaya!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, how it had happened. The intelligent\r\nyounger brother of Daruka soon brought unto Satyaki another car, duly\r\nequipped with all necessaries. With shafts attached to it by chains of\r\niron and gold and bands of silk, decked with a thousand stars, decked\r\nwith banners and with the figure of a lion on his standard, with horses,\r\nfleet as the wind and adorned with trappings of gold, yoked unto it, and\r\nwith rattle deep as the roar of the clouds, that car was brought unto\r\nhim. Ascending upon it, the grandson of Sini rushed against thy troops.\r\nDaruka, meanwhile, went as he listed to Kesava's side. A new cat was\r\nbrought for Karna also, O king, unto which were yoked four steeds of the\r\nbest breed that were decked in trappings of gold and white as conchs or\r\nmilk. Its kaksha and standard were made of gold. Furnished with banners\r\nand machines, that foremost of cars had an excellent driver. And it was\r\nfurnished with a profusion of weapons of every kind. Mounting on that\r\ncar, Karna also rushed against his foes. I have now told thee all that\r\nthou hadst asked me. Once more, however, O king, learn the (extent of\r\nthe) destruction caused by the evil policy. Thirty one of thy sons have\r\nbeen slain by Bhimasena. Having Durmukha for their foremost, they were\r\nconversant with all modes of warfare. Satyaki and Arjuna also have slain\r\nhundreds of heroes with Bhimasena as their foremost, and Bhagadatta also,\r\nO sire! Even thus, O king, hath the destruction commenced, caused by thy\r\nevil counsels.'"

Tell me all, O\r\nSanjaya!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'After Bhimasena had been made carless, that hero,\r\nafflicted with the wordy darts of Karna and filled with rage, addressed\r\nPhalguna and said, 'In thy very sight, O Dhananjaya, Karna hath\r\nrepeatedly said to me, 'Eunuch, fool, glutton, unskilled in weapons, do\r\nnot fight, child, unable to bear the burden of battle!' He that would\r\ntell me so would be slain by me. Karna hath told me those words, O\r\nBharata! O mighty-armed one, thou knowest the vow which I have made\r\njointly with thee. Remember the words that were then spoken by me. O\r\nforemost of men, act in such a way that that vow of mine, O son of Kunti,\r\nas also thy own vow, may not be falsified. O Dhananjaya, do that by which\r\nthat vow of mine may be made true.' Hearing these words of Bhima, Arjuna\r\nof immeasurable prowess, getting near Karna in that battle, told him, 'O\r\nKarna, thou art of false fight. O son of a Suta, thou applaudest thy own\r\nself. Of wicked understanding, listen now to what I tell thee. Heroes\r\nmeet with either of these two things in battle, viz., victory or defeat.\r\nBoth of these are uncertain, O son of Radha! The case is not otherwise\r\nwhen Indra himself is engaged in battle. Made carless by Yuyudhana, with\r\nthy senses no longer under thy control, thou wert almost at the point of\r\ndeath. Remembering, however, that I had vowed to slay thee, that hero\r\ndismissed thee without taking thy life. It is true thou hadst succeeded\r\nin depriving Bhimasena of his car. Thy abuse, however, O son of Radha, of\r\nthat hero was sinful. Those bulls among men that are truly righteous and\r\nbrave, having vanquished a foe, never boast, nor speak ill of anybody.\r\nThy knowledge, however, is little. It is for this, O son of a Suta, that\r\nthou indulged in such speeches. Then, again the abusive epithets thou\r\ndidst apply to the battling Bhimasena, endued with great prowess and\r\nheroism and devoted to the practices of the righteous, were not\r\nconsistent with truth. In the very sight of all the troops, of Kesava, as\r\nalso of myself, thou wert many a time made carless by Bhimasena in\r\nbattle. That son of Pandu, however, did not call thee a single harsh\r\nword. Since, however, thou hast addressed Vrikodara in many harsh\r\nspeeches, and since thou with others hast slain the son of Subhadra out\r\nof my sight, therefore, this very day obtain the fruit of those offences\r\nof thine. It was for thy own destruction, O wicked wight, that thou didst\r\nthen cut off Abhimanyu's bow; for that, O thou of little understanding,\r\nthou shalt be slain by me, with all thy followers, forces, and animals.\r\nAccomplish now all those acts which thou shouldst do, for a great\r\ncalamity is impending over thee. I will slay Vrishasena in thy very sight\r\nin battle. All those other kings, again, that will fully advance against\r\nme, I will despatch unto Yama's abode. I say this truly, laying my hand\r\non my weapon. A fool as thou art, without wisdom and full of vanity, I\r\nsay that beholding thee lying on the field of battle the wicked\r\nDuryodhana will indulge in bitter lamentations.' After Arjuna had vowed\r\nthe slaughter of Karna's son, a loud and tremendous uproar arose amongst\r\nthe car-warriors. At that frightful time when confusion was everywhere,\r\nthe thousand-rayed sun, dimming his rays, entered the Asta hill. Then, O\r\nking, Hrishikesa, stationed in the van of battle embracing Arjuna who had\r\naccomplished his vow, told him these words, By good luck, O Jishnu, thy\r\ngreat vow hath been accomplished. By good luck, that Vriddhakshatra hath\r\nbeen slain along with his son. The celestial generalissimo himself, O\r\n-Bharata, encountering the Dhartarashtra force, would, in battle, O\r\nJishnu, lose his senses. There is no doubt of this. Except thee, O tiger\r\namong men, I do not even in thought see the person in the three worlds\r\nthat could fight with this host. Many royal warriors endued with great\r\nprowess, equal to thee or superior have been united together at\r\nDuryodhana's command. Clad in mail, they could not approach thee,\r\nencountering thy angry self in battle. Thy energy and might are equal to\r\nthat of Rudra or the Destroyer himself. None else is capable of putting\r\nforth such prowess in battle as thou, O scorcher of foes, alone and\r\nunsupported, didst today put forth. Thus shall I applaud thee again after\r\nKarna of wicked soul has been slain along with his followers. Thus shall\r\nI glorify thee when that foe of thine shall have been vanquished and\r\nslain.' Unto him Arjuna replied, 'Through thy grace, O Madhava, this vow\r\nthat even the gods could with difficulty accomplish, hath been\r\naccomplished by me. Their victory is not at all a matter of wonder that\r\nhave thee, O Kesava, for their lord. Through thy grace, Yudhishthira will\r\nobtain the whole earth. All this is due to thy power, O thou of Vrishni's\r\nrace! This is thy victory, O lord! Our prosperity is thy victory, O lord!\r\nOur prosperity is thy care and we are thy servants, O slayer of Madhu!'\r\nThus addressed, Krishna smiled softly, and slowly urged the steeds. And\r\nhe showed unto Partha, as they came, the field of battle abounding with\r\ncruel sights.\r\n\r\n\"Then Krishna said, 'Desirous of victory in battle or world-wide fame\r\nmany heroic kings are lying on the earth, struck with thy shafts. Their\r\nweapons and ornaments lay scattered, and their steeds, cars, and\r\nelephants are mangled and broken. With their coats of mail pierced or cut\r\nopen, they have come to the greatest grief. Some of them are yet alive,\r\nand some of them are dead. Those, however, that are dead, still seem to\r\nbe alive in consequence of the splendour with which they are endued.\r\nBehold the earth covered with their shafts equipped with golden wings,\r\nwith their numerous other weapons of attack and defence, and with their\r\nanimals (deprived of life). Indeed, the earth looks resplendent with\r\ncoats of mail and necklaces of gems, with their heads decked with\r\nearrings, and headgears and diadems, and floral wreaths and jewels worn\r\non crowns, and Kanthasutras and Angadas, and collars of gold, and with\r\ndiverse other beautiful ornaments. Strewn with Anuskaras and quivers,\r\nwith standards and banners, with Upaskaras and Adhishthanas, with shafts\r\nand crests of cars, with broken wheels and beautiful Akshas in profusion,\r\nwith yokes and trappings of steeds, with belts and bows and arrows, with\r\nelephants, housings, with spiked maces and hooks of iron, with darts and\r\nshort arrows, with spears and pikes, with Kundas and clubs, with\r\nSataghnis and Bhushandis, with scimitars and axes, with short and heavy\r\nclubs and mallets, with maces and Kunapas, with whips decked with gold, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, with the bells and diverse other ornaments of\r\nmighty elephants, with floral garlands and various kinds of decorations,\r\nand with costly robes all loosened from the bodies of men and animals,\r\nthe earth shines brilliantly, like the autumnal firmament with planets\r\nand stars. The lords of the earth, slain for the sake of earth, are\r\nslumbering on the earth clasping with their limbs the earth like a dear\r\nwife. Like mountains shedding through their caves and fissures streams of\r\nliquid chalk, these elephants, resembling Airavata himself and huge as\r\nmountains, are shedding profuse streams of blood through the openings in\r\ntheir bodies caused by weapons. Behold, O hero, those huge creatures\r\nafflicted with shafts lying on the ground in convulsions. Behold, those\r\nsteeds also, lying on the ground, adorned with trappings of gold. Behold\r\nalso, O Partha, those riderless and driverless cars that had at one time\r\nresembled celestial vehicles or the vapoury forms in the evening sky, now\r\nlying on the ground, with standards and banners and Akshas and yokes cut\r\ninto pieces, and with broken shafts and crests, O lord. Foot-soldiers\r\nalso, O hero, bearing bows and shields and slain in hundreds and\r\nthousands are lying on the ground, bathed in blood and clasping the earth\r\nwith every limb and their locks smeared with dust. Behold, O mighty-armed\r\none, those warriors with bodies mangled with thy weapons. Behold the\r\nearth, strewn with Yak-tails and fans, and umbrellas and standards, and\r\nsteeds and cars and elephants, and with diverse kinds of blankets, and\r\nreins of steeds, and beautiful robes and costly Varuthas (of cars), look,\r\nas if overspread with embroidered tapestry. Many warriors fallen from the\r\nbacks of well-equipped elephants along with those creatures themselves\r\nthat they had ridden, are looking like lions fallen from mountain summits\r\nstruck down by thunder. Mingled with the steeds (they had ridden) and the\r\nbows (they had held), horsemen and foot-soldiers in large numbers, are\r\nlying on the field, covered with blood. Behold, O foremost of men, the\r\nsurface of the earth is frightful to look at, covered as it is with large\r\nnumber of slain elephants and steeds and car-warriors, and miry with\r\nblood, fat, and rotten flesh in profusion, and on which dogs and wolves\r\nand Pisachas and diverse wanderers of the night are cantering with joy!\r\nThis fame-enhancing and mighty feat on the field of battle is capable of\r\nbeing achieved by thee only, O puissant one, or by that chief of the\r\ngods, viz., Indra himself, who in great battle slayeth the Daityas and\r\nthe Danavas.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, \"Thus showing the field of battle unto the\r\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, Krishna blew his conch Panchajanya with the gleeful\r\nsoldiers of the Pandava army (blowing their respective conchs). Having\r\nshown the field of battle unto the diadem-decked hero, that slayer of\r\nfoes viz., Janardana quickly proceeded towards Ajatasatru, the son of\r\nPandu, and informed him of the slaying of Jayadratha.'\"[177]"

And he said, 'By good luck,\r\nO king of kings, thy prosperity increaseth. O best of men, thy foe hath\r\nbeen slain. By good luck, thy younger brother hath accomplished his vow.'\r\nThus addressed by Krishna, that subjugator of hostile towns, viz., king\r\nYudhishthira, filled with joy, came down from his car, O Bharata! His\r\neyes filled with tears of joy, he embraced the two Krishnas and wiping\r\nhis bright and lotus-like face, said these words unto Vasudeva, and\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Pandu, 'Ye mighty car-warriors, by good luck, I\r\nbehold both of you after ye have accomplished your task. By good luck,\r\nthat sinful wretch, viz., the ruler of the Sindhus, hath been slain. Ye\r\nKrishnas, by good luck, ye have done that which hath filled me with great\r\nhappiness. By good luck, our foes have been plunged into an ocean of\r\ngrief. Thou art the sovereign lord of all the worlds, O slayer of Madhu!\r\nIn the three worlds they that have thee for their preceptor can have no\r\nobject incapable of accomplishment. Through thy grace, O Govinda, we will\r\nconquer our foes, like Indra conquering the Danavas in days of old. Be it\r\nthe conquest of the world, or be it the conquest of the three worlds,\r\neverything is certain, O thou of the Vrishni race, in their case with\r\nwhom thou art gratified, O giver of honours! They can have no sin, nor\r\ncan they meet with defeat in battle with whom thou, O lord of the\r\ncelestials, art gratified, O giver of honours! It is through thy grace, O\r\nHrishikesa, that Sakra hath become the chief of the celestials. It is\r\nthrough thy grace, that blessed personage obtained on the field of battle\r\nthe sovereignty of the three worlds! It is through thy grace, O lord of\r\nthe celestials, that the latter obtained immortality, O Krishna, and\r\nenjoy eternal regions (of bliss). Having slain thousands of Daityas, with\r\nprowess having its origin in thy grace, O slayer of foes, Sakra obtained\r\nthe lordship of the celestials. Through thy grace, O Hrishikesa, the\r\nmobile and immobile universe, without swerving from its (ordained)\r\ncourse, O hero, is engaged in prayers and homa![178] In the beginning,\r\nthis universe, enveloped in darkness, had been one vast expanse of water.\r\nThrough thy grace, O mighty-armed one, the universe became manifest, O\r\nbest of men! Thou art the creator of all the worlds, thou art the Supreme\r\nSoul, and thou art immutable! They that behold thee, O Hrishikesa, are\r\nnever confounded. Thou art the Supreme God, thou art the God of gods, and\r\nthou art Eternal. They that seek refuge with thee, O lord of the gods,\r\nare never confounded. Without beginning and without death, thou art\r\nDivine, the Creator of all the worlds, and immutable. They that are\r\ndevoted to thee, O Hrishikesa, always tide over every difficulty. Thou\r\nart Supreme, the Ancient one, the Divine-Being, and that which is the\r\nHighest of the high. He that attaineth to that viz., thy Supreme Self\r\nhath ordained for him the highest prosperity. Thou art sung in the four\r\nVedas. The four Vedas sing of thee. Be seeking thy shelter, O high-souled\r\none, I shall enjoy unrivalled prosperity. Thou art the Supreme God, thou\r\nart the God of the highest gods, thou art the lord of Winged creatures,\r\nand the lord of all human beings. Thou art the Supremest Lord of\r\neverything. I bow to thee, O best of beings! Thou art the Lord, the Lord\r\nof lords O puissant one! Prosperity to thee, O Madhava! O thou of large\r\neyes, O Universal soul, Thou art the origin of all things. He, again,\r\nthat is a friend of Dhananjaya or is engaged in Dhananjaya's good,\r\nobtaineth thee that art the preceptor of Dhananjaya and attaineth to\r\nhappiness.' Thus addressed by him those high-souled ones, viz., Kesava\r\nand Arjuna, cheerfully said unto the king, that lord of the earth, 'The\r\nsinful king Jayadratha, hath been consumed by the fire of thy wrath. O\r\npuissant one, although the Dhartarashtra host is vast and swelleth with\r\npride, yet, O Bharata, struck and slain, it is being exterminated. O\r\nslayer of foes, it is in consequence of thy wrath that the Kauravas are\r\nbeing destroyed. Having, O hero, angered thee that canst slay with thy\r\neyes alone, the wicked-minded Suyodhana, with his friends and kinsmen,\r\nwill have to lay down his life in battle. Slain before in consequence of\r\nthy ire, and struck down also by the gods themselves, the invincible\r\nBhishma, the grandsire of the Kurus, lieth now on a bed of arrows. O\r\nslayer of foes, victory in battle is unattainable by them, and death also\r\nwaiteth for them, that have thee, O son of Pandu, for their foe. Kingdom,\r\nlife, dear ones, children, and diverse kinds of bliss, will soon be lost\r\nby him with whom thou, O scorcher of foes, hast been angry. I regard the\r\nKauravas to be lost with their sons, and kinsmen, when thou, O scorcher\r\nof foes, that art observant of the duties of a king, hast been angry with\r\nthem.' Then Bhima, O king, and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, both\r\nmangled with shafts, saluted their senior. And those two mighty bowmen\r\nsat down on the ground, surrounded by the Panchalas, Beholding those two\r\nheroes filled with joy and arrived and waiting with joined hands, the son\r\nof Kunti congratulated them both, saying, 'By good luck, it is that I see\r\nyou both, ye heroes, escaped with lire from that sea of (hostile) troops,\r\nthat sea in which Drona acted the part of an invincible alligator, and\r\nthe son of Hridika that of a fierce shark. By good luck, all the kings of\r\nthe earth have been vanquished (by you two).[179] By good luck, I see\r\nboth of you victorious in battle. By good luck, Drona hath been\r\nvanquished in battle, and that mighty car-warrior also viz., the son of\r\nHridika. By good luck, Karna hath been vanquished in battle with barbed\r\nshafts. By good luck, Salya also was obliged to turn away from the field\r\nby you both, ye bulls among men. By good luck, I behold you both come\r\nback from battle safe and sound, ye that are foremost of car-warriors and\r\nwell-skilled in battle! By good luck, I behold again, ye heroes, that\r\nhave forded that sea of troops in obedience to my command, ye that went\r\nto battle impelled by the desire of honouring me! Ye are heroes\r\ndelighting in battle. Ye are to me as life. By good luck, I see you\r\nboth.' Having said this, the son of Pandu, O king, embraced both\r\nYuyudhana and Vrikodara, those tigers among men, and shed tears of joy.\r\nThen, O monarch, the entire host of the Pandavas became cheerful and\r\nfilled with joy. And all of them once more set their hearts on battle.'\""

Beholding that great terrible slaughter of his troops caused\r\nby Jishnu and Bhimasena and Satwata in battle, he became pale, dejected\r\nand melancholy, and his eyes became filled with tears. And he came to\r\nthink no warrior existed on the earth that could be compared with Arjuna.\r\nNeither Drona, nor the son of Radha, nor Aswatthaman, nor Kripa, O sire,\r\nis competent to stand before Arjuna when the latter is excited with\r\nwrath, And Suyodhana, said unto himself, 'Having vanquished in battle all\r\nthe mighty car-warriors of my army, Partha slew the ruler of the Sindhus.\r\nNone could resist him. This my vast host hath almost been exterminated by\r\nthe Pandavas. I think, there is no one that can protect my army, no, not\r\neven Purandara himself. He, relying upon whom I have been engaged in this\r\npassage-at-arms in battle, alas, that Karna hath been defeated in battle\r\nand Jayadratha slain. That Karna relying upon whose energy I regarded\r\nKrishna as straw who came to sue me for peace, alas, that Karna hath been\r\nvanquished in battle.' Grieving so within his heart, that offender\r\nagainst the whole world, O king, went to Drona, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nfor seeing him. Repairing unto him, he informed Drona of that immense\r\nslaughter of the Kurus, the victory of his foes, and the dire calamity of\r\nthe Dhartarashtras.[180] And Suyodhana said, 'Behold, O preceptor, this\r\nimmense slaughter of kings.[181] I came to battle, placing that grandsire\r\nof mine, viz., the heroic Bhishma, at our head. Having slain him,\r\nSikhandin, his aspiration fulfilled, stayeth at the very van of all the\r\ntroops, surrounded by all the Panchalas, covetous of another\r\ntriumph.[182] Another disciple of thine, viz., the invincible\r\nSavyasachin, having slain seven. Akshauhinis of troops hath despatched\r\nking Jayadratha to Yama's abode. How, O preceptor, shall I be freed from\r\nthe debt I owe to those allies of mine who, desirous of victory to me and\r\never engaged in my good, have gone to Yama's abode? Those lords of earth\r\nwho had desired the sovereignty of the earth, are now lying on the earth,\r\nabandoning all their earthly prosperity. Truly, I am a coward. Having\r\ncaused such a slaughter of friends, I dare not think that I shall be\r\nsanctified by performing even a hundred horse-sacrifices. I am covetous\r\nand sinful and a transgressor against righteousness. Through my acts\r\nalone, these lords of earth, in their desire for victory, have gone to\r\nYama's abode. Why, in presence of those kings, does not the earth yield\r\nme a hole (through which to sink), since I am so sinful in behaviour and\r\nsuch a fomenter of internecine dissensions![183] Alas, what will the\r\ngrandsire with blood-red eyes, that invincible hero who hath conquered\r\nthe other world, tell me in the midst of the kings when he meets me?[184]\r\nBehold that mighty bowman, Jalasandha, slain by Satyaki. That great\r\ncar-warrior, that hero, came proudly to battle for my sake, prepared to\r\nlay down his life. Beholding the ruler of the Kamvojas slain, as also\r\nAlamvusha and many other allies of mine, what object can I have for\r\npreserving my life? Those unretreating heroes who, fighting for my sake\r\nand struggling to the utmost of their powers to vanquish my foes, have\r\nlaid down their lives. I shall today, O scorcher of foes, exerting the\r\nutmost measure of my might, free myself from the debt that I owe them and\r\ngratify them with oblations of water by repairing to the Yamuna. O\r\nforemost of all bearers of arms, I tell thee truly and swear by the good\r\nacts I have performed, by the prowess I possess and by my sons, that\r\nslaying all the Panchalas with the Pandavas, I shall obtain peace of\r\nmind, or slain by them in battle I shall repair to those regions whither\r\nthose allies of mine have gone. I shall certainly proceed thither whither\r\nthose bulls among men, slain, while engaged in battle for my sake, by\r\nArjuna have gone! Our allies, seeing that they are not well-protected by\r\nus, no longer desire to stand by us. O thou of mighty arms, they now\r\nregard the Pandavas to be preferable to ourselves. Thyself, of sure aim,\r\nhast ordained our extermination in battle, for thou treatest Arjuna\r\nleniently, since he is thy disciple. It is for this that all those have\r\nbeen slain who had endeavoured to secure victory to us. It seems that\r\nonly Karna now wishes us victory. The man of weak understanding who\r\nwithout duly examining another, accepteth him for a friend and engageth\r\nhim in concerns that require friends for their accomplishment, is certain\r\nto suffer injury even so hath this affair of mine been managed by my best\r\nfriend![185] I am exceedingly covetous, sinful, crooked-hearted, and\r\ncharacterised by avarice! Alas, king Jayadratha hath been slain, and\r\nSomadatta's son also of great energy, and the Abhishahas, the Surasenas,\r\nthe Sivis, and the Vasatis! I shall go thither today whither those bulls\r\namong men, slain, while engaged in battle for my sake, by Arjuna, have\r\ngone. In the absence of those bulls among men, I have no need for life. O\r\npreceptor of the sons of Pandu, let me have thy permission in this."

Tell me all this, O Sanjaya!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Loud wails arose among thy coops, O Bharata, after the\r\nslaughter of Bhurisravas and the ruler of the Sindhus. All of them\r\ndisregarded the counsels of thy son, those counsels in consequence of\r\nwhich leaders of men, by hundreds, were slain, As regards Drona, hearing\r\nthose words of thy son, he became filled with grief. Reflecting for a\r\nshort while, O monarch, he said these words in great affliction.\r\n\r\n\"Drona said, O Duryodhana, why dost thou pierce me thus with wordy\r\nshafts? I told thee before that Arjuna is incapable of defeat in battle.\r\nProtected by the diadem-decked Arjuna, Sikhandin slew Bhishma. By that\r\nfeat, O thou of Kuru's race, the prowess of Arjuna in battle hath been\r\nwell-tested. Beholding Bhisma who was incapable of being defeated by the\r\ngods and the Danavas, actually slain in battle, even then I knew that\r\nthis Bharata host is doomed. Upon the fall of him whom of all persons in\r\nthe three worlds, we had regarded to be the very foremost of heroes, who\r\nelse is there upon whom we are to rely? Those dice, O sire, with which\r\nSakuni formerly played in the Kuru assembly, were not dice but keen\r\narrows capable of slaying foes. Even those arrows, O sire, sped by Jaya,\r\nare now slaying us. Though Vidura characterised them to be such, thou\r\ndidst not yet understand them to be so. Those words, again, that the wise\r\nand high-souled Vidura, with tears in his eyes had then said unto thee,\r\nthose auspicious words recommending peace, thou didst not then hear. That\r\ncalamity which foretold hath now come. That frightful carnage, O\r\nDuryodhana, hath now come as the result of that disobedience by thee of\r\nVidura's words. That man of foolish understanding who, disregarding the\r\nsalutary words of trusted friends, followeth his own opinion, soon falls\r\ninto a pitiable plight. O son of Gandhari, this great evil, viz., that\r\ndragging in our very sight to the Kuru assembly of Krishna who never\r\ndeserved such treatment, who hath been born in a noble race, and who\r\npractiseth every virtue. Know that all this is but little, for in the\r\nnext world dire consequences yet will be thine. Vanquishing the Pandavas\r\nat dice by deceit, thou hadst sent them, into the woods, attired in\r\ndeer-skins. What other Brahmana, except myself, in this world, would seek\r\nto injure those princes that are ever engaged in the practice of virtue\r\nand that are to me even as my own sons\" With the approval of\r\nDhritarashtra, in the midst of the Kuru assembly, thou hadst, with Sakuni\r\nas thy help-mate, provoked the ire of the Pandavas. United with\r\nDuhsasana, Karna then fanned that wrath. Disregarding the words of\r\nVidura, thou hast repeatedly fanned it thyself. With resolute care, all\r\nof you had surrounded Arjuna, resolved to stand by the ruler of the\r\nSindhus. Why then have all of you been vanquished and why also has\r\nJayadratha been slain? Why, when thou art alive, and Karna, and Kripa,\r\nand Salya, and Aswatthaman, O Kauravya, hath the ruler of the Sindhus\r\nbeen slain? For rescuing the ruler of the Sindhus, the kings (on thy\r\nside) had put forth all their fierce energy. Why, then, hath Jayadratha\r\nbeen slain in their midst? Relying upon me, king Jayadratha had expected\r\nhis rescue from the hands of Arjuna. He, however, obtained not the rescue\r\nhe had expected. I do not also see my safety for my own self. Until I\r\nsucceed in slaying the Panchalas with Sikhandin, I feel like one sinking\r\nin the Dhristadyumna-mire. Having failed, O Bharata, in rescuing the\r\nruler of the Sindhus, why dost thou pierce me thus with thy wordy shafts,\r\nseeing that I too am burning with grief? Thou seest not any longer on the\r\nfield the gold standards of Bhishma of sure aim, that warrior who was\r\nnever tired in battle. How, then, canst thou hope for success? When the\r\nruler of the Sindhus and Bhurisravas also have been slain in the very\r\nmidst of so many mighty car-warriors, what do you think, will the end be?\r\nKripa, difficult of being vanquished, is still alive, O king! That he\r\nhath not followed in the track of Jayadratha, I applaud him highly for\r\nthis! When I saw Bhishma himself, that achiever of the most difficult\r\nfeats (in battle), that warrior who was incapable of being slain in\r\nbattle by the gods with Vasava at their head, slain in thy sight, O\r\nKaurava, as also of thy younger brother Duhsasana, I thought then, O\r\nking, that the Earth hath abandoned thee. Yonder the troops of the\r\nPandavas and the Srinjayas, united together, are now rushing against me.\r\nFor achieving thy good in battle, O son of Dhritarashtra, I will not\r\nwithout slaying all the Panchalas, put off my armour. O king, go and tell\r\nmy son Aswatthaman who is present in battle that even at the risk of his\r\nlife he should not let the Somakas alone.[186] Thou shouldst also tell\r\nhim, 'Observe all the instructions thou hast received from thy father. Be\r\nfirm in acts of humility, in self-restraint, in truth and righteousness.\r\nObservant of religion, profit, and pleasure, without neglecting religion\r\nand profit, thou shouldst always accomplish those acts in which religion\r\npredominates. The Brahmanas should always be gratified with presents. All\r\nof them deserve thy worship. Thou shouldst never do anything that is\r\ninjurious to them. They are like flames of fire. As regards myself, I\r\nwill penetrate the hostile host, O slayer of foes, for doing great\r\nbattle, pierced as I am by thee with thy wordy shafts. If thou canst, O\r\nDuryodhana, go and protect those troops. Both the Kurus and the Srinjayas\r\nhave been angry. They will fight even during the night.' Having said\r\nthese words, Drona proceeded against the Pandavas and set himself to\r\nover-ride the energy of the Kshatriyas like the sun overshadowing the\r\nlight of the stars.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION CLI\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Thus urged by Drona, king Duryodhana, filled with rage\r\nset his heart on battle. And thy son, Duryodhana, then said unto Karna,\r\n'Behold, the diadem-decked son of Pandu, with Krishna alone for helpmate,\r\npenetrated into the array formed by the preceptor, an array that the gods\r\nthemselves could not pierce, and in the very sight of the illustrious\r\nDrona struggling in battle and of many other foremost of warriors, slew\r\nthe ruler of the Sindhus. Behold, O son of Radha, many foremost of kings\r\nlying on the earth, slain in battle. Partha unaided by any one, in the\r\nvery sight of the illustrious Drona and myself, vigorously exerting\r\nourselves like a host of inferior animals-slain by a lion. The son of\r\nSakra hath reduced my host to a small remnant of what it was. How,\r\nindeed, could Phalguna, in spite of the resistance offered by Drona in\r\nbattle, accomplish his vow by slaying the ruler of the Sindhus? If Drona\r\nhad not himself willed it, O hero, how could the son of Pandu, in battle,\r\nhave pierced that impenetrable array, overcoming his struggling\r\npreceptor? Truly, Phalguna is exceedingly dear to the illustrious\r\npreceptor! For this, the latter gave him admittance, without having\r\nfought with him. Behold my misfortune! Having in the first instance\r\npromised protection unto the ruler of the Sindhus, Drona, that scorcher\r\nof foes, gave unto the diadem-decked Arjuna admittance into the array! If\r\nhe had in the beginning granted permission to the ruler of the Sindhus\r\nfor his return home, without doubt, such an awful carnage would then have\r\nnever occurred. Alas! Jayadratha, in hopes of saving his life, had\r\ndesired to return home. Having obtained from Drona a promise of\r\nprotection in battle, it was I, a fool that I was, who prevented him from\r\ngoing. Alas, today my brothers having Chitrasena for their head, have all\r\nperished in the very sight of our wretched selves.'[187]\r\n\r\n\"Karna said, 'Do not blame the preceptor. That Brahmana is fighting\r\naccording to the measure of his power and courage and regardless of his\r\nvery life. If Arjuna, of white steeds, having transgressed him,\r\npenetrated into our array, the slightest fault does not, for that, attach\r\nto the preceptor. Phalguna is accomplished in weapons, possessed of great\r\nactivity, endued with youth; he is a hero who has mastered all arms; he\r\nis distinguished for the celerity of his movements. Armed with celestial\r\nweapons and mounted on his ape-bannered car, the reins of whose steeds\r\nagain were in the hands of Krishna, cased in impenetrable armour, and\r\ntaking his celestial bow Gandiva of unfading might, the valiant Arjuna,\r\nscattering keen arrows, and proud of the strength of his arms,\r\ntransgressed Drona. There is nothing to wonder at this. The preceptor, on\r\nthe other hand is, O king, old and incapable of proceeding quickly. He is\r\nalso, O king, incapable of exercising his arms long. It was for this that\r\nPhalguna, of white steeds and having Krishna for his charioteer,\r\nsucceeded in transgressing the preceptor. For this reason also, I do not\r\nsee any fault in Drona. For all that, when Arjuna, of white steeds,\r\npenetrated into our array, having transgressed the preceptor it seems\r\nthat the latter, however skilled in weapons, is incapable of vanquishing\r\nthe Pandavas in battle. I think that which is ordained by Fate never\r\noccurs otherwise. And since, O Suyodhana, in spite of ourselves fighting\r\nto the utmost extent of our powers, the ruler of the Sindhus has been\r\nslain in battle, it seems that Fate is all-powerful. With thyself we had\r\nall been exerting to the utmost of our might on the field of battle.\r\nFate, however, baffling our exertions, did not smile on us. We have\r\nalways exerted to injure the Pandavas, relying both on deceit and\r\nprowess. Whatever act, O king, a person afflicted by Fate does, is\r\nfrustrated by Fate, however, much the person himself may strive to\r\nachieve it. Whatever, indeed, a man endued with perseverance should do,\r\nought to be done fearlessly. Success depends on Fate! By deceit the sons\r\nof Pritha were beguiled as also by the administration of poison, O\r\nBharata! Burnt they were in the palace of lac, vanquished they were at\r\ndice. In accordance with the dictates of statecraft, they were exited\r\ninto the woods. All these, though done by us with care, have been baffled\r\nby Fate. Fight with resolution, O king, setting Fate at nought. Between\r\nthee and them, both striving to the best of your prowess even Fate may\r\nprove auspicious to that party which excels the other.[188] No wise\r\nmeasures have been adopted by the Pandavas with the aid of superior\r\nintelligence. Nor, O hero, do we see, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, that\r\nthou hast done anything unwise from want of intelligence! It is Fate that\r\ndecides the result of acts, wise or unwise; Fate, ever intent on its own\r\npurposes is awake when all else sleeps. Vast was thy host, and thy\r\nwarriors are many. Even thus the battle began. With their small force,\r\nmuch greater and consisting of men capable of smiting effectually, hath\r\nbeen much reduced. I fear, it is the work of Fate, that has frustrated\r\nour exertions.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'While they were discoursing thus, O king, the\r\nPandava divisions appeared for battle. Then occurred a fierce battle\r\nbetween thy warriors and theirs, in which cars and elephants encountered\r\none another. All this, however, O king, was due to thy evil policy!'\""

Resolved to\r\ngo to the other world, the Panchalas and the Kauravas fought with one\r\nanother for admission into the swelling domains of Yama. Brave warriors,\r\nencountering brave rivals, pierced one another with arrows and lances and\r\ndarts, and quickly despatched one another unto Yama's abode. Dreadful was\r\nthe battle that took place between car-warriors and car-warriors who\r\nstruck one another and caused a fierce flow of blood. Infuriated\r\nelephants, encountering infuriated compeers, afflicted one another with\r\ntheir tusks. Horsemen, solicitous of glory, pierced and cut down horsemen\r\nin that terrific melee with spears and darts and battle-axes.\r\nFoot-soldiers also O mighty-armed one, in hundreds, armed with weapons,\r\nrepeatedly rushed against one another with resolute courage, O scorcher\r\nof foes! So great was the confusion that the Panchalas and the Kurus\r\ncould only be distinguished from each other by the tribal, the family,\r\nand the personal names we heard them utter. The warriors, despatching one\r\nanother to the other world with arrows and darts and axes, careered\r\nfearlessly on the field. With thousands of arrows, however, O king, shot\r\nby the combatants the ten points were no longer illuminated as before in\r\nconsequence of the Sun having set. While the Pandavas were thus fighting,\r\nO Bharata, Duryodhana, O king, penetrated into the midst of their host.\r\nFilled with great wrath at the slaughter of the ruler of Sindhus, and\r\nresolved to lay down his life, he penetrated into the hostile army.\r\nFilling the earth with the rattle of his car-wheels and causing her to\r\ntremble therewith, thy son approached the Pandava host. Terrific was the\r\nclash that took place between him and them, O Bharata, causing a\r\ntremendous carnage of troops. Like the sun himself at midday scorching\r\neverything with his rays, thy son scorched the hostile host with his\r\narrowy showers.[189] The Pandavas became incapable of even looking at\r\ntheir brother (Duryodhana). Despairing of vanquishing their foes, they\r\nset their hearts on flying away from the field. Slaughtered by thy\r\nillustrious son, armed with the bow, by means of his gold-winged arrows\r\nof blazing points, the Panchalas ran away in all directions. Afflicted\r\nwith those keen shafts, the Pandava troops began to fall down on the\r\nground. Indeed, the Pandavas had never succeeded in achieving such a feat\r\nin battle as was then achieved by thy royal son, O monarch! The Pandava\r\nhost was crushed and ground by an elephant.[190] As, again, an assemblage\r\nof lotuses becomes shorn of its beauty when the water (over which it\r\ngrows) is dried up by the sun and the wind, even so became the Pandava\r\nhost being dried up by thy son, O Bharata, the Panchalas, with Bhimasena\r\nthen with ten shafts, and each of the sons of Madri with three, and\r\nVirata and Drupada each with six, and Sikhandin with a hundred, and\r\nDhrishtadyumna with seventy, and Yudhishthira with seven, and the\r\nKaikeyas and the Chedis with innumerable keen shafts, and Satwata with\r\nfive, and each of the (five) sons of Draupadi with three, and Ghatotkacha\r\nalso with a few, he uttered a leonine shout. Cutting off hundreds of\r\nother warriors and the bodies of elephants and steeds in that great\r\nbattle by means of his fierce shafts, he behaved like the Destroyer\r\nhimself in rage slaying created beings.[191] While engaged, however, in\r\nthus slaughtering his foes, his bow, the back of whose staff was\r\nornamented with gold, Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, O sire, cut off\r\ninto three parts with a pair of broad-headed shafts. And Yudhishthira\r\npierced Duryodhana himself with ten keen arrows shot with great force.\r\nPiercing through Duryodhana's vital limbs, those passed out and entered\r\nthe earth in a continuous line. The troops that stood around then\r\nencompassed Yudhishthira, like the celestials encompassing Purandara for\r\nthe slaughter of Vritra. Then king Yudhishthira, O sire, who is incapable\r\nof being easily defeated, shot at thy son in that battle a fierce shaft.\r\nDeeply pierced therewith, Duryodhana sat down on his excellent car. Then\r\na loud noise arose from among the Panchala troops. Even this, O monarch,\r\nwas that tremendous uproar, viz., 'The king is slain!' The fierce whizz\r\nof arrows also was heard there, O Bharata. Then Drona quickly showed\r\nhimself there in that battle. Meanwhile, Duryodhana recovering his\r\nsenses, had firmly grasped the bow. He then rushed towards the royal son\r\nof Pandu saying, 'Wait, Wait.' Then the Panchalas also solicitous of\r\nvictory, began to advance with speed. Desirous of rescuing the Kuru\r\nprince, Drona received them all. And the preceptor began to destroy them\r\nlike the bright-rayed maker of day destroying tempest-tossed clouds.\r\nThen, O king, there occurred a fierce battle, fraught with immense\r\ncarnage, between thine and theirs encountering one another from desire of\r\nfight.'\""

Who\r\nprotected the right wheel of the preceptor's car in that dreadful battle?\r\nWho also protected his left when he fiercely slaughtered the foe? Who\r\nwere those brave warriors that followed that fighting hero at his back?\r\nWho were those, then, that stood in front of that car-warrior? When that\r\nunvanquished and great bowman, that foremost of all bearers of weapons,\r\ndancing along the track of his car, entered the Pandavas host, I think,\r\nhis foes felt an excessive and unseasonable cold. I think, they trembled\r\nlike kine exposed to wintry blasts. How did that bull among car-warriors,\r\nwho consumed all the troops of the Panchalas like a raging conflagration,\r\nmeet with his death?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having slain the ruler of the Sindhus in the evening,\r\nPartha, after his meeting with Yudhishthira and the great bowman, viz.,\r\nSatyaki, both proceeded towards Drona. Then Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena,\r\nthe son of Pandu, each with a separate division of the army, quickly\r\nproceeded against Drona. Similarly, the intelligent Nakula, and the\r\ninvincible Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna with his own division, and\r\nVirata, and the ruler of the Salwas, with a large force, proceeded\r\nagainst Drona in battle. Similarly, king Drupada, the father of\r\nDhrishtadyumna, protected by the Panchalas proceeded, O king, against\r\nDrona. And the sons of Draupadi, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha,\r\naccompanied by their forces, proceeded against Drona of great splendour.\r\nThe Prabhadraka-Panchalas also six thousand strong, and all effectual\r\nsmiters, proceeded against Drona placing Sikhandin at their head. Other\r\nforemost of men and mighty car-warriors among the Pandavas, uniting\r\ntogether, O bull among men, proceeded against Drona. When those heroic\r\nwarriors, O bull among the Bharatas, proceeded to battle, the night\r\nbecame pitch dark, enhancing the terrors of the timid. And during that\r\nhour of darkness, O king, many were the warriors that laid down their\r\nlives. And that night also proved the death of many elephants and steeds\r\nand foot-soldiers. On that night of pitch darkness, yelling jackals\r\neverywhere inspired great fear with their blazing mouths. Fierce owls,\r\nperching on the standards of Kauravas and hooting therefrom, foreboded\r\nfears. Then, O king, a fierce uproar arose among the troops. Mingling\r\nwith the loud beat of drums and cymbals, grunts of elephants, neighings\r\nof steeds, and stampings of horse-hoofs, that uproar spread everywhere.\r\nThen, in that hour of evening, fierce was the battle that took place\r\nbetween Drona, O king, and all of the Srinjayas. The world having been\r\nenveloped in darkness, nothing could be noticed. The welkin was covered\r\nwith the dust raised by the combatants. Blood of man and horse and\r\nelephant mingled together. The earthy dust then disappeared. All of us\r\nbecame perfectly cheerless. During that night, like the sounds of a\r\nburning forest of bamboos on a mountain, frightful sounds were heard of\r\nclashing weapons. With the sounds of Mridangas and Anakas and Vallakis\r\nand Patahas,[192] with the shouts (of human beings) and the neigh (of\r\nsteeds), a dreadful confusion set in everywhere, O lord! When the field\r\nof battle was enveloped in darkness, friends, O king, could not be\r\ndistinguished from foes. All were possessed with a madness in that night.\r\nThe earthen dust that had arisen, O king, was soon allayed with showers\r\nof blood. Then, in consequence of golden coats of mail and the bright\r\nornaments of the warriors, that darkness was dispelled. The Bharata host\r\nthen, adorned with gems and gold (and abounding with darts and\r\nstandards), looked like the firmament in the night, O bull of Bharata's\r\nrace, bespangled with stars. The field of battle then resounded with the\r\nyells of jackals and the cawings of crows, with the grunts of elephants,\r\nand the shouts and cries of the warriors. Those sounds, mingling\r\ntogether, produced a loud uproar, making the hair stand on end. That\r\nuproar filled all the points of the compass like the report of Indra's\r\nthunder. At dead of night, the Bharata host seemed illuminated with the\r\nAngadas, the ear-rings, the cuirasses, and the weapons of combatants.\r\nThere elephants and cars, adorned with gold, looked in that night like\r\nclouds charged with lightning. Swords and darts and maces and scimitars\r\nand clubs and lances and axes, as they fell, looked like dazzling flashes\r\nof fire. Duryodhana was the gust of wind that was the precursor (of that\r\ntempest-like host). Cars and elephants constituted its dry clouds. The\r\nloud noise of drums and other instruments formed the peal of its\r\nthunders. Abounding with standards, bows formed to lightning flashes.\r\nDrona and the Pandavas formed its pouring clouds. Scimitars and darts and\r\nmaces constituted its thunders. Shafts formed its downpour, and weapons\r\n(of other kinds) its incessant gusts of wind. And the winds that blew\r\nwere both exceedingly hot and exceedingly cold. Terrible, stunning and\r\nfierce, it was destructive of life. There was nothing that could afford\r\nshelter from it.[193] Combatants, desirous of battle entered into that\r\nfrightful host on that dreadful night resounding with terrible noises,\r\nenhancing the fears of the timid and the delight of heroes. And during\r\nthe progress of that fierce and dreadful battle in the night, the Pandus\r\nand the Srinjayas, united together, rushed in wrath against Drona. All\r\nthese, however, O king, that advanced right against the illustrious\r\nDrona, were either obliged to turn back or despatched to the abode of\r\nYama. Indeed, on that night, Drona alone pierced with his shafts,\r\nelephants in thousands and cars in tens of thousands and millions of\r\nmillions of foot-soldiers and steeds.'\""

When that warrior of\r\nimmeasurable soul, having said those words unto my disobedient son,\r\nDuryodhana, so entered (the hostile ranks), what steps did Partha take?\r\nWhen after the fall of the heroic Jayadratha and of Bhurisravas, that\r\nunvanquished warrior of great energy, that scorcher of foes, viz., the\r\nunconquerable Drona, proceeded against the Panchalas, what did Arjuna\r\nthink? What also did Duryodhana think as the most seasonable step that he\r\ncould adopt? Who were they that followed that boon-giving hero, that\r\nforemost of regenerated ones? Who were those heroes, O Suta, that stood\r\nbehind that hero while engaged in 'battle? Who fought in his van, while\r\nhe was employed in slaughter? I think, all the Pandavas, afflicted with\r\nthe arrows of Bharadwaja's son, were, O Suta, like lean kine trembling\r\nunder a wintry sky. Having penetrated into the midst of the Panchalas how\r\ndid that great bowman, that scorcher of foes, that tiger among men, meet\r\nwith his death?[194] When on that night all the troops, united together,\r\nand all the great car-warriors combined were being separately ground (by\r\nDrona), who were those intelligent men amongst you that were present\r\nthere? Thou sayest that my troops were slain or huddled together, or\r\nvanquished, and that my car-warriors were made carless in those\r\nencounters. While those combatants became cheerless and were being ground\r\nby the Pandavas, what did they think when they sank in such affliction on\r\nthat dark night? Thou sayest that the Pandavas were hearty and\r\nexceedingly hopeful, and that mine were melancholy and heartless and\r\npanic-stricken. How, O Sanjaya, couldst thou mark the distinction on that\r\nnight between the Kurus and the unretreating Parthas?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'During the progress, O king, of that fierce night-battle,\r\nthe Pandavas along with the Somakas all rushed against Drona. Then Drona,\r\nwith his swift-going shafts, despatched all the Kaikeyas and the sons of\r\nDhrishtadyumna into the world of spirits. Indeed, all those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, O king, that advanced right against Drona, all those lords\r\nof the earth, were despatched (by him) into the region of the dead. Then\r\nking Sivi, of great prowess, filled with rage, proceeded against that\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., the heroic son of Bharadwaja, while the latter\r\nwas thus employed in grinding (the hostile combatants). Beholding that\r\ngreat car-warrior of the Pandavas advancing, Drona pierced him with ten\r\nshafts made entirely of iron. Sivi, however, pierced Drona in return with\r\nthirty shafts, winged with Kanka feathers. And smiling the while, he\r\nalso, with a broad-headed shaft felled the driver of Drona's car. Drona\r\nthen, slaying the steeds of the illustrious Sivi as also the driver of\r\nhis car, cut off from his trunk Sivi's head with head-gear on it. Then\r\nDuryodhana quickly sent unto Drona a driver for his car. The reins of his\r\nsteeds having been taken up by the new man, Drona once more rushed\r\nagainst his foes. The sort of the ruler of the Kalingas, supported by the\r\nKalinga troops, rushed against Bhimasena, filled with rage at the\r\nslaughter of his sire by the latter, Having pierced Bhima with five\r\nshafts he once more pierced him with seven. And he struck Visoka (the\r\ndriver of Bhima's car) with three shafts and the latter's standard with\r\none. The Vrikodara, filled with rage, leaping from his own car to that of\r\nhis foe, slew with only his fists that angry hero of the Kalingas. The\r\nbones of that prince thus slain in battle by the mighty son of Pandu with\r\nonly his fists, fell down on the earth separated from one another, Karna\r\nand the brother of the slain prince, (and others), could not brook that\r\nact of Bhima. All of them began to strike Bhimasena with keen shafts\r\nresembling snakes of virulent poison. Abandoning then that car of the foe\r\n(upon which he stood), Bhima proceeded to the car of Dhruva,[195] and\r\ncrushed, by a blow of his fist, that prince who had been striking him\r\nincessantly. Thus struck by the mighty son of Pandu. Dhruva fell down.\r\nHaving slain him, O king, Bhimasena of great strength, proceeding to the\r\ncar of Jayarata, began to roar repeatedly like a lion. Dragging Jayarata\r\nthen with his left arm, while, employed in roaring, he slew that warrior\r\nwith a slap of his palm in the very sight of Karna. Then Karna hurled at\r\nthe son of Pandu, a dart decked with gold. The Pandava, however, smiling\r\nthe while, seized with his hand that dart. And the invincible Vrikodara\r\nin that battle hurled that very dart back at Karna. Then Sakuni, with a\r\nshaft that had drunk oil, cut off that dart as it coursed towards Karna.\r\nHaving achieved these mighty feats in battle, Bhima, of wonderful\r\nprowess, came back to his own car and rushed against thy troops. And\r\nwhile Bhima was thus advancing, slaughtering (thy troops) like the\r\nDestroyer himself in rage, thy sons, O monarch, attempted to resist that\r\nmighty-armed hero. Indeed, those mighty car-warriors covered him with a\r\ndense shower of arrows. Then Bhima, smiling the while, despatched in that\r\nbattle, with his shafts, the driver and the steeds of Durmada unto the\r\nabode of Yama. Durmada, at this, quickly mounted upon the car of\r\nDushkarna. Then those scorchers of foes, viz., the two brothers, riding\r\noh the same car, both rushed against Bhima in the front rank of battle,\r\nlike the Regent of the waters and Surya rushing against Taraka, that\r\nforemost of Daityas. Then thy sons, Durmada and Dushkarna, mounting on\r\nthe same car, pierced Bhima with shafts. Then in the very sight of Karna,\r\nof Aswatthaman, of Duryodhana, of Kripa, of Somadatta, and of Valhika,\r\nthe son of Pandu, that chastiser of foes, by a stamp of his foot, caused\r\nthat car of the heroic Durmada and Dushkarna to sink into the earth.\r\nFilled with rage, Bhima struck with his fists those mighty and brave sons\r\nof thine, viz., Durmada and Dushkarna, and crushed them therewith and\r\nroared aloud. Then cries of Oh and Alas arose among the troops. And the\r\nkings, beholding Bhima said, 'That is Rudra who is fighting in Bhima's\r\nform among the Dhartarashtras.' Saying these words, O Bharata, all the\r\nkings fled away, deprived of their senses and urging the animals they\r\nrode to their greatest speed. Indeed, no two of them could be seen\r\nrunning together. Then, when on that night a great carnage had been\r\ncaused among the (Kaurava) army, the mighty Vrikodara, with eyes\r\nbeautiful as the full-blown lotus, highly applauded by many bulls among\r\nkings, repairing unto Yudhishthira, paid his regards unto him. Then the\r\ntwins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and Drupada and Virata, and the Kaikeyas,\r\nand Yudhishthira also, felt great joy. And all of them paid their\r\nadorations unto Vrikodara even as the celestials did unto Mahadeva after\r\nAndhaka had been slain. Then thy sons, all equal unto the sons of Varuna,\r\nfilled with rage and accompanied by the illustrious Preceptor and a large\r\nnumber of cars, foot-soldiers, and elephants encompassed Vrikodara on all\r\nsides from desire of fight. Then, O best of kings, on that terrible\r\nnight, when everything was enveloped in darkness, as thick as a cloud, a\r\ndreadful battle took place between those illustrious warriors, delightful\r\nto wolves and crows and vultures.'\""

Two\r\npersons, indeed, among the Vrishnis are reputed to be the foremost of\r\ngreat car-warriors, viz., Pradyumna of mighty energy and thou also, O\r\nSatyaki!

Then\r\nSatyaki, of eyes like lotus-petals and teeth like those of a lion,\r\npossessed of great strength, and filled with rage, said these words unto\r\nSomadatta, 'O thou of Kuru's race, whether battling with thee or with\r\nothers, I do not in my heart ever experience the slightest fear. If,\r\nprotected by all the troops, thou fightest with me, I would not, even\r\nthen experience on thy account, any pain, O thou of Kuru's race! I am\r\never observant of Kshatriya practices.

If, O king, thou wishest to fight with me today, be\r\ncruel and strike me with keen shafts and I will also strike thee. Thy\r\nson, the mighty car-warrior Bhurisravas, O king, had been slain. Sala\r\nalso, and Vrishasena, have been crushed by me. Thee also today I shall\r\nslay, with thy soils and kinsmen.

Then with a thousand\r\ncars and ten thousand horses, Duryodhana took his station, encompassing\r\nSomadatta, Sakuni also, filled with rage, and armed with every weapon and\r\nsurrounded by his sons and grandsons as also by his brothers, that were\r\nequal to Indra himself in prowess (did the same). Thy brother-in-law, O\r\nking, young in years and of body hard as the thunder-bolt and possessed\r\nof wisdom, had a hundred thousand horses of the foremost valour with him.\r\nWith these he encompassed the mighty bowman Somadatta. Protected by those\r\nmighty warriors, Somadatta covered Satyaki (with clouds of shafts).\r\nBeholding Satyaki thus covered with clouds of straight shafts,\r\nDhrishtadyumna proceeded towards him in rage and accompanied by a mighty\r\nforce. Then, O king, the sound that arose there of those two large hosts\r\nstriking each other, resembled that of many oceans lashed into fury by\r\nfrightful hurricanes. Then Somadatta pierced Satyaki, with nine arrows.\r\nSatyaki, in return, struck that foremost of Kuru warriors with nine\r\narrows. Deeply pierced in that battle by the mighty and firm bowman\r\n(Satyaki), Somadatta sat down on the terrace of his car and lost his\r\nsenses in a swoon, Beholding him deprived of his senses, his driver, with\r\ngreat speed, bore away from the battle that great car-warrior, viz., the\r\nheroic Somadatta. Seeing that Somadatta, afflicted with Yuyudhana's\r\nshafts, had lost his senses Drona rushed with speed, desiring to slay the\r\nYadu hero. Beholding the Preceptor advance, many Pandava warriors headed\r\nby Yudhishthira surrounded that illustrious perpetuator of Yadu's race\r\nfrom desire of rescuing him. Then commenced a battle between Drona and\r\nthe Pandavas, resembling that between Vali and the celestials for\r\nacquiring sovereignty oft the three worlds. Then Bharadwaja's son of\r\ngreat energy shrouded the Pandava host with clouds of arrows and pierced\r\nYudhishthira also. And Drona pierced Satyaki with ten arrows, and the son\r\nof Prishata with twenty. And he pierced Bhimasena with nine arrows and\r\nNakula with five, and Sahadeva with eight, and Sikhandin with a hundred.\r\nAnd the mighty-armed hero pierced each of the (five) sons of Draupadi\r\nwith five arrows. And he pierced Virata with eight arrows and Drupada\r\nwith ten. And he pierced Yudhamanyu with three arrows and Uttamaujas with\r\nsix in that encounter. And piercing many other combatants, he rushed\r\ntowards Yudhishthira. The troops of Pandu's son, slaughtered by Drona,\r\nran away in all directions, from fear, O king, with loud wails. Beholding\r\nthat host slaughtered by Drona. Phalguna, the son of Pritha, with wrath\r\nexcited a little, quickly proceeded towards the preceptor. Beholding then\r\nthat Drona was also proceeding towards Arjuna in that battle, that host\r\nof Yudhishthira, O king, once more rallied. Then once more occurred a\r\nbattle between Drona and the Pandavas. Drona, surrounded, O king, on all\r\nsides, by thy sons, began to consume the Pandava host, like fire\r\nconsuming a heap of cotton. Beholding him radiant like the sun and endued\r\nwith the splendour of a blazing fire, and fiercely and continually, O\r\nking, emitting his ray-like arrows, with bow incessantly drawn to a\r\ncircle and scorching everything around like the sun himself, and\r\nconsuming his foes, there was none in that army that could check him. The\r\nshafts of Drona cutting off the head of all those that ventured to\r\napproach him in the face, penetrated into the earth. Thus slaughtered by\r\nthat illustrious warrior, the Pandava host, once more fled away in fear\r\nin the very sight of Arjuna. Beholding that force, O Bharata, thus routed\r\non that night by Drona, Jishnu asked Govinda to proceed towards Drona's\r\ncar. Then he of Dasarha's race urged those steeds, white as silver or\r\nmilk or the Kunda flower, or the moon, towards the car of Drona.\r\nBhimasena also, beholding Phalguna proceed towards Drona, commanded his\r\nown charioteer, saying, 'Bear me towards Drona's division.' Hearing those\r\nwords of Bhima, his driver Visoka urged his steeds, following in the\r\nwake, O chief of the Bharatas, of Jishnu, of sure aim. Beholding the two\r\nbrothers resolutely proceeding towards Drona's division, the mighty\r\ncar-warriors among the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, the Matsyas, the Chedis,\r\nthe Karushas, the Kosalas, and the Kaikeyas, O king, all followed them.\r\nThen, O monarch, took place a terrible battle that made the hair stand on\r\nend. With two mighty throngs of cars, Vibhatsu and Vrikodara attacked thy\r\nhost; the former on the right and the latter in the front. Seeing those\r\ntigers among men, viz., Bhimasena and Dhananjaya (thus engaged),\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O monarch, and Satyaki of great strength, rushed behind.\r\nThen, O king, an uproar arose there in consequence of the two hosts\r\nstriking each other, that resembled the noise made by many seas lashed\r\ninto fury by a tempest. Beholding Satyaki in battle, Aswatthaman, filled\r\nwith rage at the slaughter of Somadatta's son, rushed furiously against\r\nthat Satwata hero at the van of battle. Seeing him rush in that battle\r\nagainst the car of Sini's grandson, Bhimasena's son, the gigantic\r\nRakshasa, Ghatotkacha, endued with great strength, rushed at him, riding\r\non a huge and terrible car made of black iron covered with bear-skins.\r\nBoth the height and the width of that large car measured thirty\r\nnalwas.[197] Equipped with machines set in proper places it was; its\r\nrattle resembled that of a mighty mass of clouds. No steeds or elephants\r\nwere yoked unto it, but, instead, beings that looked like elephants.[198]\r\nOn its tall standard perched a prince of vultures with outstretched wings\r\nand feet, with eyes wide-expanded, and shrieking awfully. And it was\r\nequipped with red flags and decked with the entrails of various animals.\r\nAnd that huge vehicle was furnished with eight wheels. Riding on it,\r\nGhatotkacha was surrounded by a full Akshauhini of fierce-looking\r\nRakshasas armed with lances and heavy clubs and rocks and trees. Seeing\r\nhim advance with uplifted bow, resembling the mace-armed Destroyer\r\nhimself in the hour of universal dissolution, the hostile kings were\r\nstruck with fear. At sight of that prince of Rakshasas, viz.,\r\nGhatotkacha, looking like a mountain summit of terrible aspect,\r\nfrightful, possessed of terrible teeth and fierce face, with arrow-like\r\nears and high cheek-bones, with stiff hair rising upwards, awful eyes,\r\nsunken belly, blazing mouth, wide as a chasm, and diadem on his head,\r\ncapable of striking every creature with fear, possessing jaws wide-open\r\nlike those of the Destroyer, endued with great splendour and capable of\r\nagitating all foes, advancing towards them, thy son's host, afflicted\r\nwith fear, became highly agitated like the current of the Ganga agitated\r\ninto fierce eddies by (the action of) the wind. Terrified by the leonine\r\nroar uttered by Ghatotkacha, elephants began to eject urine and the kings\r\nbegan to tremble. Then, thrown by the Rakshasas who had become more\r\npowerful in consequence of the night, there began to fall on the field of\r\nbattle a thick shower of stones. And a ceaseless shower of iron wheels\r\nand Bhundis and darts and lances and spears and Sataghnis and axes also\r\nfell there. Beholding that fierce and awful battle, the kings, thy sons,\r\nand Karna, also exceedingly pained, fled away. Only the proud son of\r\nDrona, ever boastful of his might in arms, stood fearlessly. And he soon\r\ndispelled that illusion that had been created by Ghatotkacha. Upon the\r\ndestruction of his illusion, Ghatotkacha in rage sped fierce shafts\r\n(Aswatthaman). These pierced the son of Drona, like angry snakes speedily\r\npiercing through an ant-hill. Those arrows, having pierced through the\r\nbody of Aswatthaman, dyed with blood and quickly entered the earth like\r\nsnakes into an ant-hill. The light-handed Aswatthaman, however, of great\r\nprowess, filled with wrath, pierced Ghatotkacha with ten arrows.\r\nGhatotkacha, deeply pierced in his vital parts by Drona's son, and\r\nfeeling great pain, took up a wheel having a thousand spokes. Its edge\r\nwas sharp as a razor, and it was resplendent as the rising sun. And it\r\nwas decked with diverse gems and diamonds. Desirous of slaying him, the\r\nson of Bhimasena hurled that wheel at Aswatthaman. And as that wheel\r\ncoursed swiftly towards Drona's son, the latter cut it into fragments by\r\nmeans of his shafts. Baffled, it fell down on the earth, like the hope\r\ncherished by an unfortunate man. Beholding his wheel baffled, Ghatotkacha\r\nquickly covered the son of Drona with his shafts, like Rahu swallowing\r\nthe sun. Meanwhile, Ghatotkacha's son endued with great splendour and\r\nlooking like a mass of antimony, checked the advancing son of Drona like\r\nthe king of mountain (Meru) checking the (course of the) wind. Afflicted\r\nwith showers of shafts by Bhimasena's grandson, viz., the brave\r\nAnjanaparvan, Aswatthaman looked like the mountain Meru bearing a torrent\r\nof rain from a mighty cloud. Then Aswatthaman, equal unto Rudra or\r\nUpendra in prowess, became filled with rage. With one shaft he cut off\r\nthe standard of Anjanaparvan. With two others, his two drivers, and with\r\nthree others, his Trivenuka. And he cut off the Rakshasa's bow with one\r\narrow, and his four steeds with four other arrows, Made carless,\r\nAnjanaparvan took up a scimitar. With another keen shaft, Aswatthaman cut\r\noff in two fragments that scimitar, decked with golden stars, in the\r\nRakshasa's hand. The grandson of Hidimva then, O king, whirling a gold\r\nadorned mace, quickly hurled it at Aswatthaman. Drona's son, however,\r\nstriking it with his shafts, caused it to fall down on the earth. Soaring\r\nup then into the sky, Anjanaparvan began to roar like a cloud. And from\r\nthe welkin he showered trees upon his foe. Like the sun piercing a mass\r\nof clouds with his rays, Aswatthaman then began to pierce with his shafts\r\nthe son of Ghatotkacha, that receptacle of illusions, in the welkin.\r\nGifted with great energy, the Rakshasa once more came down on his gold\r\ndecked car. He then looked like a high and beautiful hill of antimony on\r\nthe surface of the earth. The son of Drona then slew that son of Bhima's\r\nson, viz., Anjanaparvan, cased in an iron coat of mail, even as Mahadeva\r\nhad slain in days of yore the Asura Andhaka. Beholding his mighty son\r\nslain by Aswatthaman, Ghatotkacha, coming unto the son of Drona,\r\nfearlessly addressed the heroic son of Saradwata's daughter, who was then\r\nconsuming the Pandava troops like a raging forest-conflagration, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Ghatotkacha said, 'Wait, Wait, O son of Drona! Thou shalt not escape me\r\nwith life! I shall slay thee today like Agni's son slaying Krauncha.'\r\n\r\n\"Aswatthaman said, 'Go, O son, and fight with others, O thou that hast\r\nthe prowess of a celestial. It is not proper, O son of Hidimva, that sire\r\nshould battle with son.[199] I do not cherish any grudge against thee, O\r\nson of Hidimva! When, however, one's ire is excited, one may kill one's\r\nown self.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Having heard these words, Ghatotkacha, filled with\r\ngrief on account of the fall of his son, and with eyes red as copper in\r\nwrath, approached Aswatthaman and said, 'Am I a dastard in battle, O son\r\nof Drona, like a vulgar person, that thou dost frighten me thus with\r\nwords? Thy words are improper. Verily, I have been begotten by Bhima in\r\nthe celebrated race of the Kurus. I am a son of the Pandavas, those\r\nheroes that never retreat from battle. I am the king of the Rakshasas,\r\nequal to the Ten-necked (Ravana) in might. Wait, wait, O son of Drona!\r\nThou shalt not escape me with life. I shall today, on the field of\r\nbattle, dispel thy desire for fight.' Having thus replied unto\r\nAswatthaman, that mighty Rakshasa with eyes red as copper in rage, rushed\r\nfuriously against the son of Drona, like a lion against a prince of\r\nelephants. And Ghatotkacha began to shower upon that bull among\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Drona's son, shafts of the measure of Aksha of battle\r\ncar, like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Drona's son however, with his\r\nown shafts, checked that arrowy shower before it could reach him. At that\r\ntime, it seemed that another encounter was taking place in the welkin\r\nbetween shafts (as the combatants). The welkin, then, during the night,\r\nshone resplendent with the sparks caused by the clash of those weapons,\r\nas if with (myriads of) flies. Observing that his illusion was dispelled\r\nby Drona's son, proud of his prowess in battle, Ghatotkacha, once more\r\nmaking himself invisible, created an illusion. He assumed the form of a\r\nhigh mountain, crowded with cliffs and trees, and possessing fountains\r\nfrom which ceaselessly flowed spears and lances and swords and heavy\r\nclubs. Beholding that mountain-like mass of antimony, with countless\r\nweapons falling from it, Drona's son was not at all moved. The latter\r\ninvoked into existence the Vajra weapon.[200] The prince of mountains,\r\nthen, struck with that weapon, was quickly destroyed. Then the Rakshasa,\r\nbecoming a mass of blue clouds in the firmament, decked with rainbow,\r\nbegan furiously to shower upon Drona's son in that battle a downpour of\r\nstones and rocks. Then that foremost of all persons acquainted with\r\nweapons, viz., Aswatthaman, aiming the Vayavya weapon, destroyed that\r\nblue cloud which had risen on the firmament. Drona's son, that foremost\r\nof men, covering then all the points of the compass with his shafts, slew\r\na hundred thousand car-warriors. He then beheld Ghatotkacha fearlessly\r\ncoming towards him with bent bow and accompanied by a large number of\r\nRakshasas that resembled lions or infuriated elephants of great strength,\r\nsome riding on elephants, some on cars, and some on steeds. The son of\r\nHidimva was accompanied by those fierce followers of his, with frightful\r\nfaces and heads and necks. Those Rakshasas consisted of both Paulastyas\r\nand Yatudhanas.[201] Their prowess was equal to that of Indra himself.\r\nThey were armed with diverse kinds of weapons and were cased in diverse\r\nkinds of armour. Of terrible visage, they swelled with rage. Ghatotkacha\r\ncame to battle, accompanied by those Rakshasas, who were, indeed,\r\nincapable of being easily defeated in battle. Beholding them, thy son,\r\nDuryodhana, became exceedingly cheerless. Unto him the son of Drona said,\r\n'Wait, O Duryodhana! Thou needst have no fear. Stand aside with these thy\r\nheroic brothers and these lords of earth, endued with the prowess of\r\nIndra. I will slay thy foes. Defeat thou shalt not have. I tell thee\r\ntruly. Meanwhile, assure thy troops.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'I do not regard what thou sayest to be at all\r\nwonderful, since thy heart is large. O son of Gautama's daughter, thy\r\nregard for us is great.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, Having said those words unto Aswatthaman, he then\r\naddressed the son of Suvala, saying, 'Dhananjaya is engaged in battle\r\nsurrounded by a hundred thousand car-warriors of great valour. Go thou\r\nagainst him, with sixty thousand cars. Karna also, and Vrishasena and\r\nKripa, and Nila, and the Northerners, and Kritavarman, and the sons of\r\nPurumitra, and Duhsasana, and Nikumbha, and Kundabhedin, and Puranjaya\r\nand Dridharatha, and Hemakampana, and Salya, and Aruni, and Indrasena,\r\nand Sanjaya, and Vijaya, and Jaya, and Purakrathin, and Jayavarman, and\r\nSudarsana, these will follow thee, with sixty thousand foot-soldiers. O\r\nuncle, slay Bhima and the twins and king Yudhishthira the Just, like the\r\nchief of the celestials slaying the Asuras. My hope of victory is in\r\nthee. Already pierced by Drona's son with shafts, all their limbs have\r\nbeen exceedingly mangled. Slay the sons of Kunti, O uncle, like Kartikeya\r\nslaying the Asuras.' Thus addressed by thy son, Sakuni proceeded quickly\r\nto destroy the Pandavas, filling thy son's heart, O king, with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, O king, the battle that took place between the Rakshasas and\r\nthe son of Drona on that night was exceedingly terrible like that between\r\nSakra and Prahlada (in days of old). Ghatotkacha, filled with rage,\r\nstruck Drona's son in the chest with ten powerful shafts fierce as poison\r\nor fire. Deeply pierced with those shafts by the son of Bhimasena,\r\nAswatthaman trembled on the terrace of his car like a tall tree shaken by\r\nthe tempest. Once more Ghatotkacha, with a broad-headed shaft, quickly\r\ncut off the bright bow that was in the hands of Drona's son. The latter,\r\nthen, taking up another bow capable of bearing of great strain, showered\r\nkeen arrows (upon his foe) like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Then\r\nthe son of Saradwat's daughter, O Bharata, sped many sky-ranging and\r\nfoe-slaying arrows, winged with gold, towards the sky-ranging Rakshasa.\r\nAfflicted with those shafts of Aswatthaman, that vast force of\r\nbroad-chested Rakshasas looked like a herd of infuriated elephants\r\nafflicted by lions. Consuming with his arrows those Rakshasas with their\r\nsteeds, drivers, and elephants, he blazed forth like the adorable Agni\r\nwhile consuming creatures at the end of the Yuga. Having burnt with his\r\nshafts a full Akshauhini of Rakshasa troops, Aswatthaman shone\r\nresplendent like the divine Maheswara in heaven after the burning of the\r\ntriple city.[202] That foremost of victors, viz., Drona's son, having\r\nburnt thy foes, shone brilliantly like the blazing Yuga-fire after having\r\nburnt all creatures at the end of the Yuga. Then Ghatotkacha, filled with\r\nrage, urged that vast Rakshasa force on, saying, 'Slay the son of Drona!'\r\nThat command of Ghatotkacha was obeyed by those terrible Rakshasa of\r\nbright teeth, large faces, frightful aspects, gaping mouths, long tongues\r\nand eyes blazing with wrath. Causing the earth to be filled with their\r\nloud leonine roars, and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, they rushed\r\nagainst the son of Drona for slaying him. Endued with fierce prowess,\r\nthose Rakshasas, with eyes red in wrath, fearlessly hurled at\r\nAswatthaman's head hundreds and thousands of darts, and Sataghnis, and\r\nspiked maces, and Asanis and long lances, and axes, and scimitars, and\r\nmaces, and short arrows and heavy clubs, and battle-axes, and spears, and\r\nswords, and lances, and polished Kampanas and Kunapas, and Hulas, and\r\nrockets, and stones, and vessels of (hot) treacle, and thunas made of\r\nblack iron, and mallets, all of terrible forms and capable of destroying\r\nfoes. Beholding that thick shower of weapons falling upon the head of\r\nDrona's son, thy warriors were much pained. The son of Drona, however,\r\nfearlessly destroyed with his whetted shafts endued with the force of the\r\nthunder that frightful shower of weapons looking like a risen cloud. Then\r\nthe high-souled son of Drona, with other weapons, equipped with golden\r\nwings and inspired with mantras speedily slew many Rakshasas. Afflicted\r\nwith those shafts, that vast force of broad-chested Rakshasas looked like\r\na herd of infuriated elephants afflicted by lions. Then those mighty\r\nRakshasas, thus afflicted Drona's son, became filled with fury and rushed\r\nagainst the former. The prowess that the son of Drona then showed was\r\nexceedingly wonderful, for the feat he achieved is incapable of being\r\nachieved by any other being among living creatures, since, alone and\r\nunsupported, that warrior acquainted with high and mighty weapons burnt\r\nthat Rakshasa force with his blazing shafts in the very sight of that\r\nprince of Rakshasas. Whilst consuming that Rakshasa force, Drona's son in\r\nthat battle shone resplendent like the Samvartaka fire, while burning all\r\ncreatures at the end of the Yuga. Indeed, amongst those thousands of\r\nkings and those Pandavas, O Bharata, there was none, except that mighty\r\nprince of the Rakshasa, viz., the heroic Ghatotkacha, capable of even\r\nlooking at the son of Drona in that battle, who was thus employed in\r\nconsuming their ranks with his shafts, resembling snakes of virulent\r\npoison. The Rakshasa, O chief of the Bharatas, with eyes rolling in\r\nwrath, striking his palms, and biting his (nether) lip, addressed his own\r\ndriver, saying, 'Bear me towards the son of Drona.' Riding on that\r\nformidable car equipped with triumphal banners, that slayer of foes once\r\nmore proceeded against Drona's son, desirous of a single combat with the\r\nlatter. Endued with terrible prowess, the Rakshasa, uttering a loud\r\nleonine roar, hurled in that encounter at Drona's son, having whirled it\r\n(previously), a terrible Asani of celestial workmanship, and equipped\r\nwith eight bells.[203] Drona's son, however, jumping down from his car,\r\nhaving left his bow thereon, seized it and hurled it back at Ghatotkacha\r\nhimself. Ghatotkacha, meanwhile, had quickly alighted from his car. That\r\nformidable Asani, of dazzling effulgence, having reduced to ashes the\r\nRakshasa's vehicle with steeds and drivers and standard, entered the\r\nearth, having pierced her through. Beholding that feat of Drona's son,\r\nviz., his having jumped down and seized that terrible Asani of celestial\r\nworkmanship, all creatures applauded it. Proceeding then, O king, to\r\nDhrishtadyumna's car, Bhimasena's son, taking up a terrible bow that\r\nresembled the large bow of Indra himself, once more shot many keen shafts\r\nat the illustrious son of Drona. Dhrishtadyumna also fearlessly shot at\r\nAswatthaman's chest many foremost of shafts, equipped with wings of gold\r\nand resembling snakes of virulent poison. Then Drona's son shot arrows\r\nand long shafts by thousands. These two heroes, however, viz.,\r\nGhatotkacha and Dhrishtadyumna, struck and baffled Aswatthaman's shafts\r\nby means of their own shafts whose touch resembled that of fire. The\r\nbattle then that took place between those two lions among men\r\n(Ghatotkacha on the one side) and the son of Drona (on the other) became\r\nfierce in the extreme and gladdened all the combatants, O bull of\r\nBharata's race! Then, accompanied by a thousand cars, three hundred\r\nelephants, and six thousand horses, Bhimasena arrived at that spot. The\r\nvirtuous son of Drona, however, endued as he was with prowess that knew\r\nno fatigue, continued to fight with the heroic son of Bhima and with\r\nDhrishtadyumna supported by his followers.[204] The prowess then that\r\nDrona's son displayed on that occasion was exceedingly wonderful, in as\r\nmuch as, O Bharata, none else amongst all creatures is capable of\r\naccomplishing such feats. Within the twinkling of an eye, he destroyed,\r\nby means of his sharp shafts, a full Akshauhini of Rakshasa troops with\r\nsteeds, drivers, cars, and elephants, in the very sight of Bhimasena and\r\nHidimva's son and Prishata's son and the twins and Dharma's son and\r\nVijaya and Achyuta.[205] Deeply struck with the straight-going shafts (of\r\nAswatthaman), elephants fell down on elephants on the earth like\r\ncrestless mountains. Strewn all around with the lopped off trunks of\r\nelephants, that moved still in convulsions, the earth looked as if\r\noverspread with moving snakes. And the earth looked resplendent with\r\ngolden staves and royal umbrellas, like the firmament at the end of the\r\nYuga, bespangled with planets and stars and many moons and suns. And\r\nDrona's son caused a bloody river of impetuous current to flow there. The\r\nblood of elephants and steeds and combatants formed its water; tall\r\nstandards its frogs; drums formed its large tortoises; umbrellas, its\r\nrows of swans, yak-tails in profusion, Kankas and vultures, its\r\ncrocodiles; weapons its fishes; large elephants the stones and rocks on\r\nits banks; elephants and steeds, its sharks; cars, its unstable and broad\r\nbanks; and banners, its beautiful rows of trees. Having shafts for its\r\n(smaller) fishes, that frightful river had lances and darts and swords\r\nfor snakes; marrow and flesh for its mire, and trunkless bodies floating\r\non it for its rafts. And it was choked with the hair (of men and animals)\r\nfor its moss. And it inspired the timid with cheerlessness and fear. And\r\nbloody waves were seen on its surface. Rendered frightful by means of the\r\nfoot-soldiers with which it teemed, Yama's abode, was the ocean towards\r\nwhich it flowed. Having slain the Rakshasas, Drona's son then began to\r\nafflict the son of Hidimva with arrows. Filled once more with rage, the\r\npuissant son of Drona having pierced those mighty car-warriors, viz., the\r\nParthas including Vrikodara and the sons of Prishata, slew Suratha, one\r\nof the sons of Drupada. Then he slew in that battle Suratha's younger\r\nbrother named Satrunjaya. And then he slew Valanika and Jayanika, and\r\nJaya. And once more, with a keen shaft, Drona's son' uttering a leonine\r\nroar, slew Prishdhra, and then proud Chandrasena. And then he slew with\r\nten arrows the ten sons of Kuntibhoja. Then, O king, Drona's son\r\ndespatched Srutayus to the abode of Yama. With three other keen shafts,\r\nequipped with beautiful wings and red eyes, he despatched the mighty\r\nSatrunjaya to the region of Sakra.[206] Then Aswatthaman, filled with\r\nrage, fixed on his bowstring a fierce and straight arrow. Drawing the\r\nstring to his ear, he quickly shot that fierce and excellent arrow\r\nresembling the rod of Death himself, aiming at Ghatotkacha. That mighty\r\nshaft, equipped with beautiful wings, passing through the chest of that\r\nRakshasa, O lord of the earth, entered the earth, piercing through it,\r\nGhatotkacha thereupon fell down on the car. Beholding him fallen down and\r\nbelieving him to be dead, the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna took him\r\naway from the presence of Drona's son and caused him to be placed upon\r\nanother car. Thus, O king, that car-force of Yudhishthira turned away\r\nfrom the fight. The heroic son of Drona having vanquished his foes,\r\nuttered a loud roar. And he was worshipped by all men and all thy sons, O\r\nsire.'[207] The earth, strewn all around with the fallen bodies of dead\r\nRakshasas, pierced and mangled with hundreds of arrows, became fierce\r\nlooking and impassable, as if strewn with mountain summits. The Siddhas\r\nand Gandharvas and Pisachas, and Nagas, and birds, and Pitris and ravens\r\nand large numbers of cannibals and ghosts, and Apsaras and celestials,\r\nall combined in highly applauding the son of Drona.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the sons of Drupada, as also those of\r\nKuntibhoja, and Rakshasas too in thousands, slain by the son of Drona,\r\nYudhishthira and Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, and\r\nYuyudhana, uniting together, set their hearts firmly on battle. Then\r\nSomadatta, once more filled with rage upon beholding Satyaki in that\r\nbattle, covered the latter, O Bharata, with a dense shower of arrows.\r\nThen took place a battle, fierce and exceedingly wonderful to behold,\r\nbetween thy warriors and those of the foe, both parties being solicitous\r\nof victory. Fighting on behalf of Satyaki, Bhima pierced the Katirava.\r\nhero with ten shafts. Somadatta, however, in return, pierced that hero\r\nwith a hundred arrows. Then Satwata, filled with rage, pierced with ten\r\nkeen shafts, endued with the force of the thunder, that old warrior\r\nafflicted with grief on account of the death of his son, and who was,\r\nbesides, endued with every estimable virtue like Yayati, the son of\r\nNahusha. Having pierced him with great force, he struck him once more\r\nwith seven arrows. Then, fighting for the sake of Satyaki, Bhimasena\r\nhurled at the head of Somadatta a new, hard and terrible Parigha. Satyaki\r\nalso filled with rage, shot at Somadatta's chest, in that battle, an\r\nexcellent shaft, keen and equipped with goodly wings and resembling fire\r\nitself in splendour. The Parigha and the shaft, both terrible, fell\r\nsimultaneously upon the body of the heroic Somadatta. That mighty\r\ncar-warrior, thereupon, fell down. Beholding his son (Somadatta) thus\r\nfallen into a swoon, Valhika rushed at Satyaki scattering showers of\r\narrows like a cloud in season. Then Bhima, for Satyaki's sake, afflicted\r\nthe illustrious Valhika with nine shafts and pierced him therewith at the\r\nvan of battle. Then the mighty-armed son of Pratipa, Valhika, filled with\r\ngreat fury, hurled a dart at the chest of Bhima, like Purandara himself\r\nhurling the thunder. Struck therewith, Bhima trembled (on his car) and\r\nswooned away. The mighty warrior then, recovering his senses, hurled a\r\nmace at his opponent. Hurled by the son of Pandu, that mace snatched away\r\nthe head of Valhika, who, thereupon, fell down lifeless on the earth,\r\nlike a tree struck down by lightning. Upon the slaughter of that bull\r\namong men, viz., the heroic Valhika, ten of thy sons, each of whom was\r\nequal unto Rama, the son of Dasaratha, in prowess, began to afflict\r\nBhima. They were Nagadatta, and Dridharatha, and Viravahu, and Ayobhuja,\r\nand Dridha, and Suhasta, and Viragas and Pramatha, and Ugrayayin.\r\nBeholding them Bhimasena became filled with rage. He then took up a\r\nnumber of arrows, each capable of bearing a great strain. Aiming at each\r\nof them one after another, he sped those arrows at them, striking each in\r\nhis vital part. Pierced therewith, they fell down from their cars,\r\ndeprived of energy and life, like tall trees from mountain cliffs broken\r\nby a tempest. Having with those ten shafts slain those ten sons of thine,\r\nBhima shrouded the favourite son of Karna with showers of arrows. Then\r\nthe celebrated Vrikaratha, brother of Karna, pierced Bhima with many\r\narrows. The mighty Pandava, however, soon disposed of him effectually.\r\nSlaying next, O Bharata, seven car-warriors among thy brother-in-law,\r\nwith his shafts, the heroic Bhima pressed Satachandra down into the\r\nearth. Unable to bear the slaughter of the mighty car-warrior\r\nSatachandra, Sakuni's brothers, viz., the heroic Gavaksha and Sarabha and\r\nBibhu, and Subhaga, and Bhanudatta, those five mighty car-warriors,\r\nrushing towards Bhimasena, attacked him with their keen shafts. Thus\r\nattacked with those shafts, like a mountain with torrents of rain.'[208]\r\nBhima slew those five mighty kings with five shafts of his. Beholding\r\nthose heroes slain many great kings began to waver.\r\n\r\n\"Then Yudhishthira, filled with wrath, began to destroy thy ranks, in the\r\nsight, O sinless one, of the Pot-born (Drona) and of thy sons. Indeed,\r\nwith his shafts, Yudhishthira began to despatch to the regions of Yama\r\nthe Amvashthas, the Malavas, the brave Trigartas and the Sivis. And\r\ncutting off the Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Valhikas, and the Vasatis,\r\nhe caused the earth to be miry with flesh and blood. And he also\r\ndespatched within a trice, by means of many shafts, to Yama's domains,\r\nthe Yaudheyas, the Malavas, and large numbers, O king, of the Madrakas.\r\nThen a loud uproar arose in the vicinity of Yudhishthira's car, amid\r\nwhich was heard, 'Slay', Seize', 'Capture', Pierce', Cut into pieces'!\r\nBeholding him thus slaying and routing thy troops, Drona, urged on by thy\r\nson, shrouded Yudhishthira with showers of shafts. Drona filled with\r\ngreat wrath, struck Yudhishthira with the Vayavya weapon. The son of\r\nPandu, however, baffled that celestial weapon with a similar weapon of\r\nhis own. Seeing his weapon baffled, the son of Bharadwaja, filled with\r\ngreat wrath and desirous of slaying the son of Pandu, sped at\r\nYudhishthira diverse celestial weapons such as the Varuna, the Yamya, the\r\nAgneya, the Tvashtra, and the Savitra. The mighty-armed Pandava, however,\r\nconversant with morality, fearlessly baffled all those weapons of the\r\nPot-born that were hurled or in course of being hurled at him. Then the\r\nPot-born, striving to accomplish his vow and desirous also for thy son's\r\ngood, to slay the son of Dharma, invoked into existence, O Bharata, the\r\nAindra and the Prajapatya weapons. Then that foremost one of Kuru's race,\r\nYudhishthira, of the gait of the elephant or the lion, of broad chest and\r\nlarge and red eyes, and endued with energy scarcely inferior (to that of\r\nDrona) invoked into existence the Mahendra weapon. With that he baffled\r\nthe weapon of Drona. Seeing all his weapons baffled, Drona, filled with\r\nwrath and desirous of accomplishing the destruction of Yudhishthira,\r\ninvoked into existence the Brahma weapon. Enveloped as we then were by a\r\nthick gloom, we could not observe what passed. All creatures also, O\r\nmonarch, were filled with great fright. Beholding the Brahma weapon\r\nuplifted, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, O king, baffled it with a Brahma\r\nweapon of his own. Then, all the foremost warriors applauded those two\r\nbulls among men, viz., Drona and Yudhishthira, those great bowmen\r\nacquainted with every mode of warfare. Abandoning Yudhishthira, Drona\r\nthen, with eyes red as copper in rage, began to consume the division of\r\nDrupada with the Vayavya weapon. Oppressed by Drona, the Panchalas fled\r\naway from fear, in the very sight of Bhimasena and of the illustrious\r\nPartha. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna) and Bhimasena, checking that\r\nflight of their troops, suddenly encountered that hostile force with two\r\nlarge throngs of cars. Vibhatsu, attacking the right and Vrikodara the\r\nleft, Bharadwaja's son was encountered, with two mighty showers of\r\nshafts. Then the Kaikeyas, the Srinjayas, and the Panchalas of great\r\nenergy followed the two brothers, O king, accompanied by the Matsyas and\r\nthe Satwatas. Then the Bharata host, slaughtered by the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna) and overcome with sleep and darkness, began to break. Drona, and\r\nthy son himself, endeavoured to rally them. The combatants, however, O\r\nking, were incapable of being then checked in their flight.'\""

O Karna, save in battle all my warriors. Our\r\ncombatants are now encompassed on all sides by the Panchalas, the\r\nKaikeyas, the Matsyas, and the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, all\r\nfilled, with rage and resembling hissing snakes. Yonder the Pandavas,\r\nsolicitous of victory, are roaring in joy. The vast car-force of the\r\nPanchalas is possessed of the prowess of Sakra himself.'\r\n\r\n\"Karna replied, 'If Purandara himself were to come hither for saving\r\nPartha, quickly vanquishing even him, I would slay that son or Pandu. I\r\ntell thee truly. Be cheered, O Bharata! I will slay the son of Pandu and\r\nall the assembled Panchalas, I will give thee victory, like Pavaka's son\r\ngiving victory unto Vasava. I shall do what is agreeable to thee in this\r\nbattle that has begun. Amongst all the Parthas, Phalguna is the\r\nstrongest. At him I will hurl the fatal dart of Sakra's workmanship. Upon\r\nthe death of that great bowman, his brothers, O giver of honour, will\r\neither surrender themselves unto thee or once more retire into the\r\nforest. When I am alive, O Kauravya, never indulge in any grief. I will\r\nvanquish in battle all the Pandavas united together and all the\r\nPanchalas, the Kaikeyas, and the Vrishnis assembled together. Making\r\nporcupines of them by means of my arrowy showers, I will give thee the\r\nearth.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'While Karna was uttering those words, Kripa, the\r\nmighty armed son of Saradwat, smiling the while, addressed the Suta's son\r\nin these words, 'Thy speech is fair, O Karna! If words alone could lead\r\nto success, then with thee, O son of Radha, as his protector, this bull\r\namong the Kurus would be considered to have the amplest measure of\r\nprotection. Thou boastest much, O Karna, in the presence of the Kuru\r\nchief, but thy prowess is seldom witnessed, nor, indeed, any result (of\r\nthy boastful speeches). Many a time have we seen thee encounter the sons\r\nof Pandu in battle. On every one of those occasions, O Suta's son, thou\r\nhast been vanquished by the Pandavas. While Dhritarashtra's son was being\r\ntaken away (as a captive) by the Gandharvas, all the troops fought on\r\nthat occasion except thy single self, who was the first to fly away. In\r\nVirata's city also, all the Kauravas, united together, including thyself\r\nand thy younger brother were vanquished by Partha in battle. Thou art not\r\na match for even one of the sons of Pandu, viz., Phalguna, on the field\r\nof battle. How then canst thou venture to vanquish all the sons of Pandu\r\nwith Krishna at their head? Thou indulgest in too much brag, O Suta's\r\nson! Engage thyself in battle without saying anything. To Put forth\r\nprowess without indulging in brag is the duty of good men. Ever roaring\r\naloud, O Suta's son like the dry clouds of autumn, thou showest thyself,\r\nO Karna to be without substance. The king, however, does not understand\r\nit. Thou roarest, O son of Radha, as long as thou seest not the son of\r\nPritha. These thy roars disappear when thou seest Partha near. Indeed,\r\nthou roarest as long as thou art out of the range of Phalguna's shafts.\r\nThose roars of thine disappear when thou art pierced with Partha's\r\nshafts. Kshatriyas evince their eminence by means of their arms;\r\nBrahmanas, by means of speech; Arjuna evinces his by means of the bow;\r\nbut Karna, by the castles he builds in the air. Who is there that will\r\nresist that Partha who gratified Rudra himself (in battle)?' Thus railed\r\nat by Saradwat's son, Karna, that foremost of smiters, answered Kripa in\r\nthe following strain, 'Heroes always roar like clouds in the season of\r\nrains, and like steeds put in the soil, quickly yield fruits. I do not\r\nsee any fault in heroes that take great burdens on their shoulders,\r\nindulging in boastful speeches on the field of battle. When a person\r\nmentally resolves to bear a burden, Destiny itself aids him in the\r\nexecution. Wishing in my heart bear a great burden, I always summon\r\nsufficient resolution. If, slaying the sons of Pandu with Krishna and\r\nSatwatas in battle, I indulge in such roars, what is it to thee, O\r\nBrahmana? They that are heroes never roar fruitlessly like autumnal\r\nclouds. Conscious of their own might, the wise indulge in roars! In my\r\nheart I am determined to vanquish in battle today Krishna and Partha\r\nunited together and fighting with resolution! It is for this that I roar,\r\nO son of Gotama! Behold the fruit of these my roars, O Brahmana! Slaying\r\nthe son of Pandu in battle, with all their followers, Krishna and\r\nSatwatas, I will bestow on Duryodhana the whole earth without a thorn in\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"Kripa said, 'Little do I reckon, O Suta's son, these delirious saying of\r\nthine discovering thy thoughts, not deeds. Thou always speakest in\r\ndepreciation of the two Krishnas and king Yudhishthira the just. He, O\r\nKarna, is certain, to have the victory who hath on his side those two\r\nheroes skilled in battle. Indeed, Krishna and Arjuna are incapable of\r\nbeing defeated by the celestials, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, human\r\nbeings, the Nagas, and the birds, all clad in mail. Yudhishthira, the son\r\nof Dharma is devoted to the Brahmanas. He is truthful in speech and\r\nself-restrained. He reverences the Pitris and the deities. He is devoted\r\nto the practice of truth and righteousness. He is, again, skilled in\r\nweapons. Possessed of great intelligence, he is also grateful. His\r\nbrothers are all endued with great might and well-practised in all\r\nweapons. They are devoted to the service of their seniors. Possessed of\r\nwisdom and fame, they are also righteous in their practices. Their\r\nkinsmen and relatives are all endued with the prowess of Indra. Effectual\r\nsmiters, they are all exceedingly devoted to the Pandavas.\r\nDhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin and Janamejaya, the son of Durmuksha and\r\nChandrasen, and Madrasen, and Kritavarman, Dhruva, and Dhara and\r\nVasuchandra, and Sutejana, the sons of Drupada, and Drupada himself,\r\nconversant with high and mighty weapons, and the king of the Matsyas\r\nalso, with his younger brothers, all resolutely struggling for their\r\nsake, and Gajanika, and Virabhadra, and Sudarsana, and Srutadhwaja, and\r\nValanika, and Jayanika, and Jayaprya, and Vijaya and Labhalaksha, and\r\nJayaswa, and Kamaratha, and the handsome brothers of Virata, and the\r\ntwins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and the\r\nRakshasa Ghatotkacha, are all fighting for the Pandavas. The sons of\r\nPandu, therefore, will not meet with destruction. These and many other\r\nhosts (of heroes) are for the sons of Pandu. Without doubt, the entire\r\nuniverse, with the celestials, Asuras, and human beings, with all the\r\ntribes of Yaksha and Rakshas and with all the elephants and snakes and\r\nother creatures, can be annihilated by Bhima and Phalguna by the prowess\r\nof their weapons. As regards Yudhishthira also, he can, with angry eyes\r\nonly, consume the whole world. How, O Karna, canst thou venture to\r\nvanquish those foes in battle for whom Sauri of immeasurable might hath\r\nclad himself in mail? This, O Suta's son, is a great folly on thy part,\r\nsince thou always venturest to contend with Sauri himself in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed (by Kripa), Karna the son of Radha, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, smiling the while, said these words unto the\r\npreceptor Kripa, the son of Saradwat, 'The words thou hast spoken about\r\nthe Pandavas, O Brahmana, are all true. These and many other virtues are\r\nto be seen in the sons of Pandu. It is true also that the Parthas are\r\nincapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava at their head,\r\nand the Daityas, the Yakshas, and the Rakshasas. For all that I will\r\nvanquish the Parthas with the help of the dart given me by Vasava. Thou\r\nknowest, O Brahmana, that the dart given by Sakra is incapable of being\r\nbaffled. With that I will slay Savyasachin in battle. Upon Arjuna's fall,\r\nKrishna and the uterine brothers of Arjuna will never be able to enjoy\r\nthe (sovereignty of the) earth without Arjuna (to aid them). All of them,\r\ntherefore, will perish. This earth then, with her seas, will remain\r\nsubject to the chief of the Kurus, O Gautama, without costing him any\r\nefforts. In this world everything, without doubt, becomes attainable by\r\npolicy. Knowing this, I indulge in these roars, O Gautama! As regards\r\nthyself, thou art old, a Brahmana by birth, and unskilled in battle. Thou\r\nbearest much love for the Pandavas. It is for this thou insultest me\r\nthus. If, O Brahmana, thou tellest me again such words as these, I shall,\r\nthen, drawing out my scimitar, cut off thy tongue, O wretch! Thou\r\ndesirest, O Brahmana, to applaud the Pandavas, for frightening all the\r\ntroops and the Kauravas, O thou of wretched understanding! As regards\r\nthis also, O Gautama, listen to what I say. Duryodhana, and Drona, and\r\nSakuni, and Durmukha, and Jaya, and Duhsasana, and Vrishasena, and the\r\nruler of the Madras, and thyself too and Somadatta and Drona's son, and\r\nVivinsati,--all these heroes skilled in battle,--are here, clad in mail.\r\nWhat foe is there, endued with even the prowess of Sakra, that would\r\nvanquish these in battle? All those I have named a-e heroes, skilled in\r\nweapons, endued with great might, solicitous of admission into heaven,\r\nconversant with morality, and skilled in battle. They would stay the very\r\ngods in fight. These will take their places on the field for slaying the\r\nPandavas, clad in mail on behalf of Duryodhana desirous of victory. I\r\nregard victory to be dependent on destiny, even in the case of the\r\nforemost of mighty men. When the mighty-armed Bhishma himself lieth\r\npierced with a hundred arrows, as also Vikarna, and Jayadratha, and\r\nBhurisravas, and Jaya, and Jalasandha, and Sudakshina, and Sala; that\r\nforemost of car-warriors, and Bhagadatta of great energy, I say, when\r\nthese and many others, incapable of being easily vanquished by the very\r\ngods, heroes all and mightier (than the Pandavas), lie on the field of\r\nbattle, slain by the Pandavas, what dost thou think, O wretch among men,\r\nbut that all this is the result of destiny? As regards them also, viz.,\r\nthe foes of Duryodhana, whom thou adorest, O Brahmana, brave warriors of\r\ntheirs, in hundreds and thousands, have been slain. The armies of both\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas are diminishing in numbers; I do not, in this,\r\nbehold the prowess of the Pandavas! With them, O lowest of men, whom thou\r\nalways regardest to be so mighty, I shall strive, to the utmost extent of\r\nmy might, to contend in battle, for Duryodhana's good. As regards\r\nvictory, that depends on destiny.'\""

Of wicked understanding as thou art,\r\nthou rebukest, however, my brave uncle from malice. Possessed with pride\r\nand insolence, thou braggest today of thy prowess, not regarding any of\r\nthe world's bowmen in battle![209] Where was thy prowess and where were\r\nthy weapons when vanquishing thee in battle the wielder of Gandiva slew\r\nJayadratha in thy very sight? Vainly, O wretch of a Suta, dost thou\r\nindulge in thy mind the hope of vanquishing him who formerly contended in\r\nbattle with Mahadeva himself. The very gods with the Asuras united\r\ntogether and with Indra at their head had failed to vanquish Arjuna, that\r\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, having Krishna only for his ally.\r\nHow then, O Suta, hopest thou, aided by these kings, to vanquish that\r\nforemost of heroes in the world, viz., the unvanquished Arjuna, in\r\nbattle? Behold, O Karna of wicked soul, (what I do to thee) today! O\r\nlowest of men, O thou of wretched understanding, I shall presently sever\r\nthy head from thy trunk.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus saying, Aswatthaman made a furious rush at\r\nKarna. The king himself, of great energy, and Kripa, that foremost of\r\nmen, held him fast. Then Karna said, 'Of wicked understanding, this\r\nwretch of a Brahmana thinks himself brave and boasts of his prowess in\r\nbattle. Set him at liberty, O chief of the Kurus. Let him come in contact\r\nwith my might.'\r\n\r\n\"Aswatthaman said, 'O son of a Suta, O thou of wicked understanding, this\r\n(thy fault) is pardoned by us.

Thou shouldst not, O sinless one, be angry\r\nwith the Suta's son. Upon thee and Karna and Kripa and Drona and the\r\nruler of the Madras and Suvala's son resteth a great burthen. Drive away\r\nthy wrath, O best of Brahmanas! Yonder, all the Pandava troops are\r\napproaching from desire of fight with Radha's son. Indeed, O Brahmana,\r\nyonder they come, challenging us all.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus pacified by the king, the high-souled son of\r\nDrona, O monarch, whose ire had been excited, suppressed his wrath and\r\nforgave (Karna). Then the preceptor Kripa, of noble heart, who is of a\r\nquite disposition, O monarch, and mild temper, therefore, returned soon\r\nunto him, said these words.'\r\n\r\n\"Kripa, said, 'O Suta's son of wicked heart, this (thy fault) is pardoned\r\nby us. Phalguna, however, will quell this thy risen pride.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then the Pandavas, O king, and the Panchalas,\r\ncelebrated for their prowess, uniting together approached in thousands,\r\nuttering loud shouts; Karna also, that foremost of car-warriors, endued\r\nwith great energy, surrounded by many foremost ones among the Kuru\r\nwarriors and resembling Sakra in the midst of the celestials, waited,\r\ndrawing his bow and relying on the might of his own arms. Then commenced\r\na battle between Karna and the Pandavas. O king, that was exceedingly\r\ndreadful and characterised by loud leonine roars. Then Pandavas, O\r\nmonarch, and the Panchalas, celebrated for their prowess, beholding the\r\nmighty-armed Karna, loudly shouted, saying, 'There is Karna,' 'Where is\r\nKarna in this fierce battle.'--'O thou of wicked understanding, O lowest\r\nof men, fight with us!'--Others, beholding the son of Radha said, with\r\neyes expanded In wrath, 'Let this arrogant wretch of little\r\nunderstanding, this son of a Suta, be slain by the allied kings. He hath\r\nno need to live. This sinful man is always very hostile to the Parthas.\r\nObedient to the counsels of Duryodhana, this one is the root of these\r\nevils. Slay him.' Uttering such words, great Kshatriya car-warriors,\r\nurged by Pandu's son, rushed towards him, covering him with a dense\r\nshower of arrows, for slaying him. Beholding all those mighty Pandavas\r\nthus (advancing), the Suta's son, trembled not, nor experienced any fear.\r\nIndeed, seeing that wonderful sea of troops, resembling Death himself,\r\nthat benefactor of thy sons, viz., the mighty and fight-handed Karna,\r\nnever vanquished in battle, O bull of Bharata's race, began, with clouds\r\nof shafts, to resist that force on all sides. The Pandavas also fought\r\nwith the foe, shooting showers of shafts. Shaking their hundreds and\r\nthousands of bows they fought with Radha's son, like the Daityas of old\r\nfighting with Sakra. The mighty Karna, however, with a dense arrowy\r\nshower of his own dispelled that downpour of arrows caused by those lords\r\nof earth on all sides. The battle that took place between them, and in\r\nwhich each party counteracted the feats of the other,' resembled the\r\nencounter between Sakra and the Danavas in the great battle fought of\r\nyore between the gods and the Asuras. The lightness of arm that we then\r\nbehold of the Suta's son was wonderful in the extreme, inasmuch as, all\r\nhis foes, fighting resolutely, could not strike him in that battle.\r\nChecking the clouds of arrows shot by the (hostile) king, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Radha's son, sped terrible arrows marked with his own\r\nname at the yokes, the shafts, the umbrellas, the cars, and the steeds\r\n(of his foes). Then those kings, afflicted by Karna and losing their\r\ncoolness, began to wander on the field like a herd of kine afflicted with\r\ncold. Struck by Karna, large numbers of steeds and elephants and\r\ncar-warriors were seen there to drop down deprived of life. The whole\r\nfield, O king, became strewn with the fallen heads and arms of\r\nunreturning heroes. With the dead, the dying, and the wailing warriors,\r\nthe field of battle, O monarch, assumed the aspect of Yama's domain. Then\r\nDuryodhana, O king, witnessing the prowess of Karna, repaired to\r\nAswatthaman and addressing him, said, 'Behold, Karna, clad in mail, is\r\nengaged with all the (hostile) kings. Behold, the hostile army, afflicted\r\nwith the arrows of Karna, is being routed like the Asura army overwhelmed\r\nwith the energy of Kartikeya. Seeing his army vanquished in battle by\r\nthat intelligent Karna, yonder cometh Vibhatsu from desire of slaying the\r\nSuta's son. Let such steps, therefore, be taken as may prevent the son of\r\nPandu from slaying that mighty car-warrior viz., Suta's son, in the very\r\nsight of us all.' (Thus addressed), Drona's son, and Kripa, and Salya,\r\nand that great car-warrior, viz., the son of Hridika, beholding the son\r\nof Kunti coming (towards them) like Sakra himself towards the Daitya\r\nhost, all advanced against Partha for rescuing the Suta's son. Meanwhile,\r\nVibhatsu, O monarch, surrounded by the Panchala I advanced against Karna,\r\nlike Purandara proceeding against the Asura Vritra.'[210]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding Phalguna excited with fury and looking\r\nlike the Destroyer himself, as he appears at the end of the Yuga what, O\r\nSuta, did Vikartana's son Karna do next? Indeed, the mighty car-warrior\r\nKarna, the son of Vikartana, had always challenged Partha. Indeed, he had\r\nalways said that he was competent to vanquish the terrible Vibhatsu. What\r\nthen, O Suta, did that warrior do when he thus suddenly met his ever\r\ndeadly foe?'[211]\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like\r\nan elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against\r\nDhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing\r\nwith great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with\r\nwings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of\r\nPandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna,\r\nfilled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty\r\ncar-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook\r\nit. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts,\r\nwhetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great\r\nmight and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow\r\non the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped\r\nfrom that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then\r\nthe mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once\r\nmore covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness\r\nof hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his\r\nown shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each\r\nother, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's\r\nfeats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle\r\nthat took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became\r\nexceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the\r\nsake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha,\r\nbeholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle.\r\nAnd he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode\r\nwith a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut\r\noff from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and\r\nPritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with\r\nfour shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts,\r\nspecially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of\r\nKripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of\r\nBharata's race, fled away in all directions. Seeing them fly away, king\r\nDuryodhana himself checked them and said these words, 'Ye heroes, do not\r\nfly away. Ye bulls among Kshatriyas, stay in battle. I myself will now\r\nadvance for slaying Partha in battle. I myself will slay Partha with the\r\nassembled Panchalas. While I shall fight with the wielder of Gandiva\r\ntoday, Partha will behold my prowess to resemble that of the Destroyer\r\nhimself at the end of the Yuga. Today the Parthas shall behold my shafts\r\nshot in thousands to resemble flights of locusts. The combatants shall\r\nbehold me today shooting, bow in hand, dense showers of shafts, like\r\ntorrents of rain poured by the clouds at the end of the summer season. I\r\nshall today vanquish Partha with my straight shafts. Stay, ye heroes, in\r\nbattle, and remove your fear or Phalguna. Encountering my prowess,\r\nPhalguna shall never be able to bear it, like the ocean, the abode of\r\nmakaras, unable to overcome the continents.' Thus saying, the king\r\nproceeded in rage, his eyes red in wrath, surrounded by a large host,\r\ntowards Phalguna. Beholding the mighty-armed Duryodhana thus proceeding,\r\nSaradwat's son, approaching Aswatthaman, said these words, 'Yonder, the\r\nmighty-armed Duryodhana, deprived of his senses by wrath, desireth to\r\nfight with Phalguna, like an insect desiring to rush into a blazing fire.\r\nBefore this foremost of kings layeth down his life, in our very sight, in\r\nthis battle with Partha, prevent him (from rushing into the encounter).\r\nThe brave Kuru king can remain alive in battle as long only as he doth\r\nnot place himself within the range of Partha's shafts. Let the king be\r\nstopped before he is consumed into ashes by the terrible shafts of\r\nPartha, that resemble snakes just freed from their sloughs. When we are\r\nhere, O giver of honours, it seems to be highly improper that the king\r\nshould himself go to battle to fight, as if he had none to fight for him.\r\nThe life of this descendant of Kuru will be in great danger if he engages\r\nin battle with the diademdecked (Arjuna), like that of an elephant\r\ncontending with a tiger.' Thus addressed by his maternal uncle, Drona's\r\nson, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, quickly repaired unto\r\nDuryodhana and addressing him, said these words, 'When I am alive, O son\r\nof Gandhari, it behoveth thee not to engage thyself in battle,\r\ndisregarding me, O descendant of Kuru, that am ever desirous of thy good.\r\nThou needst not be at all anxious about vanquishing Partha. I will check\r\nPartha! Stand here, O Suyodhana.'\r\n\r\n\"Duryodhana said, 'The preceptor (Drona) always protecteth the sons of\r\nPandu, as if they are his own sons. Thou also always never interferest\r\nwith those my foes. Or, it may be due to my misfortune, that thy prowess\r\nnever becometh fierce in battle. This may be due also to thy affection\r\nfor Yudhishthira or Draupadi. I myself am ignorant of the true reason.\r\nFie on my covetous self, for whose sake all friends, desirous of making\r\nme happy, are themselves vanquished and plunged into grief. Except thee,\r\nO son of Gotama's daughter, what foremost of all wielders of weapons of\r\nthere, what warrior, indeed, equal to Mahadeva himself in battle, that\r\nwould not, though competent, destroy the foe? O Aswatthaman; be pleased\r\nwith me and destroy my enemies. Neither the gods nor the Danavas are\r\ncapable of staying within the range of thy weapons, O son of Drona, slay\r\nthe Panchalas and the Somakas with all their followers. As regards the\r\nrest, we will slay them, Protected by thee. Yonder, O Brahmana, the\r\nSomakas and the Panchalas, possessed of great fame, are careering amid my\r\ntroops like a forest-conflagration. O mighty-armed one, check them as\r\nalso the Kailkeyas, O best of men, else, protected by the diadem-decked\r\n(Arjuna), they will annihilate us all. O Aswatthaman, O chastiser of\r\nfoes, go thither with speed. Whether thou accomplishest it now or\r\nafterwards, that feat, O sire, should be accomplished by thee. Thou hast\r\nbeen born, O mighty-armed one, for the destruction of the Panchalas.\r\nPutting forth thy prowess, thou shalt make the world destitute of\r\nPanchalas. Even thus the reverend ones crowned with (ascetic) success,\r\nhave said. It will be as they have said. Therefore, O tiger among men,\r\nslay the Panchalas with all their followers. The very gods with Vasava at\r\ntheir head are incapable of staying within the range of thy weapons, what\r\nneed be said then of the Parthas and the Panchalas? These words of mine\r\nare true. I tell thee truly, O hero, that the Pandavas united with the\r\nSomakas are no match for thee in battle! Go, O mighty-armed one! Let\r\nthere be no delay. Behold, our army, afflicted with Partha's shafts, is\r\nbreaking and flying away. Thou art competent, O mighty-armed one, aided\r\nby thy own celestial energy, to afflict, O giver of honours, the Pandavas\r\nand the Panchalas.'\""

The mighty-armed Aswatthaman\r\nanswered thy son, saying, 'It is even so as thou sayest, O descendant of\r\nKuru! The Pandavas are always dear to both myself and my father. So also,\r\nare we both dear unto them. Not so, however, in battle. We will,\r\naccording to the measure of our might, fearlessly contend in battle,\r\nreckless of our lives. Myself, Karna, Salya, Kripa, and Hridika's son,\r\ncould, O best of kings, destroy the Pandava host within the twinkling of\r\nan eye. The Pandavas also, O best of the Kurus, could within the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, destroy the Kaurava host, if, O mighty-armed one, we\r\nwere not present in battle. We are fighting with the Pandavas to the best\r\nof our might, and they also are fighting with us to the best of their\r\nmight. Energy, encountering energy, is being neutralised, O Bharata! The\r\nPandava army is incapable of being vanquished as long as the sons of\r\nPandu are alive. This that I tell thee is true. The sons of Pandu are\r\nendued with great might. They are, again, fighting for their own sake.\r\nWhy should not they, O Bharata, be able to slay thy troops. Thou,\r\nhowever, O king, art exceedingly covetous. Thou, O Kaurava, art\r\ndeceitful. Thou art vainglorious and suspicious of everything. For this,\r\nthou suspectest even us. I think, O king, thou art wicked, of sinful\r\nsoul, and an embodiment of sin. Mean and of sinful thoughts, thou\r\ndoubtest us and others. As regards myself, fighting with resolution for\r\nthy sake, I am prepared to lay down my life. I will presently go to\r\nbattle for thy sake, O chief of the Kurus. I will fight with the foe and\r\nslay a large number of the enemy. I will fight with the Panchalas, the\r\nSomakas, the Kaikeyas, and the Pandayas also, in battle, for doing what\r\nis agreeable to thee, O chastiser of foes. Scorched with my arrows today,\r\nthe Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Somakas, will fly away on all sides\r\nlike a herd of kine afflicted by a lion. Today, the royal son of Dharma\r\nwith all the Somakas, beholding my prowess, will regard the whole world\r\nto be filled with Aswatthamans. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, will become\r\nexceedingly cheerless, beholding the Panchalas and Somakas slain (by me)\r\nin battle. I will, O Bharata, slay all those that will approach me in\r\nbattle. Afflicted with the might of my arms, none of them, O hero, will\r\nescape me today with life.' Having said so unto thy son, Duryodhana, the\r\nmighty-armed (Aswatthaman) proceeded to battle, and afflicted all bowmen.\r\nThat foremost of all living beings thus sought to achieve what was\r\nagreeable to thy sons. The son of Gotama's daughter, then addressing the\r\nPanchalas and the Kaikeyas, said unto them, 'Ye mighty car-warriors,\r\nstrike ye all at my body. Displaying your lightness in the use of arms,\r\nfight ye with me coolly.' Thus addressed by him, all those combatants, O\r\nking, poured showers of weapons upon Drona's son like clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain. Baffling that shower, Drona's son in that battle, slew\r\nten brave warriors amongst them, in the very sight, O lord, of\r\nDhrishtadyumna and the sons of Pandu. The Panchalas and the Somakas then,\r\nthus worked in battle, abandoned the son of Drona and fled away in all\r\ndirections. Beholding those brave warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the\r\nSomakas, flying away, Dhrishtadyumna, O king, rushed against Drona's son\r\nin that battle. Surrounded then by a hundred brave and unreturning\r\ncar-warriors mounted upon cars, decked with gold, and the rattle of whose\r\nwheels resembled the roar or rain-charged clouds, the mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the son of the Panchala king, beholding his warriors\r\nslain, addressed Drona's son and said these words, 'O foolish son of the\r\npreceptor, what is the use of slaying vulgar combatants. If thou art a\r\nhero, fight then with me in battle. I will slay thee. Wait for a moment\r\nwithout flying away.' Saying thus, Dhrishtadyumna of great prowess struck\r\nthe preceptor's son with many keen and terrible arrows capable of\r\npiercing the very vitals. Those swiftly-coursing shafts, equipped with\r\ngolden wings and keen points, and capable of piercing the body of every\r\nfoe proceeding in a continuous line, penetrated into Aswatthaman's body,\r\nlike freely-roaming bees in search of honey entering a flowering tree.\r\nDeeply pierced and swelling with rage, like a trodden snake, the proud\r\nand fearless son of Drona, arrow in hand, addressed his foe, saying, 'O\r\nDhrishtadyumna, wait for moment, without leaving my presence.' Soon shall\r\nI despatch thee to Yama's abode with my keen shafts.' Having said these\r\nwords, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Drona, displaying\r\ngreat lightness of hands, covered the son of Prishata from every side\r\nwith clouds of arrows. Thus covered in that encounter (with arrows) by\r\nDrona's son, the Panchala prince, difficult to defeat in battle, said\r\n'Thou knowest not of my origin, O Brahmana, or of my vow. O thou of\r\nwicked understanding, having first slain Drona himself, I will not,\r\ntherefore, slay thee today when Drona himself is still alive. O thou of\r\nwicked understanding, after this night passeth away and bringeth in the\r\nfair dawn, I shall first slay thy sire in battle and then despatch thee\r\nalso to the region of Spirits. Even this is the wish entertained by me.\r\nStanding before me, display, therefore, till then, the hatred thou\r\nbearest towards the Parthas, and the devotion thou cherishest for the\r\nKurus. Thou shalt not escape from me with life. That, Brahmana who,\r\nabandoning the practices of a Brahmana, devoteth himself to the practices\r\nof a Kshatriya, becomes slayable by all Kshatriyas even as thou, O lowest\r\nof men.' Thus addressed by Prishata's son in language so harsh and\r\ninsulting that best of Brahmanas Aswatthaman mustered all his rage and\r\nanswered, saying, 'Wait, Wait!' And he gazed at Prishata's son apparently\r\nburning him with his eyes. Sighing (in rage) like a snake, the\r\npreceptor's son, then, covered Dhrishtadyumna in that battle (with a\r\nshower of arrows). The mighty-armed son of Prishata, however, that best\r\nof car-warriors, surrounded by all the Panchala troops, though thus\r\nstruck with arrows in that encounter by Drona's son, did not tremble,\r\nrelying as he did on his own energy. In return, he sped many arrows at\r\nAswatthaman. Both engaged in a gambling match in which the stake was life\r\nitself, those heroes, unable to brook each other, resisted each other and\r\nchecked each other's arrowy showers. And those great bowmen shot dense\r\nshowers of shafts all around. Beholding that fierce battle, inspiring\r\nterror, between Drona's and Prishata's son, the Siddhas and Charanas and\r\nother sky-ranging beings applauded them highly. Filling the welkin and\r\nall the points of the compass with clouds of shafts, and creating a thick\r\ngloom therewith, those two warriors continued to fight with each other,\r\nunseen (by any of us). As if dancing in that battle, with their bows\r\ndrawn to circles, resolutely aspiring to slay each other, those\r\nmighty-armed warriors, inspiring fear in every heart, fought wonderfully\r\nand with remarkable activity and skill. Applauded by thousands of\r\nforemost warriors in that battle, and thus resolutely engaged in fight\r\nlike two wild elephants in the forest, both the armies, beholding them,\r\nbecame filled with delight. And leonine shouts were heard there, and all\r\nthe combatants blew their conchs. And hundreds and thousands of musical\r\ninstruments began to be sounded. That fierce fight, enhancing the terror\r\nof the timid, seemed only for a short time to be waged equally. Then\r\nDrona's son, O king, making a rush, cut off the bow, and standard, and\r\numbrella, and the two Parshni drivers, and the principal driver, and the\r\nfour steeds, of the high-souled son of Prishata. And that warrior of\r\nimmeasurable soul then caused the Panchalas in hundreds and thousands, by\r\nmeans of his straight shafts, to fly away. Beholding those feats of\r\nDrona's son, resembling those of Vasava himself in battle, the Pandava\r\nhost, O bull of Bharata race, began to tremble in fear. Slaying a hundred\r\nPanchalas with a hundred arrows, and three foremost of men with three\r\nkeen arrows, in the very sight of Drupada's son and of Phalguna, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Drona, slew a very large number of\r\nPanchalas that stayed before him. The Panchalas then, as also the\r\nSrinjayas, thus disconcerted in battle, fled away leaving Drona's son,\r\nwith their banners torn. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of\r\nDrona, having vanquished his foes in battle, uttered a loud roar like\r\nthat of a mass of clouds at the end of summer. Having slain a large\r\nnumber of foes, Aswatthaman looked resplendent like the blazing fire at\r\nthe end of the Yuga, after having consumed all creatures. Applauded by\r\nall the Kauravas after having defeated thousands of foes in battle, the\r\nvaliant son of Drona beamed forth in beauty, like the chief of the\r\ncelestials himself after vanquishing his foes'.\""

Seeing this, king\r\nDuryodhana, aided by Bharadwaja's son, rushed against the Pandavas in\r\nthat encounter. Then commenced a battle that was fierce and terrific,\r\nenhancing the fears of the timid. Yudhishthira, in wrath began to\r\ndespatch vast numbers of Amvashthas, Malavas, Vangas, Sivis, and\r\nTrigartas, to the domain of the dead. Bhima also, mangling the\r\nAbhishahas, the Surasenas, and other Kshatriyas difficult to defeat in\r\nbattle, made the earth miry with blood. The diademdecked (Arjuna) of\r\nwhite steeds despatched, O king, the Yaudheyas, the Mountaineers, the\r\nMadrakas, and the Malavas also, to the regions of the dead. Forcibly\r\nstruck with swiftly-coursing shafts, elephants began to fall down on the\r\nearth like double-crested hills. Strewn with the lopped-off trunks\r\nelephants that still moved in convulsions, the earth seemed as if covered\r\nwith moving snakes. Covered with the fallen umbrellas of kings that were\r\nadorned with gold, the field of battle looked resplendent like the\r\nfirmament at the end of the Yuga bespangled with suns, moons and stars.\r\nAbout this time a fierce uproar arose near Drona's car, in the midst of\r\nwhich could be heard the words, 'Slay', 'Strike fearlessly', 'Pierce',\r\n'cut in pieces'. Drona, however, filled with rage, began to destroy by\r\nmeans of the Vayavya weapon the foes about him, like a mighty tempest\r\ndestroying gathering masses of clouds. Thus treated by Drona, the\r\nPanchalas fled away, from fear, in the very sight to Bhimasena and the\r\nhigh-souled Partha. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna) and Bhimasena soon\r\nchecked the flight of their troops and accompanied by a large car-force\r\nattacked the vast force of Drona. Vibhatsu attacking the right and\r\nVrikodara the left, they both poured on Bharadwaja's son two dense\r\nshowers of arrows. The mighty car-warriors among the Srinjayas and the\r\nPanchalas, with the Matsyas and the Somakas, O king, followed the two\r\nbrothers thus engaged (in that encounter with Drona). Similarly, many\r\nforemost of car-warriors, skilled in smiting, belonging to thy son,\r\naccompanied by a large force, proceeded towards Drona's car (for\r\nsupporting the latter). Then the Bharata host, slaughtered by the\r\ndiadem-decked (Arjuna) and overcome with and afflicted by the darkness,\r\nbegan to break. Thy son himself, and Drona, both endevoured to rally\r\nthem. Thy troops, however, O king, could not be checked in their flight.\r\nIndeed, that vast host, slaughtered by the shafts of Pandu's son, began\r\nto fly away in all directions in that hour when the world was enveloped\r\nwith gloom.

I tell thee\r\ntruely, O Suta, that I shall not return from battle today without having\r\nslain that foe, viz., that worst of the Kurus, the son of Valhika'. Thus\r\naddressed, the charioteer then urged to battle those fleet steeds of the\r\nSindhu breed, white as conch and capable of bearing every weapon. Those\r\nsteeds endued with the speed of the wind or the mind, bore Yuyudhana to\r\nbattle like the steeds of Indra, O king, bearing the latter in days of\r\nyore when he proceeded to quell the Danavas. Beholding the Satwata hero\r\nthus advancing quickly in battle Somadatta, O king, fearlessly turned\r\ntowards him. Scattering showers of shafts like the clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain, he covered the grandson of Sini like the clouds\r\ncovering the sun. Satyaki also, O bull of Bharata's race, in that\r\nencounter fearlessly covered that bull amongst the Kurus with showers of\r\nshafts. Then Somadatta pierced that hero of Madhu's race with sixty\r\nshafts in the chest. Satyaki, in turn, O king, pierced Somadatta with\r\nmany whetted arrows. Mangled by each other with each-other's shafts,\r\nthose two warriors looked resplendent like a couple of flowering Kinsukas\r\nin the season of spring. Dyed all over with blood, those illustrious\r\nwarriors of the Kuru and the Vrishni races looked at each other with\r\ntheir glances. Riding on their cars that coursed in circles, those\r\ngrinders of foes, of terrible countenances, resembled two clouds pouring\r\ntorrents of rain. Their bodies mangled and pierced all over with arrows,\r\nthey looked, O king, like two porcupines. Pierced with countless shafts,\r\nequipped with wings of gold, the two warriors looked resplendent, O\r\nmonarch, like a couple of tall trees covered with fire-flies. Their\r\nbodies looking bright with the blazing arrows sticking to them, those two\r\nmighty car-warriors looked in that battle like two angry elephants decked\r\nwith burning torches. Then, O monarch, the mighty car-warrior, Somadatta,\r\nin that battle, cut off with a crescent-shaped arrow the large bow of\r\nMadhava. With great speed also, at a time when speed was of the utmost\r\nconsequence, the Kuru hero then pierced Satyaki with five and twenty\r\nshafts, and once again with ten. Then Satyaki, taking up a tougher bow,\r\nquickly pierced Somadatta with five shafts. With another broad-headed\r\narrow, Satyaki also, O king, smiling the while, cut off the golden\r\nstandard of Valhika's son. Somadatta, however, beholding his standard cut\r\ndown, fearlessly pierced the grandson of Sini with five and twenty\r\narrows. Satwata also, excited with rage, cut off with a razor-faced arrow\r\nthe bow of Somadatta, in that encounter. And he also pierced Somadatta\r\nwho then resembled a snake without fangs, with a hundred straight arrows,\r\nequipped with wings of gold. The mighty car-warrior Somadatta, then, who\r\nwas endued with great strength taking up another bow, began to cover\r\nSatyaki (with showers of shafts). Satyaki too, inflamed with rage,\r\npierced Somadatta with many shafts. Somadatta, in return, afflicted\r\nSatyaki with his arrowy showers. Then Bhima coming to the encounter, and\r\nfighting on behalf of Satyaki, struck Valhika's son with ten shafts.\r\nSomadatta, however, fearlessly struck Bhimasena with many whetted arrows.\r\nThen Satyaki, inflamed with rage, aiming at Somadatta's chest, shot a new\r\nand terrible Parigha equipped with a golden staff and hard as the\r\nthunder. The Kuru warrior, however, smiling the while, cut off that\r\nterrible Parigha advancing with speed against him in two parts. That\r\nformidable Parigha of iron, then, thus cut off into two fragments, fell\r\ndown like so many crests of a mountain riven by thunder. Then Satyaki, O\r\nking, with a broad-headed arrow, cut off in that encounter Somadatta's\r\nbow, and then with five arrows, the leathern fence that cased his\r\nfingers. Then, O Bharata, with four other shafts he speedily despatched\r\nthe four excellent steeds of the Kuru warrior to Yama's presence. And\r\nthen that tiger among car-warriors with another straight shaft, smiling\r\nthe while, cut off from his trunk the head of Somadatta's driver. Then he\r\nsought at Somadatta himself a terrible shaft of fiery effulgence, whetted\r\non stone, steeped in oil, and equipped with wings of gold. That excellent\r\nand fierce shaft, shot by the mighty grandson of Sini, quickly fell like\r\na hawk, O Lord, upon the chest of Somadatta. Deeply pierced by the mighty\r\nSatwata, the great car-warrior Somadatta, O monarch, fell down (from his\r\ncar) and expired. Beholding the great car-warrior Somadatta slain there,\r\nthy warriors with a large throng of cars rushed against Yuyudhana.\r\nMeanwhile, the Pandava also, O king, with all the Prabhadrakas and\r\naccompanied by a large force, rushed against Drona's army. Then\r\nYudhishthira, excited with wrath, began, with his shafts, to strike and\r\nrout the troops of Bharadwaja's son at the very sight of the latter.\r\nBeholding Yudhishthira thus agitating his troops, Drona, with eyes red in\r\nwrath, furiously rushed against him. The preceptor, then pierced the son\r\nof Pritha with seven keen arrows. Yudhishthira, in return, excited with\r\nwrath, pierced the preceptor with five arrows. Deeply pierced by the son\r\nof Pandu, the mighty bowman (Drona), licking the corners of his mouth for\r\na moment, cut off both the standard and the bow of Yudhishthira. With\r\ngreat speed, at a time when speed was of the utmost consequence, that\r\nbest of kings, whose bow had been cut off, took up another bow that was\r\nsufficiently tough and hard. The son of Pandu then pierced Drona with his\r\nsteeds, driver, standard, and car, with a thousand arrows. All this\r\nseemed exceedingly wonderful. Afflicted with the strokes of those arrows\r\nand feeling great pain, Drona, that bull among Brahmanas, sat down for a\r\nwhile on the terrace of his car. Recovering his senses, sighing like a\r\nsnake, and filled with great rage, the preceptor invoked into existence\r\nthe Vayavya weapon. The valiant son of Pritha, bow in hand, fearlessly\r\nbaffled that weapon with a similar weapon of his in that encounter. And\r\nthe son of Pandu also cut in two fragments the large bow of the Brahmana.\r\nThen Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, took up another bow. That bull of\r\nKuru's race, Yudhishthira, cut off that bow also, with many keen shafts.\r\nThen Vasudeva, addressing Yudhishthira. the son of Kunti, said, 'Listen,\r\nO mighty-armed Yudhishthira, to what I say. Cease, O best of the\r\nBharatas, to fight with Drona. Drona always striveth to seize thee in\r\nbattle. I do not think it fit that thou shouldst fight with him. He who\r\nhath been created for Drona's destruction will, without doubt, slay him.\r\nLeaving the preceptor, go where king Suyodhana is. Kings should fight\r\nwith kings, they should not desire to fight with such as are not kings.\r\nSurrounded, therefore, by elephants and steeds and cars, repair thou\r\nthither, O son of Kunti, where Dhananjaya with myself, aided by a small\r\nforce, and Bhima also, that tiger among men, are fighting with the\r\nKurus'. Hearing these words of Vasudeva, king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nreflecting for a moment, proceeded to that part of the field where that\r\nslayer of foes, viz., Bhima, engaged in fierce battle, was slaughtering\r\nthy troops like the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth. Making the\r\nearth resound with the loud rattle of his car, which resembled the roar\r\nof the clouds at the end of summer, king Yudhishthira the just, the\r\n(eldest) son of Pandu, took up the flank of Bhima, engaged in the\r\nslaughter of the foe. Drona also on that night, began to consume his\r\nfoes, the Panchalas'\""

The combatants of both\r\narmies, oppressed all around by those foremost of car-warriors, during\r\nthe hour of darkness, fled away on all sides. Indeed, the warriors, broke\r\nand fled away in all directions with hearts perfectly cheerless. And as\r\nthey fled away in all directions, they underwent a great carnage.\r\nThousands of foremost car-warriors also, O king, slaughtered one another\r\nin that battle. Unable to see anything in the dark, the combatants became\r\ndeprived of their senses. All this was the result of the evil counsels of\r\nthy son. Indeed, at that hour when the world was enveloped in darkness,\r\nall creatures, O Bharata, including even the foremost of warriors,\r\novercome with panic, were deprived of their senses in that battle.'[213]\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'What became the state of your mind then when,\r\nafflicted by that darkness, ye all were deprived of your energy and\r\nfuriously agitated by the Pandavas! How also, O Sanjaya, when everything\r\nwas enveloped in darkness, did the Pandava troops as also mine once more\r\nbecame visible?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then the remnant of the army (of the Katirava),\r\nunder the orders of their leaders, were once more disposed in (compact)\r\narray. Drona placed himself at the van, and Salya at the rear. And\r\nDrona's son and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, placed themselves on the right\r\nand the left flanks. And king Duryodhana himself, O monarch, on that\r\nnight, busied himself in protecting all the troops. Cheering all the\r\nfoot-soldiers, O king, Duryodhana said unto them, 'Laying aside your\r\ngreat weapons, take ye all blazing lamps in your hands.' Thus commanded\r\nby that best of kings, the foot-soldiers joyfully took up burning lamps.\r\nThe gods and Rishis, Gandharvas and celestial Rishis, and the diverse\r\ntribes of Vidyadharas and Apsaras, and Nagas and Yakshas and Uragas and\r\nKinnaras, stationed on the welkin also joyfully took up blazing lamps.\r\nMany lamps, filled with sweet-scented oil, were seen to fall from the\r\nRegents of the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass. For\r\nDuryodhana's sake, many such were seen to come from Narada and Parvata in\r\nespecial, lighting up that darkness. The (Kaurava) army then, disposed in\r\ncompact array, looked resplendent, on that night with the light of those\r\nlamps, the costly ornaments (on the persons of combatants), and the\r\nblazing celestial weapons as those were shot or hurled by it. On each car\r\nwere placed five lamps, and on each infuriated elephant three.[214] And\r\nupon each horse was placed a large lamp. Thus was that host lighted up by\r\nthe Kuru warriors.[215] Set in their places within a short time, those\r\nlamps speedily lighted up thy army. Indeed, all the troops, thus made\r\nradiant by the foot-soldiers with oil-fed lamps in their hands, looked\r\nbeautiful like clouds in the nocturnal sky illumined by flashes of\r\nlightning. When the Kuru host had thus been illuminated, Drona, endued\r\nwith the effulgence of fire, scorching everything around, looked radiant,\r\nO king, in his golden armour, like the midday sun of blazing ray. The\r\nlight of those lamps began to be reflected from the golden ornaments, the\r\nbright cuirasses and bows, and the well-tempered weapons of the\r\ncombatants. And maces twined with strings, and bright Parighas, and cars\r\nand shafts and darts, as they coursed along, repeatedly created, O\r\nAjamidha, by their reflection myriads of lamps. And umbrellas and\r\nyak-tails and scimitars and blazing brands, O king, and necklaces of\r\ngold, as these were whirled or moved, reflecting that light, looked\r\nexceedingly beautiful. Illuminated by the light of those lamps and\r\nirradiated by the reflection from weapons and ornaments, that host, O\r\nking, blazed up with splendour. Well-tempered and beautiful weapons, red\r\nwith blood, and whirled by heroes, created a blazing effulgence there,\r\nlike flashes of lightning in the sky at the end of summer. The faces of\r\nwarriors, impetuously pursuing foes for striking them down and themselves\r\ntrembling in the ardour of the rush, looked beautiful like masses of\r\nclouds urged on by the wind. As the splendour of the sun becomes fierce\r\non the occasion of the conflagration of a forest full of trees, even so\r\non that terrible night became the splendour of that fierce and\r\nilluminated host. Beholding that host of ours illumined, the Parthas\r\nalso, with great speed, stirring up the foot-soldiers throughout their\r\narmy, acted like ourselves. On each elephant, they placed seven lamps; on\r\neach car, ten; and on the back of each steed they placed two lamps; and\r\non the flanks and rear (of their cars) and on their standard also, they\r\nplaced many lamps. And on the flanks of their host, and on the rear and\r\nthe van, and all around and within, many other lamps were lighted. The\r\nKurus having done the same, both the armies were thus lighted. Throughout\r\nthe host, the foot-soldiers became mingled with elephants and cars and\r\ncavalry. And the army of Pandu's son was also illuminated by others (than\r\nfoot-soldiers) standing with blazing torches in their hands.[216] With\r\nthose lamps that host became fiercely effulgent, like a blazing fire made\r\ndoubly resplendent by the dazzling rays of the maker of day. The\r\nsplendour of both the armies, over-spreading the earth, the welkin, and\r\nall the points of the compass, seemed to increase. With that light, thy\r\narmy as also theirs became distinctly visible. Awakened by that light\r\nwhich reached the skies, the gods, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the\r\nRishis and other crowned with (ascetic) success, and the Apsaras, all\r\ncame there. Crowded then with gods and Gandharvas, and Yakshas, and\r\nRishis crowned with (ascetic) success, and Apsaras, and the spirits of\r\nslain warriors about to enter the celestial regions, the field of battle\r\nlooked like a second heaven. Teeming with cars and steeds and elephants,\r\nbrilliantly illumined with lamps, with angry combatants and horses slain\r\nor wandering wildly, that vast force of arrayed warriors and steeds and\r\nelephants looked like the arrays of the celestials and the Asuras in days\r\nof old. The rush of darts formed the fierce winds; great cars, the cloud;\r\nthe neigh and grunt of steeds and elephants, the roars; shafts, the\r\nshowers; and the blood of warriors and animals, the flood, of that\r\ntempest like nocturnal encounter between those god-like men. In the midst\r\nof that battle, that foremost of Brahmanas, viz., the high-souled\r\nAswatthaman, scorching the Pandavas, O ruler of men, resembled the midday\r\nsun at the end of the season of rains, scorching everything with his\r\nfierce ray.'\"[217]"

With thousands of lamps blazing all around and with\r\nthe more blazing lamps of the gods and the Gandharvas, set upon golden\r\nstands decked with jewels, and fed with fragrant oil, the field of\r\nbattle, O Bharata, looked resplendent like the firmament bespangled with\r\nstars. With hundreds upon hundreds of blazing brands, the earth looked\r\nexceedingly beautiful. Indeed, the earth seemed to be in a conflagration,\r\nlike what happens at the universal destruction.[219] All the points of\r\nthe compass blazed up with those lamps all around and looked like trees\r\ncovered by fire-flies at an evening in the season of rains. Heroic\r\ncombatants, then, O king, engaged in battle with heroic rivals. Elephants\r\nengaged with elephants, and horsemen with horsemen, and car-warriors with\r\ncar-warriors, filled with joy, on that fierce night at the command of thy\r\nson. The clash of the two armies both consisting of four kinds of forces,\r\nbecame terrible. Then Arjuna, O monarch, began, with great speed, to\r\ndestroy the Kaurava ranks, weakening all the kings.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the invincible Arjuna, excited with wrath and\r\nunable to brook (the feats of the Kurus), penetrated into the army of my\r\nson, what became the state of your minds? Indeed, when that scorcher of\r\nfoes entered into their midst, what did the soldiers think? What steps\r\nalso did Duryodhana think fit to be adopted then? Who were those\r\nchastisers of foes that proceeded in that battle against that hero?\r\nIndeed, when Arjuna, of white steeds, entered (our army), who were they\r\nthat protected Drona? Who guarded the right wheel and who the left wheel\r\nof Drona's car? Who were those heroes that protected the rear of that\r\nbattling hero? Indeed, when Bharadwaja's son proceeded, slaying the foe\r\n(along his route), who were they that proceeded in his van? That mighty\r\nand invincible bowman who penetrated into the midst of the Panchalas,\r\nthat tiger among men endued with great valour, who proceeded, as if\r\ndancing, along the track of his car, and consumed large throngs of\r\nPanchala cars by means of his shafts like a raging conflagration; alas,\r\nhow did that Drona meet with his death? Thou always speakest of my foes\r\nas cool and unvanquished and cheerful and swelling with might in battle.\r\nThou dost not, however, speak of mine in such words. On the other hand,\r\nthou describest them to be slain, pale, and routed, and thou speakest of\r\nmy car-warriors, as always deprived of their cars in all the battles they\r\nfight!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Understanding the wishes of Drona who was bent on\r\nbattle, Duryodhana, on that night, O king, addressing his obedient\r\nbrothers, viz., Vikarna and Chitrasena and Suparsva and Durdharsha and\r\nDirghavahu, and all those that followed them, said those words, 'Ye\r\nheroes of great valour, struggling with resolution, all of you protect\r\nDrona from the rear. The son of Hridika will protect his right and Sala\r\nhis left.' Saying this, thy son then urged forward placing them at the\r\nvan, the remnant of the brave and mighty Trigarta car-warriors, saying,\r\n'The preceptor is merciful. The Pandavas are fighting with great\r\nresolution.. While engaged in slaughtering the foe in battle, protect him\r\nwell, uniting together. Drona is mighty in battle; is endued with great\r\nlightness of hand and great valour. He can vanquish the very gods in\r\nbattle,--what need then be said of the Pandavas and the Somakas? All of\r\nyou, however, united together and struggling with great resolution in\r\nthis terrible battle, protect the invincible Drona from that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, viz., Dhrishtadyumna. Except Dhrishtadyumna, I do not see\r\nthe man amongst all the warriors of the Pandavas that can vanquish Drona\r\nin battle. I, therefore, think that we should, with our whole soul,\r\nprotect the son of Bharadwaja. Protected (by us), he is sure to slay the\r\nSomakas and the Srinjayas, one after another. Upon the slaughter of all\r\nthe Srinjayas at the head of the (Pandava) army, Drona's son without\r\ndoubt, will slay Dhrishtadyumna in battle. Similarly, the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Karna will vanquish Arjuna in battle. As regards Bhimasena\r\nand others clad in mail, I will subjugate them all in fight. The rest of\r\nthe Pandavas deprived of energy, will be easily defeated by the warriors.\r\nIt is evident, my success then will last for ever. For these reasons,\r\nprotect the mighty car-warrior Drona in battle.' Having said these words,\r\nO chief of the Bharatas, thy son Duryodhana, urged his troops on that\r\nnight of terrible darkness. Then commenced a battle, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, between the two hosts. O Monarch, both actuated by the desire\r\nof victory. Arjuna began to afflict the Kauravas, and the Kauravas began\r\nto afflict Arjuna, with diverse kinds of weapons. Drona's son covered\r\nthe, ruler of the Panchalas, and Drona himself covered the Srinjaya, with\r\nshowers of straight shafts in that battle. And as the Pandava and the\r\nPanchala troops (on the one side) and the Kaurava troops (on the other),\r\nO Bharata, were engaged in slaughtering each other, there arose a furious\r\nuproar on the field. The battle that took place on that night was so\r\nterrible and fierce that its like had never been previously witnessed by\r\nourselves or those gone before us.'\""

Indeed, O king, for the destruction of men, cars, and elephants,\r\nking Yudhisthira commanded his own troops, saying, 'Proceed ye against\r\nDrona only, for slaying him!'[220] At the command of the king, O monarch,\r\nthe Panchalas and the Somakas rushed against Drona alone, uttering\r\nterrible shouts. Ourselves excited with rage, and loudly roaring in\r\nreturn, rushed against them, to the best of our prowess, courage, and\r\nmight, in battle. Kritavarman, the son of Hridika, rushed against\r\nYudhishthira, as the latter was advancing against Drona, like an\r\ninfuriated elephant against an infuriated compeer. Against Sini's\r\ngrandson who advanced scattering arrowy showers all around, rushed, O\r\nking, the Kuru warrior Bhuri, that grinder (of foes) in battle. Karna,\r\nthe son of Vikartana, O king, resisted that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nPandu's son, Sahadeva, as the letter advanced for getting at Drona. King\r\nDuryodhana, in that battle, himself rushed against that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., Bhimasena, advancing on his car like the Destroyer.\r\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, O king, proceeding quickly, resisted that\r\nforemost of warriors, viz., Nakula, who was conversant with every kind of\r\nbattle. Kripa, the son of Saradwat, O king, resisted Sikhandin in that\r\nbattle, that foremost of car-warrior, as the latter advanced on his car.\r\nDuhsasana, O king, contending vigorously, resisted Prativindhya as the\r\nletter advanced with resolution (on his car), drawn by steeds looking\r\nlike peacocks. Aswatthaman, O monarch, resisted Bhimasena's son, viz.,\r\nRakshasa (Ghatotkacha) acquainted with a hundred kinds of illusion, as\r\nthe latter advanced. Vrishasena. in that battle resisted the mighty\r\nDrupada with his troops and followers as the latter advanced for getting\r\nat Drona. The ruler of the Madras, O king, excited with wrath resisted\r\nVirata, O Bharata, as the latter quickly advanced for the slaughter of\r\nDrona; Chitrasena, in that battle, resisted, with great force and\r\nshooting many shafts, Nakula's son, Satanika, as the latter advanced for\r\nslaying Drona. The prince of the Rakshasas, viz., Alambhusha, O king,\r\nresisted Arjuna, that foremost of car-warriors, as the latter advanced.\r\nDhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas, cheerfully resisted the\r\ngreat bowman Drona as the latter was engaged in slaughtering the foe. As\r\nregards the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, that advanced (against\r\nDrona), other car-warriors of thy army, O king, resisted them with great\r\nforce. Elephant riders speedily encountering elephant riders in that\r\ndreadful battle, began to fight, with each other and grind each other by\r\nthousands. At dead of night, O monarch, as the steeds rushed against each\r\nother with impetuosity, they looked like winged hills. Horsemen, O\r\nmonarch, encountered horsemen, armed with lances and darts and swords,\r\nand uttering loud shouts. Large numbers of men slaughtered one another in\r\nheaps, with maces and short clubs and diverse other weapons. Kritavarman,\r\nthe son of Hridika, excited with wrath, resisted Dharma's son,\r\nYudhishthira, like continents resisting the swelling sea. Yudhishthira,\r\nhowever, piercing Hridika's son with five arrows, once more pierced him\r\nwith twenty, and addressing him, said, Wait, Wait.' Then Kritavarman, O\r\nsire, excited with wrath, cut off with a broad-headed shaft, the bow of\r\nking Yudhishthira the just and pierced the latter with seven arrows.\r\nTaking up another bow, that mighty car-warrior, viz., Dharma's son,\r\npierced the son of Hridika in the arms and chest with ten arrows. Then\r\nthat warrior of Madhu's race, thus pierced, O sire, by Dharma's son in\r\nthat battle, trembled with rage and afflicted Yudhishthira with seven\r\nshafts. Then Pritha's son cutting off his enemy's bow as also the\r\nleathern fence that cased his hands, sped at him five keen shafts whetted\r\non stone. Those fierce shafts, piercing through the latter's costly\r\narmour, decked with gold, entered the earth like snakes into an ant-hill.\r\nWith the twinkling of an eye, Kritavarman, taking up another bow, pierced\r\nthe son of Pandu with sixty arrows and once more with ten. Of\r\nimmeasurable soul, the son of Pandu, then placing his large bow on his\r\ncar, sped at Kritavarman a dart resembling a snake. That dart decked with\r\ngold, shot by the son of Pandu, piercing through Kritavarman's right arm,\r\nentered the earth. Meanwhile, Pritha's son, taking up his formidable bow,\r\nshrouded the son of Hridika with showers of straight shafts. Then brave\r\nKritavarman, that great car-warrior among the Vrishnis, within less than\r\nthe twinkling of an eye, made Yudhishthira steedless and driverless and\r\ncarless. Thereupon, the eldest son of Pandu took up a sword and a shield.\r\nThen he, of Madhu's race, cut off both those weapons in that battle.\r\nYudhishthira then, taking up a fierce lance, equipped with a gold-decked\r\nstaff, quickly sped it, in that battle, at the illustrious son of\r\nHridika. Hridika's son, however, smiling the while, and displaying great\r\nlightness of hand, cut off into two fragments that lance hurled from the\r\narms of Yudhishthira, as it coursed impetuously towards him. He then\r\ncovered the son of Dharma with a hundred arrows in that encounter.\r\nExcited with wrath, he then cut off the latter's coat of mail with\r\nshowers of shafts. Yudhishthira's armour, decked with gold, cut off by\r\nHridika's son with his shafts, dropped down from his body, O king, like a\r\ncluster of stars dropping down from the firmament. His armour cut off,\r\nhimself deprived of car and afflicted with the shafts of Kritavarman,\r\nDharma's son, Yudhishthira, quickly retreated from battle. The mighty\r\ncar-warrior Kritavarman, then, having vanquished Yudhishthira, the son of\r\nDharma, once more began to protect the wheel of Drona's car.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Bhuri, O king, in that battle, resisted that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the grandson of Sini, who advanced like an elephant\r\ntowards a lake full of water. The Satyaki, excited with wrath, pierced\r\nhis foe in chest with five keen shafts. At this, the latter's blood began\r\nto flow. The Kuru warrior in that encounter similarly pierced with great\r\nspeed the grandson of Sini, that hero difficult of defeat in battle, with\r\nten shafts in the chest. Those warriors, drawing their bows to their\r\nfullest stretch, and with eyes red in wrath, began, O king, to mangle\r\neach other in that combat. The arrowy downpours of those two warriors,\r\nboth, excited with rage and resembling Death himself or the sun\r\nscattering his rays, were exceedingly terrible. Shrouding each other with\r\nshafts, each stayed before the other in that battle. For a short while\r\nthat battle proceeded equally. Then, O king, the grandson of Sini,\r\nexcited with rage and smiling the while, cut off the bow of the\r\nillustrious Kuru warrior in that battle. Having cut off his bow, Satyaki\r\nquickly pierced him in the chest with nine keen arrows and addressing\r\nhim, said, 'Wait! Wait!' That scorcher of foes deeply pierced his mighty\r\nfoe, quickly took up another bow and pierced the Satwata warrior in\r\nreturn. Having pierced the Satwata hero with three shafts, O monarch,\r\nBhuri, then, smiling the while, cut off his foe's bow with a sharp and\r\nbroad-headed shaft. His bow being cut off, Satyaki, O king, maddened with\r\nrage, hurled an impetuous dart at the broad chest of Bhuri. Pierced with\r\nthat dart, Bhuri fell down from his excellent car, covered with blood,\r\nlike the sun dropping down from the firmament. Beholding him thus slain,\r\nthe mighty car-warrior Aswatthaman, O Bharata, rushed impetuously against\r\ngrandson of Sini. Having addressed Satyaki, O king, saying, 'Wait, Wait,'\r\nhe shrouded him with showers of shafts, like the clouds pouring torrents\r\nof rain on the crest of Merit. Beholding him rushing towards the car of\r\nSini's grandson, the mighty car-warrior Ghatotkacha, O king, uttering a\r\nloud roar, addressed saying, Wait, Wait, O son of Drona! Thou shalt not\r\nescape from me with life. I will presently slay thee like the six-faced\r\n(Karttikeya) slaying (the Asura) Mahisha. I shall today, on the field,\r\npurge thy heart of all desire of battle.' Having said these words, that\r\nslayer of hostile heroes, viz., the Rakshasa (Ghatotkacha), with eyes red\r\nlike copper in wrath, rushed furiously against the son of Drona, like a\r\nlion rushing against a prince of elephants. And Ghatotkacha sped at his\r\nfoe shafts of the measure of the Aksha of a car, and covered that bull\r\namong car-warriors therewith, like clouds pouring torrents of rain. With\r\nhis own shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison, Drona's son,\r\nhowever, in that battle, quickly dispelled that arrowy shower before it\r\ncould reach him. He then pierced that chastiser of foes, viz.,\r\nGhatotkacha, that prince of the Rakshasas, with hundreds of keen and\r\nswift-coursing arrows, all capable of penetrating into the very vitals.\r\nThus pierced with those shafts by Aswatthaman, that Rakshasas, on the\r\nfield of battle, looked beautiful, O monarch, like a porcupine with\r\nquills erect on its body. Then the valiant son of Bhimasena, filled with\r\nrage, mangled the son of Drona with many fierce arrows, whizzing through\r\nthe air with the roar of thunder. And he rained on Aswatthaman a perfect\r\nshower of arrows of diverse kinds; some, equipped with heads like razors;\r\nsome, shaped as the crescent; some, only pointed; some, frog-faced; some,\r\nwith heads resembling the boar's ear; some, barbed; and some of other\r\nspecies.[221] Like the wind dispersing mighty masses of clouds, Drona's\r\nson, O king, without his senses being agitated, destroyed with his own\r\nterrible arrows, inspired by mantras with the force of celestial weapons,\r\nthat fierce, unbearable and unrivalled shower of weapons, whose sound\r\nresembled the roar of thunder, and which fell incessantly upon him. It\r\nseemed then that another encounter was taking place in the welkin between\r\nweapons (as the combatants), which was terrible, and which, O king,\r\nfilled the warriors with awe. With the sparks all around, generated by\r\nthe clash of the weapons, shot by those two warriors, the welkin looked\r\nbeautiful as illumined by myriads of fire-flies in the evening. Drona's\r\nson then, filling all the points of the compass with his shafts, shrouded\r\nthe Rakshasa himself, for doing what was agreeable to thy sons. Then\r\ncommenced a battle once more between Drona's son and the Rakshasa on that\r\nnight of thick darkness, which resembled the encounter between Sakra and\r\nPrahlada. Then Ghatotkacha, filled with rage, struck Drona's son, in that\r\nbattle, on the chest with ten shafts, each resembling the Yuga-fire,\r\nDeeply pierced the Rakshasa, the mighty son of Drona began to tremble in\r\nthat battle like a tall tree shaken by the wind. Supporting himself by\r\nholding the flagstaff, he swooned away. Then all thy troops, O king,\r\nuttered cries of Oh and Alas. Indeed, O monarch, all thy warriors then\r\nregarded Drona's son as slain. Beholding Aswatthaman in that plight, the\r\nPanchalas and the Srinjayas in that battle uttered leonine roars. Then\r\nthat crusher of foes, viz., the mighty car-warrior Aswatthaman,\r\nrecovering his senses, forcibly drawing the bow with his left hand,\r\nstretching the bowstring to his ear, quickly shot a terrible shaft\r\nresembling the rod of Yama himself, aiming at Ghatotkacha. That excellent\r\nshafts, fierce and equipped with golden wings, piercing through the chest\r\nof the Rakshasa, entered the earth, O king. Deeply pierced, O monarch, by\r\nDrona's son who was proud of his prowess in battle, that prince of\r\nRakshasas, endued with great strength, sat down on the terrace of his\r\ncar. Beholding Hidimva's son deprived of his senses, his charioteer,\r\ninspired with fear, speedily removed him from the field, bearing him away\r\nfrom the presence of Drona's son. Having pierced that prince of\r\nRakshasas, viz., Ghatotkacha, in that encounter thus, Drona's son, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, uttered a loud roar. Worshipped by thy sons as also\r\nby all thy warriors, O Bharata, Aswatthaman's body blazed up like the\r\nmidday sun.\r\n\r\n\"As regards Bhimasena who was battling in from of Drona's cal king\r\nDuryodhana himself pierced him with many whetted shafts. Bhimasena,\r\nhowever, O Bharata, pierced him in return with nine arrows. Duryodhana,\r\nthen, pierced Bhimasena with twenty arrows. Covered with each other's\r\narrows on the field of battle, those two warriors looked like the sun and\r\nthe moon covered with clouds in the firmament. Then king Duryodhana, O\r\nchief of Bharatas, pierced Bhima with five winged arrows and said, 'Wait!\r\nWait!' Bhima then, cutting off his bow as also his standard with keen\r\nshafts, pierced the Kuru king himself with ninety straight arrows. Then,\r\nDuryodhana filled with rage, taking up a more formidable bow, O chief of\r\nthe Bharatas, afflicted Bhimasena, at the van of battle, with many\r\nwhetted shafts, in the very sight of all the bowmen. Baffling those\r\nshafts shot from Duryodhana's bow, Bhima pierced the Kuru king with five\r\nand twenty short arrows. Duryodhana then, O sire, excited with wrath, cut\r\noff Bhimasena's bow with a razor-faced arrow and pierced Bhima himself\r\nwith ten shafts in return. Then the mighty Bhimasena, taking up another\r\nbow, quickly pierced the king with seven keen shafts. Displaying great\r\nlightness of hand, Duryodhana cut off even that bow of Bhima. The second,\r\nthe third, the fourth, and the fifth, bow that Bhima took up were\r\nsimilarly cut off. Indeed, O king, thy son, proud of his prowess and\r\ndesirous of victory, cut off Bhima's bow as soon as the latter took up\r\none. Seeing his bows repeatedly cut off, Bhima then hurled, in that\r\nbattle, a dart made wholly of iron and hard as the thunder. That dart\r\nblazing as a flame of fire, resembled the sister of Death. The Kuru king,\r\nhowever, in the very sight of all the warriors and before the eyes of\r\nBhima himself, cut in three fragments that dart, which coursed towards\r\nhim through the welkin with the splendour of fire and dividing it, as it\r\nwere by a straight line such as is visible on the head of a woman parting\r\nher tresses. Then Bhima, O king, whirling his heavy and blazing mace,\r\nhurled it with great force at the car of Duryodhana. That heavy mace\r\nspeedily crushed the steeds, the driver, and the car also, of thy son in\r\nthat encounter. Thy son, then, O monarch, afraid of Bhima and shrinking\r\nwithin the narrowest compass, ascended another car, viz., that of the\r\nillustrious Nandaka. Then Bhima, regarding Suyodhana to have been slain\r\namid the darkness of that night, uttered a loud leonine roar challenging\r\nthe Kauravas. Thy warriors regarded the king to be slain. All of them\r\nuttered loud cries of Oh and Alas. Hearing the wails of the affrighted\r\nwarriors and the roars of the high souled Bhima, O king, king\r\nYudhishthira also regarded Suyodhana to have been slain. And the eldest\r\nson of Pandu, thereupon, rushed quickly to the spot where Vrikodara, the\r\nson of Pritha, was. And the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, the Matsyas, the\r\nKaikeyas, and the Chedis, speedily advanced, with all their might against\r\nDrona from desire of slaying him. There also occurred a dreadful battle\r\nbetween Drona and the enemy. And the combatants of both sides were\r\nenveloped in thick gloom and struck and slew one another'.\""

Piercing the son of Radha with nine shafts, Sahadeva\r\nonce more pierced that warrior with nine straight arrows. Karna then\r\npierced Sahadeva in return with a hundred straight shafts, and displaying\r\ngreat lightness in hand, cut off the latter's stringed bow. Then the\r\nvaliant son of Madri, taking up another bow, pierced Karna with twenty\r\narrows. This feat of his seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then Karna,\r\nslaying Sahadeva's steeds with many straight shafts, speedily despatched\r\nthe latter's driver with a broad-headed shaft, to Yama's abode. This\r\ncarless Sahadeva then took up a sword and a shield. Even those weapons\r\nwere cut off by Karna smiling the while. Then the mighty Sahadeva, in\r\nthat encounter, sped towards the car of Vikartana's son, a heavy and\r\nterrible mace decked with gold. Karna, then with his shafts, quickly cut\r\noff that mace which hurled by Sahadeva, coursed towards him impetuously,\r\nand caused it to fall down on the earth. Beholding his mace cut off,\r\nSahadeva quickly hurled a dart at Karna. That dart also was cut off by\r\nKarna. The son of Madri, then, quickly jumping down from his excellent\r\ncar, and blazing with wrath upon beholding Karna stationed before him,\r\ntook up a car-wheel and hurled it at the son of Adhiratha. The Suta's\r\nson, however, with many thousands of arrows, cut off that wheel coursing\r\ntowards him like the uplifted wheel of Death. When that wheel had been\r\ncut off, Sahadeva, O sire, aiming at Karna, hurled at him the shafts of\r\nhis car, the traces of his steeds, the yokes of his cars, the limbs of\r\nelephants and steeds and dead human bodies. Karna cut off all these with\r\nhis shafts. Seeing himself deprived of all weapons, Madri's son,\r\nSahadeva, struck by Karna with many shafts, left the battle. Pursuing him\r\nfor a while, the son of Radha, O bull of Bharata's race, smilingly\r\naddressed Sahadeva and said these cruel words, 'Do not, O hero, fight in\r\nbattle with those that are superior to thee. Fight with thy equals, O son\r\nof Madri! Do not mistrust my words.' Then touching him with the horn of\r\nhis bow, he once more said, 'Yonder, Arjuna is fighting resolutely with\r\nthe Kurus in battle. Go there, O son of Madri, or return home if thou\r\nlikest.' Having said those words, Karna, that foremost of car-warriors,\r\nsmilingly proceeded on his car against the troops of the king of the\r\nPanchalas. The slayer of foes, that mighty car-warrior, devoted to truth,\r\nslew not the son of Madri although he had got the opportunity,\r\nrecollecting the words of Kunti. Sahadeva, then, heartless and afflicted\r\nwith arrows, and pierced with the wordy darts of Karna, no longer\r\ncherished any love for life. That mighty car-warrior then quickly\r\nascended the car of Janamejaya, the illustrious prince of the Panchalas.'\""

The battle that took place between those two great\r\nbowmen resembled, O king, that between Vala and Vasava in days of yore.\r\nThe ruler of the Madras, O monarch, with great activity, struck Virata,\r\nthat commander of a large division, with a hundred straight shafts. King\r\nVirata, in return, pierced the ruler of the Madras with nine keen arrows,\r\nand once more with three and seventy, and once again with a hundred. The\r\nruler of the Madras, then, slaying the four steeds yoked unto Virata's\r\ncar, cut down with a couple of shafts, the latter's umbrella and\r\nstandard. Quickly jumping down from that steedless car, the king stood,\r\ndrawing his bow and shooting keen shafts. Beholding his brother deprived\r\nof his steeds, Satanika quickly approached him on his car in the very\r\nsight of all the troops. The ruler of the Madras, however, piercing the\r\nadvancing Satanika with many shafts, despatched him to the abode of Yama.\r\nUpon the fall of the heroic Satanika, Virata, that commander of a large\r\ndivision, ascended the fallen hero's car, decked with standard and\r\ngarlands.[223] opening his eyes wide, and with prowess doubled by wrath,\r\nVirata quickly covered the car of the ruler of the Madras with winged\r\narrows. The ruler of the Madras then, excited with rage, deeply pierced\r\nVirata, that commander of a large division, in the chest, with a hundred\r\nstraight shafts. Deeply pierced by the mighty ruler of the Madras, that\r\ngreat car-warrior, viz., Virata, sat down on the terrace of his car and\r\nswooned away. His driver, then, beholding him mangled with shafts in that\r\nencounter, bore him away. Then that vast force, O Bharata, fled away on\r\nthat night, oppressed by hundreds of arrows of Salya, that ornament of\r\nbattle. Beholding the troops flying away, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya quickly\r\nadvanced to that spot, O monarch, where Salya was stationed. Then that\r\nprince of the Rakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, O king, riding upon a foremost\r\ncar, harnessed with eight steeds, having terrible-looking Pisachas of\r\nequine faces yoked unto it, furnished with blood-red banners, decked with\r\nfloral garlands made of black iron, covered with bear-skins, and\r\npossessing a tall standard over which perched a terrible, fierce-looking,\r\nand incessantly shrieking vulture, of spotted wings and wide-open eyes,\r\nproceeded against those advancing heroes. That Rakshasa, O king, looked\r\nbeautiful like a loose heap of antimony, and he withstood the advancing\r\nArjuna, like Meru withstanding a tempest, scattering showers of arrows, O\r\nmonarch, upon Arjuna's head. The battle then that commenced between the\r\nRakshasa and that human warrior, was exceedingly fierce. And it filled\r\nall the spectators there, O Bharata, with wonder. And it conduced to the\r\njoy also of vultures and crows, of ravens and owls and Kanakas and\r\njackals. Arjuna struck Alamvusha with six shafts and then cut off his\r\nstandard with ten sharp arrows. With a few other arrows, he cut off his\r\ndriver, and with some others his Trivenu, and with one more, his bow, and\r\nwith four others his four steeds. Alamvusha strung another bow, but that\r\nalso Arjuna cut off in two fragments. Then, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nPartha pierced that prince of the Rakshasas with four keen arrows. Thus\r\npierced, the Rakshasas fled away in fear. Having vanquished him, Arjuna\r\nquickly proceeded towards the spot where Drona was, shooting as he went,\r\nmany shafts, O king, at men, elephants, and steeds. Slaughtered O\r\nmonarch, by the illustrious son of Pandu, the combatants fell down on the\r\nground, like trees laid low by a tempest. Thus treated by the illustrious\r\nson of Pandu, all of them fled like a frightened herd of deer.'\""

This feat of his seemed exceedingly wonderful.\r\nDivested of his armour, thy son, O king, looked exceedingly beautiful,\r\nlike a snake, O monarch, having cast off his slough at the proper season.\r\nThen Nakula's son, with many keen shafts, cut off the struggling\r\nChitrasena's standard, and then his bow, O monarch, in that encounter.\r\nHis bow cut off in that combat, and deprived also of his armour, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, then, O king, took up another bow capable of piercing\r\nevery foe.

Vrishasena, then, excited with rage,\r\nquickly pierced Yajnasena, standing on his car, with many shafts in the\r\ncentre of the chest. Those two warriors mangled by arrows, and with\r\nshafts sticking to their bodies, looked beautiful like a couple of\r\nporcupines with their quills erect. Bathed in blood in consequence of the\r\nwounds caused by those straight arrows of keen points and golden wings,\r\nthey looked exceedingly beautiful in that dreadful encounter. Indeed, the\r\nspectacle they presented was that of a couple of beautiful and radiant\r\nKalpa trees or of a couple of Kinsukas rich with their flowery burthens.\r\nThen Vrishasena, O king, having pierced Drupada with nine arrows, once\r\nmore pierced him with seventy, and then again with three other arrows.\r\nThen shooting thousands of arrows, Karna's son, O monarch, looked\r\nbeautiful in that battle, like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Then\r\nDrupada, inflamed with wrath, cut off Vrishasena's bow into two\r\nfragments, with a broad-headed arrow, sharp and well-tempered. Taking,\r\nthen, another gold-decked bow that was new and strong, and drawing out of\r\nhis quiver a strong, whetted, well-tempered, sharp and broad-headed\r\narrow, and fixing it on his string, and carefully aiming it-at Drupada,\r\nhe let it off with great force, inspiring all the Somakas with fear. That\r\narrow, piercing through the breast of Drupada, fell on the surface of the\r\nearth. The king (of the Panchalas), then, thus pierced through with\r\nVrishasena's arrow, swooned away. His driver, then, recollecting his own\r\nduty, bore him away from the field. After the retreat, O monarch, of that\r\nmighty car-warrior of the Panchalas, the (Kaurava) army, on that terrible\r\nnight, rushed furiously against Drupada's troops whose coats of mail had\r\nbeen cut off by means of the arrows of the foe. In consequence of the\r\nblazing lamps dropped by the combatants all around, the earth, O king,\r\nlooked beautiful like the cloudless firmament bespangled with planets and\r\nstars. With the fallen Angadas of the combatants, the earth looked\r\nresplendent, O king, like a mass of clouds in the rainy season with\r\nflashes of lightning. Afflicted with the fear of Karna's son, the\r\nPanchalas fled away on all sides, like the Danavas from fear of Indra in\r\nthe great battle of yore between the gods and the Asuras. Thus afflicted\r\nin battle by Vrishasena, the Panchalas and the Somakas, O monarch,\r\nillumined by lamps, looked exceedingly beautiful.[225] Having vanquished\r\nthem in battle, Karna's son looked beautiful like the son, O Bharata,\r\nwhen he reaches the meridian. Amongst all those thousands of kings of thy\r\nside and their the valiant Vrishasena then seemed to be the only\r\nresplendent luminary. Having defeated in battle many heroes and all the\r\nmighty car-warriors among the Somakas, he quickly proceeded, O king, to\r\nthe spot where king Yudhishthira was stationed.\r\n\r\n\"Thy son Duhsasana proceeded against that mighty car-warrior, viz.,\r\nPrativindhya, who was advancing (against Drona), scorching his foes in\r\nbattle. The encounter that took place between them, O king, looked\r\nbeautiful, like that of Mercury and Venus in the cloudless firmament.\r\nDuhsasana pierced Prativindhya, who was accomplishing fierce feats in\r\nbattle, with three arrows on the forehead. Deeply pierced by that mighty\r\nbowman, thy son, Prativindhya, O monarch, looked beautiful like a crested\r\nhill. The mighty car-warrior Prativindhya, then, piercing Duhsasana with\r\nthree arrows, once more pierced him with seven, Thy son, then, O Bharata,\r\nachieved there an exceedingly difficult feat, for he felled\r\nPrativindhya's steeds with many arrows. With another broad-headed arrow\r\nhe also felled the latter's driver, and then his standard. And then he\r\ncut off, O king, into a thousand fragments the car of Prativindhya, armed\r\nwith the bow.

He then ascended the resplendent of\r\nSutasoma. Taking up another bow, he continued, O king, to pierce thy son.\r\nThen many warriors on thy side, accompanied by a large force, rushed\r\nimpetuously and surrounded thy son (for rescuing him).

Suvala's son\r\nin that encounter displayed the same measure of skill that Nakula\r\ndisplayed, O king, in shooting showers of arrows. Both pierced with\r\narrows, O king, in that battle, they looked beautiful like a couple of\r\nporcupines with quills erect on their bodies. The armour of each cut off\r\nby means of shafts with straight points and golden wings, and each bathed\r\nin blood, those two warriors looked resplendent in that dreadful battle\r\nlike two beautiful and brilliant Kalpa trees, or like two flowering\r\nKinsukas on the field of battle. Indeed, O king, those two heroes in that\r\nencounter, both pierced with arrows, looked beautiful like a couple of\r\nSalmali trees with prickly thorns on them. Casting oblique glances at\r\neach other, with eyes expanded in rage, whose corners had become red,\r\nthey seemed to scorch each other by those glances. Then thy\r\nbrother-in-law, excited with wrath, and smiling the while, pierced\r\nMadri's son in the chest with a barbed arrow of keen point. Deeply\r\npierced by that great bowman, viz., thy brother-in-law, Nakula sat down\r\non the terrace of his car and swooned away. Beholding his proud foe, that\r\nmortal enemy of his in that plight, Sakuni uttered a roar loud as that of\r\nthe clouds at the end of summer. Recovering consciousness, Nakula, the\r\nson of Pandu, once more rushed against Suvala's son, like the Destroyer\r\nhimself of wide-open mouth. Inflamed with rage, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nhe pierced Sakuni with sixty arrows, and more with a hundred long shafts\r\nat the centre of his chest. He then cut off Sakuni's bow with arrow fixed\r\nthereon, into two fragments, at the handle. And then cutting off in a\r\ntrice Sakuni's standard, he caused it to fall down on the earth. Piercing\r\nnext Sakuni's thigh with keen, sharp, and well-tempered shafts, Nakula,\r\nthe son of Pandu, caused him to fall down on the terrace of his car,\r\nclasping his flag-staff, like an amorous man clasping his mistress.\r\nBeholding that brother-in-law of thine laid low and deprived of\r\nconsciousness, O sinless one, his driver quickly bore him away from the\r\nvan of battle. The Parthas, then, and all their followers, uttered a loud\r\nroar. Having vanquished his foes, Nakula, that scorcher of foes,\r\naddressing his driver, said, 'Beat me to the host commanded by Drona.'\r\nHearing these words of Madri's son, his driver proceeded to the spot, O\r\nking, where Drona was stationed.[226] Against mighty Sikhandin proceeding\r\ntowards Drona, Kripa resolutely advanced with great impetuosity. That\r\nchastiser of foes, viz., Sikhandin, then, smiling the while, pierced with\r\nnine arrows the son of Gotama thus advancing against him towards the\r\nvicinity of Drona. Then the preceptor, Kripa, that benefactor of thy\r\nsons, piercing Sikhandin first with five arrows, once more pierced him\r\nwith twenty. The combat that took place, O monarch, between them, was\r\nexceedingly dreadful, like that between Samvara and the chief of the\r\ncelestials in the battle between the gods and the Asuras. Those heroic\r\nand mighty car-warriors, both invincible in battle, covered the welkin\r\nwith their arrows, like clouds covering the welkin on the expiry or\r\nsummer. Terrible of itself, that night, O chief of the Bharatas, became\r\nmore terrible still to the heroic combatants engaged in battle. Indeed,\r\nof terrible aspects and inspiring all sorts of fear, that night became,\r\nas it were, death-night (of all creatures). Then Sikhandin, O king, cut\r\noff, with a crescent-shaped arrow, the large bow of Gotama's son and shot\r\nat the latter many whetted shafts. Inflamed with wrath, O monarch, Kripa\r\nthen sped at his antagonist a fierce dart, equipped with a golden shaft\r\nand keen point, and polished by the hands of the smith. Sikhandin,\r\nhowever, cut it off with ten shafts as it coursed towards him. That dart,\r\nthen, decked with gold (thus cut off), fell down on the earth. Then\r\nGautama, foremost of men, taking up another bow, O king, covered\r\nSikhandin with a large number of whetted shafts. Thus covered in that\r\nbattle by the illustrious son of Gotama, Sikhandin, that foremost of\r\ncar-warriors sank on the terrace of his car. Beholding him thus weakened,\r\nKripa in that encounter, struck him with many arrows, from desire of\r\nslaying him, O Bharata! (Sikhandin then was borne away by his driver).\r\nBeholding that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Yajnasena retreating\r\nfrom battle, the Panchalas and the Somakas surrounded him on all sides\r\n(for rescuing him). Similarly, thy sons also surrounded that foremost of\r\nBrahmans, Kripa, with a large force. Then commenced a battle once more,\r\nbetween car-warriors, O king, that struck one another. The uproar that\r\nrose became loud as the roaring of clouds, O Bharata, caused by rushing\r\nhorsemen and elephants, O monarch, smiting one another down. Then, O\r\nking, the field of battle looked exceedingly fierce. With the tread of\r\nrushing infantry the earth began to tremble, O monarch, like a lady\r\nshaken with fear. Car-warriors, mounting on their cars, rushed\r\nimpetuously, attacking compeers by their thousands, O king, like crows\r\nseizing winged insects (in the air). Similarly, mighty elephants with\r\nwiny exudation down their bodies, pursuing similar elephants, encountered\r\nthem, O Bharata, furiously. So also, horsemen, coming upon horsemen, and\r\nfoot-soldiers angrily encountered one another in that battle. At dead of\r\nnight, the sound of retreating and the rushing of troops and of those\r\ncoming again to the encounter became deafening. The blazing lamps also,\r\nplaced on cars and elephants and steeds, seemed, O king, large meteors\r\nfalling from the firmament. That night, O chief of the Bharatas,\r\nlightened up by those lamps looked like day, O king, on the field of\r\nbattle. As the sun, encountering the thick gloom, destroys it completely,\r\neven so the thick gloom of the battle was destroyed by those blazing\r\nlamps. Indeed, the welkin, the earth, the cardinal and the subsidiary\r\npoints of the compass, enveloped by dust and darkness, became once more\r\nilluminated by that light. The splendour of weapons and coats of mail,\r\nand of the jewels of illustrious heroes, became overshadowed, by the\r\nlight of those blazing lamps. During the progress of that fierce battle\r\nat night, none of the combatants, O Bharata, could know the warriors of\r\nhis own side. Sire, O chief of the Bharatas, slew son, and son, from\r\nignorance, slew sire, and friend slew friend. And relatives slew\r\nrelatives, and maternal uncles slew sisters' sons, and warriors slew\r\nwarriors of their own side, and foes slew their own men, in that battle,\r\nO Bharata. In that dreadful nocturnal encounter, O king, all fought\r\nfuriously, ceasing to have any regard for one another.'\""

Beholding Drona, that foremost of preceptors, thus assailed, thy\r\nson, resolutely contending in battle, protected Drona on all sides.

And Drona's son pierced\r\nhim with five, and Drona himself with five, and Salya pierced him with\r\nnine, and Duhsasana with three. And Duryodhana pierced him with twenty\r\narrows and Sakuni with five. Indeed, all those mighty car-warriors\r\nquickly pierced the prince of the Panchalas. Thus was he pierced by these\r\nseven heroes in that battle exerting themselves for the rescue of Drona.\r\nThe prince of the Panchalas, however, pierced every one of these heroes\r\nwith three arrows. Indeed, O king, Dhrishtadyumna, in that dreadful\r\nbattle, quickly pierced Drona himself, and Karna, and Drona's son, and\r\nthy son. Thus pierced by that bowman, those warriors, fighting together,\r\npierced Dhrishtadyumna again in that encounter, uttering loud roars the\r\nwhile. Then Drumasena, excited with wrath, O king, pierced the Panchala\r\nprince with a winged arrow, and once again quickly with three other\r\narrows. And addressing the prince, he said, 'Wait! Wait!' Dhrishtadyumna\r\nthen pierced Drumasena in return with three straight arrows, in the\r\nencounter, which were equipped with wings of gold, steeped in oil, and\r\ncapable of taking the life of him at whom they are sped. With another\r\nbroad-headed shaft, the prince of the Panchalas then, in that battle, cut\r\noff from Drumasena's trunk the latter's head decked with bright ear-rings\r\nof gold. That head, with (the lower) lip bit (in rage), fell on the\r\nground like a ripe palmyra fruit separated from the stalk by the action\r\nof a strong wind. Once again, piercing all those warriors with keen\r\nshafts, that hero, with some broad-headed shafts, cut off the bow of\r\nRadha's son, that warrior conversant with all modes of warfare. Karna\r\ncould not book that cutting off of his bow, like a fierce lion incapable\r\nof brooking the cutting off of his tail. Taking up another bow, Karna,\r\nwith eyes red in rage, and breathing hard, covered mighty Dhrishtadyumna\r\nwith clouds of arrows. Beholding Karna excited with rage, those heroes,\r\nviz., those six bulls among car-warriors, quickly encompassed the prince\r\nof the Panchalas from desire of slaying him. Seeing the latter in front\r\nof those six foremost warriors of thy side, all thy troops, O lord,\r\nregarded him to be already within the jaws of the Destroyer. Meanwhile,\r\nSatyaki, of the Dasarha race, scattering his shafts as he proceeded,\r\nreached the spot where, the valiant Dhrishtadyumna was battling.\r\nBeholding that invincible warrior of the Satwata race advancing, Radha's\r\nson pierced him in that battle with ten arrows. Satyaki, then, O king,\r\npierced Karna with ten shafts in the very sight of all those heroes, and\r\naddressing him, said, 'Do not fly away but stay before me.' The encounter\r\nthen, that took place between mighty Satyaki and the industrious Karna,\r\nresembled, O king, that between Vali and Vasava (in the days of yore).\r\nThat bull among Kshatriyas, viz., Satyaki, terrifying all the Kshatriyas\r\nwith the rattle of his car, pierced the lotus-eyed Karna in return (with\r\nmany arrows). Making the earth tremble with the twang of his bow, the\r\nmighty son of the Suta, O monarch, contended with Satyaki. Indeed, Karna\r\npierced the grandson of Sini in return with hundreds of long, and barbed,\r\nand pointed, and tall-toothed, and razor-headed arrows and diverse other\r\nshafts. Similarly, that foremost one of Vrishni's race, Yuyudhana, in\r\nthat battle, shrouded Karna with his arrows. For a time that battle\r\nproceeded equally. Then thy son, O monarch, placing Karna at their head,\r\nall pierced Satyaki from every side with keen arrows. Resisting with his\r\nown weapons those of them all and of Karna also, O lord, Satyaki quickly\r\npierced Vrishasena in the centre of the chest. Pierced with that arrow,\r\nthe valiant Vrishasena, of great splendour, quickly fell down on his car,\r\ncasting aside his bow. Then Karna, believing that mighty car-warrior,\r\nviz., Vrishasena, slain, became scorched with grief on account of the\r\ndeath of his son and began to afflict Satyaki with great force. Thus\r\nafflicted by Karna, the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, with great speed,\r\nrepeatedly pierced Karna with many shafts. Once more piercing Karna with\r\nten arrows, and Vrishasena with five, the Satwata hero cut off the\r\nleathern fences and the bows of both sire and son. Then those two\r\nwarriors, stringing two other bows, capable of inspiring enemies with\r\nterror, began to pierce Yuyudhana from every side with keen shafts.\r\nDuring the progress of that fierce conflict that was so destructive of\r\nheroes the loud twang of Gandiva, O king, was heard over every other\r\nsound. Hearing then the rattle of Arjuna's car as also that twang of\r\nGandiva, the Suta's son, O king, said these words unto Duryodhana,\r\n'Slaughtering our entire army and the foremost of heroic warriors and\r\nmany mighty bowmen among the Kauravas, Arjuna is loudly twanging his bow.\r\nThe rattle also of his car is heard, resembling the roar of the thunder.\r\nIt's evident, the son of Pandu is achieving feats worthy of his own self\r\nThis son of Pritha, O monarch, will grind our large host. Many of our\r\ntroops are already breaking. No one stays in battle. Indeed, our army is\r\nbeing dispersed like a risen mass of clouds dispersed by the wind.\r\nEncountering Arjuna, our host breaks like a boat on the ocean. The loud\r\nwails, O king, of the foremost of warriors, O monarch, flying away from\r\nthe field, or falling down in consequence of the arrows sped from\r\nGandiva, are being heard. Hear, O tiger among car-warriors, the sound of\r\ndrums and cymbals near Arjuna's car at dead of night, resembling the deep\r\nroll of thunder in the welkin. Hear also the loud wails (of afflicted\r\ncombatants) and the tremendous leonine shouts, and diverse other noises\r\nin the vicinity of Arjuna's car. Here, however, this Satyaki, this\r\nforemost one of the Satwata race, stayeth amid us. If this object of our\r\naim can be struck down, we can then vanquish all our foes. Similarly, the\r\nson of the Panchala king is engaged with Drona. He is encompassed on all\r\nsides by many heroic and foremost of car-warriors. If we can slay Satyaki\r\nand Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata without doubt, O king, victory\r\nwill be ours. Surrounding these two heroes, these two mighty\r\ncar-warriors, as we did the son of Subhadra we will strive, O king, to\r\nslay them, viz., this son of Vrishni's race and this son of Prishata.\r\nSavyasachin, O Bharata, is before us, coming towards this division of\r\nDrona, knowing that Satyaki is engaged here with many chief among the\r\nKurus. Let a large number of our foremost of car-warriors proceed\r\nthither, so that Partha may not be able to come to the rescue of Satyaki,\r\nnow encompassed by many. Let these great heroes speedily shoot clouds of\r\nshafts with great force, so that Satyaki of Madhu's race may by speedily\r\ndespatched to Yama's abode.' Ascertaining this to be the opinion of\r\nKarna, thy son, addressing Suvala's son in the battle, like the\r\nillustrious Indra addressing Vishnu, said these words, Surrounded by ten\r\nthousand unretreating elephants and ten thousand cars also, proceed\r\nagainst Dhananjaya! Duhsasana and Durvishaha and Suvahu and\r\nDushpradharshana--these will follow thee, surrounded by a large number of\r\nfoot-soldiers. O uncle, slay those great bowmen, viz., the two Krishnas,\r\nand Yudhishtira, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhima, the son of Pandu My\r\nhope of victory resteth on thee, like that of the gods on their chief\r\nIndra. O uncle, slay the son of Kunti, like (Kartikeya) slaying the\r\nAsuras.' Thus addressed and urged by thy son, Sakuni, clad in mail,\r\nproceeded against the Parthas, accompanied by a large force as also by\r\nthy sons, in order to consume the sons of Pandu. Then commenced a great\r\nbattle between the warriors of thy army and the foe. When Suvala's son, O\r\nking, (thus) proceeded against the Pandavas, the Suta's son, accompanied\r\nby a large force, quickly advanced against Satyaki, shooting many\r\nhundreds of shafts. Indeed, thy warriors, combining together, encompassed\r\nSatyaki. Then Bharadwaja's son, proceeding against the car of\r\nDhrishtadyumna, fought a wonderful and fierce battle at dead of night, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, with the brave Dhrishtadyumna and the Panchalas.'\""

Mounting on their well-equipped cars, O\r\nking, that were decked with gold and jewels, and accompanied also by\r\ncavalry and elephants, they encompassed the Satwata hero. Hemming him on\r\nall sides those mighty car-warriors, challenging that hero, uttered loud\r\nleonine roars. Those great heroes, desirous of slaying him of Madhu's\r\nrace, poured their keen arrows on Satyaki of invincible prowess.\r\nBeholding them thus advancing with speed towards him, that slayer of\r\nhostile hosts, viz., the mighty-armed grandson of Sini, took up and shot\r\nmany shafts. The heroic and great bowman Satyaki, invincible in battle,\r\ncut off many heads with his fierce and straight arrows. And he of Madhu's\r\nrace also cut off the trunks of many elephants, the necks of many seeds,\r\nand arms decked with Angadas of many warriors, by means of razor-faced\r\narrows. With the fallen yak-tails and white umbrellas, O Bharata, the\r\nfield of battle became almost full, and resembled the firmament, O lord,\r\nwith stars. The wails of the host thus slaughtered in battle, O Bharata,\r\nby Yuyudhana, became as loud as those of shrieking ghosts (in hell). With\r\nthat loud uproar the earth became filled, and the night became fiercer\r\nand more terrible. Beholding his host, afflicted with Yuyudhana's arrows\r\nbreaking, and hearing that tremendous uproar at dead of night making the\r\nhair stand on end, thy son, that mighty car-warrior, addressing his\r\ndriver, repeatedly said, 'Urge the steeds to that spot whence this uproar\r\ncometh.' Then king Duryodhana, that firm bowman, above all modes of\r\nwarfare, rushed against Yuyudhana. Madhava pierced Duryodhana with a\r\ndozen blood-drinking shafts, sped from his bow drawn to its fullest\r\nstretch. Thus afflicted with arrows by Yuyudhana first, Duryodhana,\r\nexcited with rage, pierced the grandson of Sini in return with ten\r\narrows. Meanwhile, the battle that raged between the Panchalas and all\r\nthy troops presented an exceedingly wonderful sight. Then the grandson of\r\nSini, excited with rage in that battle, pierced thy son, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, with eighty shafts, in the chest. He then, with other\r\nshafts, despatched Duryodhana's steeds to Yama's abode. And that slayer\r\nof foes then quickly felled his antagonist's driver from the car. Thy\r\nson, O monarch, staying on that steedless car, shot many keen arrows\r\ntowards Satyaki's car. The grandson of Sini, however, displaying great\r\nlightness of hand, O king, cut off those fifty shafts sped in that battle\r\nby thy son. Then Madhava, with a broad-headed shafts suddenly cut off in\r\nthat encounter the formidable bow of thy son in the handle, Deprived of\r\nboth his car and bow, that puissant ruler of men then mounted quickly\r\nupon the bright car of Kritavarman. Upon Duryodhana's retreat, the\r\ngrandson of Sini, O monarch, afflicted and routed thy army at dead of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"Sakuni, meanwhile, O king, encompassing Arjuna on all sides with many\r\nthousands of cars and several thousands of elephants, and many thousands\r\nof steeds, began to fight desperately. Many of them hurled towards Arjuna\r\ncelestial weapons of great power. Indeed, those Kshatriyas fought with\r\nArjuna, incurring the certitude of death. Arjuna, however, excited with\r\nrage, checked those thousands of cars and elephants and steeds, and\r\nultimately caused those foes to turn back. Then Suvala's son, with eyes\r\nred as copper with rage, deeply pierced Arjuna, that slayer of foes, with\r\ntwenty shafts. And once more shooting a hundred shafts, he checked the\r\nprogress of Partha's great car. Then Arjuna, O Bharata, pierced Sakuni\r\nwith twenty arrows in that battle. And he pierced each of the great\r\nbowmen with three arrows. Checking all of them with his arrows, O king,\r\nDhananjaya slew those warriors of thy army with excellent shafts, endued\r\nwith the force of thunder.[227] Strewn with lopped off arrows, O monarch,\r\nand (dead) bodies by thousands, the earth looked as if covered with\r\nflowers. Indeed, strewn with the heads of Kshatriyas, heads that were\r\ndecked with diadems and handsome noses and beautiful ear-rings and\r\n(nether) lips bit in rage and wide open eyes,--heads that were graced\r\nwith collars and crowned also with gems, and which, while life was in\r\nthem, spoke sweet words,--the earth looked resplendent as if strewn with\r\nhillocks overspread with Champaka flowers. Having achieved that fierce\r\nfeat, and pierced Sakuni once more, struck Uluka with an arrow in that\r\nbattle. Piercing Uluka thus in the sight of his sire, viz., Suvala's son,\r\nArjuna uttered a loud roar, filling the earth therewith. Then the son of\r\nIndra cut off Sakuni's bow. And then he despatched his four steeds to\r\nYama's abode. Then Suvala's son, O bull of Bharata's race, jumping down\r\nfrom his car, quickly ascended the car of Uluka. Then those two mighty\r\ncar-warriors, viz., sire and son, both riding on the same car, showered\r\ntheir arrows on Partha like two risen clouds pouring torrents of rain on\r\na mountain. The son of Pandu then piercing both those warriors with keen\r\nshafts, afflicted and caused thy troops to fly away in hundreds and\r\nthousands. Like a mighty mass of clouds dispersed on all sides by the\r\nwind, that army of thine, O monarch, was dispersed on all sides. Indeed,\r\nthat host, O chief of the Bharatas, thus slaughtered on the night, fled\r\naway in all directions, afflicted with fear and in the very sight (of\r\ntheir leaders). Many abandoning the animals they rode, other urging their\r\nanimals to their greatest speed, turned back from the battle, inspired\r\nwith fear, during that fierce hour of darkness. Having vanquished thy\r\nwarriors thus, O bull of Bharata's race, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya\r\ncheerfully blew their conchs.\r\n\r\n\"Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, piercing Drona with three arrows, quickly cut\r\noff the latter's bowstring with a sharp arrow. Throwing down that bow on\r\nthe earth, heroic Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, took up another that\r\nwas exceedingly tough and strong. Piercing Dhrishtadyumna then with five\r\narrows, Drona pierced his driver also, O bull of Bharata's race, with\r\nfive arrows. Checking Drona with his arrows, the mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtadyumna began to destroy the Kaurava host, like Maghavat\r\ndestroying the Asura army. During the slaughter of thy son's army, O\r\nsire, a terrible river, having blood for its current, began to flow. And\r\nit ran between the two hosts, bearing away men and steeds and elephants\r\nalong its current. And it resembled, O king, the Vaitarani that flows, O\r\nlord, towards the domains of Yama. Agitating and routing thy army, the\r\nvaliant Dhrishtadyumna, endued with great energy, blazed forth like Sakra\r\nin the midst of the celestials. Then Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin blew\r\ntheir large conchs, as also the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and\r\nVrikodara, the son of Pandu. Thus those fierce warriors, vanquished\r\nthousands of kings; on thy side that were endued with great energy, at\r\nthe sight of thy Son and of Karna and the heroic Drona and Drona's son, O\r\nmonarch!'\""

You are beholding with indifference the slaughter of my army\r\nby the forces of the Pandavas, although you two are fully competent to\r\nvanquish those forces. If you two now abandon me, you should have, in the\r\nbeginning, told me of it, 'We two shall vanquish the sons of Pandu in\r\nbattle.' Even these were the words, ye givers of honours, that ye then\r\nsaid unto me. Hearing these words of yours, I sanctioned these\r\nproceedings. I would never have provoked these hostilities with the\r\nParthas,--hostilities that are so destructive of heroic combatants (if ye\r\nhad told me otherwise). If I do not deserve to be abandoned by you two,\r\nye bulls among men, then fight according to the true measure of your\r\nprowess, ye heroes endued with great prowess.' Thus pierced by the goad\r\nof speech of thy son, those two heroes once more engaged in battle, like\r\ntwo snakes vexed with sticks. Then those two foremost of car-warriors,\r\nthose two bowmen above all bowmen in the world, rushed with speed against\r\nthe Parthas headed by the grandson of Sini and by others. Similarly, the\r\nParthas uniting together, and accompanied by all their troops, advanced\r\nagainst those two heroes, who were roaring repeatedly. Then the great\r\nbowman, Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, excited with\r\nrage, quickly pierced (Satyaki), that bull amongst the Sinis, with ten\r\narrows. And Karna pierced him with ten arrows, and thy son with seven,\r\nand Vrishasena pierced him with ten, and Suvala's son with seven. In that\r\nimpervious wall of Kauravas around the grandson of Sini, these also\r\nstationed themselves, encompassing him. Beholding Drona slaughtering the\r\nPandava army in that battle, the Somakas quickly pierced him from every\r\nside with showers of arrows. Then Drona began to take the lives of\r\nKshatriyas, O monarch, like the sun destroying darkness around him by his\r\nrays. We then heard, O monarch, a loud uproar amongst the Panchalas, who\r\ncalled upon one another, while they were being slaughtered by Drona. Some\r\nabandoning sons, some sires, some brothers, some uncles, some their\r\nsister's sons, some their relatives and kinsmen, fled away with speed,\r\nfor saving their own lives. Some, again, deprived of their senses, ran\r\nagainst Drona himself. Indeed, many were the combatants of the Pandava\r\narmy that were then despatched to the other world. Thus afflicted by that\r\nillustrious hero, the Pandava host, that night, O king, fled away,\r\nthrowing down their blazing torches all around, in the very sight of\r\nBhimasena and Arjuna and Krishna and the twins and Yudhishthira and\r\nPrishata's son. The world being enveloped in darkness, nothing could be\r\nseen. In consequence of the light that was amongst the Katirava troops,\r\nthe flight of the foe could be ascertained. Those mighty car-warriors,\r\nviz., Drona and Karna, O king, pursued the flying host, scattering\r\nnumerous shafts. Seeing the Panchalas slaughtered and routed, Janardana\r\nbecoming cheerless, said these words unto Phalguna, 'Dhrishtadyumna and\r\nSatyaki, accompanied by the Panchalas, had proceeded against those great\r\nbowmen, viz., Drona and Karna, shooting many shafts. This large host of\r\nours hath been broken and routed (by them) with showers of arrows. Though\r\ntheir flight is sought to be checked, they are still incapable of being\r\nrallied, O son of Kunti!--Beholding the host fly away, through fear, ye\r\nPandava warriors, cast away your fears! Accompanied by all the forces and\r\narraying then, in good order, both of us, with uplifted weapons, are even\r\nnow proceeding against Drona and the Suta's son for withstanding them.'\r\nThen Janardana beholding Vrikodara advancing, once more addressed Arjuna,\r\nthe son of Pandu, as if for gladdening him, in these words, 'Yonder\r\nBhima, who taketh delight in battle, surrounded by the Somakas and the\r\nPandavas, is coming against those mighty car-warriors, viz., Drona and\r\nKarna. Supported by him, as also by the many mighty car-warriors among\r\nthe Pandavas, fight now, O son of Pandu, for assuring all your\r\ntroops.'[228] Then those two tigers among men, viz., the son of Pandu and\r\nhe of Madhu's race, approaching Drona and Karna, took up their station at\r\nthe head of battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Then that vast force of Yudhishthira once more\r\nreturned to battle, proceeding to the place where Drona and Karna were\r\ngrinding their foes in battle. At dead of night, a fierce encounter took\r\nplace, resembling that of two oceans swelling at moon-rise. Then the\r\nwarriors of thy army, throwing away from their hands the blazing lamps\r\nheld by them, fought with the Pandavas fearlessly and madly. On that\r\nterrible night when the world was enveloped with gloom and dust, the\r\ncombatants fought with one another, guided only by the names they\r\nuttered. The names uttered by the kings contending in battle, were heard,\r\nO monarch, there, like what happens, O king, at a Swayamvara or\r\nself-choice. Suddenly, a silence overspread the field of battle, and\r\nlasted for a moment. Then, again, a loud uproar was heard made by the\r\nangry combatants, victors and vanquished. Thither where blazing lamps\r\nwere seen, O bull of Kuru's race, thither rushed those heroes like\r\ninsects (towards a blazing fire). And as the Pandavas, O king, and the\r\nKauravas, contended with each other in battle, the darkness of night\r\nthickened around them.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Karna, that slayer of hostile heroes, beholding\r\nPrishata's son in battle, struck him on the chest with ten shafts capable\r\nof penetrating into the very vitals. Dhrishtadyumna quickly pierced Karna\r\nin return in that great battle, with five shafts, and addressing him,\r\nsaid, Wait! Wait!' Shrouding each other in that dreadful combat with\r\nshowers of arrows, O king, they once more pierced each other with keen\r\nshafts, sped from bows drawn to their fullest stretch. Then Karna, in\r\nthat battle, despatched to Yama's abode the driver and the four steeds or\r\nDhrishtadyumna, that foremost warrior among the Panchalas. He then cut\r\noff his enemy's foremost bow with keen arrows, and felled, with a\r\nbroad-headed shaft the latter's driver from his niche in the car. Then\r\nthe valiant Dhrishtadyumna, deprived of car, steeds, and driver, quickly\r\njumped down from his car and took up a mace. Though struck all the while\r\nwith straight shafts by Karna, the Panchala prince, approaching Karna,\r\nslew the four steeds of the latter. Turning back with great speed, that\r\nslayer of hosts, viz., the son of Prishata, quickly ascended the car of\r\nDhananjaya. Mounting upon that car, the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna\r\ndesired to proceed towards Karna. Dharma's son (Yudhishthira), however,\r\nbade him desist. Then Karna endued with great energy, mingling his\r\nleonine shouts with it twanged his bow loudly and blew his conch with\r\ngreat force. Beholding Prishata's son vanquished in battle, those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the Somakas, excited with rage, and\r\ntaking up all kinds of weapons, proceeded, making death itself their\r\ngoal, towards Karna, from desire of slaughtering him. Meanwhile, Karna's\r\ndriver had yoked other steeds unto his master's car, that were white as\r\nconchs, endued with great speed, of the Sindhu breed, and well-broken.\r\nThen Karna of sure aim, contending with vigour, afflicted those mighty\r\ncar-warriors among the Panchalas with his shafts like a cloud pouring\r\ntorrents of rain upon a mountain. The Panchala host, thus afflicted by\r\nKarna, fled away in fear, like a doe frightened by a lion. Horsemen were\r\nseen falling from their horses, and elephant-riders from their elephants,\r\nO monarch, and car-warriors from cars, all around. In that dreadful\r\nbattle, Karna cut off with razor-faced arrows the arms of flying\r\ncombatants and heads decked with car-rings. And he cut off, O king, the\r\nthighs of others that were on elephants or on the back of steeds, or on\r\nthe earth, O sire! Many mighty car-warriors, as they fled away, felt not\r\ntheir loss of limbs or the injury in their animals, in that battle.\r\nSlaughtered by terrible shafts, the Panchalas and the Srinjayas took the\r\nmotion of even a straw for Karna (so great was their fright). Deprived of\r\ntheir senses, the warriors took their flying friends for Karna and fled\r\naway from these in fear. Karna pursued the broken and retreating host, O\r\nBharata, shooting his shafts on all sides. Indeed, in that battle, the\r\nretreating warriors, deprived of their senses, were slaughtered with\r\nmighty weapons by that illustrious hero, Karna. Others, only looked at by\r\nDrona, fled away on all sides. Then king Yudhishthira, beholding his army\r\nflying away, and regarding retreat to be advisable, addressed Phalguna\r\nand said, 'Behold that mighty bowman, Karna stationed there like Rudra\r\nhimself armed with his bow. Behold him scorching everything around like\r\nthe blazing sun himself, at this fierce hour, this dead of night. These\r\nwails are being incessantly heard, O Partha, of thy helpless friends who\r\nare uttering them, mangled by the shafts of Karna. The manner in which\r\nKarna is aiming and letting off his shafts is such that no interval can\r\nbe noticed between the two acts. He will, O Partha, annihilate all our\r\nfriends. Do that now, Dhananjaya, about the slaughter of Karna, which,\r\naccording to thy judgment, should next be done and the time for which may\r\nhave come.' Thus addressed (by Yudhishthira), Partha said unto Krishna,\r\n'The royal son of Dharma is frightened today by the prowess of Karna.\r\nWhen Karna's division is thus acting (towards us) repeatedly, do thou\r\nspeedily adopt that course which should now be adopted. Our army is\r\nflying away, O slayer of Madhu, our troops, broken and mangled with\r\nDrona's shafts and frightened by Karna, are unable to make a stand. I see\r\nKarna careering fearlessly. Our foremost of car-warriors are flying away.\r\nKarna is scattering his keen shafts. I cannot, like a snake incapable of\r\nputting up with the tread of a human being upon its body, bear to see him\r\nthus careering at the head of battle, before my eyes, O tiger of\r\nVrishni's race. Proceed, therefore, to that spot where the mighty\r\ncar-warrior Karna is. I will either kill him, O slayer of Madhu, or let\r\nhim slay me.'[229]\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'I behold Karna, O son of Kunti, that tiger among men,\r\nthat warrior of superhuman prowess, careering in battle like the chief of\r\nthe celestials himself. O Dhananjaya, there is none else capable of\r\nadvancing against him in battle, save thee, O tiger among men, and the\r\nRakshasa Ghatotkacha. I do not, however, O sinless one, regard the time\r\nto have come, O mighty-armed one, for thee to encounter the Suta's son in\r\nbattle. The blazing dart, resembling a mighty meteor, given him by\r\nVasava, is still with him, O thou of mighty arms, kept for thee with\r\ncare, by the Suta's son. He keepeth that dart by him, and hath now\r\nassumed a terrible form. As regards Ghatotkacha, he is always devoted to\r\nyou and desirous of your good. Let the mighty Ghatotkacha proceed against\r\nthe son of Radha. Endued with the prowess of a celestial, he has been\r\nbegotten by the mighty Bhima. With him are celestial weapons as also\r\nthose used by Rakshasa. The latter soon came before him, clad in mail,\r\nand armed, O king, with sword arrow, and bow. Saluting Krishna and also\r\nDhananjaya, the son of Pandu, he proudly said, 'Here I am, command me.'\r\nThen he of Dasarha's race, addressed Hidimva's son, that Rakshasa of\r\nblazing mouth and fiery eyes and body of the hue of clouds, and said\r\nthese words, 'Listen, O Ghatotkacha, attend to what I say. The time is\r\ncome for the display of thy prowess, and not of anybody else. Be thou the\r\nraft in this battle to the sinking Pandavas. Thou hast diverse weapons,\r\nand many kinds of Rakshasa illusion. Behold, O son of Hidimva, the army\r\nof the Pandavas is being beaten by Karna on the field of battle, like a\r\nherd of kine by the herdsman. Yonder, the mighty bowman Karna, endued\r\nwith great intelligence and steady prowess, is scorching the foremost of\r\nKshatriyas among the divisions of the Pandava host. Afflicted by his\r\nfiery arrows, the Pandava warriors are incapable of standing in front of\r\nthat firm bowman who is shooting showers of mighty shafts. Afflicted at\r\ndead of night by the Suta's son with his arrowy showers, the Panchalas\r\nare flying away like a herd of deer afflicted by a loin. Except thee, O\r\nthou of terrible prowess, there is none else that can withstand the\r\nSuta's son who is thus engaged in battle. Aided by thy energy and might,\r\ndo thou, O mighty-armed one, accomplish that which is worthy of thy own\r\nself, of thy maternal race, and of thy sires. It is even for this, O son\r\nof Hidimva, that men desire children, viz., for being rescued from\r\ndifficulties. Do thou now rescue thy kinsmen. O Ghatotkacha, sires desire\r\nsons for achieving their own objects. Children, those sources of good,\r\nare expected to rescue their sires both here and hereafter. Illustrious\r\nthou art, and thy might in battle is terrible and unrivalled, while\r\ncontending in battle, there is none equal to thee. O scorcher of foes, be\r\nthou the means by which the Pandavas who are routed by Karna with his\r\nshafts this night, and who are now sinking in the Dhartarashtra ocean,\r\nmay safely reach the shore. At night, Rakshasas, again, become endued\r\nwith unlimited prowess, great might, and great courage. They become (at\r\nsuch an hour) warriors of great valour and incapable of defeat. Slay\r\nKarna in battle, at this dead of night, aided by thy illusions. The\r\nParthas, with Dhrishtadyumna, will dispose of Drona.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing those words of Kesava, Vibhatsu also, O\r\nKauravya, said these words unto that chastiser of foes, viz., the\r\nRakshasa Ghatotkacha, 'O Ghatotkacha, thyself, the long-armed Satyaki,\r\nand Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, these three, in my judgment, are the\r\nforemost ones among all our warriors. Go and encounter Karna in single\r\ncombat this night. The mighty car-warrior Satyaki will protect thy rear.\r\nAssisted by Satwata hero, slay brave Karna in battle, as Indra in days of\r\nold had slain (the Asura) Taraka, aided by (the celestial generalissimo)\r\nSkanda.'\r\n\r\n\"Ghatotkacha said, 'I am match for Karna, as also for Drona, O Bharata,\r\nor for any illustrious Kshatriya accomplished in weapons. This night I\r\nshall fight such a battle with the Suta's son as will form the subject of\r\ntalk as long as the world lasts. Tonight, I will spare neither the brave\r\nnor the timid nor those that will, with joined hands, pray for quarter.\r\nFollowing the Rakshasa usage, I shall slay all.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, Having said these words, that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes, viz., the son of Hidimva, rushed against Karna in that dreadful\r\nfight frightening thy troops. The Suta's son, that tiger among men,\r\nsmilingly received that angry warrior of blazing mouth and blazing locks.\r\nThe battle then that took place between Karna and that Rakshasa, both\r\nroaring against each other, O tiger among kings, resembled that between\r\nIndra and Prahlada (in days of yore).'"

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the mighty-armed Ghatotkacha, O king,\r\nproceeding towards the car of Suta's son, Karna for slaughtering him in\r\nbattle, thy son Duryodhana addressing Duhsasana, said these words, 'The\r\nRakshasa, seeing the prowess of Karna in battle, is speedily advancing\r\nagainst him. Resist that mighty car-warrior. Surrounded by a mighty force\r\nproceed to that spot where the mighty Karna, the son of Vikartana, is\r\ncontending with the Rakshasa in battle. O giver of honours, surrounded by\r\ntroops and exerting thyself vigorously, protect Karna in battle. Let not\r\nthe terrible Rakshasa slay Karna in consequence of our carelessness.\r\nMeanwhile, O king, Jatasura's mighty son, that foremost of smiters,\r\napproaching Duryodhana, said unto him, 'O Duryodhana, commanded by thee,\r\nI desire to slay, with their followers, thy foes of celebrity, viz., the\r\nPandavas, those warriors incapable of being easily defeated in battle. My\r\nfather was mighty Jatasura, that foremost of Rakshasa. Formerly, having\r\nperformed some Rakshasa slaying incantations, the despicable sons of\r\nPritha slew him. I desire to worship my dead sire by offering him the\r\nblood of his foes, and their flesh, O monarch! it behoveth thee to grant\r\nme permission.' The king, thus addressed, became exceedingly delighted\r\nand said unto him repeatedly, 'Aided by Drona and Karna and others, I am\r\nquite competent to vanquish my foes. Commanded, however, by me, O\r\nRakshasa, go thou to battle and slay Ghatotkacha in the fight--that\r\nRakshasa of fierce deeds, born of man, ever devoted to the welfare of the\r\nPandavas, and always slaying our elephants and steeds and car-warriors in\r\nbattle, himself all the while staying in the welkin, O, despatch him to\r\nYama's abode.' Saying, 'so be it,' and summoning Ghatotkacha to the\r\nfight, Jatasura's son shrouded the son of Bhimasena with diverse kinds of\r\nweapons. The son of Hidimva, however, alone and unsupported began, to\r\ngrind Alamvusha and Karna and the vast Kuru host, like the tempest\r\ncrushing a mass of clouds. Seeing then the power of (Ghatotkacha's)\r\nillusion, the Rakshasa Alamvusha covered Ghatotkacha with showers of\r\ndiverse kinds of arrows. Having pierced Bhimasena's son with many shafts,\r\nAlamvusha, without losing any time, began to afflict the Pandava host\r\nwith his arrows. Thus afflicted by him, O Bharata, the Pandava troops, at\r\ndead of night, broke and fled away like clouds dispersed by a tempest.\r\nSimilarly, thy host also, mingled with the shafts of Ghatotkacha, fled\r\naway at dead of night, O king, in thousands, throwing down their torches.\r\nAlamvusha then, excited with great wrath, struck Bhimasena's son in that\r\ndreadful battle with many shafts, like a driver striking an elephant.\r\nThen Ghatotkacha cut off into minute fragments the car, the driver, and\r\nall the weapons of his foe and laughed frightfully. Then, like the clouds\r\npouring torrents of rain on the mountains of Meru, Ghatotkacha poured\r\nshowers of arrows on Karna, Alamvusha and all the Kurus. Afflicted by the\r\nRakshasa, the Kuru host became exceedingly agitated. The four kinds of\r\nforces, of which thy army consisted, began to press and crush one\r\nanother. Then Jatasura's son, carless and driverless, wrathfully struck\r\nGhatotkacha, in that battle, with his fists. Thus struck, Ghatotkacha\r\ntrembled like a mountain with its trees and creepers and grass at the\r\ntime of an earthquake. Then Bhimasena's son, mad with rage, raising his\r\nown foe-slaying arm that resembled a spiked mace, dealt a severe blow on\r\nJatasura's son. Crushing him then in rage, Hidimva's son quickly threw\r\nhim down, and seizing him with his two arms he began to press him with\r\ngreat force upon the earth. Then Jatasura's son freeing himself from\r\nGhatotkacha, rose up and assailed Ghatotkacha with great impetuosity.\r\nAlamvusha also, dragging and throwing down the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, in\r\nthat battle, began to crush him in rage on the surface of the earth. The\r\nbattle then that took place between those two roaring and gigantic\r\nwarriors, viz., Ghatotkacha and Alamvusha, became exceedingly fierce and\r\nmade the hair stand on end. Endeavouring to prevail over each other by\r\nmeans of their powers of illusion, those two proud warriors, endued with\r\ngreat energy, fought with each other like Indra and Virochana's son.\r\nBecoming fire and ocean, and, once more, Garuda and Takshaka, and once\r\nagain, a cloud and a tempest, and then thunder and a large mountain, and\r\nonce again, an elephant and then Rahu and the sun, they thus displayed a\r\nhundred different kinds of illusion, solicitous of destroying each other.\r\nIndeed, Alamvusha and Ghatotkacha fought most wonderfully, striking each\r\nother with spiked clubs and maces and lances and mallets and axes and\r\nshort clubs and mountain-cliffs. Riding on horseback or on elephants, on\r\nfoot or on car, those foremost of Rakshasas, both endued with large\r\npowers of illusion, fought with each other in battle. Then Ghatotkacha, O\r\nking, desiring to slay Alamvusha, roared aloft in rage and then alighted\r\nwith great quickness like a hawk. Seizing then that gigantic prince of\r\nRakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, who thus struggled with him, he pressed him\r\ndown on the earth, like Vishnu slaying (the Asura) Maya in battle. Taking\r\na scimitar of wonderful appearance, Ghatotkacha, of immeasurable prowess,\r\nthen cut off from his trunk, O king, his fierce and mighty foe's terrible\r\nhead that was still uttering awful roars. Seizing that blood-dyed head by\r\nthe hair, Ghatotkacha quickly proceeded towards Duryodhana's car.\r\nApproaching (the Kuru king), the mighty-armed Rakshasa, smiling the\r\nwhile, threw upon Duryodhana's car that head with frightful face and\r\nhair. Uttering then a fierce roar, deep as that of the clouds in the\r\nseason of rains, he addressed Duryodhana, O king, and said, 'This thy\r\nally is now slain, he, that is, whose prowess thou hadst beheld! Thou\r\nshalt see the slaughter of Karna again, and then thy own. One that is\r\nobservant of these three, viz., morality, profit and pleasure, should\r\nnever see with empty hands a king, a Brahmana, or a woman.[230] Live\r\ncheerfully till that time when I slay Karna.' Having said these words, he\r\nthen, O king, proceeded towards Karna, shooting hundreds of keen arrows\r\nupon the head of Karna. The battle then that took place between that\r\nhuman warrior and that Rakshasa, was fierce and terrible, O king, and\r\nexceedingly wonderful.'\""

What aspect did that fierce Rakshasa then\r\npresent? What kind of car did he ride, and what was the nature of his\r\nsteeds and what of his weapons? What was the size of his steeds, of the\r\nstandard of his car, and of his bow? What was the kind of armour he wore,\r\nand what head-gear had he on? Asked by me, describe all this, for thou\r\nart skilled in narration, O Sanjaya!'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Of blood-red eyes, Ghatotkacha was of gigantic form. His\r\nface was of the hue of copper. His belly was low and sunken. The bristles\r\non his body all pointed upwards. His head was green. His ears were like\r\narrows. His cheek-bones were high. His mouth was large, extending from\r\near to ear. His teeth were keen, and four of these were high and pointed.\r\nHis tongue and lips were very long and of a coppery hue. His brows were\r\nlong-extending. His nose was thick. His body was blue, and neck red. Tall\r\nas a hill, he was terrible to behold. Of gigantic frame, gigantic arms,\r\nand gigantic head, he was endued with great might. Ugly and of hard\r\nlimbs, the hair on his head was tied upwards in a frightful shape. His\r\nhips were large and his navel was deep. Of gigantic frame, the\r\ncircumference of his body, however, was not great. The ornaments on his\r\narms were proportionate. Possessed of great powers of illusion, he was\r\ndecked also in Angadas. He wore a cuirass on his breast like a circle of\r\nfire on the breast of a mountain. On his head was a bright and beautiful\r\ndiadem made of gold, with every part proportionate and beautiful, and\r\nlooking like an arch. His ear-rings were bright as the morning sun, and\r\nhis garlands were made of gold and exceedingly bright. He had on his body\r\na gigantic armour of brass of great effulgence. His car was decked with a\r\nhundred tinkling bells, and on his standard waved numerous blood-red\r\nbanners. Of prodigious proportions, and of the measure of a nalwa, that\r\ncar was covered with bear-skins. Equipped with all kinds of mighty\r\nweapons, it possessed a tall standard and was adorned with garlands,\r\nhaving eight wheels, and its clatter resembled the roar of the clouds.\r\nHis steeds were like infuriated elephants, and possessed of red eyes; of\r\nterrible aspect, they were variegated in hue, and endued with great speed\r\nand might. Above all fatigue, and adorned with long manes and neighing\r\nrepeatedly, they bore that hero to battle. A Rakshasa of terrible eyes,\r\nfiery mouth, and blazing ear-rings, acted as his driver, holding the\r\nreins, bright as the rays of the sun, of his steeds in battle. With that\r\ndriver he came to battle like Surya with his driver Aruna. Looking like a\r\nhigh mountain encircled with a mighty cloud, a very tall standard, that\r\ntouched the heavens, was set up on his car. A carnivorous and awful\r\nvulture of blood-red body perched on it. He came, forcibly drawing his\r\nbow whose twang resembled the thunder of Indra, and whose string was very\r\nhard, and which measured a dozen cubits in length and one cubit in\r\nbreadth.[231] Filling all the points of the compass with shafts of the\r\nmeasure of the Aksha of a car, the Rakshasa rushed against Karna on that\r\nnight that was so destructive of heroes. Staying proudly on his car, as\r\nhe stretched his bow, the twang that was heard resembled that sound of\r\nthe roaring thunder. Frightened by him, O Bharata, all thy troops\r\ntrembled like the surging waves of the ocean. Beholding that frightful\r\nRakshasa of horrible eyes advancing against him, Radha's son, as if\r\nsmiling, withstood him speedily. And Karna proceeded against the smiling\r\nRakshasa, smiting him in return from a near point, like an elephant\r\nagainst an elephant or the leader of a bovine herd against the leader of\r\nanother herd. The collision that took place between them, i.e., Karna and\r\nthe Rakshasa, O king, became terrible and resembled that between Indra\r\nand Samvara. Each taking a formidable bow of loud twang, struck and\r\ncovered the other with powerful shafts. With straight shafts sped from\r\nbows drawn to their fullest stretch, they mangled each other, piercing\r\ntheir coats of mail made of brass. With darts of the measure of Akshas,\r\nand shafts also they continued to mangle each other, like a couple of\r\ntigers or of mighty elephants with their teeth or tusks. Piercing each\r\nother's body, aiming shafts at each other, scorching each other with\r\nclouds of arrows, they became incapable of being gazed at. With limbs\r\npierced and mangled with shafts, and bathed in streams of blood, they\r\nlooked like two hills of chalk with rivulets running down their breasts.\r\nThose two mighty car-warriors, both struggling vigorously, both with\r\nlimbs pierced with keen-pointed shafts, and each mangling the other,\r\nfailed, however to make each other tremble For a long time, that\r\nnocturnal combat between Karna and the Rakshasas in which both seemed to\r\nsport, making life itself the stake, continued equally. Aiming keen\r\nshafts and shooting them to the utmost measure of his might, the twang of\r\nGhatotkacha's bow inspired both friends and foes with fear.[232] At that\r\ntime, O king, Karna could not prevail over Ghatotkacha. Seeing this, that\r\nforemost of all persons acquainted with weapons, invoked into existence\r\ncelestial weapons. Beholding a celestial weapon aimed at him by Karna,\r\nGhatotkacha, that foremost of Rakshasas invoked into existence his\r\nRakshasa illusion. He was seen surrounded by a large force of\r\nterrible-looking Rakshasas, armed with lances, large rocks and hills and\r\nclubs.[233] Beholding Ghatotkacha advancing with a mighty weapon uplifted\r\n(in his hands) like unto the Destroyer himself of all creatures armed\r\nwith his fierce and fatal club, all the kings there were struck with\r\nfear. Terrified at the leonine roars uttered by Ghatotkacha, the\r\nelephants passed urine all the combatants trembled with fear. Then there\r\nfell on all sides a thick rain of rocks and stones poured incessantly by\r\nthe Rakshasas, who had, in consequence of midnight, became inspired with\r\ngreater strength.[234] Iron wheels and Bhusundis, and darts, and lances\r\nand spears and Sataghnis and axes also began to fall incessantly.\r\nBeholding that fierce and terrible battle, all the kings, as also thy\r\nsons and the combatants, fled away in fear. Only one amongst them, viz.,\r\nKarna, proud of the power of his weapons, and feeling a noble pride,\r\ntrembled not. Indeed, with his shafts he destroyed that illusion invoked\r\ninto existence by Ghatotkacha. Beholding his illusion dispelled,\r\nGhatotkacha, filled with rage began to shoot deadly shafts from desire of\r\nslaying the Suta's son. Those shafts, bathed in blood, piercing through\r\nKarna's body in that dreadful battle, entered the earth like angry\r\nsnakes. Then the valiant son of the Suta, filled with rage and possessed\r\nof great lightness of hands, prevailing over Ghatotkacha, pierced the\r\nlatter with ten shafts. Then Ghatotkacha, thus pierced by the Suta's son\r\nin his vital parts and feeling great pain, took up a celestial wheel\r\nhaving a thousand radii. The edge of that wheel was sharp as a razor.\r\nPossessed of the splendour of the morning sun, and decked with jewels and\r\ngems, Bhimasena's son hurled that wheel at the son of Adhiratha, desirous\r\nof making an end of the latter. That wheel, however, of great power and\r\nhurled also with great might, was cut off into pieces by Karna with his\r\nshafts, and fell down, baffled of its object, like the hopes and purposes\r\nof an unfortunate man. Filled with rage upon beholding his wheel baffled,\r\nGhatotkacha covered Karna with showers of shafts, like Rahu covering the\r\nsun. The Suta's son, however, endued with the prowess of Rudra or of\r\nIndra's younger brother or of Indra, fearlessly shrouded Ghatotkacha's\r\ncar in a moment with winged arrows. Then Ghatotkacha, whirling a\r\ngold-decked mace, hurled it at Karna. Karna, however, with his shafts,\r\ncutting it off, caused it to fall down. Then soaring into the sky and\r\nroaring deep like a mass of clouds, the gigantic Rakshasa poured from the\r\nwelkin a perfect shower of trees. Then Karna pierced with his shafts\r\nBhima's son in the sky, that Rakshasa acquainted with illusions, like the\r\nsun piercing with his rays a mass of clouds. Slaying then all the steeds\r\nof Ghatotkacha, and cutting also his car into a hundred pieces, Karna\r\nbegan to pour upon him his arrows like a cloud pouring torrents of rain.\r\nOn Ghatotkacha's body there was not even two finger's breadth of space\r\nthat was not pierced with Karna's shafts. Soon the Rakshasa seemed to be\r\nlike a porcupine with quills erect on his body. So completely was he\r\nshrouded with shafts that we could not in that battle, any longer see\r\neither the steeds or the car or the standard of Ghatotkacha or\r\nGhatotkacha himself. Destroying then by his own weapon, the celestial\r\nweapon of Karna, Ghatotkacha, endued with the power of illusion, began to\r\nfight with the Suta's son, aided by his powers of illusion. Indeed, he\r\nbegan to fight with Karna, aided by his illusion and displaying the\r\ngreatest activity. Showers of shafts fell from an invisible source from\r\nthe welkin. Then Bhimasena's son, endued with great prowess of illusion,\r\nO foremost of the Kurus, assumed a fierce from, aided by those powers,\r\nbegan to stupefy the Kauravas, O Bharata! The valiant Rakshasa, assuming\r\nmany fierce and grim heads, began to devour the celestial weapons of the\r\nSuta's son. Soon again, the gigantic Rakshasa, with a hundred wounds on\r\nhis body seemed to lie cheerlessly, as if dead, on the field. The Kaurava\r\nbulls then, regarding Ghatotkacha deed, uttered loud shouts (of joy).\r\nSoon, however, he was seen on all sides, careering in new forms. Once\r\nmore, he was seen to assume a prodigious form, with a hundred heads and a\r\nhundred stomachs, and looking like the Mainaka mountain.[235] Once again,\r\nbecoming small about the measure of the thumb, he moved about\r\ntransversely or soared aloft like the swelling surges of the sea. Tearing\r\nthrough the earth and rising on the surface, he dived again into the\r\nwaters. Once seen here, he was next seen at a different place. Descending\r\nthen from the welkin, he was seen standing, clad in mail, on a car decked\r\nwith gold, having wandered through earth and sky and all the points of\r\nthe compass, aided by his powers of illusion. Approaching then the\r\nvicinity of Karna's car, Ghatotkacha, with his ear-rings waving,\r\nfearlessly addressed the Suta's son, O monarch, and said, 'Wait a little,\r\nO Suta's son. Whither shalt thou go with life, avoiding me. I shall\r\ntoday, on the field of battle, quell thy desire of fight.' Having said\r\nthose words, that Rakshasas, of cruel prowess and eyes red like copper in\r\nwrath, soared aloft into the sky and laughed aloud. Like a lion smiting a\r\nprince of elephants, he began to strike Karna, pouring upon him a shower\r\nof shafts, each of the measure the Aksha, of a car. Indeed, he poured\r\nthat arrowy shower upon Karna, that bull among car-warriors, like a cloud\r\npouring torrents of rain on a mountain, Karna destroyed that shower of\r\narrows from a distance. Beholding his illusion destroyed by Karna, O bull\r\nof Bharata's race, Ghatotkacha once more created an illusion and made\r\nhimself invisible. He became a high mountain with many summits and\r\nabounding with tall trees. And from that mountain incessantly issued\r\nstreams of lances and spears and swords and clubs. Seeing that mountain,\r\nwhich resembled a mighty mass of antimony, with its streams of fierce\r\nweapons, on the welkin, Karna was not at all agitated. Smiling the while,\r\nKarna invoked into existence a celestial weapon. Cut off with that\r\nweapon, that huge mountain was destroyed. Then he fierce Ghatotkacha,\r\nbecoming a blue cloud with a rainbow, in the welkin, began to pour upon\r\nthe Suta's son a shower of stones. Vikartana's son, Karna, who was called\r\nalso Vrisha, that foremost of all persons acquainted with weapons, aiming\r\na Vayavya weapon, destroyed that dart-cloud. Then covering all the points\r\nof the compass with innumerable shafts, he destroyed a weapon that had\r\nbeen aimed at him by Ghatotkacha. The mighty son of Bhimasena then\r\nlaughing loudly in that battle, once more invoked into existence an\r\nall-powerful illusion against the mighty car-warrior Karna. Once more\r\nbeholding that foremost of warriors, viz., Ghatotkacha, fearlessly\r\napproaching him, surrounded by a large number of Rakshasas that resembled\r\nlions and tigers and infuriated elephants in prowess, some riding on\r\nelephants, some on cars, and some on horseback, all armed with diverse\r\nweapons and clad in diverse kinds of mail and diverse kinds of ornaments;\r\nin fact, beholding Ghatotkacha surrounded by those fierce Rakshasas like\r\nVasava by the Maruts, the mighty bowman Karna began to battle with him\r\nfiercely. Then Ghatotkacha piercing Karna with five shafts, uttered a\r\nterrible roar frightening all the kings. Once more shooting an Anjalika\r\nweapon, Ghatotkacha quickly cut off the bow of Karna's hand along with\r\nthe arrowy shower the latter had shot. Karna then taking out another bow\r\nthat was strong and capable of bearing a great strain and that was as\r\nlarge as Indra's bow, drew it with great force. Then Karna shot some\r\nfoe-slaying shafts of golden wings at those sky-ranging Rakshasas.\r\nAfflicted with those shafts, the large foes of broad chested Rakshasas\r\nlooked agitated like a herd of wild elephants afflicted by a lion.\r\nDestroying with his shafts those Rakshasas along with their steeds and\r\ndiverse elephants, the puissant Karna looked like the divine Agni\r\nconsuming all creatures at the time of the universal dissolution. Having\r\ndestroyed that Rakshasa host, the Suta's son looked resplendent like the\r\ngod Maheswara in heaven after having consumed the triple city (of the\r\nAsuras). Among those thousands of kings on the Pandava side, O sire,\r\nthere was not a single one, O monarch, that could even look at Karna\r\nthen, save the mighty Ghatotkacha, that prince of Rakshasas, who was\r\nendued with terrible energy and strength, and who, inflamed with rage,\r\nthen looked like Yama himself. From his eyes, as he was excited with\r\nwrath, flames of fire seemed to emit, like blazing drops of oil from a\r\ncouple of burning brands. Striking his palm against palm and biting his\r\nnether lip, the Rakshasa was once more seen on a car that had been\r\ncreated by his illusion, and unto which were yoked a number of asses,\r\nlooking like elephants and having the faces of Pisachas. Excited with\r\nwrath, he addressed his driver, saying, 'Bear me towards the Suta's son.'\r\nThen that foremost of car-warriors proceeded on that terrible-looking car\r\nof his, for once more fighting a single combat with the Suta's son, O\r\nking! The Rakshasa, excited with rage, hurled at the Suta's son an Asani\r\nof Rudra's workmanship, terrible and furnished with eight wheels. Karna,\r\nplacing his bow on his car, jumped down on the earth and seizing that\r\nAsani hurled it back at Ghatotkacha. The latter, however, had quickly\r\ndescended from his car (before the weapon could reach it). The Asani,\r\nmeanwhile, of great effulgence, having reduced the Raksha's car to ashes,\r\nwith it steeds, driver, and standard, piercing through the earth,\r\ndisappeared within its bowels, at which the gods were filled with wonder.\r\nThen all creatures applauded Karna, who, having jumped down from his car,\r\nhad seized that Asani. Having achieved that feat, Karna once more\r\nascended his car. The Suta's sort, that scorcher of foes, then began to\r\nshoot his shafts. Indeed, O giver of honours, there is none else amongst\r\nall living creatures who can accomplish what Karna accomplished in that\r\nfrightful battle. Struck by Karna with shafts like a mountain with\r\ntorrents of rain, Ghatotkacha once more disappeared from the field of\r\nbattle like the melting forms of vapour in the sky. Contending in this\r\nway, the gigantic Rakshasa, that slayer of foes, destroyed the celestial\r\nweapons of Karna by means of his activity as also his power of illusion.\r\nSeeing his weapons destroyed by the Rakshasa, aided by his powers of\r\nillusion, Karna, without being inspired with fear, continued to fight\r\nwith the cannibal. Then, O monarch, the mighty son of Bhimasena excited\r\nwith wrath, divided his own self into many parts, frightening all the\r\nmighty car-warriors (of the Kuru army). Then there came on the field of\r\nbattle lions, and tigers, and hyenas, and snakes with fiery tongues, and\r\nbirds with iron beaks. As regards Ghatotkacha. himself, struck with the\r\nkeen arrows that were sped from Karna's bow, that huge Rakshasa, looking\r\nlike (Himavat) the prince of mountains, disappeared then and there. Then\r\nmany Rakshasas and Pisachas and Yatudhanas, and large numbers of wolves\r\nand leopards, of frightful faces rushed towards Karna for devouring him.\r\nThese approached the Suta's son, uttering fierce howls for frightening\r\nhim. Karna pierced every one of those monsters with many swift-winged and\r\nterrible shafts that drank their blood. At last, using a celestial\r\nweapon, he destroyed that illusion of the Rakshasa. He then, with some\r\nstraight and fierce shafts, struck the steeds of Ghatotkacha. These, with\r\nbroken and maimed limbs, and their backs cut by those shafts, fell down\r\non the earth, in the very sight of Ghatotkacha. The son of Hidimva,\r\nseeing his illusion dispelled, once more made himself invisible, saying\r\nunto Karna, the son of Vikartana, 'I will presently compass thy\r\ndestruction.'\""

Learning now that a nocturnal battle was raging, he came,\r\nimpelled by the desire of slaying Bhima in fight, like an infuriated\r\nelephant or an angry snake. Desirous of battle, he addressed Duryodhana\r\nand said, 'It is known to thee, how my kinsmen, the Rakshasa Vaka and\r\nKirmira and Hidimva have been slain by Bhima. What shall I say more, the\r\nvirgin Hidimva was formerly deflowered by him, disregarding us and the\r\nother Rakshasas. I am here, O king, to slay that Bhima with all his\r\nfollowers, steeds, cars, and elephants, as also that son of Hidimva with\r\nfriends. Slaying today all the sons of Kunti, Vasudeva and others that\r\nwalk before them, I will devour them with all their followers. Command\r\nall thy troops to desist from battle. We will fight with the Pandavas.'\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of his, Duryodhana became very glad. Surrounded by\r\nhis brothers, the king, accepting the words of the Rakshasa, said,\r\n'Placing thee with thine in the van, we will fight the foe. My troops\r\nwill not stand as indifferent spectators since their enmity has not\r\ncooled.' That bull amongst Rakshasa, saying, 'Let it be so,' unto the\r\nking, speedily proceeded against Bhima, accompanied by his cannibal\r\nforce. Endued with a blazing form, Alayudha rode a car bright like the\r\nsun. Indeed, O monarch, that car of his was similar to Ghatotkacha's car.\r\nThe rattle also of Alayudha's car was as deep as that of Ghatotkacha's,\r\nand it was decked with many arches. That large car was covered with\r\nbear-skins, and its measure was a nalwa. His steeds, like those of\r\nGhatotkacha, were endued with great speed, resembled elephants in shape,\r\nand had the voice of asses. Subsisting on flesh and blood and gigantic in\r\nsize, a hundred of them were yoked unto his vehicle. Indeed, the rattle\r\nof his car, like that of his rival, was loud and strong, and its string\r\nwas as hard. His shafts also, winged with gold and whetted on stone, were\r\nas large as Ghatotkacha's, being of the measure of Akshas. The heroic\r\nAlayudha was as mighty-armed as Ghatotkacha, and the standard of his car,\r\nendued with the splendour of the sun or fire, was, like Ghatotkacha's,\r\npierced upon by vultures and ravens. In form, he was more handsome than\r\nGhatotkacha, and his face, agitated (with wrath) looked blazing. With\r\nblazing Angadas and blazing diadem and garlands, decked with floral\r\nwreaths and headgear and sword armed with mace and Bhushundis and short\r\nclubs and ploughs and bows and arrows, and with skin black and hard as\r\nthat of the elephant, riding on that car possessed of the splendour of\r\nfire, he looked, while employed in afflicting and routing the Pandava\r\nhost, like a roving cloud in the welkin, decked with flashes of lighting.\r\n(As Alayudha came to battle), the principal kings of the Pandava army\r\nendued with great might, and armed with (sword and) shield, and clad in\r\nmail, engaged in fight, O king, with joyous hearts.'\""

Similarly, thy sons having\r\nDuryodhana for their head, (were filled with delight) like raftless men\r\ndesirous of crossing the ocean when they meet with a raft. Indeed, the\r\nIcings in the Kuru army then regarded themselves as persons reborn after\r\ndeath.[236] They all offered a respectful welcome to Alayudha, During the\r\nprogress of that terrible and superhuman battle between Karna and the\r\nRakshasa at night,--a battle which though fierce was yet delightful to\r\nbehold,--the Panchalas, with all the other Kshatriyas, smilingly looked\r\non as spectators. Meanwhile, thy soldiers, O king, though protected (by\r\ntheir leaders) all over the field and Drona and Drona's son and Kripa and\r\nothers, uttered loud wails, saying, 'All is lost!' Indeed, beholding\r\nthose feats of Hidimva's son on the field of battle, all thy warriors\r\nwere agitated with fear, and uttering cries of woe became almost deprived\r\nof their senses. Thy troops, O king, became hopeless of Karna's life.\r\nThen Duryodhana, beholding Karna fallen into great distress, summoned\r\nAlayudha and said unto him, 'Yonder Vikartana's son, Karna, is engaged\r\nwith the son of Hidimva, and is accomplishing such feats in battle as are\r\nworthy of his might and prowess. Behold those brave kings slain by the\r\nson of Bhimasena, struck with diverse kinds of weapons (and lying on the\r\nfield) like trees broken by an elephant. Amongst all my royal warriors,\r\nlet this be thy share in battle, allotted by me, with thy permission, O\r\nhero, displaying thy prowess, slay thou this Rakshasa. O crusher of foes,\r\nsee that this wretch viz., Ghatotkacha, may not, relying on his powers of\r\nillusion, slay Karna, the son of Vikarana, before thou finishest him.'\r\nThus addressed by the king, that Rakshasa of fierce prowess and mighty\r\narms, saying, 'So be it,' rushed against Ghatotkacha. Then Bhimasena's\r\nson, O lord, abandoning Karna, began to grind his advancing foe with\r\narrows. The battle that took place then between those angry Rakshasa\r\nprinces, resembled that between two infuriated elephants in the forest,\r\nfighting for the sake of the same she-elephant in her season. Freed then\r\nfrom the Rakshasa, Karna, that foremost of car-warriors, rushed against\r\nBhimasena, riding on his car of solar effulgence. Beholding Ghatotkacha\r\nengaged with Alayudha in battle and afflicted like the leader of a bovine\r\nherd when engaged with a lion, Bhima, that foremost of smiters,\r\ndisregarding the advancing Karna, rushed towards Alayudha, riding on his\r\ncar of solar effulgence and scattering clouds of shafts. Seeing Bhima\r\nadvance, Alayudha, O lord, abandoning Ghatotkacha, proceeded against\r\nBhima himself. Then Bhima, that exterminator of Rakshasas, impetuously\r\nrushed towards him, O lord, and covered that prince of the Rakshasas with\r\nshafts. Similarly, Alayudha, that chastiser of foes, repeatedly covered\r\nthe son of Kunti with straight shafts whetted on stone. All the other\r\nRakshasas also, of terrible forms and armed with diverse weapons\r\nsolicitous for the victory of thy sons, rushed against Bhimasena. The\r\nmighty Bhimasena, thus assailed by them, pierced each of them with five\r\nwhetted shafts. Then those Rakshasas of wicked understanding, thus\r\nreceived by Bhimasena, uttered loud wails and fled away on all sides. The\r\nmighty Rakshasa, beholding his followers frightened by Bhima, rushed\r\nimpetuously against Bhima and covered him with shafts. Then Bhimasena, in\r\nthat battle, weakened his foe by means of many keen-pointed arrows.\r\nAmongst those arrows sped at him by Bhima, Alayudha speedily cut off some\r\nand seized others in that battle. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, looking\r\nsteadily at that prince of the Rakshasas, hurled at him with great force\r\na mace endued with the impetuosity of thunder. That mace, coursed towards\r\nhim like a flame of fire, and the cannibal struck it with a mace of his\r\nown, where-upon the latter (baffling the former) proceeded towards Bhima.\r\nThen, the son of Kunti covered that prince of Rakshasas, with showers of\r\nshafts. The Rakshasa, with his own keen shafts, baffled all those shafts\r\nof Bhima. Then all those Rakshasa warriors, of terrible forms, rallying\r\nand returning to battle, at the command of their leader, began to slay\r\nthe elephants (of Bhima's force). The Panchalas and the Srinjayas, the\r\nsteeds and huge elephants (of Bhima's army), exceedingly afflicted by the\r\nRakshasas, became much agitated. Beholding that terrible battle (fought\r\nbetween Bhima and the Rakshasa), Vasudeva, that foremost of men\r\naddressing Dhananjaya, said these words, 'Behold, the mighty-armed Bhima\r\nis succumbing to that prince of Rakshasas. Quickly proceed in Bhima's\r\nwake, without thinking of anything else, O son of Pandu. Meanwhile, let\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin, and Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, these mighty\r\ncar-warriors, uniting with the son of Draupadi, proceed against Karna.\r\nLet Nakula and Sahadeva and the valiant Yuyudhana, O son of Pandu, at thy\r\ncommand, slay the other Rakshasas! As regards thyself, O mighty armed\r\none, do thou resist this division having Drona at its head. O thou of\r\nmighty arms, great is the danger that threatens us now.' After Krishna\r\nhad said so, those foremost of car-warriors, as commanded, proceeded\r\nagainst Karna, the son of Vikartana, and against the other Rakshasas\r\n(fighting for the Kurus). Then with some shafts resembling snakes of\r\nvirulent poison and sped from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, the\r\nvaliant prince of the Rakshasas cut off Bhima's bow. The mighty cannibal\r\nnext, in the very sight of Bhima, O Bharata, slew the latter's steeds and\r\ndriver with some whetted shafts. Steedless and driverless, Bhima,\r\ndescending from the terrace of his car, uttered a loud roar and hurled a\r\nheavy mace at his foe. That heavy mace, as it coursed impetuously towards\r\nhim with a terrible sound, the mighty cannibal baffled with a mace of his\r\nown. The latter then uttered a loud roar. Beholding that mighty and\r\nterrible feat of that prince of Rakshasas, Bhimasena filled with joy,\r\nseized another fierce mace. The battle then that took place between that\r\nhuman warrior and that Rakshasa, became dreadful. With the clash of their\r\ndescending maces, the earth trembled violently. Casting aside their\r\nmaces, they once more encountered each other. They struck each other with\r\ntheir clenched fists, failing with the sound of thunder. Excited with\r\nrage, they encountered each other with car-wheels, and yokes, and Akshas\r\nand Adhishthanas, and Upaskaras, in fact, with anything that came in\r\ntheir way. Encountering each other thus and both covered with blood, they\r\nlooked like a couple of infuriated elephants of gigantic size. Then,\r\nHrishikesa, ever devoted to the good of the Pandavas, beholding that\r\ncombat, despatched Hidimva's son for protecting Bhimasena.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Seeing Bhima in that battle assailed by the cannibal,\r\nVasudeva, approaching Ghatotkacha, said unto him these words, 'Behold, O\r\nmighty-armed one, Bhima is violently assailed by the Rakshasa in battle,\r\nin the very sight of all the troops and of thyself, O thou of great\r\nsplendour! Abandoning Karna for the present, quickly slay Alayudha, O\r\nmighty armed one! Thou can afterwards slay Karna.' Hearing these words of\r\nhim of Vrishni's race, the valiant Ghatotkacha, abandoning Karna,\r\nencountered Alayudha, that prince of cannibals and brother of Vaka. The\r\nbattle then that took place at night between those two cannibals, viz.,\r\nAlayudha and the son of Hidimva became fierce and dreadful, O Bharata.\r\nMeanwhile, the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, and Nakula, and Sahadeva,\r\npierced with keen shafts the warriors of Alayudha, those terrible-looking\r\nand heroic Rakshasas, armed with bows. The diadem-decked Vibhatsu, O\r\nking, in that battle, shooting his arrows on all sides, began to\r\noverthrow many foremost of Kshatriyas. Meanwhile, Karna, O king, in that\r\nbattle agitated many kings and many mighty car-warriors amongst the\r\nPanchalas headed by Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and others. Beholding\r\nthem slaughtered (by Karna), Bhima, of terrible prowess, rushed speedily\r\ntowards Karna, shooting his shafts in that battle. Then those warriors\r\nalso, viz., Nakula and Sahadeva and the mighty car-warrior,\r\n\r\nSatyaki, having slain the Rakshasas, proceeded to that place where the\r\nSuta's son was. All of them, then, began to fight with Karna, while the\r\nPanchalas encountered Drona. Then Alayudha, excited with rage, struck\r\nGhatotkacha, that chastiser of foes, on the head, with a gigantic\r\nParigha. With the stroke of that Parigha, the mighty son of Bhimasena,\r\nendued with great prowess, seemed to be in a state of partial swoon and\r\nsat down motionless. Recovering consciousness, the latter, then, in that\r\nencounter, hurled at his foe a gold-decked mace adorned with a hundred\r\nbells and looking like a blazing fire. Hurled forcibly by that achiever\r\nof fierce feats, that mace crushed into pieces the steeds, the driver,\r\nand the loud-rattling car of Alayudha. Having recourse to illusion, the\r\nlatter, then, jumped down from that car of his, whose steeds and wheels\r\nand Akshas and standard and Kuvara had all been crushed into pieces.\r\nRelying on his illusion, he poured a copious shower of blood. The sky\r\nthen seemed to be overspread with a mass of black clouds adorned with\r\nflashes of lightning. A thunder-storm was then heard, accompanied with\r\nloud reports and loud roars of clouds. Loud sounds also of chat, chat,\r\nwere heard in that dreadful battle. Beholding that illusion created by\r\nthe Rakshasa Alayudha, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, soaring aloft, destroyed\r\nit by means of his own illusion. Alayudha, beholding his own illusion\r\ndestroyed by that of his foe, began to pour a heavy shower of stones on\r\nGhatotkacha. That terrible shower of stones, the valiant Ghatotkacha\r\ndispelled by means of a shower of arrows. They then rained on each other\r\ndiverse weapons, such as iron Parighas and spears and maces and short\r\nclubs and mallets, and Pinakas and swords and lances and long spears and\r\nKampanas, and keen shafts, both long and broad-headed, and arrows and\r\ndiscs and battle-axes, and Ayogudas and short-arrows, and weapons with\r\nheads like those of kine, and Ulukhalas. And they struck each other,\r\ntearing up many kinds of large-branched trees such as Sami and Pilu and\r\nKarira and Champaka, O Bharata, and Inguidi and Vadari and flowering\r\nKovidara and Arimeda and Plaksha and banian and peepul, and also with\r\ndiverse mountain-summits and diverse kinds of metals. The clash of those\r\ntrees and mountain-summits became very loud like the roar of driving\r\nthunder. Indeed, the battle that took place between Bhima's son and\r\nAlayudha, was, O king, dreadful in the extreme, like that in days of old,\r\nO monarch, between Vali and Sugriva, those two princes among the monkeys.\r\nThey struck each other with shafts and diverse other kinds of fierce\r\nweapons, as also with sharp scimitars. Then the mighty Rakshasas, rushing\r\nagainst each other, seized each other by the hair. And, O king, those two\r\ngigantic warriors, with many wounds on their bodies and blood and sweat\r\ntrickling down, looked like two mighty masses of clouds pouring rain.\r\nThen rushing with speed and whirling the Rakshasas on high and dashing\r\nhim down, Hidimva's son cut off his large head. Then taking that head\r\ndecked with a pair of ear-rings, the mighty Ghatotkacha uttered a loud\r\nroar. Beholding the gigantic brother of Vaka, that chastiser of foes,\r\nthus slain, the Panchalas and the Pandavas began to utter leonine shouts.\r\nThen, upon the fall of the Rakshasa, the Pandavas beat and blew thousands\r\nof drums and ten thousands of conchs. That night then clearly indicated\r\nthe victory of the Pandavas. Illumined with torches all around, and\r\nresounding with the noise of musical instruments, the night looked\r\nexceedingly resplendent. Then the mighty son of Bhimasena threw down the\r\nhead of the slain Alayudha before Duryodhana. Duryodhana, beholding the\r\nheroic Alayudha slain, became, O Bharata, filled with anxiety, for all\r\nhis troops. Alayudha, having come to Duryodhana of his own accord.\r\nremembering his former quarrel, had said unto him that he would slay\r\nBhima in battle. The Kuru king had regarded Bhima's slaughter to be\r\ncertain, and had believed that his brothers would all be long-lived.\r\nBeholding that Alayudha slain by Bhimasena's son, the king regarded\r\nBhima's vow (about the slaughter of himself and his brothers) already\r\nfulfilled.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Having slain Alayudha, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha became\r\nfilled with delight. Standing at the head of the army he began to utter\r\ndiverse kinds of shouts. Hearing those loud roars of his that made\r\nelephants tremble, a great fear, O monarch, entered into the hearts of\r\nthy warriors. Beholding the mighty son of Bhimasena engaged with\r\nAlayudha, the mighty-armed Karna rushed against the Panchalas. He pierced\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin, each with ten strong and straight shafts\r\nsped from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. With a number of other\r\npowerful shafts, the Suta's son then caused Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas,\r\nand the great car-warrior Satyaki to tremble. The bows of those warriors\r\nalso, O king, while they were engaged in striking Karna from all sides,\r\nwere seen to be drawn into circles. On that night, the twang of their\r\nbow-strings and the rattle of their car-wheels (mingling together),\r\nbecame loud and deep as the roar of the clouds at the close of summer.\r\nThe nocturnal battle, O monarch, resembled a gathering mass of clouds.\r\nThe twang of bow-string and the rattle of car-wheels constituted its\r\nroar. The bows (of warriors) constituted its lightning flashes; and\r\nshowers of shafts formed its downpour of rain. Standing immovable like a\r\nhill and possessed of the strength of a prince of mountains, that grinder\r\nof foes, viz., Vikartana's son, Karna, O king, destroyed that wonderful\r\nshower of arrows shot at him. Devoted to the good of thy sons, the\r\nhigh-souled Vaikartana, in the battle, began to strike his foes with\r\nlances endued with the force of thunder, and with whetted shafts,\r\nequipped with beautiful wings of gold. Soon the standard of some were\r\nbroken and cut down by Karna, and the bodies of others pierced and\r\nmangled by him with keen arrows; and soon some were deprived of drivers,\r\nand some of their steeds. Exceedingly afflicted by the Suta's son in that\r\nbattle, many of them entered the force of Yudhishthira. Beholding them\r\nbroken and compelled to retreat, Ghatotkacha became mad with rage.\r\nMounted on that excellent car of his that was decked with gold and\r\njewels, he uttered a leonine roar and approaching Vikartana's son, Karna,\r\npierced him with shafts endued with the force of thunder. Both of them\r\nbegan to cover the welkin with barbed arrows, and cloth-yard shafts, and\r\nfrog-faced arrows, and Nalikas and Dandas and Asanis and arrows bearing\r\nheads like the calf's tooth or the boar's ear, and broad-headed shafts,\r\nand shafts pointed like horns, and others bearing heads like razors. The\r\nwelkin, covered with that arrowy shower, looked, in consequence of those\r\ngold-winged shafts of blazing splendour coursing horizontally through it,\r\nas if hung with garland of beautiful flowers. Each endued with prowess\r\nequal to that of the other, they struck each other equally with powerful\r\nweapons. None could, in that battle, find any mark of superiority in\r\neither of those excellent heroes. Indeed, that battle between the son of\r\nSurya and Bhima's son, characterised by a thick and heavy shower of\r\nweapons, looked exceedingly beautiful and presented almost an unrivalled\r\nsight like the fierce encounter between Rahu and Surya in the welkin.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'When Ghatotkacha, O king, that foremost of all\r\npersons conversant with weapons, found that he could not prevail over\r\nKarna, he invoked into existence a fierce and mighty weapon. With that\r\nweapon, the Rakshasa first slew the steeds of Karna and then the latter's\r\ndriver. Having achieved that feat, Hidimva's son quickly made himself\r\ninvisible.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Rakshasa fighting by deceitful means thus\r\ndisappeared, tell me, O Sanjaya, what the warriors of my army thought.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, Seeing the Rakshasa disappear, all the Kauravas loudly\r\nsaid, Appearing next, the Rakshasa, fighting deceitfully, will certainly\r\nslay Karna.' Then Karna, endued with wonderful lightness in the use of\r\nweapons, covered all sides with showers of shafts. The welkin being\r\ncovered with the darkness caused by that thick arrowy shower, all\r\ncreatures became invincible. So great was the lightness of hand displayed\r\nby the Suta's son, that none could mark when he touched his quivers with\r\nhis fingers, when he fixed his arrows on the bowstring, and when he aimed\r\nand sped them off. The entire welkin seemed to be shrouded with his\r\narrows. Then a fierce and terrible illusion was invoked into existence by\r\nthe Rakshas in the welkin. We beheld in the sky what appeared to us to be\r\na mass of red clouds resembling the fierce flame of a blazing fire. From\r\nthat cloud issued flashes of lightning, and many blazing brands, O Kuru\r\nking! And tremendous roars also issued therefrom, like the noise of\r\nthousands of drums beat at once. And from it fell many shafts winged with\r\ngold, and darts, lances and heavy clubs, and other similar weapons, and\r\nbattle-axes, and scimitars washed with oil, and axes of blazing edges,\r\nand spears, and spiked maces emitting shining rays, and beautiful maces\r\nof iron, and long darts of keen points, and heavy maces decked with gold\r\nand twined round with string's, and Sataghnis, all around. And large\r\nrocks fell from it, and thousands of thunderbolts with loud report, and\r\nmany hundreds of wheels and razors of the splendour of fire. Karna\r\nshooting showers of shafts, failed to destroy that thick and blazing\r\ndownpour of darts and lances and clubs. Loud became the uproar then of\r\nfalling steeds slain by those shafts, and mighty elephants struck with\r\nthunder, and great car-warriors deprived of life by other weapons.\r\nAfflicted by Ghatotkacha with that terrible shower of arrows all around,\r\nthat host of Duryodhana was seen to wander in great pain over the field.\r\nWith cries of Oh and Alas, and exceedingly cheerless, that wandering host\r\nseemed on the point of being annihilated. The leaders, however, in\r\nconsequence of the nobility of their hearts, fled not away with faces\r\nturned from the field. Beholding that exceedingly frightful and awful\r\nshower of mighty weapons, caused by the Rakshasa's illusion, failing upon\r\nthe field, and seeing their vast army incessantly slaughtered, the sons\r\nbecame inspired with great fear. Hundreds of jackals with tongues blazing\r\nlike fire and terrible yells, began to cry. And, O king, the (Kaurava)\r\nwarriors beholding the yelling Rakshasas, became exceedingly distressed.\r\nThose terrible Rakshasas with fiery tongues and blazing mouths and sharp\r\nteeth, and with forms huge as hills, stationed in the welkin, with darts\r\nin grasp looked like clouds pouring torrents of rain. Struck and crushed\r\nwith those fierce shafts and darts and lances and maces and spiked clubs\r\nof blazing splendour; and thunder-bolts and Pinakas and Asanis and disci\r\nand Sataghnis, the (Kaurava) troops began to fall down. The Rakshasas\r\nbegan to pour upon the warriors of thy son long darts, and treacle and\r\nSataghnis, and Sthunas made of black iron and twined with strings of\r\njute. Then all the combatants became stunned. Brave warriors, with\r\nweapons broken or loosened from their grasp, or deprived of heads, or\r\nwith fractured limbs began to fall down on the field. And in consequence\r\nof the failing rocks, steeds and elephants and cars began to be crushed.\r\nThose Yatudhanas of terrible forms created by Ghatotkacha with the aid of\r\nhis powers of illusion pouring that thick shower of mighty weapons spared\r\nneither those that were terrified nor those that begged for quarter.\r\nDuring that cruel carnage of Kuru heroes, brought on by Death himself,\r\nduring that extermination of Kshatriyas the Kaurava warriors suddenly\r\nbroke and fled with speed, crying aloud, 'Fly, ye Kauravas! All is lost!\r\nThe gods Indra at their head are slaying us for the sake of the\r\nPandavas!' At that time there was none that could rescue the sinking\r\nBharata troops. During that fierce uproar and rout and extermination of\r\nthe Kauravas, the camps losing their distinctive features, the parties\r\ncould not be distinguished from each other. Indeed, during that terrible\r\nrout in which the soldiers showed no regard for one another, every side\r\nof the field, when looked at, seemed to be empty. Only Karna, O king,\r\ncould be seen there, drowned in that shower of weapons. Then Karna\r\ncovered the welkin with his shafts, contending with that celestial\r\nillusion of the Rakshasa. The Suta's son, endued with modesty and\r\nachieving the most difficult and noble feats, did not lose his senses in\r\nthat battle. Then, O king, all the Saindhavas and Valhikas affrightedly\r\nlooked at Karna who kept his senses in that fight. And they all\r\nworshipped him, while they looked at the triumph of the Rakshasa. Then a\r\nSataghni equipped with wheels, hurled by Ghatotkacha, slew the four\r\nsteeds of Karna simultaneously. These. dropped down on the ground, on\r\ntheir knees, deprived of life, teeth, eyes, and tongues. Then jumping\r\ndown from his steedless car and seeing the Kauravas flying away, and\r\nbeholding his own celestial weapon baffled by the Rakshasa illusion,\r\nKarna, without losing his senses, turned his mind inwards and began to\r\nreflect on what he should next do. At that time all the Kauravas,\r\nbeholding Karna and that terrible illusion (of the Rakshasa) cried out\r\nsaying, 'O Karna, slay the Rakshasa soon with thy dart. These Kauravas\r\nand the Dhartarashtras are on the point of being annihilated. What will\r\nBhima and Arjuna do to us? Slay this wretched Rakshasa at dead of night,\r\nwho is consuming us all. They that will escape from this dreadful\r\nencounter to-day will fight with the Parthas in battle. Therefore, slay\r\nthis terrible Rakshas now with that dart given thee by Vasava. O Karna,\r\nlet not these great warriors, the Kauravas, these princes that resemble\r\nIndra himself, be all destroyed in this nocturnal battle.' Then Karna,\r\nseeing the Rakshasa alive at dead of night, and the Kuru army struck with\r\nfear, and hearing also the loud wails of the latter set his heart upon\r\nhurling his dart. Inflamed with rage like a wrathful lion and unable to\r\nbrook the assaults of the Rakshasa, Karna took up that foremost of\r\nvictory-giving and invincible darts, desirous of compassing the\r\ndestruction of Ghatotkacha. Indeed, that dart, O king, which he had kept\r\nand adored for years for (achieving) the slaughter of Pandu's son in\r\nbattle, that foremost of darts which Sakra himself had given to the\r\nSuta's son in exchange for the latter's ear-rings, that blazing and\r\nterrible missile twined with strings and which seemed to thirst for\r\nblood, that fierce weapon which looked like the very tongue of the\r\nDestroyer or the sister of Death himself, that terrible and effulgent\r\ndart, Naikartana, was now hurled at the Rakshasa. Beholding that\r\nexcellent and blazing weapon capable of piercing the body of every foe,\r\nin the hands of the Suta's son, the Rakshasa began to fly away in fear\r\nassuming a body gigantic as the foot of the Vindhya mountains. Indeed,\r\nseeing that dart in Karna's hand, all creatures in the sky, O king,\r\nuttered loud cries. Fierce winds began to blow, and thunders with loud\r\nreport began to fall on the earth. Destroying that blazing illusion of\r\nGhatotkacha and piercing right through his breast that resplendent dart\r\nsoared aloft in the night and entered a starry constellation in the\r\nfirmament. Having fought, using diverse beautiful weapons, with many\r\nheroic Rakshasa and human warriors, Ghatotkacha, then uttering diverse\r\nterrible roars, fell, deprived of life with that dart of Sakra. This also\r\nis another exceedingly wonderful feat that the Rakshasa accomplished for\r\nthe destruction of his foes, that at a time when his heart was pierced by\r\nthat dart, he shone resplendent, O king, like a mighty mountain or a mass\r\nof clouds. Indeed, having assumed that terrible and awful form,\r\nBhimasena's son of frightful deeds fell down. When dying, O king, he fell\r\nupon a portion of thy army and pressed those troops down by the weight of\r\nhis own body. Quickly falling down, the Rakshasa with his gigantic and\r\nstill increasing body, desirous of benefiting the Pandavas, slew a full\r\nAkshauhini of thy troops while he himself breathed his last. Then a loud\r\nuproar arose there made up of leonine shouts and blare of conchs and the\r\nbeat of drums and cymbals. The Kauravas indeed, beholding the illusion of\r\nthe Rakshasa destroyed and the Rakshasa himself slain uttered loud shouts\r\nof joy. Then Karna, worshipped by the Kurus as Sakra had been by the\r\nMaruts upon the slaughter of Vritra, ascended behind the car of thy son,\r\nand becoming the observed of all, entered the Kuru host.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Hidimva's son slain and lying like a riven\r\nmountain, all the Pandavas became filled with grief and began to shed\r\ncopious tears. Only Vasudeva filled with transports of delight, began to\r\nutter leonine shouts, grieving the Pandavas. Indeed, uttering loud shouts\r\nhe embraced Arjuna. Tying the steeds and uttering loud roars, he began to\r\ndance in a transport of joy, like a tree shaken by a tempest. Then\r\nembracing Arjuna once more, and repeatedly slapping his own armpits,\r\nAchyuta endued with great intelligence once more began to shout, standing\r\non the terrace of the car. Beholding those tokens of delight that Kesava\r\nmanifested, Dhananjaya, O king, with heart in grief, addressed him,\r\nsaying, 'O slayer of Madhu, thou showest great joy at a time scarcely fit\r\nfor it, indeed on an occasion for sorrow caused by the death of Hidimva's\r\nson. Our troops are flying away, beholding Ghatotkacha slain. We also are\r\nfilled with anxiety in consequence of the fall of Hidimva's son. O\r\nJanardana, the cause must be very grave when at such a time thou feelest\r\nsuch joy. Therefore, O foremost of truthful men, asked by me, tell me\r\ntruly (what that cause is). Indeed, if it be not a secret, it behoveth\r\nthee, O chastiser of foes, to say it unto me. O slayer of Madhu, tell me\r\nwhat has removed thy gravity today. This act of thine, O Janardana, this\r\nlightness of heart, seems to me like the drying up of the ocean or the\r\nlocomotion of Meru.'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, Great is the joy I feel. Listen to me, Dhananjaya! This\r\nthat I will tell thee will immediately dispel thy sorrow and infuse\r\ndelight into thy heart. O thou of great splendour, know, O Dhananjaya,\r\nthat Karna, his dart being baffled through Ghatotkacha, is already slain\r\nin battle. The man does not exist in this world that could not stay\r\nbefore Karna armed with that dart and looking like Kartikeya in battle.\r\nBy good luck, his (natural) armour had been taken away. By good luck, his\r\nearrings also had been taken away. By good luck, his infallible dart also\r\nis now baffled, through Ghatotkacha. Clad in (natural) coat of mail and\r\ndecked with his (natural) ear-rings, Karna, who had his senses under\r\ncontrol, could singly vanquish the three worlds with the very gods.\r\nNeither Vasava, nor Varuna the lord of the waters, nor Yama, could\r\nventure to approach him. Indeed, if that bull among men had his armour\r\nand ear-rings, neither thyself, bending the Gandiva, nor myself,\r\nuplifting my discus, called Sudarsana, could vanquish him in battle. For\r\nthy good, Karna was divested of his ear-rings by Sakra with the help of\r\nan illusion. Similarly was that subjugator of hostile towns deprived of\r\nhis (natural) armour. Indeed, because Karna, cutting off his (natural)\r\narmour and his brilliant car-rings, gave them unto Sakra, it is for that\r\nhe came to be called Vaikartana. Karna now seems to me to be like an\r\nangry snake of virulent poison stupefied by power of incantation, or like\r\na fire of mild flames. From that time, O mighty-armed one, when the\r\nhigh-souled Sakra gave that dart unto Karna in exchange for the latter's\r\near-rings, and celestial armour, that dart, viz., which has slain\r\nGhatotkacha, from that time, Vrisha, having obtained it, had always\r\nregarded thee as slain in battle! But though deprived of that dart, O\r\nsinless one, I swear to thee that hero is still incapable of being slain\r\nby anybody else save thee. Devoted to Brahmanas, truthful in speech,\r\nengaged in penances, observant of vows, kind even unto foes, for these\r\nreasons Karna is called Vrisha. Heroic in battle, possessed of mighty\r\narms and with bow always uplifted, like the lion in the forest depriving\r\nleaders of elephantine herds of their pride, Karna always deprives the\r\ngreatest car-warriors of their pride on the field of battle, and\r\nresembles the mid-day sun at whom none can gaze. Contending with all the\r\nillustrious and foremost of warriors of thy army, O tiger among men,\r\nKarna, while shooting his arrowy showers, looked like the autumnal sun\r\nwith his thousand rays. Indeed, incessantly shooting showers of shafts\r\nlike the clouds pouring torrents of rain at the end of summer, Karna is\r\nlike a pouring cloud charged with celestial weapons. He is incapable of\r\nbeing vanquished in battle by the gods, he would mangle them in such a\r\nway that their flesh and blood would fall copiously on the field.\r\nDeprived, however, of his armour as also of his car-rings, O son of\r\nPandu, and divested also of the dart given him by Vasava, Karna is now\r\nlike a man (and no longer like a god). There win occur one opportunity\r\nfor his slaughter. When his car-wheels will sink in the earth, availing\r\nthyself of that opportunity, thou shouldst slay him in that distressful\r\nsituation. I will make thee a sign beforehand. Warned by it, thou\r\nshouldst act. The vanquisher of Vala himself, that foremost of heroes,\r\nwielding his thunder, is incapable of slaying the invincible Karna while\r\nthe latter stands weapon in hand. Indeed, O Arjuna, for thy good, with\r\nthe aid of diverse contrivances I have slain, one after another,\r\nJarasandha and the illustrious ruler of the Chedis and the mighty-armed\r\nNishada of the name of Ekalavya. Other great Rakshasas having Hidimva and\r\nKirmira and Vaka for their foremost, as also Alayudha, that grinder of\r\nhostile troops, and Ghatotkacha, that crusher of foes and warrior of\r\nfierce deeds, have all been slain.'\""

      "content": "\"Arjuna said, 'How, O Janardana, for our good, and by what means, were\r\nthose lords of the earth, viz., Jarasandha and the others, slain?'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, If Jarasandha, and the ruler of the Chedis, and the\r\nmighty son of the Nishada king, had not been slain, they would have\r\nbecome terrible. Without doubt, Duryodhana would have chosen those\r\nforemost of car-warriors (for embracing his side). They had always been\r\nhostile to us, and, accordingly, they would all have adopted the side of\r\nthe Kauravas. All of them were heroes and mighty bowmen accomplished in\r\nweapons and firm in battle. Like the celestials (in prowess), they would\r\nhave protected Dhritarashtra's sons. Indeed, the Suta's son, and\r\nJarasandha, and the ruler of the Chedis, and the son of the Nishada\r\nadopting the son of Suyodhana, would have succeeded in conquering the\r\nwhole earth. Listen, O Dhananjaya, by what means they were slain. Indeed,\r\nwithout the employment of means, the very gods could not have conquered\r\nthem in battle. Each of them, O Partha, could fight in battle with the\r\nwhole celestial host protected by the Regents of the world. (On one\r\noccasion), assailed by Valadeva, Jarasandha, excited with wrath, hurled\r\nfor our destruction a mace capable of slaying all creatures. Endued with\r\nthe splendour of fire, that mace coursed towards us dividing the welkin\r\nlike the line on the head that parts the tresses of a woman, and with the\r\nimpetuosity of the thunder hurled by Sakra. Beholding that mace thus\r\ncoursing towards us the son of Rohini hurled the weapon called\r\nSthunakarna for baffling it. Its force destroyed by the energy of\r\nValadeva's weapon, that mace fell down on the earth, splitting her (with\r\nits might) and making the very mountains tremble. There was a terrible\r\nRakshasa of the name Jara, endued with great prowess. She, O prince, had\r\nunited that slayer of foes, and, therefore, was the latter called\r\nJarasandha. Jarasandha had been made up of two halves of one child. And\r\nbecause it was Jara that had united those two halves, it was for this\r\nthat he came to be called Jarasandha.[237] That Rakshasa woman, O Partha,\r\nwho was there within the earth, was slain with her son and kinsmen by\r\nmeans-of that mace and the weapon of Sthunakarna. Deprived of his mace in\r\nthat great battle, Jarasandha was afterwards slain by Bhimasena in thy\r\npresence, O Dhananjaya.[238] If the valiant Jarasandha had stood armed\r\nwith his mace, the very gods with Indra at their head could not have\r\nslain him in battle. O best of men! for thy good, the Nishada's son also,\r\nof prowess incapable of being baffled, was, by an act of guile, deprived\r\nof his thumb by Drona, assuming the position of his preceptor. Proud and\r\nendued with steady prowess, the Nishada's son, with fingers cased in\r\nleathern gloves, looked resplendent like a second Rama. Undeprived of\r\nthumb, Ekalavya, O Partha, was incapable of being vanquished in battle by\r\nthe gods, the Danavas, the Rakshasas, and the Uragas (together). Of firm\r\ngrasp, accomplished in weapons, and capable of shooting incessantly day\r\nand night, he was incapable of being looked at by mere men. For thy good,\r\nhe was slain by me on the field of battle. Endued with great prowess, the\r\nruler of the Chedis was slain by me before thy eyes. He also was\r\nincapable of being vanquished in battle by the gods and the Asuras\r\ntogether. I was born to slay him as also the other enemies of the gods,\r\nwith thy assistance, O tiger among men, from desire of benefiting the\r\nworld. Hidimva and Vaka and Kirmira have all been slain by Bhimasena. All\r\nthose Rakshasas were endued with might equal to that Ravana and all of\r\nthem were destroyers of Brahmanas and sacrifices. Similarly, Alayudha,\r\npossessed of large powers of illusion, had been slain by Hidimva's son.\r\nHidimva's son also, I have slain by the employment of means, viz.,\r\nthrough Karna with his dart. If Karna had not slain him with his dart in\r\ngreat battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima's son Ghatotkacha.\r\nFrom desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa\r\nwas inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of\r\nsacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O\r\nsinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also\r\nbeen rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of\r\nrighteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me,\r\nfor establishing righteousness. Whither the Vedas and truth and\r\nself-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity\r\nand wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself\r\nalways remain. Thou needst not be at all anxious about Karna's slaughter.\r\nI will tell you the means by which you will slay him. Vrikodara also will\r\nsucceed in slaying Suyodhana. I will tell thee, O son of Pandu, the means\r\nby which that will have to be compassed. Meanwhile, the uproar made by\r\nthe hostile army is increasing. Thy troops also are flying away on all\r\nsides. Having achieved their objects, the Kauravas are destroying thy\r\nhost. Indeed, Drona, that foremost of all smiters, is scorching us in\r\nbattle.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION CLXXXII\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Suta's son had such a dart as was sure to\r\nslay one person, why did he not hurt it at Partha, to the exclusion of\r\nall others? Upon Partha's slaughter by means of that dart, all the\r\nSrinjayas and the Pandavas would have been slain. Indeed, upon Phalguna's\r\ndeath, why should not the victory have been ours? Arjuna has made a vow\r\nto the effect that summoned to battle he would never refuse to accept the\r\nchallenge. The Suta's son should have, therefore, summoned Phalguna to\r\nbattle. Tell me, O Sanjaya, why did not Vrisha then engaging Phalguna in\r\nsingle combat, slay the latter with that dart given him by Sakra? Without\r\ndoubt, my son is destitute of both intelligence and counsellors? That\r\nsinful wretch is constantly baffled by the foe. How should he then\r\nsucceed in vanquishing his enemies? Indeed, that dart which was such a\r\nmighty weapon and upon which rested his victory, alas, that dart, hath,\r\nby Vasudeva, been made fruitless through Ghatotkacha. Indeed, it hath\r\nbeen snatched from Karna, like a fruit from the hand of a cripple, with a\r\nwithered arm, by a strong person. Even so hath that fatal dart been\r\nrendered fruitless through Ghatotkacha. As in a fight between a boar and\r\na dog, upon the death of either, the hunter is the party profited, I\r\nthink, O learned one, that even so was Vasudeva the party to profit by\r\nthe battle between Karna and Hidimva's son. If Ghatotkacha had slain\r\nKarna in battle, that would have been a great gain for the Pandavas. If,\r\non the other hand, Karna had slain Ghatotkacha, that too would have been\r\na great gain to them in consequence of the loss of Karna's dart. Endued\r\nwith great wisdom, that lion among men, viz., Vasudeva, reflecting in\r\nthis way, and for doing what was agreeable to and good for the Pandavas,\r\ncaused Ghatotkacha to be slain by Karna in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Knowing the feat that Karna desired to achieve, the\r\nslayer of Madhu, the mighty-armed Janardana, O king, commanded the prince\r\nof the Rakshasas, Ghatotkacha of mighty energy, to engage in single\r\ncombat with Karna for rendering, O monarch, the latter's fatal dart\r\nfruitless. All this, O king, is the result of thy evil policy! We would\r\ncertainly have achieved success, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, if Krishna\r\nhad not (thus) rescued the mighty car-warrior Partha from Karna's hands.\r\nIndeed, Partha would have been destroyed with his steeds, standard, and\r\ncar, in battle, Oh Dhritarashtra, if that master, that lord of Yogins,\r\nviz., Janardana had not saved him. Protected by diverse means, O king,\r\nand well-aided by Krishna, Partha approaching his foes, vanquished that\r\nfatal dart, otherwise that weapon would have quickly destroyed the son of\r\nKunti like the lightning destroying a tree.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'My son is fond of quarrel. His advisers are\r\nfoolish. He is vain of his wisdom. It is for that, that this certain\r\nmeans of Arjuna's death hath been baffled. Why, O Suta, did not\r\nDuryodhana, or that foremost of all wielders, viz., Karna, possessed of\r\ngreat intelligence, hurl that fatal dart at Dhananjaya? Why, O son of\r\nGavalgana, didst thou too forget this great object, possessed as thou art\r\nof great wisdom, or why didst not thou remind Karna of it?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Indeed, O king, every night this formed the subject of\r\ndeliberation with Duryodhana and Sakuni and myself and Duhsasana. And we\r\nsaid unto Karna, 'Excluding all other warriors, O Karna, slay Dhananjaya.\r\nWe would then lord it over the Pandu's and the Panchalas as if these were\r\nour slaves. Or, if upon Partha's fall, he of Vrishni's race appoints\r\nanother amongst the sons of Pandu (in this place for carrying on the\r\nfight), let Krishna himself be slain. Krishna is the root of the\r\nPandavas, and Partha is like their risen trunk. The other sons of Pritha\r\nare like their branches, while the Panchalas may be called their leaves.\r\nThe Pandavas have Krishna for their refuge, Krishna for their might,\r\nKrishna for their leader. Indeed, Krishna is their central support even\r\nas the moon is of the constellations. Therefore, O Suta's son, avoiding\r\nthe leaves and branches and trunk, slay that Krishna who is everywhere\r\nand always the root of the Pandavas. Indeed, if Karna had slain him of\r\nDasarha's race, viz., that delighter of the Yadavas, the whole earth, O\r\nking, would, without doubt, have come under thy control. Truly, O\r\nmonarch, if that illustrious one, that delighter of both the Yadavas and\r\nthe Pandavas, could be made to lie down on the earth, deprived of life,\r\nthen certainly, O monarch, the entire earth with the mountains and\r\nforests would have owned thy supremacy. We rose every morning, having\r\nformed such a resolution in respect of that Lord of the very gods, viz.,\r\nHrishikesa of immeasurable energy. At the time of battle, however, we\r\nforget our resolution. Kesava always protected Arjuna, the son of Kunti.\r\nHe never placed Arjuna before the Suta's son in battle. Indeed, Achyuta\r\nalways placed other foremost of car-warriors before Karna, thinking how\r\nthat fatal dart of ours might be made fruitless by ourselves. O lord!\r\nWhen, again, the high-souled Krishna protected Partha in this manner from\r\nKarna, why, O monarch, would not that foremost of beings protect his own\r\nself? Reflecting well, I see that there is no person in the three worlds\r\nwho is able to vanquish that chastiser of foes, viz., Janardana, that\r\nhero bearing the discus in hand.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'That tiger among car-warriors, viz., Satyaki of\r\nprowess incapable of being baffled, asked the mighty-armed Krishna about\r\nthe great car-warrior, Karna, saving, 'O Janardana, even this had been\r\nKarna's firm resolution, viz., that he would hurl that dart of\r\nimmeasurable energy at Phalguna. Why, however, did not the Suta's son\r\nactually hurt it then at him?'\r\n\r\n\"Vasudeva said, 'Duhsasana and Karna and Sakuni and the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, with Duryodhana at their head, had frequently debated on this\r\nsubject. Addressing Karna, they used to say, 'O Karna. O great bowman, O\r\nthou of immeasurable prowess in battle, O foremost of all victors, this\r\ndart should not be hurled at any one else than that great car-warrior,\r\nviz., Kunti's son, Partha or Dhananjaya. He is the most celebrated\r\namongst them, like Vasava amongst the gods. He being slain, all the other\r\nPandavas with the Srinjayas will be heartless like fireless\r\ncelestials![239]' Karna having assented to this, saying 'So be it' (the\r\ndesire of) slaughtering the wielder of Gandiva, O bull amongst the Sinis,\r\nwas ever present in Karna's heart. I, however, O foremost of warriors,\r\nalways used to stupefy the son of Radha. It was for this that he did not\r\nhurl the dart at Pandu's son, owning white steeds. As long as I could not\r\nbaffle that means of Phalguna's death, I had neither sleep, nor joy in my\r\nheart, O foremost of warriors! Beholding that dart, therefore, rendered\r\nfutile through Ghatotkacha, O bull amongst the Sinis, I regarded\r\nDhananjaya today to have been rescued from within the jaws of Death. I do\r\nnot regard my sire, my mother, yourselves, my brothers, ay, my very life,\r\nso worthy of protection as Vibhatsu in battle. If there be anything more\r\nprecious than the sovereignty of the three worlds, I do not, O Satwata,\r\ndesire (to enjoy) it without Pritha's son, Dhananjaya (to share it with\r\nme). Beholding Dhananjaya, therefore, like one returned from the dead,\r\nthese transports of delight, O Yuyudhana, have been mine. It was for this\r\nthat I had despatched the Rakshasa unto Karna for battle. None else was\r\ncapable of withstanding, in the night, Karna in battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Even thus did Devaki's son who is ever devoted to\r\nDhananjaya's good and to what is agreeable to him, speak unto Satyaki on\r\nthat occasion.'\""

Indeed, when you knew that\r\ndart could always slay one person in battle, and that it was incapable of\r\nbeing either borne or baffled by the very gods with Vasava at their head,\r\nwhy then, O Sanjaya, was it not hurled by Karna at Devaki's son, or\r\nPhalguna, while he was engaged with this in battle before?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Returning from battle every day, O monarch, all of us, O\r\nforemost one of Kuru's race, used to debate in the night and say unto\r\nKarna.

When, however, the morning came, O king, through\r\ndestiny, both Karna and the other warriors forgot that resolution. I\r\nthink destiny to be supreme, since Karna, with that dart in his hands,\r\ndid not slay in battle either Partha or Devaki's son, Krishna.

Karna, and my\r\nsons, as all the other kings, through his highly impolitic act, have\r\nalready entered the abode of Yama. Tell me now how the battle once more\r\nraged between the Kurus and the Pandavas after the fall of Hidimva's son.\r\nHow did they that rushed against Drona, arrayed in order of battle and\r\nwell-skilled in smiting, viz., the Srinjaya and the Panchalas, fight?\r\nHow, indeed, did the Pandus and Srinjaya withstand the smiting Drona,\r\nwhen the latter proceeding against them, penetrated into their host,\r\nexcited with wrath at the slaughter of Bhurisravas and Jayadratha,\r\nreckless of his very life, and resembling a yawning tiger or the\r\nDestroyer himself with wide open mouth? What also did they do in battle,\r\nO sire, viz., Drona's son and Karna and Kripa and others headed by\r\nDuryodhana that protected the preceptor? Tell me, O Sanjaya, how my\r\nwarriors in that battle covered with their shafts Dhananjaya and\r\nVrikodara who were solicitous of slaying Bharadwaja's son. How, indeed,\r\ndid these excited with wrath at the death of the ruler of the Sindhus,\r\nand those at the death of Ghatotkacha, each side unable to brook their\r\nloss, fight that nocturnal battle?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the slaughter, that night, O king, of the Rakshasa,\r\nGhatotkacha, by Karna, thy troops, filled with joy, uttered loud shouts.\r\nIn that dark hour of the night, they fell impetuously upon the Pandava\r\ntroops and began to slay them. Seeing all this, king Yudhishthira became\r\nexceedingly cheerless, O chastiser of foes. The mighty-armed son of\r\nPandu, then addressed Bhimasena and said, 'O thou of mighty arms, resist\r\nDhritarashtra host. In consequence of the slaughter of Hidimva's son, a\r\ngreat stupefaction overwhelms me.' Having ordered Bhimasena thus, he sat\r\ndown on his car. With tearful face and sighing repeatedly, the king\r\nbecame exceedingly cheerless at the sight of Karna's prowess. Beholding\r\nhim so afflicted, Krishna said these words, 'O son of Kunti, let not such\r\ngrief be thine. Such cheerlessness does not become thee, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, as it does an ordinary person. Rise, O king, and fight. Bear\r\nthe heavy burden, O lord! If cheerlessness overtakes thee, our victory\r\nbecomes uncertain.' Hearing these words of Krishna, Dharma's son,\r\nYudhishthira, wiping his eyes with his hands, replied unto Krishna,\r\nsaying, 'O thou of mighty arms, the excellent path of duty is not unknown\r\nto me. The dire consequences of a Brahmana's slaughter are his that\r\nforgets the services he receives at other's hands. Whilst we were living\r\nin the woods the high-souled son of Hidimva, although then a mere child\r\ndid us many services, O Janardana! Learning that Partha, having white\r\nsteeds, had departed for the acquisition of weapons, that great bowman\r\n(viz., Ghatotkacha), O Krishna, came to me at Kamyaka. He dwelt with us\r\ntill Dhananjaya's reappearance. Whilst proceeding over many inaccessible\r\nfastnesses, he himself carried on his back the tired princess of\r\nPanchala. The feats he achieved, O lord, show that he was skilled in all\r\nmodes of warfare. Indeed, that high-souled one accomplished many\r\ndifficult feats for my benefit. My affection for Ghatotkacha, that prince\r\nof the Rakshasas is twice that, O Janardana, which I naturally bear\r\ntowards Sahadeva. That mighty-armed one was devoted to me. I was dear to\r\nhim and he was dear to me. It is for this that, scorched by grief, O thou\r\nof Vrishni's race, I have become so cheerless. Behold, O thou of\r\nVrishni's race, our troops afflicted and routed by the Kauravas. Behold,\r\nthose mighty car-warriors, viz., Drona and Karna, are contending\r\nearnestly in battle. Behold, the Pandava host crushed at dead of night,\r\nlike an extensive forest of heath by a couple of infuriated elephants.\r\nDisregarding the might of Bhimasena's son, as also the variety of weapon\r\nthat Partha bears, the Kauravas are putting forth their prowess, Yonder,\r\nDrona and Karna and king Suyodhana, having slain the Rakshasa in battle,\r\nare uttering loud roars. How, O Janardana, when we are alive and thyself\r\ntoo, could Hidimva's son be slain while engaged with the Suta's son?\r\nHaving caused a great slaughter amongst us, and in the very sight of\r\nSavyasachin, Karna, O Krishna, hath slain Bhimasena's son of great\r\nstrength, the Rakshasa, Ghatotkacha. When Abhimanyu was slain by the\r\nwicked Dhartarashtras, the mighty car-warrior Savyasachin, O Krishna, was\r\nnot present in that battle. We also were all held in check by the\r\nillustrious ruler of the Sindhus. Drona, with his son (Aswatthaman),\r\nbecame the cause of that act. The preceptor himself told Karna the means\r\nof Abhimanyu's slaughter. While Abhimanyu was battling with the sword it\r\nwas the preceptor himself that cut off that weapon. And while fallen into\r\nsuch distress, Kritavarman most cruelly slew the steeds and the two\r\nParshni drivers (of the boy). Other great bowmen then despatched the son\r\nof Subhadra. For a little offence, O Krishna, was the ruler of the\r\nSindhus slain by the wielder of Gandiva. O foremost one among the\r\nYadavas, that act did not give me great joy. If the slaughter of foes is\r\njust and should be achieved by the Pandavas, then Drona and Karna should\r\nhave been slain before this. This is what I think. O bull among men,\r\nthose two are the root of our woes. Obtaining those two (as his allies)\r\nin battle, Suyodhana has become confident. Indeed, when it was Drona that\r\nshould have been slain or the Suta's son with his followers, the\r\nmighty-armed Dhananjaya slew the Sindhu king whose connection with the\r\naffair was very remote. The punishment of the Suta's son should certainly\r\nby undertaken by me. I shall, therefore, O hero, now fight for slaying\r\nthe Suta's son. The mighty-armed Bhimasena is now engaged with Drona's\r\ndivision.' Having said these words, Yudhishthira quickly proceeded\r\nagainst Karna, holding his formidable bow and blowing his conch fiercely.\r\nThen, surrounded by a Panchala and Prabhadraka force of a thousand cars,\r\nthree hundred elephants and five thousand horses,\r\n\r\nSikhandin speedily followed in the wake of the king. Then the mail-clad\r\nPanchalas and the Pandavas headed by Yudhishthira beat their drums and\r\nblew their conchs. At this time Vasudeva of mighty arms, addressing\r\nDhananjaya said, 'Filled with wrath, yonder proceedeth Yudhishthira with\r\ngreat speed from desire of slaying the Suta's son. It is not proper that\r\nthou shouldst rely upon him in this.' Having said these words, Hrishikesa\r\nquickly urged the steeds. Indeed, Janardana followed in the wake of the\r\nking who was now at a distance. At that time, seeing Dharma's son,\r\nYudhishthira, whose mind was afflicted by grief and who seemed to be\r\nscorched as if by fire, rush with speed from desire of slaying the Suta's\r\nson, Vyasa approached him and said these words.'[240]\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, By good luck, Phalguna liveth still although he had\r\nencountered Karna in battle. Indeed, Karna had kept his dart, desirous of\r\nslaying Savyasachin, O bull of Bharata's race, by good luck Jishnu did\r\nnot engage in single combat with Karna. Each of them in that case\r\nchallenging the other, would have shot his celestial weapons on all\r\nsides. The weapons of the Suta's son would have been destroyed by Arjuna.\r\nThe former then afflicted by the latter, would certainly have hurled\r\nIndra's dart in that battle. O Yudhishthira! O foremost one of Bharata's\r\nrace, (if this had come to pass), then great would have been thy grief. O\r\ngiver of honours, by good luck the Rakshasa hath been slain in battle by\r\nthe Suta's son. Indeed, Ghatotkacha hath been slain by death himself\r\nmaking the dart of Vasava an instrument only. For thy good it is, O sire,\r\nthat the Rakshasa hath been slain in battle. Do not yield to anger, O\r\nforemost one of Bharata's race, and do not set thy heart on grief. O\r\nYudhishthira, this is the end of all creatures in this world. Uniting\r\nwith thy brothers and all the illustrious kings (of the host), fight with\r\nthe Kauravas in battle, O Bharata! On the fifth day from this, the earth\r\nwill be thine. O tiger among men, always think of virtue. With a cheerful\r\nheart, O son of Pandu, practise kindness (to all creatures), penances,\r\ncharity, forgiveness, and truth. Victory is there where righteousness is.\r\nHaving said these words unto the son of Pandu, Vyasa made himself\r\ninvisible there and then.'\"[241]"

In consequence, however of the slaughter of Ghatotkacha by the\r\nSuta's son that night, the king became filled with grief and anger.\r\nBeholding thy vast host held in check by Bhima, Yudhishthira, addressing\r\nDhrishtadyumna, said, 'Resist the Pot-born! O scorcher of foes, thou\r\nhadst, clad in mail, and armed with bow and arrows and scimitar, sprung\r\nfrom fire, for the destruction of Drona! Cheerfully rush thou to battle,\r\nthou needst have no fear. Let also Janamejaya and Sikhandin and\r\nDurmukha's son and Yasodhara, rush in wrath against the Pot-born on every\r\nside. Let Nakula and Sahadeva and the sons of Draupadi and the\r\nPrabhadrakas, and Drupada and Virata with their sons and brothers, and\r\nSatyaki and the Kaikeyas and the Pandavas and Dhananjaya, rush with speed\r\nagainst Bharadwaja's son, from desire of slaying him. Let also all our\r\ncar-warriors and all the elephants and horses we have, and all our\r\nfoot-soldiers, overthrow the mighty car-warrior Drona in battle.' Thus\r\nordered by the illustrious son of Pandu, all of them rushed impetuously\r\nagainst the Pot-born from desire of slaughtering him. Drona, however,\r\nthat foremost of all wielders of arms, received in battle all those\r\nPandava warriors thus rushing towards him suddenly with great force and\r\nperseverance. The king Duryodhana, desiring to protect Drona's life,\r\nrushed, filled with wrath, against the Pandavas, with great force and\r\nperseverance. Then commenced the battle between the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas who roared at each other. The animals of both hosts as also the\r\nwarriors were all tired. The great car-warriors also, O king, with eyes\r\nclosing in sleep and worn out with exertion in battle, knew not what to\r\ndo. That night of nine hours, so terrible and awful[242] and so\r\ndestructive of creatures, appeared to them to be everything.[243] While\r\nthey were being thus slain and mangled by one another, and while sleep\r\nsat heavy on their eyes, it became midnight. All the Kshatriyas became\r\ncheerless. Thy troops, as also those of the toe, had no more weapons and\r\narrows. Passing the time thus (most of), the warriors (of both armies)\r\nendued with modesty and energy and observant of the duties of their\r\norder, din not abandon their divisions. Others, blind with sleep,\r\nabandoning their weapons, laid themselves down. Some laid themselves down\r\non the backs of elephants, some on cars, and some on horseback, O\r\nBharata! Blind with sleep, they became perfectly motionless, O king.\r\nOther warriors (that were yet awake) in that battle, despatched these to\r\nYama's abode. Others, deprived of their senses, and dreaming in sleep,\r\nslew themselves, that is, their own comrades, as also foes. Indeed, these\r\nfought in that dreadful battle, uttering various exclamations. Many\r\nwarriors, O monarch, of our army, desirous of continuing the fight with\r\nthe foe, stood with eyes drowsy with sleep. Some brave warriors, during\r\nthat terrible hour of darkness, though blind with sleep, yet gliding\r\nalong the field, slew one another in that battle. Many amongst the foe,\r\nentirely stupefied by slumber, were slain without their being conscious\r\n(of the strokes that launched them into eternity). Beholding this\r\ncondition of the soldiers, O bull among men, Vibhatsu in a very loud\r\nvoice, said these words: all of you, with your animals, are worn out with\r\nexertion and blind with sleep. Ye warriors, ye are enveloped in darkness\r\nand with dust. Therefore, if ye like, ye may rest. Indeed, here, on the\r\nfield of battle close your eyes for a while. Then when the moon will\r\nrise, ye Kurus and Pandavas, ye may again, having slept and taken rest,\r\nencounter each other for the sake of heaven.' Hearing these words of the\r\nvirtuous Arjuna, the virtuous warriors (of the Kuru army) assented to the\r\nsuggestion, and addressing one another, loudly said, 'O Karna, O Karna, O\r\nking Duryodhana, abstain from the fight. The Pandava host hath ceased to\r\nstrike us.' Then at those words of Phalguna, uttered loudly by him, the\r\nPandava army as also thine, O Bharata, abstained from battle. Indeed,\r\nthese noble words of Partha were highly applauded by the gods, the\r\nhigh-souled Rishis, and all the gladdened soldiers. Applauding those kind\r\nwords, O Bharata, all the troops, O king, worn out with exertion, laid\r\n-themselves down for sleep, O bull of Bharata's race. Then that army of\r\nthine, O Bharata, happy at the prospect of rest and sleep, sincerely\r\nblessed Arjuna saying, 'In thee are the Vedas as also all weapons! In\r\nthee are intelligence and prowess! In thee, O mighty armed one, are\r\nrighteousness and compassion for all creatures, O sinless one! And since\r\nwe have been comforted by thee, we wish thy good, O Partha! Let\r\nprosperity be to thee! Soon do thou get, O hero, those objects that are\r\ndear to thy heart!' Blessing him thus, O tiger among men, those great\r\ncar-warriors, overcome with sleep, became silent, O monarch! Some laid\r\nthemselves down on horseback, some on the car-boxes, some on the necks of\r\nelephants, and some on the bare ground. Many men, with their weapons and\r\nmaces and swords and battle axes and lances and with their armours on,\r\nlaid themselves down for sleep, apart from one another. Elephants, heavy\r\nwith sleep, made the earth cool with the breath of their nostrils, that\r\npassed through their snake-like trunks spotted with dust. Indeed, the\r\nelephants, as they breathed on the ground, looked beautiful like hills\r\nscattered (on the field of battle) over whose breasts hissed gigantic\r\nsnakes. Steeds, in trappings of gold and with manes mingling with their\r\nyokes, stamping their hoofs made even grounds uneven. Thus every one, O\r\nking, slept there with the animal he rode. Thus steeds and elephants and\r\nwarriors, O bull of Bharata's race, very much worn out with exertion,\r\nslept, abstaining from battle. That slumbering host, deprived of sense\r\nand sunk in sleep, then looked like a wonderful picture drawn on canvas\r\nby skilful artists. Those Kshatriyas, decked in ear-rings and endued with\r\nyouth, with limbs mangled by shafts, and immersed in sleep, having laid\r\nthemselves down on the coronal globes of elephants, looked as if they\r\nwere lying on the deep bosom of beautiful ladies. Then the moon, that\r\ndelighter of eye and lord of lilies, of hue white as the checks of a.\r\nbeautiful lady, rose, adorning the direction presided over by Indra.[244]\r\nIndeed, like a lion of the Udaya hills, with rays constituting his manes\r\nof brilliant yellow, he issued out of his cave in the east, tearing to\r\npieces the thick gloom of night resembling an extensive herd of\r\nelephants.[245] That lover of all assemblage of lilies (in the world),\r\nbright as the body of Mahadeva's excellent bull, full-arched and radiant\r\nas Karna's bow, and delightful and charming as the smile on the lips of a\r\nbashful bride, bloomed in the firmament.[246] Soon, however, that divine\r\nlord having the hare for his mark showed himself shedding brighter rays\r\naround. Indeed, the moon, after this seemed to gradually emit a bright\r\nhalo of far-reaching light that resembled the splendour of gold. Then the\r\nrays of that luminary, dispelling the darkness by their splendour, slowly\r\nspread themselves over all the quarters, the welkin, and the earth. Soon,\r\ntherefore, the world became illuminated. The unspeakable darkness that\r\nhad hidden everything quickly fled away. When the world was thus\r\nilluminated into almost daylight by the moon, amongst the creatures that\r\nwander at night, some continued to roam about and some abstained. That\r\nhost, O king, awakened by the rays of the sun. Indeed, that sea of troops\r\nwas awakened by the rays of the moon bloomed (into life) like an\r\nassemblage of lotuses expanded by the rays of the sun. Indeed, that sea\r\nof troops was awakened by the risen moon like the ocean swelling up in\r\nagitated surges at the rise of that luminary. Then, O king, the battle\r\nonce more commenced on earth, for the destruction of the earth's\r\npopulation, between men that desired to attain to heaven.'\""

Desirous of doing what is agreeable to thee, we\r\nshowed them kindness by then letting them alone. The tired Pandavas,\r\nhowever (having taken rest), have become stronger. As regards ourselves,\r\nwe are, in every respect, losing in energy and strength. The Pandavas,\r\nprotected by thee, are constantly gaining prosperity. All weapons that\r\nare celestial and all those that appertain to Brahma exist in thee. I\r\ntell thee truly, that neither the Pandavas, nor ourselves, nor any other\r\nbowmen in the world, can be a match for thee while thou art engaged in\r\nbattle. O foremost of regenerate ones, thou art acquainted with all\r\nweapons. Without doubt, by means of thy celestial weapons thou art\r\ncapable of destroying the (three) worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and\r\nthe Gandharvas. The Pandavas are all afraid of thee. Thou, however,\r\nforgivest them, remembering that they were thy pupils, or, perhaps, owing\r\nto my ill luck.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus rebuked and angered by thy son, Drona, O king,\r\nwrathfully addressed Duryodhana and said these words: 'Although I am so\r\nold, O Duryodhana, I am still exerting myself in battle to the utmost\r\nextent of might. All these men are unacquainted with weapons. I am,\r\nhowever, well-versed in them. If, from desire of victory, I slay these\r\nmen, there can be no more ignoble act for me to do. That, however, which\r\nis in thy mind, be it good or bad, I will accomplish, O Kaurava, at thy\r\ncommand. It will not be otherwise. Putting forth my prowess in battle and\r\nslaying all the Panchalas, I will doff my armour, O king! I swear this to\r\nthee truly. Thou thinkest that Arjuna, the son of Kunti, was worn out in\r\nbattle. O mighty-armed Kaurava! Listen to what I truly say regarding his\r\nprowess. If Savyasachin's wrath is excited, neither Gandharvas, nor\r\nYakshas nor Rakshasas can venture to bear him. At Khandavas, he\r\nencountered the divine chief of the celestials himself. The illustrious\r\nArjuna, with his shafts baffled the pouring Indra. Yakshas, and Nagas,\r\nand Daityas, and all others proud of their might, were slain by that\r\nforemost of men. That also is known to thee. On the occasion of the tale\r\nof cattle, the Gandharvas headed by Chitrasena and others were vanquished\r\nby him. That firm bowman rescued you, while you were being carried away\r\nby those Gandharvas. Nivatakavachas also, those enemies of the\r\ncelestials, that were unslayable in battle by the celestials, themselves,\r\nwere vanquished by that hero. Thousands of Danavas dwelling in\r\nHiranyapura, that tiger among men vanquished. How can human beings then\r\nwithstand him? O monarch, thou hast seen with thy own eyes how this host\r\nof thine, although exerting themselves so heroically, hath been destroyed\r\nby the son of Pandu.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto Drona who was thus applauding Arjuna, thy son,\r\nO king, angered thereat, once more said these words: 'Myself and\r\nDuhsasana, and Karna, and my maternal uncle, Sakuni, dividing this\r\nBharata host into two divisions (and taking one with us), shall to-day\r\nslay Arjuna in battle.' 'Hearing these words of his, Bharadwaja's son,\r\nlaughing, sanctioned that speech of the king and said, 'Blessings to\r\nthee! What Kshatriya is there that would slay that bull amongst\r\nKshatriyas, that unslayable one, viz., the bearer of Gandiva, that hero\r\nblazing forth with energy? Neither the Lord of treasures, nor Indra, nor\r\nYama, nor the Asuras, the Uragas, and the Rakshasas can stay Arjuna armed\r\nwith weapons. Only they that are fools say such words as those thou hast\r\nsaid, O Bharata! Who is there that would return home in safety, having\r\nencountered Arjuna in battle? As regards thyself, thou art sinful and\r\ncruel and suspicious of everybody. Even them that are employed in thy\r\nwelfare, thou art ready to rebuke in this way. Go thou against the son of\r\nKunti, for withstanding him for thy own sake. Thou art a well-born\r\nKshatriya. Thou seekest battle. Why dost thou cause all these unoffending\r\nKshatriyas to be slain? Thou art the root of this hostility. Therefore,\r\ngo thou against Arjuna. This thy maternal uncle is possessed of wisdom\r\nand observant of Kshatriya duties. O son of Gandhari, let this one\r\naddicted to gambling proceed against Arjuna in battle. This one, skilled\r\nin dice, wedded to deception, addicted to gambling, versed in cunning and\r\nimposture, this gambler conversant with the ways of deceiving, will\r\nvanquish the Pandavas in battle! With Karna in thy company, thou hadst\r\noften joyfully boasted, from folly and emptiness of understanding, in the\r\nhearing of Dhritarashtra, saying, 'O sire, myself, and Karna, and my\r\nbrother Duhsasana, these three, uniting together, will slay the sons of\r\nPandu in battle.' This thy boast was heard in every meeting of the court.\r\nAccomplish thy vow, be truthful in speech, with them. There thy mortal\r\nfoe, the son of Pandu, is staying before thee. Observe the duties of a\r\nKshatriya. Thy slaughter at the hands of Jaya would be worthy of every\r\npraise. Thou hast practised charity. Thou hast eaten (everything ever\r\ndesired by thee). Thou hast obtained wealth to the measure of thy wish.\r\nThou hast no debts. Thou hast done all that one should do. Do not fear.\r\nFight now with the son of Pandu.'

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'When three-fourths of that night had worn away, the\r\nbattle, O king, once more commenced between the Kurus and the Pandavas.\r\nBoth sides were elated with joy. Soon after, Aruna, the charioteer of\r\nSurya, weakening the splendour of the moon, appeared, causing the welkin\r\nto assume a coppery hue. The east was soon reddened with the red rays of\r\nthe sun that resembled a circular plate of gold. Then all the warriors of\r\nthe Kuru and the Pandava hosts, alighting from cars and steeds and\r\nvehicles borne by men, stood, with joined hands, facing the sun, and\r\nuttered the prayers of the twilight of dawn. The Kuru army having been\r\ndivided into two bodies, Drona, with Duryodhana before him, proceeded\r\n(with one of those divisions) against the Somakas, the Pandavas, and the\r\nPanchalas. Beholding the Kuru host divided into two bodies, Madhava\r\naddressed Arjuna and said, 'Keeping thy foes to thy left, place this\r\ndivision (commanded by Drona) to thy right. Obedient to the counsels of\r\nMadhava in respect of the Kurus, Dhananjaya moved to the left of those\r\ntwo mighty bowmen, viz., Drona, and Karna. Understanding the intentions\r\nof Krishna, that subjugator of hostile cities, viz., Bhimasena,\r\naddressing Partha who was then staying at the van of battle, said these\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"Bhimasena said, 'O Arjuna, O Vibhatsu, listen to these words of mine.\r\nThe time for that object for which Kshatriya ladies bring forth sons has\r\nnow come. If at such a time thou dost not strive to win prosperity, thou\r\nshalt then act meanly like a veritable wretch. Putting forth thy prowess,\r\npay the debt thou owest to Truth, Prosperity, Virtue, and Fame! O\r\nforemost of warriors, pierce this division, and keep these to thy right.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus urged by Bhima and Kesava, Savyasachin\r\nprevailing over Drona and Karna, began to resist the foe all round. Many\r\nforemost of Kshatriyas (among the Kurus), putting forth all their\r\nprowess, failed to withstand Arjuna who advanced at the very van of his\r\ntroops, and who, like a raging conflagration, was consuming the foremost\r\nones among his foes. Then Duryodhana and Karna, and Sakuni, the son of\r\nSuvala, covered Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, with showers of shafts. Baffling\r\nthe weapons of all those warriors, that foremost of all persons\r\nwell-skilled in weapons, O monarch, covered them (in return) with his\r\nshafts. Aiming at their weapons with his (and thus baffling them all),\r\nArjuna, endued with great lightness of hand and possessing a complete\r\ncontrol over his senses, pierced every one of those warriors with ten\r\nkeen-pointed shafts. The welkin was then covered with dust. Thick showers\r\nof arrows fell. Darkness set in, and a loud and terrible uproar arose.\r\nWhen such was the state of things, neither the welkin, nor the earth, nor\r\nthe points of the compass, could any longer be seen. Stupefied by the\r\ndust, all the troops became blind. Neither the foe, O king, nor we, could\r\ndistinguish each other. For this reason, the kings began to fight, guided\r\nby conjecture and the names they uttered. Deprived of their cars,\r\ncar-warriors, O king, encountering one another, lost all order and became\r\na tangled mass. Their steeds killed and drivers slain, many of them,\r\nbecoming inactive, preserved their lives and looked exceedingly\r\naffrighted. Slain steeds with riders deprived of lives were seen to lie\r\non slain elephants as if stretched on mountain-breasts. Then Drona,\r\nmoving away from that battle towards the north took up his station\r\nthere., and seemed to resemble a smokeless fire. Beholding him move away\r\nfrom the battle towards the north, the Pandava troops, O king, began to\r\ntremble. Indeed, beholding Drona resplendent and handsome and blazing\r\nwith energy, the enemy, inspired with fright became pale and wavered on\r\nthe field, O Bharata! While summoning the hostile army to battle, and\r\nlooking like an elephant in rut, the enemy became perfectly hopeless of\r\nvanquishing him, like the Danavas hopeless of vanquishing Vasava. Some\r\namong them became perfectly cheerless, and some, endued with energy,\r\nbecame inspired with wrath. And some were filled with wonder, and some\r\nbecame incapable of brooking (the challenge). And some of the kings\r\nsqueezed their hands, and some deprived of their senses by rage, bit\r\ntheir lips. And some whirled their weapons, and some rubbed their arms;\r\nand some, possessed of great energy and souls under complete control,\r\nrushed against Drona. The Panchalas particularly, afflicted with the\r\nshafts of Drona, O monarch, though suffering great pain, continued to\r\ncontend in battle.[247] Then Drupada and Virata proceeded, in that\r\nbattle, against Drona, that invincible warrior, who was thus careering on\r\nthe field. Then, O king, the three grandsons of Drupada, and those mighty\r\nbowmen, viz., the Chedis, also proceeded against Drona in that encounter.\r\nDrona, with three sharp shafts, took the lives of the three grandsons of\r\nDrupada. Deprived of lives, the princes fell down on the earth. Drona\r\nnext vanquished in that battle the Chedis, the Kaikeyas, and the\r\nSrinjayas. That mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, then\r\nvanquished all Matsyas. Then Drupada, filled with wrath, and Virata, in\r\nthat battle, shot showers of shafts, O king, at Drona. Baffling that\r\narrowy shower, Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, covered both Drupada\r\nand Virata with his shafts. Shrouded by Drona, both those warriors, with\r\nrage, began to pierce him on the field of battle with their arrows. Then\r\nDrona, O monarch, filled with wrath and desire of revenge, cut off, with\r\na couple of broad-headed shafts, the bows of both his antagonists. Then\r\nVirata, filled with wrath, sped in that encounter ten lances and ten\r\nshafts at Drona from desire of slaying him. And Drupada, in anger, hurled\r\nat Drona's car a terrible dart made of iron and decked with gold and\r\nresembling a large snake. Drona cut off, with a number of sharp and\r\nbroad-headed arrows, those ten lances (of Virata), and with certain other\r\nshafts that dart (of Drupada) decked with gold and stones of lapis\r\nlazuli. Then that grinder of foes, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, with a\r\ncouple of well-tempered and broad-headed shafts, despatched both Drupada\r\nand Virata unto the abode of Yama. Upon the fall of Virata and Drupada,\r\nand the slaughter of the Kshatriyas, the Chedis, the Matsyas, and the\r\nPanchalas, and upon the fall of those three heroes, viz., the three\r\ngrandsons of Drupada, the high-souled Dhrishtadyumna, beholding those\r\nfeats of Drona, became filled with rage and grief, and swore in the midst\r\nof all the ear-warriors, saying, 'Let me lose merits of all my religious\r\nacts as also my Kshatriya and Brahma energy, if Drona escape me today\r\nwith life, or if he succeed in vanquishing me!'[248] Having taken that\r\noath in the midst of all the bowmen, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz.,\r\nthe prince of the Panchalas, supported by his own division, advanced\r\nagainst Drona. The Panchalas then began to strike Drona from one side,\r\nand Arjuna from another. Duryodhana, and Karna, and Sakuni, the son of\r\nSuvala, and the uterine brothers of Duryodhana (stationed), according to\r\ntheir precedence, began to protect Drona in battle. Drona being thus\r\nprotected in battle by those illustrious warriors, the Panchalas though\r\nstruggling vigorously, could not even gaze at him. Then Bhimasena, O\r\nsire, became highly angry with Dhrishtadyumna and, O bull among men, that\r\nson of Pandu pierced Dhrishtadyumna with these fierce words:[249]\r\n\r\n\"Bhimasena said, 'What man is there who being regarded as a Kshatriya and\r\nwho taking his birth in the race of Drupada and who being the foremost of\r\nall persons possessing a knowledge of weapons, would only thus look at\r\nhis foe stationed before him? What man having seen his sire and son\r\nslain, and especially, having sworn such an oath in the midst of the\r\nking, would thus be indifferent to his enemy? Yonder stands Drona like a\r\nfire swelling with its own energy. Indeed, with bow and arrows\r\nconstituting his fuel, he is consuming with his energy all the\r\nKshatriyas. Soon will he annihilate the Pandava army. Stand ye (as\r\nspectators) and behold my feat. Against Drona himself will I proceed.\r\nHaving said these words, Vrikodara, filled with rage, penetrated into\r\nDrona's array, began to afflict and rout that host. Then the\r\nPanchalaprince Dhrishtadyumna, also, penetrating into that large host,\r\nengaged himself with Drona in battle. The battle became furious. Such a\r\nfierce encounter we had never seen or heard of before, O king, as that\r\nwhich now took place at sunrise of that day. The cars, O sire, were seen\r\nto be entangled with one another. The bodies of embodied creatures\r\ndeprived of lives were scattered all over the field. Some, while\r\nproceeding towards another part of the field, were, on the way, assailed\r\nby others. Some, while flying away, were struck on their backs, and\r\nothers on their sides. That general engagement continued to rage\r\nfiercely. Soon, however, the morning sun rose.'"

      "content": "\"Sanjaya continued, 'The warrior, O king, thus clad in mail on the field\r\nof battle, adored the thousand-rayed Aditya as he rose at morn. When the\r\nthousand-rayed luminary, of splendour bright, as burning gold, arose, and\r\nthe world became illumined, the battle once more commenced. The same\r\nsoldiers that were engaged with each other before the sunrise, once more\r\nfought with each other, O Bharata, after, the rise of the sun. Horsemen\r\nengaged with car-warriors, and elephants with horsemen, and foot-soldiers\r\nwith elephants and horsemen with horsemen, O bull of Bharata's race.\r\nSometimes, unitedly and sometimes separately, the warriors, fell upon one\r\nanother in battle. Having fought vigorously in the night, many, tired\r\nwith exertion, and weak with hunger and thirst became deprived of their\r\nsenses. The uproar made of the blare of conchs, the beat of drums, the\r\nroar of elephants, and the twang of out-stretched bows drawn with force\r\ntouched the very heavens, O king! The noise made also by rushing infantry\r\nand falling weapons, and neighing steeds and rolling cars, and shouting\r\nand roaring of warriors, became tremendous. That loud noise increasing\r\nevery minute, reached the heavens. The groans and wails of pain, on\r\nfalling and fallen foot-soldiers and car-warriors and elephants, became\r\nexceedingly loud and pitiable as these were heard on the field. When the\r\nengagement became general, both side slew each other's own men and\r\nanimals. Hurled from the hands of heroes upon warriors and elephants,\r\nheaps of swords were seen on the field, resembling heaps of cloths on the\r\nwashing ground. The sound, again, of uplifted and descending swords in\r\nheroic arms resembled that of cloths thrashed for wash. That general\r\nengagement then, in which the warriors encountered one another with\r\nswords and scimitars and lances and battle-axes, became exceedingly\r\ndreadful. The heroic combatants caused a river there, that ran its course\r\ntowards the regions of the dead. The blood of elephants and steeds and\r\nhuman beings formed its current. Weapons formed its fish in profusion. It\r\nwas miry with blood and flesh. Wails of grief and pain formed its roar.\r\nBanners and cloth formed its froth. Afflicted with shafts and darts, worn\r\nwith exertion, spent with toil on the (previous) night, and exceedingly\r\nweakened, elephants and steeds, with limbs perfectly motionless, stood on\r\nthe field. With their arms (in beautiful attitudes) and with their\r\nbeautiful coats of mail, and heads decked with beautiful ear-rings, the\r\nwarriors, adorned with implements of battle, looked exceedingly\r\nresplendent.[250] At that time, in consequence of the carnivorous animals\r\nand the dead and the dying, there was no path for the cars all over the\r\nfield. Afflicted with shafts steeds of the noblest breed and high mettle,\r\nresembling elephants (in size and strength), worn out with toil, were\r\nseen to tremble with great effort, as they drew vehicles whose wheels had\r\nsunk in the earth. The whole of that host, O Bharata, resembling the\r\nocean for vastness, then became agitated, and afflicted, inspired with\r\nterror, with the exception only of Drona and Arjuna. Those two became the\r\nrefuge, these two became the saviours, of the warriors of their\r\nrespective sides. Others, encountering these two proceeded to the abode\r\nof Yama. Then the vast host of the Kurus became greatly agitated, and the\r\nPanchalas, huddled together, became no longer distinguishable. During\r\nthat great carnage of the Kshatriyas on earth, on that field of battle,\r\nenhancing the terrors of the timid and looking like a crematorium neither\r\nKarna, nor Drona, nor Arjuna, nor Yudhishthira, nor Bhimasena, nor the\r\ntwins, nor the Panchala prince, nor Satyaki, nor Duhsasana, nor Drona's\r\nson, nor Duryodhana nor Suvala's son, nor Kripa, nor the ruler of the\r\nMadras, nor Kritavarman, nor others, nor my own self, nor the earth, nor\r\npoints of the compass, could be seen, O king, for all of them, mingled\r\nwith the troops, were shrouded by clouds of dust. During the progress of\r\nthat fierce and terrible battle, when that dusty cloud arose, all thought\r\nthat night had once more come over the scene. Neither the Kauravas, nor\r\nthe Panchalas, nor the Pandavas, could be distinguished, nor the points\r\nof the compass, nor the welkin, nor the earth, nor even land nor uneven\r\nland. The warriors, desirous of victory, slew foes and friends, in fact,\r\nall whom they could perceive by the touch of their hands. The earthly\r\ndust that had arisen was soon dispelled by the winds that blew, and\r\ndrenched by the blood that was shed. Elephants and steeds and\r\ncar-warriors and foot-soldiers, bathed in blood, looked beautiful like\r\nthe (celestial) forest of Parijata. Then Duryodhana, Karna, Drona and\r\nDuhsasana, these four (Kauravas) warriors engaged in battle with four of\r\nthe Pandava warriors, Duryodhana and his brothers, encountered the twins\r\n(Nakula and Sahadeva). And Radha's son engaged himself with Vrikodara,\r\nand Arjuna with the son of Bharadwaja, all the troops, from every side,\r\nlooked on that terrible encounter. The car-warriors (of both armies\r\nquietly) beheld that beautiful, that superhuman engagement between those\r\nfierce and foremost of car-warriors conversant with every mode of\r\nwarfare, riding on their own beautiful cars that performed diverse\r\ndelightful evolutions. Endued with great prowess, struggling vigorously,\r\nand each solicitous of vanquishing the other, they covered each other\r\nwith showers of shafts, like the clouds at the close of summer (pouring\r\ntorrents of rain). Those bulls among men, riding on their cars of solar\r\neffulgence, looked beautiful like congregated masses of clouds in the\r\nautumnal sky. Then those warriors, O monarch, filled with wrath and\r\ndesire of revenge, mighty bowmen all, challenging, rushed at one another\r\nwith great vigour like infuriated leaders of elephantine herds. Verily, O\r\nking, death does not take place till its hour comes, since all those\r\nwarriors did not simultaneously perish in that battle. Strewn with lopped\r\noff arms and legs, and heads decked with beautiful ear-rings, and bows\r\nand arrows and lances and scimitars and battle-axes and (other kinds of)\r\naxes, and Nalihas and razor-headed arrows and cloth-yard shafts and darts\r\nand diverse kinds of beautiful armour, and beautiful cars broken into\r\npieces, and slain elephants and standardless cars broken like cities, and\r\nvehicles dragged hither and thither with the speed of the wind by\r\ndriverless steeds in great fright, and a large number of well-decked\r\nwarriors of great courage, and fallen fans and coats of mail and\r\nstandards, and ornaments and robes and fragrant garlands, and chains of\r\ngold and diadems and crowns and head-gears and rows of bells, and jewels\r\nworn on breasts, and cuirasses and collars and gems that adorn\r\nhead-gears, the field of battle looked beautiful like the firmament\r\nbespangled with stars.'\r\n\r\n'Then there occured an encounter between Duryodhana, filled with wrath\r\nand desire of revenge, and Nakula filled with the same feelings. Madri's\r\nson cheerfully shooting hundreds of shafts, placed thy son on his right.\r\nAt this loud cheers were bestowed upon him. Placed on the right by his\r\ncousin-brother in wrath, thy son king Duryodhana, filled with rage,\r\nbegan, in battle, to wonderfully counteract Nakula from that very side.\r\nThereupon, Nakula, endued with great energy and acquainted with the\r\ndiverse course (in which a car may be conducted), began to resist thy son\r\nwho was engaged in counteracting him from his right. Duryodhana, however,\r\nafflicting Nakula with showers of shafts and resisting him on every side,\r\ncaused him to turn back. All the troops applauded that feat (of thy son).\r\nThen Nakula, addressing thy son, said, 'Wait, Wait, recollecting all his\r\nwoes caused by thy evil counsels.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Then Duhsasana, filled with wrath, rushed against\r\nSahadeva, causing the earth to tremble with the fierce speed of his car,\r\nO Madri's son, however, that crusher of foes, with a broad-headed arrow,\r\nquickly cut of the head, decked with the head-gear of his rushing\r\nantagonist's driver. From the celerity with which that act was\r\naccomplished by Sahadeva, neither Duhsasana nor any of the troops knew\r\nthat the driver's head had been cut off. The reins being no longer held\r\nby anybody, the steeds ran at their will. It was then that Duhsasana knew\r\nthat his driver had been slain. Conversant with the management of steeds,\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, himself restraining his steeds in that\r\nbattle fought beautifully and with great activity and skill. That feat of\r\nhis was applauded by friends and foes, since riding on that driverless\r\ncar, he careered fearlessly in that battle. Then Sahadeva pierced those\r\nsteeds with keen shafts. Afflicted with those shafts, they quickly ran\r\naway, careering hither and thither. For catching hold of the reins, he\r\nonce laid aside his bow, and then he took up his bow for using it, lying\r\naside the reins. During those opportunities the son of Madri covered him\r\nwith arrows. Then Karna, desirous of rescuing thy son, rushed to that\r\nspot. Thereupon, Vrikodara, with great care, pierced Karna in the chest\r\nand arms with three broad-headed shafts sped from his bow drawn to its\r\nfullest stretch. Struck with those shafts like a snake with a stick,\r\nKarna stopped and began to resist Bhimasena, shooting keen shafts.\r\nThereupon, a fierce battle took place between Bhima and Radha's son. Both\r\nof them roared like bulls, and the eyes of both were expanded (with\r\nrage). Excited with wrath, and rushing towards each other, with great\r\nspeed, they roared at each other. Those two delighters, in battle were\r\nthen very close to each other. So near were they that they could not\r\neasily shoot their shafts at each other. Thereupon, an encounter with\r\nmaces happened. Bhimasena speedily broke with his mace the Kuvara of\r\nKarna's car. That feat of his, O king, seemed highly wonderful. Then the\r\nvaliant son of Radha, taking up a mace, hurled it at Bhima's car. Bhima,\r\nhowever, broke it with the mace of his own. Then taking up a heavy mace,\r\nonce more, Bhima hurled it at Adhiratha's son. Karna struck that mace\r\nwith numerous shafts of beautiful wings, sped with great force, and once\r\nagain with other shafts, Thus struck with Karna's shafts, the mace turned\r\nback towards Bhima, like a snake afflicted with incantations. With the\r\nrebound of that mace, the huge standard of Bhima, broke and fell down.\r\nStruck with that same mace, Bhima's driver also became deprived of his\r\nsenses. Then Bhima, mad with rage, sped eight shafts at Karna, and his\r\nstandard and bow, and leathern fence, O Bharata. The mighty Bhimasena,\r\nthat slayer of hostile heroes, with the greatest care, O Bharata, cut\r\noff, with those keen shafts, the standards, the bow, and the leathern\r\nfence of Karna. The latter then, viz., the son of Radha, taking up\r\nanother invincible and gold-decked bow, shot a number of shafts, and\r\nquickly slew Bhima's steeds of the hue of bears, and then his two\r\ndrivers. When his car was thus injured, Bhima, that chastiser of foes,\r\nquickly jumped into the car of Nakula like a lion jumping down upon a\r\nmountain summit.'\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Drona and Arjuna, those two foremost of car-warriors,\r\npreceptor and pupil, both skilled in weapon, O monarch, fought with each\r\nother in battle, stupefying the eyes and minds of men with their\r\nlightness in the use of weapons and the sureness of their aim, and with\r\nthe motions of their cars. Beholding that battle, the like of which had\r\nnever been witnessed before, between preceptor and pupil, the other\r\nwarriors abstained from fighting with each other and trembled. Each of\r\nthose heroes, displaying beautiful revolutions of his car, wished to\r\nplace the other on his right. The warriors present there beheld their\r\nprowess and became filled with wonder. Indeed, that great battle between\r\nDrona and the son of Pandu resembled that, O monarch, between a couple of\r\nhawks in the welkin for the sake of a piece of meat. Whatever feats Drona\r\nperformed for vanquishing the son of Kunti, were all counteracted by\r\nArjuna's performing similar feats. When Drona failed to gain any\r\nascendency over the son of Pandu, the son of Bharadwaja, that warrior\r\nacquainted with the course of all weapons, invoked into existence the\r\nAindra, the Pasupata, the Tvashtra, the Vayavya, and the Yamya weapons.\r\nAs soon as those weapons, issued from Drona's bow, Dhananjaya destroyed\r\nthem quickly. When his weapons were thus duly destroyed by Arjuna with\r\nhis own weapons, Drona shrouded the son of Pandu with the mightiest of\r\ncelestial weapons. Every weapon, however, that Drona shot at Partha from\r\ndesire of vanquishing the latter, was shot by Partha in return for\r\nbaffling it. Seeing all his weapons, even the celestial ones, duly\r\nbaffled by Arjuna, Drona applauded the latter in his heart. That\r\nchastiser of foes, O Bharata, regarded himself superior to every person\r\nin the world acquainted with weapons, in consequence of Arjuna having\r\nbeen his pupil. Thus resisted by Partha in the midst of all those\r\nillustrious warriors, Drona, struggling with vigour, cheerfully resisted\r\nArjuna (in return), wondering all the while. Then the celestials and\r\nGandharvas in thousands, and Rishis and bodies of Siddhas, were seen on\r\nall sides in the welkin. Filled with (those as also with) Apsaras and\r\nYakshas and Rakshasas, it once more seemed that the welkin was darkened\r\nby gathering clouds. An invisible voice, fraught with the praises of\r\nDrona and the high-souled Partha, was heard to repeatedly course through\r\nthe firmament. When in consequence of the weapons shot by Drona and\r\nPartha all sides seemed ablaze with light, the Siddhas and the Rishis\r\nthat were present, said, 'This is no human nor Asura, nor Rakshasa, nor\r\ncelestial, nor Gandharva battle. Without doubt this is a high Brahma\r\nencounter. This battle is exceedingly beautiful and highly wonderful. We\r\nhave never seen or heard of its like. Now, the preceptor prevails over\r\nthe son of Pandu, and then the son of Pandu prevails over Drona. No one\r\ncan find any difference between them. If Rudra, dividing his own self\r\ninto two portions, fights, himself with himself, then may an instance be\r\nhad to match this. Nowhere else can an instance be found to match it.\r\nScience, gathered in one place, exists in the preceptor; science and\r\nmeans are in the son of Pandu. Heroism, in one place, is in Drona;\r\nheroism and might are in the son of Pandu. None of these warriors can be\r\nwithstood by foes in battle. If they wish, both of them can destroy the\r\nuniverse with the gods. Beholding those two bulls among men, all\r\ninvisible and visible creatures said these words. The high-souled Drona\r\nthen, in that battle, invoked into existence the Brahma weapon,\r\nafflicting Partha and all invisible beings. Thereupon, the earth with the\r\nmountains and waters and trees trembled. Fierce winds began to blow. The\r\nseas swelled in agitation. The combatants of the Kurus and the Pandava\r\narmies, as also all other creatures, became inspired with fear, when that\r\nillustrious warrior uplifted that weapon. The Partha, O monarch,\r\nfearlessly baffled that weapon by a Brahma weapon of his own, at which\r\nall that agitation in nature was speedily pacified. At last, when none of\r\nthem could vanquish his antagonist in combat, a general engagement took\r\nplace between the hosts, causing a great confusion on the field. During\r\nthe progress of that dreadful battle between Drona and the son of Pandu\r\n(as also of that general engagement), once more, O king, nothing could be\r\ndistinguished. The welkin became covered with dense showers of shafts, as\r\nif with masses of clouds, and creatures ranging in the air could no\r\nlonger find a passage through their element.\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'During that fearful carnage of men and steeds and\r\nelephants, Duhsasana, O king, encountered Dhrishtadyumna. Mounted upon\r\nhi, golden car and exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Duhsasana,\r\nthe Panchala prince wrathfully showered his shafts upon thy son's steeds.\r\nCovered with the shafts of Prishata's son, O king, Duhsasana's car, with\r\nstandard and driver, soon became invisible. Afflicted with those showers\r\nof arrows, Duhsasana, O monarch, became unable to stay before the\r\nillustrious prince of the Panchalas. Forcing, by means of his shafts,\r\nDuhsasana to turn back Pritha's son, scattering his arrows, proceeded\r\nagainst Drona in that battle. At the time Hridika's son, Kritavarman,\r\nwith three of his uterine brothers, appeared on the scene and attempted\r\nto oppose Dhrishtadyumna. Those bulls among men, however, viz., the\r\ntwins, Nakula and Sahadeva following in the wake of Dhrishtadyumna who\r\nwas thus proceeding like a blazing fire towards Drona, began to protect\r\nhim. Then, all those great car-warriors, endued with might and excited\r\nwith rage, began to strike one another, making death their goal. Of pure\r\nsouls and pure conduct, O king, and keeping heaven in view, they fought\r\naccording to righteous methods, desirous of vanquishing one another. Of\r\nstainless lineage and stainless acts, and endued with great intelligence,\r\nthose rulers of men, keeping heaven in view, fought fair battles with\r\nanother. There was nothing unfair in that fight and no weapon was used\r\nthat was regarded as unfair. No barbed arrows, nor those called nalikas,\r\nnor those that are poisoned, nor those with heads, made of horns, nor\r\nthose equipped with many pointed heads, nor those made of the bones of\r\nbulls and elephants, nor those having two heads, nor those having rusty\r\nheads, nor those that are not straight going, were used by any of\r\nthem.[251] All of them used simple and fair weapons and desired to win\r\nboth fame and region of great blessedness by fighting fairly. Between\r\nthose four warriors of thy army and those three of the Pandava side, the\r\nbattle that took place was exceedingly dreadful but divested of\r\neverything unfair. Then Dhrishtadyumna, exceedingly quick in the use of\r\nweapons, beholding those brave and mighty car warriors of thy army\r\nchecked by the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), proceeded towards Drona.\r\nChecked by those two lions among men, those four heroic warriors\r\nencountered the former like the wind assailing a couple of mountains\r\n(standing on their way). Each of the twins--those great car-warriors--was\r\nengaged with a couple of arrows against Drona. Beholding the invincible\r\nprince of the Panchalas proceeding against Drona, and those four heroes\r\n(of his own army) engaged with the twins, Duryodhana, O monarch, rushed\r\nto that spot, scattering showers of blood-drinking arrows. Seeing this,\r\nSatyaki quickly approached the Kuru king. Those two tigers among men,\r\nviz., the two descendants of Kuru and Madhu, approaching each other,\r\nbecame desirous of striking each other in battle. Recalling to mind their\r\nbehaviour towards each other in childhood and reflecting with pleasure on\r\nthe same, they gazed at each other and smiled repeatedly. 'Then king\r\nDuryodhana (mentally), blaming his own conduct, addressed his ever dear\r\nfriend Satyaki, and said, 'Fie on wrath, O friend, and fie on\r\nvindictiveness! Fie on Kshatriya usage, and fie on might and prowess,\r\nsince thou aimest thy weapons at me, and I too am aiming at thee, O bull\r\nof Sini's race! In those days thou wert dearer to me than life itself,\r\nand I also was such to thee! Alas, all those acts of childhood that I\r\nremember, of both thyself and mine, became quite insignificant in the\r\nfield of battle! Alas, moved by wrath and convetousness, we are here\r\nto-day for fighting against each other, O thou of the Satwata race!' Unto\r\nhim who said those words, O king, Satyaki, conversant with high weapons,\r\ntaking up some keen arrows, smilingly replied, 'This is no assembly, O\r\nprince, nor the abode of our preceptor, where in former days we sported\r\ntogether.' Duryodhana answered, 'Where have those sports of our childhood\r\ngone, O bull of Sini's race, and, alas, how has this battle now come upon\r\nus? It seems that the influence of Time is irresistible. (Urged though we\r\nare) by desire of wealth, what use, however, have we of wealth that,\r\nassembled together, we are now engaged in battle, moved by the avarice of\r\nwealth.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Unto king Duryodhana who said so, Satyaki replied, 'This\r\nhas always been the usage of the Kshatriyas that they have to fight even\r\nagainst their preceptors. If I am dear to thee, O king, then slay me\r\nwithout any delay. Through thee, O bull of Bharata's race, I shall then\r\nenter the region of the righteous. Exhibit, without delay, all thy might\r\nand prowess. I do not desire to witness this great calamity of friends.'\r\nHaving replied and reasoned thus, Satyaki, O monarch, fearlessly and in\r\nutter disregard of life, quickly advanced against Duryodhana. Beholding\r\nhim advance, thy son received him; indeed, O king, thy son poured on him\r\nof Sini's race a perfect shower of arrows. Then commenced a terrible\r\nbattle between those lions of Kuru's and Madhu's races, resembling an\r\nencounter between an elephant and a lion. Then Duryodhana, filled with\r\nwrath, pierced the invincible Satyaki with many keen arrows, shot from\r\nhis bow drawn to its fullest stretch. Satyaki quickly pierced the Kuru\r\nprince in return with fifty keen shafts in that battle and once more with\r\ntwenty, and again with ten shafts. Then, in that encounter, O king, thy\r\nson, smiling the while, pierced Satyaki in return with thirty arrows shot\r\nfrom his bowstring drawn to his ear. Shooting then a razor-headed arrow,\r\nhe cut off in twain the bow, with arrow fixed thereon, of Satyaki. Endued\r\nwith great lightness of hand, the latter then, taking up a tougher bow,\r\nshot showers of shafts at thy son. As those lines of arrows advanced for\r\ncompassing the death of Duryodhana, the latter, O king, cut them in\r\npieces, at which the troops shouted loudly. With great swiftness, the\r\nKuru king afflicted Satyaki with three and seventy shafts, equipped with\r\nwings of gold and steeped in oil and shot from his bow drawn to its\r\nfullest stretch. All those arrows of Duryodhana, as also his bow, with\r\narrow fixed thereon, Satyaki quickly cut off. The Satwata hero then\r\npoured showers of shafts on his antagonist. Deeply pierced by Satyaki and\r\nfeeling great pain, Duryodhana, O king, in great distress, sought shelter\r\nin another car. Having rested awhile and refreshed himself, thy son once\r\nmore advanced against Satyaki, shooting showers of shafts at the latter's\r\ncar. Smilingly, O king, Satyaki ceaselessly shot multitudes of shafts at\r\nDuryodhana's car. The shafts of both mingled with one another in the\r\nwelkin. In consequence of those arrows thus shot by both, falling fast on\r\nevery side, loud sounds, like those of a raging fire consuming a mighty\r\nforest, arose there. With thousands of arrows shot by both, the earth was\r\ndensely covered. The welkin also became filled therewith. Beholding then\r\nthat foremost of car-warriors, viz., that hero of Madhu's race, to be\r\nmightier than Duryodhana, Karna rushed to that spot, desirous of rescuing\r\nthy son. Mighty Bhimasena, however, could not brook that attempt of\r\nKarna. He, therefore, quickly proceeded against Karna, shooting\r\ninnumerable shafts. Cutting off all those shafts of Bhima with the\r\ngreatest ease, Karna cut off Bhima's bow, arrows and driver also, with\r\nhis own shafts. Then, Pandu's son, Bhima, filled with rage, took up a\r\nmace and crushed the bow, standard, and driver of his antagonist in that\r\nencounter. The mighty Bhima also broke one of the wheels of Karna's car.\r\nKarna, however, stood on that car of his, which had one of his wheels\r\nbroken, immovable as (Meru), the king of mountains. That beautiful car of\r\nhis which had now only one wheel, was borne by his steeds, like the\r\nsingle wheeled car of Surya, drawn by the seven celestial steeds.\r\nIncapable of brooking the feats of Bhimasena, Karna continued to fight\r\nwith the latter, using diverse kinds of shafts in profusion and diverse\r\nkinds of other weapons in that encounter. Bhimasena also filled with\r\nwrath, continued to fight with the Suta's son. When the engagement became\r\ngeneral ant confused, (Yudhishthira) the son of Dharma, addressing all\r\nthe foremost of warriors among the Panchalas and the Matsyas, said, 'They\r\nthat are our life, they that are our heads, they amongst us that are\r\nendued with great strength, those bulls among men are all engaged with\r\nthe Dhartarashtras. Why do ye then stand thus, as if stupefied and\r\ndeprived of your senses? Proceed thither where those car-warriors of my\r\narmy are fighting. Driving away your fears and keeping in view the duties\r\nof Kshatriyas (engage in fight), for then conquering or slain ye will\r\ngain desirable goals. If you prove victors, you may perform diverse\r\nsacrifices with profuse gifts to Brahmanas. If, on the other hand, you\r\nare slain, becoming then equals of the celestials, you will win many\r\nregions of blessedness. Thus urged by the king, those heroic and mighty\r\ncar-warriors engaged in battle, observant of Kshatriya duties, quickly\r\nproceeded against Drona. The Panchalas then, from one side, assailed\r\nDrona with innumerable arrows, while others headed by Bhimasena began to\r\nresist him from another side. The Pandavas had three crooked-minded\r\nmighty car-warriors amongst them. They were Bhimasena and the twins\r\n(Nakula and Sahadeva). These addressed Dhananjaya loudly and said, 'Rush,\r\nO Arjuna, with speed and drive away the Kurus from Drona's vicinity. If\r\nthe preceptor can be derived of his protectors, the Panchalas may then\r\nslay him easily.' Thus addressed, Partha suddenly rushed against the\r\nKauravas, while Drona rushed against the Panchalas headed by\r\nDhrishtadyumna. Indeed, on that the fifth day (of Drona's command) those\r\nheroic combatants, O Bharata, were grounded and crushed with\r\ngreat-celerity (by Bharadwaja's son.)\""

The great car-warriors of the Pandava army, endued with\r\nmight and energy, though slaughtered, O king, by Drona's weapons, were\r\nnot yet afraid of Drona in that battle. Indeed, O monarch, those mighty\r\ncar-warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the Srinjayas, all rushed against\r\nDrona himself, for fighting with him. Loud and fierce were the yells they\r\nuttered as they rushed towards Drona for encompassing him on all sides\r\nand were slaughtered by him with shafts and darts. Beholding the\r\nslaughter of the Panchalas in that battle by the illustrious Drona, and\r\nseeing his, weapons overwhelm all sides, fear entered the hearts of the\r\nPandavas. Beholding that dreadful carnage of steeds and human beings in\r\nthat battle, the Pandavas, O monarch, became hopeless of victory. (They\r\nbegan to say unto each other) 'Is it not evident that Drona, that warrior\r\nconversant with the mightiest of weapons, will consume us all like a\r\nraging conflagration consuming a heap of straw in the season of spring?\r\nThere is none competent to even look at him in battle. Conversant with\r\nthe ways of morality, Arjuna (who alone is a match for him) will not\r\nfight with him.' Beholding the sons of Kunti afflicted with the shafts of\r\nDrona and inspired with fear, Kesava, endued with great intelligence and,\r\ndevoted to their welfare, addressed Arjuna and said, 'This foremost of\r\nall bowmen is incapable of being ever vanquished by force in battle, by\r\nthe very gods with Vasava at their head. When, however, he lays aside his\r\nweapons, he becomes capable of being slain on the field even by human\r\nbeings. Casting aside virtue, ye sons of Pandu, adopt now some\r\ncontrivance for gaining the victory, so that Drona of the golden car may\r\nnot slay us all in battle. Upon the full of (his son) Aswatthaman he will\r\ncease to fight, I think. Let sonic man, therefore, tell him that\r\nAswatthaman, hath been slain in battle.' This advice, however, O kin was\r\nnot approved by Kunti's son, Dhananjaya. Others approved of it. But\r\nYudhishthira accepted it with great difficulty. Then the mighty-armed\r\nBhima, O king, slew with a mace a foe-crushing, terrible and huge\r\nelephant named Aswatthaman, of his own army, belonging to Indravarman,\r\nthe chief of the Malavas. Approaching Drona then in that battle with some\r\nbashfulness Bhimasena began to exclaim aloud, 'Aswatthaman hath been\r\nslain.' That elephant named Aswatthaman having been thus slain, Bhima\r\nspoke of Aswatthaman's slaughter. Keeping the true fact within his mind,\r\nhe said what was untrue, Hearing those highly disagreeable words of Bhima\r\nand reflecting upon them, Drona's limbs seemed to dissolve like sands in\r\nwater. Recollecting however, the prowess of his son, he soon came to\r\nregard that intelligence as false. Hearing, therefore, of his slaughter,\r\nDrona did not become unmanned. Indeed, soon recovering his senses, he\r\nbecame comforted, remembering that his son was incapable of being\r\nresisted by foes. Rushing towards the son of Prishata and desirous of\r\nslaying that hero who had been ordained as his slayer, he covered him\r\nwith a thousand keen shafts, equipped with kanka feathers. Then twenty\r\nthousand Panchala car-warriors of great energy covered him, while he was\r\nthus careering in battle, with their shafts. Completely shrouded with\r\nthose shafts, we could not any longer see that great car-warrior who then\r\nresembled, O monarch, the sun, covered with clouds in the season of\r\nrains. Filled with wrath and desirous of compassing the destruction of\r\nthose brave Panchalas, that mighty car-warrior, that scorcher of foes,\r\nviz., Drona, dispelling all those shafts of the Panchalas, then invoked\r\ninto existence the Brahma weapon. At that time, Drona looked resplendent\r\nlike a smokeless, blazing fire. Once more filled with rage the valiant\r\nson of Bharadwaja slaughtering all the Somakas, seemed to be invested\r\nwith great splendour. In that dreadful battle, he felled the heads of the\r\nPanchalas and cut off their massive arms, looking like spiked maces and\r\ndecked with golden ornaments. Indeed, those Kshatriyas, slaughtered in\r\nbattle by Bharadwaja's son fell down on the earth and lay scattered like\r\ntrees uprooted by the tempest. In consequence of fallen elephants and\r\nsteeds, O Bharata, the earth, miry with flesh and blood, became\r\nimpassable. Having slain twenty thousand Panchala car-warriors, Drona, in\r\nthat battle, shone resplendent like a smokeless, blazing fire. Once more\r\nfilled with rage, the valiant son of Bharadwaja cut off, with a\r\nbroad-headed arrow, the head of Vasudana from his trunk. Once more\r\nslaying five hundred Matsyas, and six thousand elephants, he slew ten\r\nthousand steeds. Beholding Drona stationed on the field for the\r\nextermination of the Kshatriya race, the Rishis Viswamitra, and\r\nJamadagni, and Bharadwaja, and Gautama, and Vasishtha, and Kasyapa, and\r\nAtri, and the Srikatas, the Prisnis, Garga, the Valkhilyas, the Marichis,\r\nthe descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, and diverse other sages of subtle\r\nforms quickly came thither, with the Bearer of sacrificial libations at\r\ntheir head, and, desirous of taking Drona unto the region of Brahman,\r\naddressed Drona, that ornament of battle, and said, 'Thou art fighting\r\nunrighteously. The hour of thy death is come. Laying aside thy weapons in\r\nbattle, O Drona, behold us stationed here. After this, it behoveth thee\r\nnot to perpetrate such exceedingly cruel deeds. Thou art versed in the\r\nVedas and their branches. Thou art devoted to the duties enjoined by\r\ntruth, especially, thou art a Brahmana. Such acts do not become thee. Lay\r\naside thy weapons. Drive away the film of error that shrouds thee. Adhere\r\nnow to the eternal path. The period for which thou art to dwell in the\r\nworld of men is now full. Thou hast, with the Brahma weapon, burnt men on\r\nearth that are unacquainted with weapons. This act that thou hast\r\nperpetrated, O regenerate one, is not righteous. Lay aside thy weapons in\r\nbattle without delay, O Drona, do not wait longer on earth. Do not, O\r\nregenerate one, perpetrate such a sinful act.' Hearing these words of\r\ntheir as also those spoken by Bhimasena, and beholding Dhrishtadyumna\r\nbefore him, Drona became exceedingly cheerless in battle. Burning with\r\ngrief and exceedingly afflicted, he enquired of Kunti's son Yudhishthira\r\nas to whether his son (Aswatthaman) had been slain or not. Drona firmly\r\nbelieved that Yudhishthira would never speak an untruth even for the sake\r\nof the sovereignty of the three worlds. For this reason, that bull among\r\nBrahmanas asked Yudhishthira and not any body else. He had hoped for\r\ntruth from Yudhishthira from the latter's infancy.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, O monarch, Govinda, knowing that Drona, that foremost of\r\nwarriors, was capable of sweeping all the Pandavas off the face of the\r\nearth, became much distressed. Addressing Yudhishthira he said, 'If Drona\r\nfighteth, filled with rage, for even half-a-day, I tell thee truly, thy\r\narmy will then be annihilated. Save us, then, from Drona. under such\r\ncircumstances, falsehood is better than truth. By telling an untruth for\r\nsaving a life, one is not touched by sin. There is no sin in untruth\r\nspoken unto women, or in marriages, or for saving king, or for rescuing a\r\nBrahmana.'[252] While Govinda and Yudhishthira were thus talking with\r\neach other, Bhimasena (addressing the king) said, 'As soon, O monarch, as\r\nI heard of the means by which the high-souled Drona might be slain,\r\nputting forth my prowess in battle, I immediately slew a mighty elephant,\r\nlike unto the elephant of Sakra himself, belonging to Indravarman, the\r\nchief of the Malavas, who was standing within thy army. I then went to\r\nDrona and told him, 'Aswatthaman has been slain, O Brahmana! Cease, then,\r\nto fight. Verily, O bull among men, the preceptor did not believe in the\r\ntruth of words. Desirous of victory as thou art, accept the advice of\r\nGovinda. Tell Drona, O King, that the son of Saradwat's daughter is no\r\nmore. Told by thee, that bull among Brahmanas will never fight. Thou, O\r\nruler of men, art reputed to be truthful in the three worlds.' Hearing\r\nthose words of Bhima and induced by the counsels of Krishna, and owing\r\nalso to the inevitability of destiny, O monarch, Yudhishthira made up his\r\nmind to say what he desired. Fearing to utter an untruth, but earnestly\r\ndesirous of victory, Yudhishthira distinctly said that Aswatthaman was\r\ndead, adding indistinctly the world elephant (after the name), Before\r\nthis, Yudhishthira's car had stayed at a height of four fingers' breadth\r\nfrom the surface of the earth; after, however, he had said that untruth,\r\nhis (vehicle and) animals touched the earth. Hearing those words from\r\nYudhishthira, the mighty car-warrior Drona, afflicted with grief, for the\r\n(supposed) death of his son, yielded to the influence of despair. By the\r\nwords, again, of the Rishis, he regarded himself a great offender against\r\nthe high-souled Pandavas. Hearing now about the death of his son, he\r\nbecame perfectly cheerless and filled with anxiety; upon beholding\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O king, that chastiser of foes could not fight as\r\nbefore.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Drona filled with great anxiety and almost\r\ndeprived of his senses by grief, Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the Panchala\r\nking, rushed at him. That hero had, for the destruction of Drona, been\r\nobtained by Drupada, that ruler of men, at a great sacrifice, from the\r\nBearer of sacrificial libations. Desirous of slaying Drona, he now took\r\nup a victory-giving and formidable bow whose twang resembled the roll of\r\nthe clouds, whose string was possessed of great strength, and which was\r\nirrefragable and celestial. And he fixed on it a fierce arrow, resembling\r\na snake of virulent poison and possessed of the splendour of fire. That\r\narrow, resembling a fire of fierce flame, while within the circle of his\r\nbow, looked like the autumnal sun of great splendour within a radiant\r\ncircle. Beholding that blazing bow bent with force by Prishata's son, the\r\ntroops regarded that to be the last hour (of the world). Seeing that\r\narrow aimed at him, the valiant son of Bharadwaja thought that the last\r\nhour of his body had come. The preceptor prepared with care to baffle\r\nthat shaft. The weapons, however, of that high-souled one, O monarch, no\r\nlonger appeared at his bidding.[253] His weapons had not been exhausted\r\nalthough he had shot them ceaselessly for four days and one night. On the\r\nexpiry, however, of the third part of that of the fifth day, his arrows\r\nbecame exhausted. Seeing the exhaustion of his arrows and afflicted with\r\ngrief on account of his son's death, and in consequence also of the\r\nunwillingness of the celestial weapons to appear at his bidding, he\r\ndesired to lay aside his weapons, as requested by the words of the Rishis\r\nalso. Though filled with great energy, he could not however, fight as\r\nbefore. Then taking up another celestial bow that Angiras had given him,\r\nand certain arrows that resembled a Brahmana's curse, he continued to\r\nfight with Dhrishtadyumna. He covered the Panchala prince with a thick\r\nshower of arrows, and filled with rage, mangled his angry antagonist.\r\nWith his own keen shafts he cut off in a hundred fragments those of the\r\nprince as also the latter's standard and bow. He then his antagonist's\r\ndriver. Then Dhrishtadyumna, smiling, took up another bow, and pierced\r\nDrona with a keen shaft in the centre of the chest. Deeply pierced\r\ntherewith and losing his self-possession in that encounter, that mighty\r\nbowman, then, with a sharp and broad-headed arrow, once more cut off\r\nDhrishtadyumna's bow. Indeed, the invincible Drona then cut off all the\r\nweapons, O king, and all the bows that his antagonist had, with the\r\nexception only of his mace and sword. Filled with rage, he then pierced\r\nthe angry Dhrishtadyumna, O chastiser of foes, nine keen arrows, capable\r\nof taking the life of every foe. Then the mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtadyumna, of immeasurable soul, invoking into existence the Brahma\r\nweapon, caused the steeds of his own car to be mingled with those of his\r\nfoes. Endued with the speed of the wind, those steeds that were red and\r\nof the hue of pigeons, O bull of Bharata's race, thus mingled together,\r\nlooked exceedingly beautiful. Indeed, O king, those steeds thus mingled\r\ntogether on the field of battle, looked beautiful like roaring clouds in\r\nthe season of rains, charged with lightning. Then that twice-born one of\r\nimmeasurable soul cut off the shaft-joints, the wheel-joints, and (other)\r\ncar-joints of Dhrishtadyumna. Deprived of his bow, and made carless and\r\nsteedless and driverless, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, fallen into great\r\ndistress, grasped a mace. Filled with rage, the mighty car-warrior,\r\nDrona, of unbaffled prowess, by means of a number of keen shafts, cut off\r\nthat mace, while it was on the point of being hurled at him. Beholding\r\nhis mace cut off by Drona with arrows, that tiger among men, (viz., the\r\nPanchala prince), took up a spotless sword and a bright shield decked\r\nwith a hundred moons. Without doubt, under those circumstances, the\r\nPanchala prince determined to make an end of that foremost of preceptors,\r\nthat high-souled warrior. Sometimes, sheltering himself in his car-box\r\nand sometimes riding on his car-shafts, the prince moved about, uplifting\r\nhis swords and whirling his bright shield. The mighty car-warrior\r\nDhrishtadyumna, desirous of achieving, from folly, a difficult feat,\r\nhoped to pierce the chest of Bharadwaja's son in that battle. Sometimes,\r\nhe stayed upon the yoke, and sometimes under the haunches of Drona's red\r\nsteeds. These movements of his were highly applauded by all the troops.\r\nIndeed, while he stayed amid the trappings of the yoke or behind those\r\nred steeds, Drona found no opportunity to strike him. All this seemed\r\nexceedingly wonderful. The movements of both Drona and Prishata's son in\r\nthat battle resembled the fight of hawk careering through the welkin for\r\na piece of meat. Then Drona, by means of a dart pierced the white steeds\r\nof his antagonist, one after another, not striking, however, the red ones\r\namongst them (that belonged to himself)[254]. Deprived of life, those\r\nsteeds of Dhrishtadyumna fell down upon the earth. Thereupon, the red\r\nsteeds of Drona himself, O king, where freed from the entanglements of\r\nDhrishtadyumna's car. Beholding his steeds slain by that foremost of\r\nBrahmanas, Prishata's sons, that mighty car-warrior, that foremost of\r\nfighters, could not brook it. Though deprived of his car, still that\r\nforemost of all swordsmen, armed with his sword, sprang towards Drona, O\r\nmonarch, like Vinata's son (Garuda) making a swoop at a snake. The form,\r\nO king, of Dhrishtadyumna at that time, when he sought to slay the son of\r\nBharadwaja, resembled the form of Vishnu himself in days of yore when at\r\nthe point of slaying Hiranyakasipu. He performed diverse evolutions, in\r\nfact. O Kauravya, the son of Prishata, careering in that battle,\r\nexhibited the well-known one and twenty different kinds of motion. Armed\r\nwith the sword, and shield in hand, Prishata's son wheeled about and\r\nwhirled his sword on high, and made side thrusts, and rushed forward, and\r\nran sideways, and leapt high, and assailed the flanks of his antagonists\r\nand receded backwards, and closed with his foes, and pressed them hard.\r\nHaving practised them well, he also showed the evolutions called Bharata,\r\nKausika Satwata, as he careened in that battle for compassing the\r\ndestruction of Drona, Beholding those beautiful evolutions of\r\nDhrishtadyumna, as he careered on the field, sword and shield in hand,\r\nall the warriors, as also the celestials assembled there, were filled\r\nwith wonder. The regenerate Drona then, shooting a thousand arrows in the\r\nthick of fight, cut off the sword of Dhrishtadyumna as also his shield,\r\ndecked with a hundred moons. Those arrows that Drona shot, while fighting\r\nfrom such a near point, were of the length of a span. Such arrows are\r\nused only in close fight. None else have arrows of that kind, except\r\nKripa, and Partha, and Aswatthaman and Karna, Pradyumna and Yuyudhana;\r\nAbhimanyu also had such arrows. Then the preceptor, desirous of slaying\r\nhis disciple who was unto him even as his own son, fixed on his\r\nbow-string a shaft endued with great impetuosity. That shaft, however,\r\nSatyaki cut off by means of ten arrows, in the very sight of thy son as\r\nalso of the high-souled Karna, as thus rescued Dhrishtadyumna who was on\r\nthe point of succumbing to Drona. Then Kesava and Dhananjaya beheld\r\nSatyaki of prowess incapable of being baffled, who, O Bharata, was thus\r\ncareering in the car-tracks (of the Kuru warriors) and within the range\r\nof the shafts of Drona and Karna and Kripa. Saying. 'Excellent,\r\nExcellent!' both of them loudly applauded Satyaki of unfading glory, who\r\nwas thus destroying the celestial weapons of all those warriors. Then\r\nKesava and Dhananjaya rushed towards the Kurus. Addressing Krishna,\r\nDhananjaya said, 'Behold, O Kesava, that perpetuator of Madhu's race,\r\nviz., Satyaki of true prowess, sporting before the preceptor and those\r\nmighty car-warriors and gladdening me and the twins and Bhima and king\r\nYudhishthira. With skill acquired by practice and without insolence,\r\nbehold that enhancer of the fame of the Vrishnis, viz., Satyaki,\r\ncareering in battle, sporting the while with those mighty car-warriors.\r\nAll these troops, as also the Siddhas (in the welkin), beholding him\r\ninvincible in battle, are filled with wonder, and applauding him, saying,\r\n'Excellent, Excellent!' Indeed, O king, the warriors of both armies all\r\napplauded the Satwata hero, for his feats.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding those feats of the Satwata hero, Duryodhana and\r\nothers, filled with rage, quickly encompassed the grandson of Sini on all\r\nsides. Kripa and Karna, of also thy sorts, O sire, in that battle,\r\nquickly approaching the grandson of Sini, began to strike him with keen\r\narrows. Then king Yudhishthira, and the two other Pandavas, viz., the two\r\nsons of Madri and Bhimasena of great might surrounded Satyaki (for\r\nprotecting him). Karna, and the mighty car-warrior Kripa, and Duryodhana\r\nand others, all resisted Satyaki, pouring showers of arrows on him. The\r\ngrand son of Sini, however, contending with all those car-warriors,\r\nbaffled, O monarch, that terrible downpour of arrows, so suddenly created\r\nby his foes. Indeed, in that dreadful battle, Satyaki, by means of his\r\nown celestial weapons, duly resisted all those celestial weapons aimed at\r\nhim by those illustrious warriors. The field of battle became full of\r\nmany cruel sights upon that encounter of those royal combatants,\r\nresembling that scene of yore when Rudra, filled with rage, had destroyed\r\nall creatures. Human arms and heads and bows, O Bharata, and umbrellas\r\ndisplaced (from cars), and yak-tails, were seen lying in heaps on the\r\nfield of battle. The earth became quickly strewn with broken wheels and\r\ncars, and massive arms lopped off from trunks, and brave horsemen\r\ndeprived of life. And, O foremost one among the Kurus, large number of\r\nwarriors, mangled with falling arrows, were seen in that great battle to\r\nroll and writhe on the ground in agony of the last spasms of death.\r\nDuring the progress of that terrible battle, resembling the encounter in\r\ndays of old between the celestials and the Asuras, king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, addressing his warriors, said, Putting forth all your vigour, rush,\r\nye great car-warriors, against the Pot-born! Yonder the heroic son of\r\nPrishata is engaged with Drona! He is endeavouring to the utmost of his\r\nmight, to slay the son of Bharadwaja. Judging from the aspect he is\r\npresenting in this great battle, it is evident that filled with rage, he\r\nwill today overthrow Drona. Uniting together, all of you fight with the\r\nPot-born.' Thus ordered by Yudhishthira, the mighty car-warriors of the\r\nSrinjayas all rushed with great vigour to slay the son of Bharadwaja.\r\nThat mighty car-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja's son, quickly rushed against\r\nthose advancing warriors, knowing for certain that he would die. When\r\nDrona, of sure aim, thus proceeded, the earth trembled violently. Fierce\r\nwinds began to blow, inspiring the (hostile) ranks with fear. Large\r\nmeteors fell, seemingly issuing out of the sun, blazing fiercely as they\r\nfell and foreboding great terrors. The weapons of Drona, O sire, seemed\r\nto blaze forth. Cars seemed to produce loud rattles, and steeds to shed\r\ntears. The mighty car-warrior, Drona, seemed to be divested of his\r\nenergy, His left eye and left hand began to twitch. Beholding Prishata's\r\nson, again, before him, and bearing in mind the words of the Rishis about\r\nhis leaving the world for heaven, he became cheerless. He then desired to\r\ngive up life by fighting fairly. Encompassed on all sides by the troops\r\nof Drupada's son, Drona began to career in battle, consuming large\r\nnumbers of Kshatriyas. That grinder of foes, having slain four and twenty\r\nthousand Kshatriyas, then despatched to Yama's abode ten times ten\r\nthousand, by means of his shafts of keen points. Exerting himself with\r\ncare, he seemed to stand in that battle like a smokeless fire. For the\r\nextermination of the Kshatriya race, he then had recourse to the Brahma\r\nweapon. Then the mighty Bhima, beholding the illustrious and irresistible\r\nprince of the Panchalas carless and weaponless, quickly proceeded towards\r\nhim. Beholding him striking at Drona from a near point, that grinder of\r\nfoes took up Dhrishtadyumna on his own car and said unto him, 'Save thee\r\nthere is no other man that can venture to fight with the preceptor. Be\r\nquick to slay him. The burden of his slaughter rests upon thee.' Thus\r\naddressed by Bhima, the mighty-armed Dhrishtadyumna speedily took up a\r\nstrong, a new and a superb bow capable of bearing a great strain. Filled\r\nwith rage, and shooting his arrows in that battle at the irresistible\r\nDrona, Dhrishtadyumna covered the preceptor, desirous of withstanding\r\nhim. Those two ornaments of battle then, both foremost of fighters and\r\nboth filled with rage, invoked into existence the Brahma and diverse\r\nother celestial weapons. Indeed, O king, Dhrishtadyumna covered Drona\r\nwith many mighty weapons in that encounter. Destroying all the weapons of\r\nBharadwaja's son, the Panchala prince, that warrior of unfading glory,\r\nbegan to slay the Vasatis, the Sivis, the Valhikas and the Kurus, that\r\nis, them, who protected Drona in that battle. Indeed, O king, shooting\r\nshowers of arrows on all sides, Dhrishtadyumna at that time looked\r\nresplendent like the sun himself shedding his thousands of rays. Drona,\r\nhowever, once more cut off the prince's bow and pierced the vitals of the\r\nprince himself with many arrows. Thus pierced, the prince felt great\r\npain. Then Bhima, of great wrath, holding the car of Drona, O monarch,\r\nslowly said these words unto him: If wretches amongst Brahmanas,\r\ndiscontented with the avocations of their own order, but well-versed in\r\narms, did not fight, the Kshatriya order then would not have been thus\r\nexterminated. Abstention from injury to all creatures hath been said to\r\nbe the highest of all virtues. The Brahmana is the root of that virtue.\r\nAs regards thyself, again, thou art the foremost of all persons\r\nacquainted with Brahma. Slaying all those Mlecchas and other warriors,\r\nwho, however, are all engaged in the proper avocations of their order,\r\nmoved thereto by ignorance and folly, O Brahmana, and by the desire of\r\nwealth for benefiting sons and wives; indeed, for the sake of an only\r\nson, why dost thou not feel ashamed? He for whom thou hast taken up\r\nweapons, and for whom thou livest, he, deprived of life, lieth today on\r\nthe field of battle, unknown to thee and behind thy back. King\r\nYudhishthira the just hath told thee this. It behoveth thee not to doubt\r\nthis fact.' Thus addressed by Bhima, Drona laid aside his bow. Desirous\r\nof laying aside all his weapons also, Bharadwaja's son of virtuous soul\r\nsaid aloud, 'O Karna, Karna, O great bowman, O Kripa, O Duryodhana, I\r\ntell you repeatedly, exert yourselves carefully in battle. Let no injury\r\nhappen to you from the Pandayas. As regards myself, I lay aside my\r\nweapons.' Saying these words, he began loudly to take the name of\r\nAswatthaman. Laying aside his weapons then in that battle, and sitting\r\ndown on the terrace of his car, he devoted himself to Yoga and assured\r\nall creatures, dispelling their fears. Beholding that opportunity,\r\nDhrishtadyumna mustered all his energy. Laying down on the car his\r\nformidable bow, with arrow fixed on the bow-string, he took up a sword,\r\nand jumping down from his vehicle, rushed quickly against Drona. All\r\ncreatures, human beings and others, uttered exclamation of woe, beholding\r\nDrona thus brought under Dhrishtadyumna's power. Loud cries of Oh and\r\nAlas were uttered, as also those of Oh and Fie. As regards Drona himself,\r\nabandoning his weapons, he was then in a supremely tranquil state. Having\r\nsaid those words he had devoted himself to Yoga. Endued with great\r\neffulgence and possessed of high ascetic merit, he had fixed his heart on\r\nthat Supreme and Ancient Being, viz., Vishnu. Bending his face slightly\r\ndown, and heaving his breast forward, and closing his eyes, and resting\r\nort the quality of goodness, and disposing his heart to contemplation,\r\nand thinking on the monosyllable Om, representing. Brahma, and\r\nremembering the puissant, supreme, and indestructible God of gods, the\r\nradiant Drona or high ascetic merit, the preceptor (of the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas) repaired to heaven that is so difficult of being attained even\r\nby the pious. Indeed, when Drona thus proceeded to heaven it seemed to us\r\nthat there were then two suns in the firmament. The whole welkin was\r\nablaze and seemed to be one vast expanse of equal light when the sun-like\r\nBharadwaja, of solar effulgence, disappeared. Confused sounds of joy were\r\nheard, uttered by the delighted celestials. When Drona thus repaired to\r\nthe region of Brahman, Dhrishtadyumna stood, unconscious of it all,\r\nbeside him. Only we five amongst men beheld the high-souled Drona rapt in\r\nYoga proceed to the highest region of blessedness. These five were\r\nmyself, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, and Drona's son, Aswatthaman, and\r\nVasudeva of Vrishni's race, and king Yudhishthira the just, the son of\r\nPandu. Nobody else, O king, could see that glory of the wise Drona,\r\ndevoted to Yoga, while passing out of the world. In fact, all human\r\nbeings were unconscious of the fact that the preceptor attained to the\r\nsupreme region of Brahman, a region mysterious to the very gods, and one\r\nthat is the highest of all. Indeed, none of them could see the preceptor,\r\nthat chastiser of foes, proceed to the region of Brahman, devoted to Yoga\r\nin the company of the foremost of Rishis, his body mangled with arrows\r\nand bathed in blood, after he had laid aside his weapons. As regards\r\nPrishata's son, though everybody cried fie on him, yet casting his eyes\r\non the lifeless Drona's head, he began to drag it. With his sword, then,\r\nhe lopped off from his foe's trunk that head,--his foe remained\r\nspeechless the while. Having slain Bharadwaja's son. Dhrishtadyumna was\r\nfilled with great joy, and uttered leonine shouts, whirling his sword. Of\r\na dark complexion, with white locks hanging down to his ears, that old\r\nman of five and eighty years of age, used, for thy sake only, to career\r\non the field of battle with the activity of a youth of sixteen. The\r\nmighty-armed Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, (before Drona's head was cut\r\noff) had said, 'O son of Drupada, bring the preceptor alive, do not slay\r\nhim. He should not be slain.' Even thus all the troops also had cried\r\nout. Arjuna, in particular, melted with pity, had cried out repeatedly.\r\nDisregarding, however, the cries of Arjuna as also these of all the\r\nkings, Dhrishtadyumna stew Drona, that bull among men, on the terrace of\r\nhis car. Covered with Drona's blood, Dhrishtadyumna then Jumped from the\r\ncar down upon the ground. Looking red like the sun, he then seemed to be\r\nexceedingly fierce. Thy troops beheld Drona slain even thus in that\r\nbattle. Then Dhrishtadyumna. that great bowman, O king, threw down that\r\nlarge head of Bharadwaja's son before the warriors of thy army. Thy\r\nsoldiers, O monarch, beholding the head of Bharadwaja's son, set their\r\nhearts on flight and ran away in all directions. Meanwhile Drona,\r\nascending the skies, entered the stellar path. Through the grace of the\r\nRishis Krishna (Dwaipayana), the son of Satyavati, I witnessed, O king,\r\nthe (true circumstances about the) death of Drona. I beheld that\r\nillustrious one proceeding, after he had ascended the sky, like a\r\nsmokeless brand of blazing splendour. Upon the fall of Drona, the Kurus,\r\nthe Pandavas and the Srinjayas, all became cheerless and ran away with\r\ngreat speed. The army then broke up. Many had been slain, and many\r\nwounded by means of keen shafts. Thy warriors (in particular), upon the\r\nfall of Drona, seemed to be deprived of life. Having sustained a defeat,\r\nand being inspired with fear about the future, the Kurus regarded\r\nthemselves deprived of both the worlds. Indeed, they lost all\r\nself-control.[255] Searching for the body of Bharadwaja's, son, O\r\nmonarch, on the field covered with thousands of headless trunks, the\r\nkings could not find it. The Pandavas, having gained the victory and\r\ngreat prospects of renown in the future, began to make loud sounds with\r\ntheir arrows and conchs and uttered loud leonine roars. Then Bhimasena, O\r\nking, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, were seen in the midst of\r\nthe (Pandava) host to embrace each other. Addressing the son of Prishata,\r\nthat scorcher of foes, viz., Bhima said, 'I will again embrace thee, O\r\nson of Prishata, as one crowned with victory, when that wretch of a\r\nSuta's son shall be slain in battle, as also that other wretch, viz.,\r\nDuryodhana.' Having said these words, Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, filled\r\nwith transports of joy, caused the earth to tremble with slaps on his\r\narmpits. Terrified by that sound, thy troops ran away from battle,\r\nforgetting the duties of the Kshatriyas and setting their hearts on\r\nflight. The Pandavas, having become victors, became very glad, O monarch,\r\nand they felt great happiness, derived from the destruction of their foes\r\nin battle.'\""

Uttering loud wails, they\r\ngrief, Seeing their foes (the Pandavas) prevailing over them, they\r\nrepeatedly trembled. Their eyes filled with tears, and hearts inspired\r\nwith fear, they became, O king, melancholy an cheerless, and destitute of\r\ngathered round thy son. Covered with dust, trembling (with fear), casting\r\nvacant looks on all sides, and their voice choked with fear, they\r\nresembled the Daityas after the fall of Hiranyaksha in the days of yore.\r\nSurrounded by them all, as if by small animals struck with fear, thy son,\r\nunable to stay in their midst, moved away. Afflicted with hunger and\r\nthirst, and scorched by the sun, thy warriors, then, O Bharata, became\r\nexceedingly cheerless. Beholding the fall of Bharadwaja's son, which was\r\nlike unto the dropping of the sun down upon the earth, or the drying up\r\nof the ocean, or the transplantation of Meru, or the defeat of Vasava,\r\nbeholding that act, incapable of being quietly witnessed, the Kauravas, O\r\nking, fled away in fear,--terror lending them greater speed. The ruler of\r\nthe Gandharas Sakuni, beholding Drona of the golden car slain, fled with\r\nthe car-warriors of his division, with speed that was much greater. Even\r\nthe Suta's son fled away in fear, taking with him his own vast division,\r\nthat was retreating with great speed with all its standards. The ruler of\r\nthe Madras, viz., Salya, also, casting vacant looks around, fled away in\r\nfear, taking with him his division, teeming with cars and elephants and\r\nsteeds. Saradwat's son, Kripa, too, fled away, saying, 'Alas. Alas,'\r\ntaking with him his division of elephants and foot-soldiers, the greater\r\npart thereof having been slain. Kritavarman, O king, also fled away,\r\nborne by his swift steeds, and surrounded by the remnant of his Bhoja,\r\nKalinga, Aratta, and Valhika troops. Uluka, O king, beholding Drona\r\nslain, fled away with speed, afflicted with fear and accompanied by a\r\nlarge body of foot-soldiers. Handsome and endued with youth, and reputed\r\nfor his bravery, Duhsasana, also, in great anxiety, fled away surrounded\r\nby his elephant division. Taking with him ten thousand cars and three\r\nthousand elephants, Vrishasena also fled with speed at the sight of\r\nDrona's fall. Accompanied by his elephants and horses and cars, and\r\nsurrounded also by foot-soldiers, thy son, the mighty car-warrior,\r\nDuryodhana, too, fled away, O king, taking with him the remnant of the\r\nSamsaptakas whom Arjuna had not yet slaughtered. Susarman, O king, fled\r\naway, beholding Drona slain. Riding on elephants and cars and steeds, all\r\nthe warriors of the Kaurava army fled away from the field, seeing Drona,\r\nof golden car, slain. Some urging their sires on, some their brothers,\r\nsome their maternal uncles, some their sons, some their friends, the\r\nKauravas fled away. Others urging on their brethren in arms or, their\r\nsisters' sons, their kinsmen, fled away on all sides. With dishevelled\r\nhair, and accoutrements loosened, all fled away in such a manner that\r\neven two persons could not be seen running together.--The Kuru army has\r\nbeen totally destroyed,--even this was the belief of every body. Others\r\namongst thy troops, fled away, O king, throwing off their coats of mail.\r\nThe soldiers loudly called upon one another, O bull of Bharata's race,\r\nsaying,--'Wait, Wait, do not fly,' but none of them that said so\r\nthemselves stood on the field. Abandoning their vehicles and cars decked\r\nwith ornaments, the warriors, riding on steeds or using their legs, fled\r\naway with great speed.\r\n\r\n\"While the troops, deprived of energy, were thus flying away with speed,\r\nonly Drona's son, Aswatthaman, like a huge alligator coming up against\r\nthe current of a stream, rushed against his foes. A fierce battle took\r\nplace between him and many warriors headed by Sikhandin and the\r\nPrabhadrakas, the Panchalas, the Chedis, and the Kaikeyas. Slaying many\r\nwarriors of the Pandava army that were incapable of being defeated with\r\nease, and escaping with difficulty from the press of battle, that hero,\r\npossessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, saw the (Kaurava) host\r\nrunning away, resolved on flight. Proceeding towards Duryodhana, Drona's\r\nson, approaching the Kuru king, said, 'Why, O Bharata, are the troops\r\nflying away as if in fear? Although flying away, thus, O monarch, why\r\ndost thou not yet rally them in battle? Thyself, too, O king, dost not\r\nseem to be in thy usual frame of mind. Upon the slaughter of that lion\r\namong car-warriors, O monarch, hath thy force fallen into this plight. O\r\nKaurava, O king, all these that are headed (even) by Karna, wait not on\r\nthe field. In no battle fought before did the army fly away thus. Hath\r\nany evil befallen thy troops, O Bharata?' Hearing these words of Drona's\r\nson on that occasion, Duryodhana, that bull among kings, felt himself\r\nunable to impart the bitter intelligence. Indeed, thy son seemed to sink\r\ninto an ocean of grief, like a foundered boat. Beholding Drona's son on\r\nhis car, the king became bathed in tears. Suffused with shame, O monarch,\r\nthe king then addressed Saradwat's son, saying, 'Blessed be thou, say\r\nthou, before others, why the army is thus flying away'. Then Saradwat's\r\nson, O king, repeatedly feeling great anguish, told Drona's son how his\r\nsire had been slain.'\r\n\r\n\"Kripa said, 'Placing Drona, that foremost of car-warriors, at our head,\r\nwe commenced to fight with only the Panchalas. When the battle commenced,\r\nthe Kurus and the Somakas, mingled together, roared at one another and\r\nbegan to strike down one another with their weapons. During the progress\r\nof that battle the Dhartarashtras began to be thinned. Seeing this, thy\r\nsire, filled with rage, invoked into existence a celestial weapon.\r\nIndeed, Drona, that bull among men, having invoked the Brahma weapon,\r\nslew his enemies with broad-headed arrows, by hundreds, and\r\nthousands.[256] Urged by fate, the Pandavas, the Kaikeyas, the Matsyas,\r\nand the Panchalas, O foremast of regenerate ones, approaching Drona's\r\ncar, began to perish. With his Brahma weapon, Drona despatched unto\r\nYama's abode a thousand brave warriors and two thousand elephants. Of a\r\ndark complexion, with his gray locks hanging down to his ears, and full\r\nfive and eighty years old, the aged Drona used to careen in battle like a\r\nyouth of sixteen, When the enemy's troops were thus afflicted and the\r\nkings were being slain, the Panchalas, though filled with desire of\r\nrevenge, turned back from the fight. When the enemy, turning back,\r\npartially lost their order, that vanquisher of foes, (viz., Drona),\r\ninvoking celestial weapons into the existence, shone resplendent like the\r\nrisen sun. Indeed, thy valiant sire, getting into the midst of the\r\nPandavas, and having arrows for the rays that emanated from him,\r\nresembled the midday sun at whom none could gaze. Scorched by Drona, as\r\nif by the blazing sun, they became cheerless and deprived of their energy\r\nand senses. Beholding them thus afflicted by Drona with his shafts, the\r\nslayer of Madhu, desirous of victory to the son of Pandu, said these\r\nwords: 'Truly, this foremost of all wielders of arms, this leader of the\r\nleaders is incapable of being vanquished in battle by the slayer of\r\nVritra himself. Ye sons of Pandu, laying aside righteousness, take care\r\nof victory, so that Drona of the golden car may not slay all of you in\r\nbattle. I think he will not fight after the fall of Aswatthaman. Let some\r\nman falsely tell him that Aswatthaman has been slain in battle.' Hearing\r\nthese words Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, approved them not. The advice,\r\nhowever, met with the approval of all others, and even of Yudhishthira\r\nwith some difficulty. Then, Bhimasena, with a tinge of bashfulness, said\r\nunto thy sire, 'Aswatthaman hath been slain.' Thy sire, however, did not\r\nbelieve him. Suspecting the intelligence to be false, thy father, so\r\naffectionate towards thee, enquired of Yudhishthira as to whether thou\r\nwert really dead or not. Afflicted with the fear of a lie, solicitous at\r\nthe same time of victory, Yudhishthira, beholding a mighty elephant, huge\r\nas a hill and called Aswatthaman, belonging to the Malava chief,\r\nIndravarman, slain on the field by Bhima, approached Drona and answered\r\nhim, saying, 'He for whom thou wieldest weapons, he, looking upon whom\r\nthou livest that ever dear son of thine, viz., Aswatthaman, hath been\r\nslain, Deprived of life he lieth on the bare ground like a young lion.'\r\nAware fully of the evil consequences of falsehood, the king spoke those\r\nwords unto that best of Brahmans, indistinctly adding elephant (after\r\nAswatthaman). Hearing of the fall of his son, he began to wail aloud,\r\nafflicted with grief, Restraining (the force of) his celestial weapons,\r\nhe fought not as before. Beholding him filled with anxiety, and almost\r\ndeprived of his senses by grief, the son of the Panchala king, of cruel\r\ndeeds, rushed towards him. Seeing the prince who had been ordained as his\r\nslayer, Drona, verse in all truths about men and things, abandoned all\r\nhis celestial weapons and sat in Praya on the field of battle. Then\r\nPrishata's son, seizing Drona's head with his left hand and disregarding\r\nthe loud admonitions of all the heroes, cut off that head.' Drona should\r\nnot be slain, even these were the words uttered from every side.\r\nSimilarly, Arjuna also, jumping down from his car, quickly ran towards\r\nPrishata's son, with arms upraised and repeatedly saying, 'O thou that\r\nart acquainted with the ways of morality, do not slay the preceptor but\r\nbring him alive.' Though thus forbidden by the Kauravas as also by\r\nArjuna, Dhrishtadyumna killed thy father. For this, afflicted with fear,\r\nthe troops are all flying away. Ourselves also, for the same reason, in\r\ngreat cheerlessness, O sinless one, are doing the same.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing of the slaughter of his sire in battle,\r\nDrona's son, like a snake struck with the foot, became filled with fierce\r\nwrath. And filled with rage, O sire, Aswatthaman blazed up in that battle\r\nlike a fire fed with a large quantity of fuel. As he squeezed his hands\r\nand ground his teeth, and breathed like a snake, his eyes became red as\r\nblood.'\""

Indeed,\r\nlearning that the preceptor, that foremost of virtuous men, had been\r\nunrighteously slain by Dhrishtadyumna in battle, what did Aswatthaman\r\nsay? The high-souled Drona, having obtained the science of weapons from\r\nRama have imparted (a knowledge of) all the celestial weapons unto his\r\nson desirous of seeing the latter adorned with all the accomplishments\r\n(of a warrior). There is only one person in this world, viz., the son,\r\nand none else, whom people desire to become superior to themselves. All\r\nhigh-souled preceptors have this characteristic, viz., that they impart\r\nall the mysteries of their science unto either sons or devoted disciples.\r\nBecoming his sire's pupil. O Sanjaya, and obtaining all those mysteries\r\nwith every detail, the son of Saradwat's daughter has become a second\r\nDrona, and a great hero. Aswatthaman is equal to Karna in knowledge of\r\nweapons, to Purandara in battle, to Kartavirya in energy, and Vrihaspati\r\nin wisdom. In fortitude, that youth is equal to a mountain, and in energy\r\nto fire. In gravity, he is equal to an ocean, and in wrath, to the poison\r\nof the snake. He is the foremost of all car-warriors in battle, a firm\r\nbowman, and above all fatigue. In speed he is equal to the wind itself\r\nand he careens in the thick of fight like Yama in rage.

Of\r\nprowess incapable of being baffled, hero is never fatigued by exertions.\r\nPurified by the Vedas and by vows, he is a thorough master of the science\r\nof arms, like Rama, the son of Dasharatha.

Aswatthaman hath been\r\nordained to be the slayer of Dhrishtadyumna, even as Yajnasena's son, the\r\nprince of the Panchalas, was ordained to be the slayer of Drona.

Filled with rage, O king, his body seems to blaze forth like that of\r\nthe Destroyer while engaged in slaughtering creatures at the end of Yuga.\r\nRepeatedly wiping his tearful eyes, and breathing hot sighs in rage, he\r\nsaid unto Duryodhana, I have now learnt how my sire has been slain by\r\nthose low wretches after he laid aside his weapons, and how also has a\r\nsinful act been perpetrated by Yudhishthira disguised in the grab of\r\nvirtue![257] I have now heard of that unrighteous and exceedingly cruel\r\nact of Dharma's son. Indeed, to those engaged in battle, either of the\r\ntwo things must happen, viz., victory or defeat. Death in battle is\r\nalways to be applauded. That death, in battle, of a person engaged in\r\nfight, which takes place under circumstances of righteousness, is not\r\ndeserving of grief, as has been observed by the sages. Without doubt, my\r\nsire has gone to the region of heroes. He having met with such a death, I\r\nshould not grieve for him. The humiliation, however, of a seizure of his\r\nlocks, that he sustained in the very sight of all the troops, while he\r\nwas righteously engaged in battle, is tearing the very core of my heart.\r\nMyself alive, my sire's locks were seized, why should sonless people then\r\nentertain a desire of offspring?[258] People perpetrate unrighteous acts\r\nor humiliate others, moved by lust or wrath or folly or hatred or levity.\r\nThe cruel and wicked-souled son of Prishata hath perpetrated this\r\nexceedingly sinful act in total disregard of me Dhrishtadyumna,\r\ntherefore, shall surely suffer the dreadful consequence of that act, as\r\nalso the false-speeched son of Pandu, that has acted so wrongly. Today,\r\nthe earth shall certainly drink the blood of that king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, who caused the preceptor, by an act of deceit to lay aside his\r\nweapons. I swear by truth, O Kauraveya, as also by my religious acts,\r\nthat I shall never bear the burden of life if I fail to exterminate the\r\nPanchalas. By every means I contend with the Panchalas in dreadful\r\nstrife. I shall certainly slay in battle Dhrishtadyumna, that perpetrator\r\nof unrighteous deeds. Mild or violent, let the means be what they will, I\r\nshall effect the destruction of all the Panchalas before peace becomes\r\nmine. O Kaurava! O tiger among men, persons desire children so that\r\nobtaining them they may be rescued from great fears both here and\r\nhereafter. My sire, however, fell unto that plight, like a friendless\r\ncreature, although myself am alive, his disciple and son, resembling a\r\nmountain (in might). Fie on my celestial weapons. Fie on my arms. Fie on\r\nmy prowess. Since Drona, although he had a son in me, had his locks\r\nseized! I shall, therefore, O chief of the Bharatas, now achieve that by\r\nwhich I may be freed from the debt I owe to my sire, now gone to the\r\nother world. He that is good never indulges in self-praise. Unable,\r\nhowever, to brook the slaughter of my sire, I speak of my prowess. Let\r\nthe Pandavas, with Janardana among them, behold my energy today, while I\r\ngrind all their troops, achieving what is done (by the destroyer himself)\r\nat the end of the Yuga. Neither the gods, nor the Gandharvas, nor the\r\nAsuras, the Uragas, and the Rakshasas, nor all the foremost of men, shall\r\ntoday be able to vanquish me on my car in battle. There is none in the\r\nworld equal to me or Arjuna in knowledge of weapons. Entering into the\r\nmidst of the troops, like the sun himself in the midst of his blazing\r\nrays, I shall today use my celestial weapons. Today, applied by me,\r\ninnumerable shafts, sped from my bow in dreadful battle, displaying their\r\nterrible energy, I shall grind the Pandavas. Today, all the points of the\r\ncompass, O king will be seen by the warriors of our army shrouded with my\r\nwinged arrows of keen points, as if with torrents of rain. Scattering\r\nshowers of shafts on all sides with a loud noise, I shall overthrow my\r\nfoes, like a tempest felling trees. Neither Vibhatsu, nor Janardana, nor\r\nBhimasena, nor Nakula, nor Sahadeva, nor king Yudhishthira, nor\r\nPrishata's wicked-souled son (Dhrishtadyumna), nor Sikhandin, nor\r\nSatyaki, O Kauravya, knoweth that weapon which I have, along with the\r\nmantras, for hurting and withdrawing it. Formerly on one occasion,\r\nNarayana, assuming the from of a Brahmana, came to my father. Bowing unto\r\nhim, my father presented his offerings unto him in due form. Taking them\r\nhimself, the divine Lord offered to give him a boon. My father then\r\nsolicited that supreme weapon called Narayana. The divine Lord, the\r\nforemost of all gods, addressing my sire, said, No man shall ever become\r\nthy equal in battle. This weapon, however, O Brahmana, should never be\r\nused in haste. It never comes back without effecting the destruction of\r\nthe foe. I know none whom it may not slay, O lord! Indeed, It would slay\r\neven the unslayable. Therefore, it should not be used (without the\r\ngreatest deliberation). This mighty weapon, O scorcher of foes, should\r\nnever be hurled upon persons that abandon their cars or weapons in\r\nbattle, or upon those that seek for quarter or those that wield\r\nthemselves up. He who seeketh to afflict in battle the unslayable with\r\nit, is himself exceedingly afflicted by it![259]'--My sire thus received\r\nthat weapon. Then Lord Narayana, addressing myself also, said, 'With the\r\naid of this weapon, thou too shalt pour diverse showers of celestial\r\nweapons in battle and blaze with energy in consequence of it. Having said\r\nthese words, the divine Lord ascended to heaven. Even this is the history\r\nof the Narayana weapon which has been obtained by my sire's son. With\r\nthat I will rout and slay the Pandavas, the Panchalas, the Matsyas, and\r\nthe Kaikeyas, in battle, like Sachi's lord routing and slaying the\r\nAsuras. My shafts, O Bharata, will fall upon the contending foes, in\r\nthose particular forms which I shall wish them to assume. Staying in\r\nbattle, I will pour showers of weapons as I desire. I will rout and slay\r\nall the foremost of car warriors with sky-ranging arrows of iron-points.\r\nWithout doubt, I will shower innumerable battle-axes upon the foe. With\r\nthe mighty Narayana weapon, a scorcher of foes that I am, I will destroy\r\nthe Pandavas, causing an immense carnage amongst them. That wretch\r\namongst the Panchalas, (viz., Dhrishtadyumna), who is an injurer of\r\nfriends and Brahmanas and of his own preceptor, who is a deceitful wretch\r\nof the most reprehensible conduct, shall never escape from me today with\r\nlife.' Hearing these words of Drona's son, the (Kuru) army rallied. Then\r\nmany foremost of men blew their gigantic conchs. And filled with delight,\r\nthey beat their drums and dindimas by thousands. The earth resounded with\r\nloud noises, afflicted with the hoofs of steeds and the wheels of cars.\r\nThat loud uproar made the earth, and the firmament also echo with it.\r\nHearing that uproar, deep as the roll of the clouds, the Pandavas, those\r\nforemost of car-warriors, uniting together, took counsel of one another.\r\nMeanwhile, Drona's son, having said those words, O Bharata, touched water\r\nand invoked the celestial weapon called the Narayana.'\""

Desirous of saving themselves, all of them fled\r\naway from battle. Some kings fled, riding on cars borne along irregular\r\ncourse without Parshni drivers, and divested of standards and banners and\r\numbrellas, and with their Kuvaras and boxes broken, and all their\r\nequipments displaced. Others, struck with panic and deprived of their\r\nsenses, themselves striking the steeds of their cars with their feet,\r\nfled precipitately. Others, riding on cars with broken yokes and wheels\r\nand Akshas, fled afflicted with fear. Others on horseback were carried\r\naway, their bodies half displaced from their saddles. Others, dislodged\r\nfrom their seats, and pinned by shafts to the necks of elephants, were\r\nquickly carried away by those animals. Others wore trodden to death all\r\naround by elephants, afflicted and mangled with arrows. Others, deprived\r\nof weapons and divested of armour, fell from their vehicles and animal\r\ndown upon the earth. Others were cut by car-wheels, or crushed by steeds\r\nand elephants. Others loudly calling after their sires and sons, fled\r\naway in fear, without recognising one another, deprived of all energy by\r\ngrief. Some, placing their sons and sires and friends and brothers (on\r\nvehicles) and taking off their armour, were seen washing them with water.\r\nAfter the slaughter of Drona, (the Kuru) army, fallen into such a plight,\r\nfled away precipitously. By whom then hath it been rallied? Tell me, if\r\nthou knowest. The sound of neighing steeds and trumpeting elephants,\r\nmingled with the clatter of car-wheels, is heard loud. These sounds, so\r\nfierce, occuring in the Kuru ocean, are repeatedly swelling up and\r\ncausing my troops to tremble. This terrific uproar, making the hair stand\r\non end, that is now heard, would, it seems, swallow the three worlds with\r\nIndra at their head. I think this terrible uproar is uttered by the\r\nwielder of the thunderbolt himself. It is evident that upon the fall of\r\nDrona, Vasava himself is approaching (against us) for the sake of the\r\nKauravas. Our hairs have stood on their ends, our foremost of\r\ncar-warriors are all afflicted with anxiety. O Dhanaujaya, hearing this\r\nloud and terrible noise, I ask thee who is that mighty car-warrior, like\r\nthe lord of the celestials himself, that rallying this terrible and\r\nswelling host, is causing it to return?'\r\n\r\n\"Arjuna said, 'He, relying upon whose energy the Kauravas, having\r\naddressed themselves to the accomplishment of fierce feats, are blowing\r\ntheir conchs and staying with patience, he about whom thou hast thy\r\ndoubts. O king, as to who he may be that is roaring so loud, having\r\nrallied the Dhartarashtras after the fall of the disarmed preceptor, he,\r\nwho is endued with modesty, possessed of mighty arms, has the tread of an\r\ninfuriated elephant, owns a face like that of a tiger, always achieves\r\nfierce feats, and dispels the fears of the Kurus, he upon whose birth\r\nDrona gave away a thousand kine unto Brahmanas of high worth, he O king,\r\nthat is roaring so loud, is Aswatthaman. As soon as he was born, that\r\nhero neighed like Indra's steed and caused the three worlds to tremble at\r\nthat sound. Hearing that sound, an invisible being, O lord, (speaking\r\naudibly) bestowed upon him the name of Aswatthaman (the horse-voiced).\r\nThat hero, O son of Pandu, is roaring today. Prishata's son, by an\r\nexceedingly cruel act, assailed Drona and took his life as if the latter\r\nwas without a preceptor. Yonder stayeth the preceptor of that Drona.\r\nSince of the prince of the Panchalas seized my preceptor by the hair,\r\nAswatthaman, confident of his own prowess, will never forgive him. Thou,\r\nO monarch, hath told thy preceptor a falsehood for the sake of kingdom!\r\nAlthough thou art acquainted with the dictates of righteousness, thou\r\nhast yet perpetrated a very sinful act. Thy ill fame, in consequence of\r\nthe slaughter of Drona, will be eternal in the three worlds with their\r\nmobile and immobile creatures, like Rama's in consequence of the\r\nslaughter of Bali![261] About thyself, Drona had thought, 'The son of\r\nPandu is possessed of every virtue; he is, besides, my disciple. He will\r\nnever speak an untruth to me.' Thinking so, he gave credence to what thou\r\nhadst said. Although in speaking of Aswatthaman's death thou hadst added\r\nthe world elephant, yet thy answer to the preceptor was, after all, an\r\nuntruth in the garb of truth. Thus told by thee, the puissant Drona laid\r\naside his weapons and, as thou sawest, became indifferent (to\r\neverything), exceedingly agitated, and almost deprived of his senses. It\r\nwas even a disciple who, abandoning all morality, thus slew his own\r\npreceptor, full of affection for his son, while, indeed, that preceptor\r\nwas filled with grief and unwilling to fight. Having caused him, who had\r\nlaid his weapons to be unrighteously slain, protect the son of Prishata\r\nif thou canst, with all thy counsellors. All of us, uniting together,\r\nshall not be able to protect Prishata's son today, who will be assailed\r\nby the preceptor's son in wrath and grief. That superhuman being who is\r\nin that habit of displaying his friendship for all creatures, that hero,\r\nhearing of the seizure of his sire's locks, will certainly consume us all\r\nin battle today. Although I cried repeatedly at the top of my voice for\r\nsaving the preceptor's life, yet, disregarding my cries and abandoning\r\nmortality, a disciple took the life of that preceptor. All of us have\r\npassed the greater part of our lives. The days that remain to us are\r\nlimited. This exceedingly unrighteous act that we have perpetrated has\r\nstained that remnant. In consequence of the affection he bore to us, he\r\nwas a sire unto us. According to the dictates of the scriptures also, he\r\nwas a sire unto us. Yet he, that preceptor of ours, has been slain by us\r\nfor the sake of short-lived sovereignty. Dhritarashtra, O king, had given\r\nunto Bhishma and Drona the whole earth, and what was still more valuable,\r\nall his children. Though honoured by our foe thus, and though he had\r\nobtained such wealth from him, the preceptor still loved us as his own\r\nchildren. Of unfading energy and prowess, the preceptor has been slain,\r\nonly because, induced by thy words he had laid aside his weapons. While\r\nengaged in fight he was incapable of being slain by Indra himself. The\r\npreceptor was venerable in years and always devoted to our welfare. Yet\r\nunrighteous that we are, and stained with a levity of behaviour, we\r\nscrupled not to injure him. Alas, exceedingly cruel and very heinous has\r\nbeen the sin that we have committed, for, moved by the desire of enjoying\r\nthe pleasures of sovereignty, we have slain that Drona. My preceptor had\r\nall along been under the impression that in consequence of my love for\r\nhim, I could, (for his sake) abandon all,--sire, brother, children, wife\r\nand life itself. And yet moved by the desire of sovereignty, I interfered\r\nnot when he was about to be slain. For this fault, O king, I have, O\r\nlord, already sunk into hell, overcome with shame. Having, for the sake\r\nof kingdom, caused the slaughter of one who was a Brahmana, who was\r\nvenerable in years, who was my preceptor, who had laid aside his weapons,\r\nand who was then devoted, like a great ascetic, to Yoga, death has become\r\npreferable to me to life!'"

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, the mighty car-warriors\r\npresent there said not a single word, O monarch, agreeable or\r\ndisagreeable, unto Dhananjaya. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, filled\r\nwith wrath, O bull of Bharata's race, reproaching Kunti's son, Arjuna,\r\nsaid these words, 'Thou preachest truths of morality like an anchorite\r\nliving in the woods or a Brahmana of rigid vows and senses under complete\r\ncontrol. A person is called a Kshatriya because he rescues others from\r\nwounds and injuries. Being such, he must save himself from wounds and\r\ninjuries. Showing forgiveness towards the three that are good (viz., the\r\ngods, the Brahmanas, and preceptor), a Kshatriya, by doing his duties,\r\nsoon wins the earth as also piety and fame and prosperity.[262] Thou, O\r\nperpetuator of thy race, art endued with every attribute of a Kshatriya.\r\nIt does not, therefore, look well for thee to speak like an ignorant\r\nwight. O son of Kunti, thy prowess is like that of Sakra himself, the\r\nlord of Sachi. Thou dost not transgress the bounds of morality like the\r\nocean that never transgresses its continents. Who is there that would not\r\nworship thee, seeing that thou seekest virtue, having abandoned the wrath\r\ncherished by thee for thirteen years? By good luck, O sire, thy heart\r\ntoday followeth in the wake of virtue. O thou of unfading glory, by good\r\nluck, thy understanding inclineth towards compassion. Though, however,\r\nthou art inclined to adopt the path of virtue, thy kingdom was snatched\r\nfrom thee most unrighteously. Dragging the wife Draupadi to the assembly,\r\nthy foes insulted her. Clad in barks of trees and skins of animals, all\r\nof us were exiled to the woods, and though we were undeserving of that\r\nplight, our foes nevertheless compelled us to endure it for thirteen\r\nyears. O sinless one, thou hast forgiven all these circumstances, every\r\none of which demands the exhibition of wrath. Wedded as thou art to\r\nduties of a Kshatriya, thou hast quietly borne these. Remembering all\r\nthose acts of unrighteousness, I came here with thee for avenging myself\r\nof them. (When, however, I see that thou art so indifferent, why), I\r\nmyself will slay those low wretches that despoiled us of our kingdom.\r\nThou hadst formerly said these words, viz., Addressing ourselves to\r\nbattle, we will exert to the utmost extent of our abilities. Today,\r\nhowever, thou reproachest us. Thou now seekest, virtue. Those words,\r\ntherefore, that thou saidst formerly were untrue. We are already\r\nafflicted with fear. Thou cuttest, however, the very core of our hearts\r\nwith these thy words, O crusher of foes, like one pouring acid upon the\r\nsores of wounded men. Afflicted with thy wordy darts, my heart is\r\nbreaking. Thou art virtuous, but thou dost not know in what righteousness\r\ntruly consists, since thou applaudest neither thyself nor us, though all\r\nof us are worthy of applause. When Kesava himself is here, praisest thou\r\nthe son of Drona, a warrior that does not come up to even a sixteenth\r\npart of thyself, O Dhanajaya, confessing thy own faults, why dost thou\r\nnot feel shame? I can rend asunder this earth in rage, or split the very\r\nmountains in whirling that terrible and heavy mace of mine, decked with\r\ngold. Like the tempest, I can break down gigantic trees looking like\r\nhills. I can, with my arrows, rout the united celestials with Indra at\r\ntheir head, together with all the Rakshasas, O Partha, and the Asuras,\r\nthe Uragas and human beings. Knowing me, thy brother, to be such, O bull\r\namong men, it behoveth thee not, O thou of immeasurable prowess, to\r\nentertain any fear about Drona's son. Or, O Vibhatsu, stand thou here,\r\nwith all these bulls amongst men. Alone and unsupported, I shall, armed\r\nwith my mace, vanquish this one in great battle.' After Bhima had ended,\r\nthe son of the Panchala king, addressing Partha, said these words, like\r\nHiranyakasipu (the leader of the Daityas) unto the enraged and roaring\r\nVishnu,[263] 'O Vibhatsu, the sages have ordained these to be the duties\r\nof Brahmanas, viz., assisting at sacrifices, teaching, giving away,\r\nperformance of sacrifices, receiving of gifts, and study as the sixth. To\r\nwhich of these six was that Drona devoted who has been stain by me?\r\nFallen off from the duties of his own order and practising those of the\r\nKshatriya order, that achiever of wicked deeds used to stay us by means\r\nof superhuman weapons. Professing himself to be a Brahmana, he was in the\r\nhabit of using irresistible illusion. By an illusion itself hath he been\r\nslain today. O Partha, what is there that is improper in this? Drona\r\nhaving been thus punished by me, if his son, from rage, uttereth loud\r\nroars, what do you lose by that? I do not think it at all wonderful that\r\nDrona's son, urging the Kauravas to battle, will cause them to be slain,\r\nunable to protect them himself. Thou art acquainted with morality. Why\r\nthen dost thou say that I am a slayer of my preceptor? It was for this\r\nthat I was born as a son to the king of the Panchalas, having sprung from\r\nthe (sacrificial) fire. How, O Dhananjaya, you call him a Brahmana or\r\nKshatriya, with whom, while engaged in battle, all acts, proper and\r\nimproper, were the same? O foremost of men, why should not he be slain,\r\nby any means in our power, who, deprived of his senses in wrath, used to\r\nslay with the Brahma weapons even those that were unacquainted with\r\nweapons? He that is unrighteous is said by those that are righteous to be\r\nequal to poison. Knowing this, O thou that art well versed with the\r\ntruths of morality, why dost thou, O Arjuna, reproach me? That cruel\r\ncar-warrior was seized and slain by me. I have done nothing that is\r\nworthy of reproach. Why then, O Vibhatsu, dost thou not congratulate me?\r\nO Partha, I have cut off that terrible head, like unto the blazing sun or\r\nvirulent poison or the all-destroying Yuga fire, of Drona. Why then dost\r\nthou not applaud an act that is worthy of applause? He had slain in\r\nbattle only my kinsmen and not those of any one else. I say that having\r\nonly cut off his head, the fever of my heart hath not abated. The very\r\ncore of my heart is being pierced for my not having thrown that head\r\nwithin the dominion of the Nishadas, like that of Jayadratha![264] It\r\nhath been heard, O Arjuna, that one incurreth sin by not slaying his\r\nfoes. Even this is the duty of a Kshatriya, viz., to slay or be slain.\r\nDrona was my foe. He hath been righteously slain by me in battle, O son\r\nof Pandu, even as thou hast slain the brave Bhagadatta, thy friend.\r\nHaving slain thy grandsire in battle, thou regardest that act to be\r\nrighteous. Why then shouldst thou regard it unrighteous in me for my\r\nhaving slain my wretched foe? In consequence of our relationship, O\r\nPartha, I cannot raise my head in thy presence and am like a prostrate\r\nelephant with a ladder against his body (for helping puny creatures to\r\nget on his back). It, therefore, behoveth thee not to reproach me. I\r\nforgive all the faults of thy speech, O Arjuna, for the sake of Draupadi\r\nand Draupadi's children and not for any other reason. It is well known\r\nthat my hostility with the preceptor has descended from sire to son. All\r\npersons in this world know it. Ye sons of Pandu, are ye not acquainted\r\nwith it? The eldest son of Pandu hath not been untruthful in speech. I\r\nmyself, O Arjuna, am not sinful. The wretched Drona was a hater of his\r\ndisciples. Fight now. Victory will be thine.'\""

Fie on the Kshatriya order,\r\nand fie on wrath itself! Tell me, O Sanjaya, what the sons of Pritha, as\r\nalso all the other royal bowmen in the world, hearing of Drona's\r\nslaughter, said unto the prince of Panchala.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Drupada's son, of crooked deeds,\r\nall the persons present there, O monarch, remained perfectly silent.\r\nArjuna, however, casting oblique glances upon Prishata's son, seemed,\r\nwith tears and sighs, to reproach him, saying, 'Fie, fie.' Yudhishthira\r\nand Bhima and the twins and Krishna and the others stood bashfully.\r\nSatyaki, however, O king, said these words, 'Is there no man here that\r\nwould, without delay, slay this sinful wight, this lowest of men, who is\r\nuttering such evil speeches? The Pandavas are all condemning thee for\r\nthis sinful act of thine, like Brahmanas condemning a person of the\r\nChandala class. Having committed such a heinous act, having incurred the\r\ncensures of all honest men, art thou not ashamed to open thy lips in the\r\nmidst of such a respectable assembly? O despicable wretch, why did not\r\nthy tongue and head split into a hundred fragments while thou wert about\r\nto slay thy own preceptor? Why wert thou not struck down by that act of\r\nsin? Since, having perpetrated such a sinful act, again applauding\r\nthyself in the midst of human beings, thou incurrest the censures of the\r\nParthas and all the Andhakas and the Vrishnis. Having perpetrated such an\r\natrocious act, thou art again displaying such hatred towards the\r\npreceptor. For this thou deservest death at our hands. There is no use in\r\nkeeping thee alive for even a single moment. Who is there, save thee, O\r\nwretch, that would cause the death of the virtuous preceptor, seizing him\r\nby his locks? Having obtained thee, O wretch, thy ancestors, for seven\r\ngenerations and thy descendants also for seven generations, deprived of\r\nfame, have sunk into hell, Thou hast charged Partha, that bull among men,\r\nwith the slaughter of Bhishma. The latter, however, viz., that\r\nillustrious personage, himself accomplished his own death. Truly\r\nspeaking, the uterine brother, (viz., Sikhandin), that foremost of all\r\nsinners, was the cause of Bhishma's death. There is none in the world\r\nthat is more sinful than the sons of the Panchala king. Thy father had\r\ncreated Sikhandin for the destruction of Bhishma. As regards Arjuna, he\r\nhad only, protected Sikhandin while Sikhandin became the cause of the\r\nillustrious Bhishma's death. Having got thee that is condemned by all\r\nrighteous men, and thy brother, amongst them, the Panchalas have fallen\r\noff from righteousness, and stained with meanness, have become haters of\r\nfriends and preceptors. If thou again speakest such words in my presence,\r\nI shall then break with this mace of mine that is as strong as the\r\nthunderbolt. Beholding thee that art the slayer of a Brahmana, since thou\r\nart guilty of nothing less than the slaughter of a Brahmana., people have\r\nto look at the sun for purifying themselves. Thou wretch of a Panchala, O\r\nthou of wicked conduct, speaking all of my preceptor first and then of my\r\npreceptor's preceptor, art thou not ashamed?[265] Wait, wait! Bear thou\r\nbut one stroke of this my mace! I myself will bear many strokes of\r\nthine.' Thus rebuked by the Satwata hero, Prishata's son, filled with\r\nrage, smilingly addressed the angry Satyaki in these harsh words.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'I have heard thy words, O thou of Madhu's race,\r\nbut I have forgiven thee. Being thyself unrighteous and sinful, desirest\r\nthou to rebuke them that are righteous and honest? Forgiveness is\r\napplauded in the world. Sin, however, does not deserve forgiveness. He\r\nthat is of sinful soul regards the forgiving person powerless. Thou art a\r\nwretch in thy behaviour. Thou art of sinful soul. Thou art wedded to\r\nunrighteousness. Thou art censurable in every respect, from the tip of\r\nthy toe to the end of their hair. Desirest thou still to speak ill of\r\nothers? What can be more sinful than that act of thine, viz., thy\r\nslaughter of the armless Bhurisravas while sitting in Praya, although\r\nthou wert with the aid of celestial weapons. He had laid aside his\r\nweapons and I slew him. O thou of crooked heart, what is there in that\r\nact that is improper? How can he, O Satyaki, blame such an act who\r\nhimself has in Praya like an ascetic, and whose arms had been cut off by\r\nanother? That valiant enemy of thine had displayed his prowess having\r\nstruck thee with his foot and thrown thee down on the earth. Why didst\r\nthou not then slay him, showing thy manliness? When Partha, however, had\r\nalready vanquished him, it was then that thou, acting most unrighteously,\r\ndidst kill the brave and valiant Somadatta's son. When Drona had sought\r\nto rout the forces of the Pandavas, then I proceeded, shooting thousands\r\nof arrows. Having thyself acted in such a way, like a Chandala, and\r\nhaving thyself become worthy of reproach, desirest thou to reproach me in\r\nsuch harsh words? Thou art a perpetrator of evil deeds, and not I, O\r\nwretch the Vrishni race! Thou art the abode of all sinful deeds. Do not\r\nagain blame me. Be silent. It behoveth thee. Don't say anything unto me\r\nafter this. This is the reply I give thee with my lips. Don't say\r\nanything more. If, from folly, thou repeatest such harsh words, I shall\r\nthen, in battle, despatch thee, with my arrows, to Yama's abode. By\r\nrighteousness alone, O fool, one cannot vanquish his enemies. Listen now\r\nto the unrighteous acts of the Kurus also. Pandu's son, Yudhishthira was\r\nsome time back unrighteously deceived by them. O Satyaki, Draupadi also\r\nwas persecuted by them unrighteously. The Pandavas, with Krishna in their\r\ncompany, were also exiled and they were robbed of their all, O fool, most\r\nunrighteously. By an act of unrighteousness, again, has the ruler of the\r\nMadras been withdrawn from us by the enemy. By an act of unrighteousness\r\nalso was the son of Subhadra slain. On this side, it was by an act of\r\nunrighteousness that Bhishma, the Kuru grandsire, was slain. Bhurisravas,\r\ntoo, was, by an act of unrighteousness, slain by thee that art so\r\nacquainted with righteousness. Even thus have the enemy, as also the\r\nPandavas, acted in this battle. Possessed of courage and acquainted with\r\nmorality, all of them, O Satwata, have acted thus, for gaining victory.\r\nHigh morality is difficult of ascertainment. Similarly, immorality also\r\ncan with difficulty be comprehended. Fight now with the Kauravas, without\r\nreturning to the home of thy fathers.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these harsh and cruel words (from\r\nDhrishtadyumna's lips), the blessed Satyaki began to tremble from head to\r\nfoot. With rage his eyes assumed the hue of copper. Keeping his bow then\r\nupon his car, he grasped his mace, sighing like a Snake. Rushing, then,\r\ntowards the prince of the Panchalas, he said unto him in great wrath, 'I\r\nwill not speak harshly to thee, but I will slay thee, deserving as thou\r\nart of slaughter.' Seeing the mighty Satyaki rushing, from wrath and\r\ndesire of revenge, at the Panchala prince, like Yama against one like his\r\nown self, the mighty Bhima, urged by Vasudeva, quickly jumped down from\r\nhis car and seized him with his arms. Endued with great strength,\r\nSatyaki, who was rushing in great wrath, proceeded for a few steps,\r\nforcibly dragging after him the mighty son of Pandu who was endeavouring\r\nto hold him back. Then Bhima firmly planting his feet stopped at the\r\nsixth step that foremost of strong men, viz., that bull of Sini's race.\r\nThen Sahadeva, O king, jumping down from his own car, addressed Satyaki,\r\nthus held fast by the strong arms of Bhima, in these words, 'O tiger\r\namong men, O thou of Madhu's race, we have no friends dearer to us than\r\nthe Andhakas, the Vrishnis and the Panchalas. So also the Andhakas and\r\nthe Vrishnis, particularly Krishna, cannot have any friends dearer than\r\nourselves. The Panchalas, also, O thou of Vrishni's race, even if they\r\nsearch the whole world to the confines of the sea, have no friends dearer\r\nto them than the Pandavas and the Vrishnis. Thou art even such a friend\r\nto this prince; and he also is a similar friend to thee. Ye all are to us\r\neven as we are to you. Acquainted as thou art with all duties,\r\nremembering now the duties thou owest to friends, restrain this wrath of\r\nthine, that has the prince of the Panchalas for its object. Be calm, O\r\nforemost one of Sini's race! Forgive the son of Prishata, and let\r\nPrishata's son also forgive thee. Ourselves also will practise\r\nforgiveness. What is there that is better than forgiveness?'\r\n\r\n\"While the scion of Sini, O sire, was thus being pacified by Sahadeva,\r\nthe son of the Panchala king, smiling, said these words, 'Release Sini's\r\ngrandson, O Bhima who is so proud of his prowess in battle. Let him come\r\nat me like the wind assailing the mountains, till, with my keen arrows, O\r\nson of Kunti, I quell his rage and desire for battle and take his life.\r\nYonder come the Kauravas. I shall (after staying Satyaki) achieve this\r\ngreat task of the Pandavas that has presented itself. Or let Phalguna\r\nresist all the enemies in battle. As regards myself, I will fell this\r\none's head with my arrows. He taketh me for the armless Bhurisravas in\r\nbattle. Release him. Either I will slay him or he will slay me.' Hearing\r\nthese words of the Panchala prince, the mighty Satyaki held fast in\r\nBhima's clasp, sighing like a snake, began to tremble. Both of them,\r\nendued with great might and possessed of powerful arms, began to roar\r\nlike a couple of bulls. Then Vasudeva, O sire, and king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, with great effort, succeeded in pacifying those heroes. Having\r\npacified those two great bowmen, those two heroes, whose eyes had become\r\nblood-red with rage, all the Kshatriyas (of the Pandava) army proceeded\r\nagainst the warriors of the hostile army for battle.'"

Slaying his enemies by means of his broad-headed arrows,\r\nAswatthaman soon piled a mountain there of the dead. The standards of\r\ncars formed its trees; and weapons its pointed summits; the lifeless\r\nelephants formed its large rocks; the steeds, its Kimpurushas; and bows,\r\nits creepers and plants. And it resounded with the cries of all\r\ncarnivorous creatures, that constituted its feathery population. And the\r\nspirits that walked there formed its Yakshas[266]. Then roaring aloud, O\r\nbull of Bharata's race, Aswatthaman once more repeated his vow in the\r\nhearing of thy son, thus, 'Since Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, assuming only\r\nthe outward garb of virtue, had caused the preceptor who was\r\n(righteously) engaged in battle to lay aside his weapons, I shall, in his\r\nvery sight, rout and destroy his army. Having mangled all his troops, I\r\nshall, then, slay the sinful prince of the Panchalas. Indeed, I shall\r\nslay all of them, if they contend with me in battle. I tell thee truly,\r\ntherefore, rally thou thy troops.' Hearing these words of Aswatthaman,\r\nthy son rallied the troops, having dispelled their fears with a loud\r\nleonine, roar. The encounter, then, O king, that once more took place\r\nbetween the Kuru and the Pandava armies, became as terrible as that of\r\ntwo oceans at full tide. The terrified Kauravas had their fears dispelled\r\nby Drona's son. The Pandus and the Panchalas had become fierce in\r\nconsequence of Drona's slaughter. Great was the violence of that\r\ncollision, on the field of battle, between those warriors, all of whom\r\nwere cheerful and filled with rage and inspired with certain hopes of\r\nvictory. Like a mountain, striking against a mountain, or an ocean\r\nagainst an ocean, O monarch, was that collision between the Kurus and the\r\nPandavas. Filled with joy, the Kuru and the Pandava warriors beat\r\nthousands of drums. The loud and stunning uproar that arose from among\r\nthose troops resembled that of the ocean itself while churned (of old by\r\nthe gods and the Danavas). Then Drona's son, aiming at the host of the\r\nPandavas and the Panchalas, invoked the weapon called Narayana. Then\r\nthousands of arrows with blazing mouths appeared in the welkin,\r\nresembling snakes of fiery mouths, that continued to agitate the\r\nPandavas. In that dreadful battle, those shafts, O king, like the very\r\nrays of the sun in a moment shrouded all the points of the compass, the\r\nwelkin, and the troops. Innumerable iron balls also, O king, then\r\nappeared, like resplendent luminaries in the clear firmament. Sataghnis,\r\nsome equipped with four and some with two wheels, and innumerable maces,\r\nand discs, with edges sharp as razor and resplendent like the sun, also\r\nappeared there. Beholding the welkin densely shrouded with those weapons,\r\nO bull of Bharata's race, the Pandavas, the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas,\r\nbecame exceedingly agitated. In all those places, O ruler of men, where\r\nthe great car-warriors of the Pandavas contended in battle, that weapon\r\nbecame exceedingly powerful. Slaughtered by the Narayana weapon, as if\r\nconsumed by a conflagration, the Pandava troops were exceedingly\r\nafflicted all over the field in that battle. Indeed, O lord, as fire\r\nconsumeth a heap of dry grass in summer, even so did that weapon consume\r\nthe army of the Pandus. Beholding that weapon filling every side, seeing\r\nhis own troops destroyed in large numbers, king Yudhishthira the just, O\r\nlord, became inspired with great fright. Seeing his army in course of\r\nflight and deprived of its senses, and beholding Parthas standing\r\nindifferent, Dharma's son said these words, 'O Dhrishtadyumna, fly away\r\nwith your Panchala troops. O Satyaki, you also go away, surrounded by the\r\nVrishnis and the Andhakas. Of virtuous soul, Vasudeva will himself seek\r\nthe means of his own safety. He is competent to offer advice to the whole\r\nworld. What need is there of telling him what he should do? We should not\r\nany longer fight. I say so unto all the troops. As regards myself, I\r\nwill, with all my brothers ascend a funeral pile. Having crossed the\r\nBhishma and the Drona oceans in this battle, that are incapable of being\r\ncrossed by the timid, shall I sink with all my followers in the vestige,\r\nrepresented by Drona's son, of a cow's hoof? Let the wishes of king\r\nDuryodhana be crowned with success today, for I have today slain in\r\nbattle the preceptor, that always cherished such friendly feelings\r\ntowards us, that preceptor, who, without protecting, caused that child\r\nunacquainted with battle, viz., the son of Subhadra, to be slain by a\r\nmultitude of wicked warriors, that preceptor, who with his son, sat\r\nindifferently, without answering, when Krishna in such distress, dragged\r\ninto the assembly and sought to be made a slave, asked him to say the\r\ntruth, that preceptor, who, white all the other warriors were fatigued,\r\ncased Duryodhana in invulnerable armour when the latter desired to slay\r\nPhalguna and who, having cased him so, appointed him to protect\r\nJayadratha, who, being acquainted with the Brahma weapon, scrupled not to\r\nexterminate the Panchalas, headed by Satyajit, that had exerted\r\nthemselves for my victory, that preceptor, who, whilst we were being\r\nunrighteously exiled from our kingdom, freely told us to go into the\r\nwoods although he had been solicited by our friends to withhold his\r\npermission[267]. Alas, that great friend of our hath been slain! For his\r\nsake, I will, with my friends, lay down my life. After Kunti's son,\r\nYudhishthira had said this, he of Dasarha's race, (viz., Kesava) quickly\r\nforbidding the troops, by motion of his arms, to fly away said these\r\nwords, Speedily lay down your weapons, all of you, and alight from your\r\nvehicles. Even this is the means ordained by the illustrious one, (viz.,\r\nNarayana himself) for baffling this weapon. Come down on the earth, all\r\nof you from your elephants and steeds and cars. If you stand weaponless\r\non the earth, this weapon will not slay you. In those places where you\r\nwill fight for quelling the force of this weapon the Kauravas will become\r\nmore powerful than you. Those men, however, that will throw down their\r\nweapons and alight from their vehicles, will not in this battle, be slain\r\nby this weapon. They, however, that will, even in imagination, contend\r\nagainst this weapon, will all be slain even if they seek refuge deep\r\nbeneath the earth'. The warriors of the Pandava army, hearing, O Bharata,\r\nthese words of Vasudeva, threw their weapons and drove away from their\r\nhearts all desire of battle. Then Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, beholding\r\nthe warriors about to abandon their weapons, said these words, O king,\r\ngladdening them all: 'None should lay down his weapons here. I shall,\r\nwith my shafts, oppose this weapon of Drona's son. With this heavy mace\r\nof mine, that is decked with gold, I shall career in this battle like the\r\nDestroyer himself, quelling this weapon of Drona's son. There is no man\r\nhere that is equal to me in prowess, even as there is no luminary in the\r\nfirmament that is equal to the sun. Beholding these two strong arms of\r\nmine like unto the trunks of a couple of mighty elephants, capable of\r\npulling down the mountain of Himavat. I am the one person here that\r\npossesses the might of the thousand elephants. I am without a peer, even\r\nas Sakra is known to be in heaven among the celestials. Let people\r\nwitness today the prowess of these two arms of my broad-chested self,\r\nwhile engaged in baffling the bright and blazing weapon of Drona's son.\r\nIf there be none (else) capable of contending against the Narayana\r\nweapon, even I shall contend against it today in the very sight of all\r\nthe Kurus and the Pandavas. O Arjuna, O Vibhatsu, thou shouldst not lay\r\nGandiva aside. A stain will then attach to thee like that of the moon.'\r\nThus addressed Bhima, Arjuna said, O Bhima, even this is my great vow,\r\nviz., that my Gandiva shall not be used against the Narayana weapon,\r\nkine, and Brahmanas. Thus answered by Arjuna, Bhima, that chastiser of\r\nfoes, riding on his car of solar effulgence, whose rattle, besides,\r\nresembled the roar of the clouds, rushed against the son of Drona. Endued\r\nwith great energy and prowess, the son of Kunti, in consequence of his\r\nextreme lightness of hand, within the twinkling of an eye, covered\r\nAswatthaman with a shower of weapons. Then Drona's son, smiling at the\r\nrushing Bhima and addressing him (in proper words) covered him with\r\narrows, inspired with mantras and equipped with blazing points. Shrouded\r\nwith those shafts that vomited fire and resembled snakes of blazing\r\nmouths, as if covered with sparks of gold. The form, O king, of Bhimasena\r\nin that battle looked like that of a mountain in the evening when covered\r\nwith fire. That weapon of Drona's son, directed against Bhimasena\r\nincreased in energy and might, O king, like a conflagration assisted by\r\nthe wind. Beholding that weapon of terrible energy thus increasing in\r\nmight, a panic entered the hearts of all the combatants of the Pandava\r\narmy with the exception of Bhima. Then all of them, throwing down their\r\nweapons on the earth, alighted from their cars and steeds. After they had\r\nthrown their weapons and alighted from their vehicles, that weapon of\r\nexceeding energy fell upon the head of Bhima. All creatures, especially\r\nthe Pandavas, uttered cries of Oh and Alas, beholding Bhimasena\r\noverwhelmed by the energy of that weapon.'\""

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, \"Beholding Bhimasena overwhelmed by that weapon,\r\nDhananjaya, for baffling its energy, covered him with the Varuna weapon.\r\nIn consequence of the lightness of Arjuna's arms, and owing also to the\r\nfiery force that shrouded Bhima, none could see that the latter had been\r\ncovered with the Varuna weapon. Shrouded with the weapon of Drona's son,\r\nBhima, his steeds, driver, and car became incapable of being gazed at,\r\nlike a fire of blazing flame in the midst of another fire. As at the\r\nclose of the night, O king, all the luminaries run towards the Asta hill,\r\neven so the fiery shafts (of Aswatthaman) all began to proceed towards\r\nBhimasena's car. Indeed, Bhima himself, his car, steeds, and driver, O\r\nsire, thus shrouded by Drona's son seemed to be in the midst of a\r\nconflagration. As the (Yuga) fire consuming the entire universe with its\r\nmobile and immobile creatures when the hour of dissolution comes, at last\r\nenters the mouth of the Creator, even so at the weapon of Drona's son\r\nbegan to enter the body of Bhimasena. As one cannot perceive a fire if it\r\npenetrates into the sun or the sun if it enters into a fire, even so none\r\ncould perceive that energy which penetrated into Bhima's body. Beholding\r\nthat weapon thus investing Bhima all around, and seeing Drona's son\r\nswelling with energy and might, the latter being then without an\r\nantagonist, and observing also that all the warriors of the Pandava army\r\nhad laid down their weapons and that all the mighty car-warriors of that\r\nhost headed by Yudhishthira had turned away their faces from the foe,\r\nthose two heroes, viz., Arjuna and Vasudeva, both endued with great\r\nsplendour, quickly alighting from their car, ran towards Bhima. Those two\r\nmighty men, diving into that energy born of the might of Aswatthaman's\r\nweapon, had resorted to the power of illusion. The fire of that weapon\r\nconsumed them not, in consequence of their having laid aside their\r\nweapons, as also in consequence of the force of the Varuna weapon, and\r\nowing also to the energy possessed by themselves. Then Nara and Narayana,\r\nfor the pacification of Narayana weapon, began forcibly to drag Bhima and\r\nall his weapons. Thus dragged by them, Kunti's son, that mighty\r\ncar-warrior, began to roar aloud. Thereupon, that terrible and invincible\r\nweapon of Drona's son began to increase (in might and energy). Then\r\nVasudeva, addressing Bhima, said, 'How is it, O son of Pandu, that though\r\nforbidden by us, thou, O son of Kunti, dost not yet abstain from battle?\r\nIf the Kurus could now be vanquished in battle, then we, as also all\r\nthese foremost of men, would certainly have continued to fight. Behold,\r\nall the warriors of thy host have alighted from their cars. For this\r\nreason, O son of Kunti, do thou also come down from thy car.' Having said\r\nthese words, Krishna brought Bhima down from his car. The latter, with\r\neyes red as blood in rage, was sighing like a snake. When, however, he\r\nwas dragged down from his car and made to lay aside his weapons, the\r\nNarayana weapon, that scorcher of foes, became pacified.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'When, by this means, the unbearable energy of that\r\nweapon became stilled, all the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, became clear. Sweet breezes began to blow and birds and\r\nanimals all became quiet. The steeds and elephants became cheerful, as\r\nalso all the warriors, O ruler of men! Indeed, when the terrible energy\r\nof that weapon, O Bharata, became stilled, Bhima. of great intelligence,\r\nshone resplendent like the morning sun. The remnant of the Pandava host,\r\nbeholding the pacification of the Narayana weapon, once more stood\r\nprepared on the field for compassing the destruction of thy sons. When,\r\nafter that weapon had been baffled, the Pandava host, stood arrayed,\r\nDuryodhana, O king, addressing Drona's son, said, O Aswatthaman, once\r\nmore use that weapon speedily since the Panchalas are once more arrayed,\r\ndesirous of victory.' Then addressed by thy son, O sire, Aswatthaman,\r\nsighing cheerlessly, replied unto the king in these words, 'That weapon,\r\nO king, cannot be brought back. It cannot be used twice. If brought back,\r\nit will without doubt, slay the person calling it back. Vasudeva, hath,\r\nby what means thou hast seen, caused it to be baffled. For this, O ruler\r\nmen, the destruction of the foe hath not been compassed in battle. Defeat\r\nand death, however, are the same. Rather, defeat is worse than death. Lo,\r\nthe enemy, vanquished and compelled to lay down his arms, looks as if\r\ndeprived of life'. Duryodhana then said, 'O preceptor's son, if it be so,\r\nif this weapon cannot be used twice, let those slayers of their preceptor\r\nbe slain with other weapons then, O foremost one of all persons\r\nacquainted with weapons! In thee are all celestial as well as in the\r\nThree eyed (Siva) of immeasurable energy. If thou wishest it not, even\r\nPurandara in rage cannot escape thee.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Drona had been slain with the aid of fraud,\r\nand the Narayana weapon baffled, what, indeed, did Drona's son, thus\r\nurged by Duryodhana then, do, beholding the Parthas once more arrived for\r\nbattle freed from the Narayana weapon, and careering at the head of their\r\ndivisions?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Remembering the slaughter of his sire, Drona's son,\r\nowning the device of the lion's tail on his banner, filled with rage and\r\ncasting of all fears, rushed against the son of Prishata. Rushing at him,\r\nO bull among men, that foremost of warriors, with great impetuosity,\r\npierced the Panchala prince with five and twenty small arrows. Then\r\nDhrishtadyumna, O King, pierced Drona's son that resembled a blazing\r\nfire, with four and sixty shafts. And he pierced Aswatthaman's driver\r\nalso with twenty arrows whetted on stone and equipped with wings of gold,\r\nand then his four steeds with four sharp arrows. Repeatedly piercing\r\nDrona's son, and causing the earth to tremble with his leonine roars.\r\nDhrishtadyumna then seemed to be employed in taking the lives of\r\ncreatures in the world in dreadful battle. Making death itself his goal,\r\nthe mighty son of Prishata, O king, accomplished in weapons and endued\r\nwith sureness of aim, then rushed against Drona's son alone. Of\r\nimmeasurable soul, that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the prince of\r\nPanchala, poured upon Aswatthaman's head a shower of arrows. Then Drona's\r\nson, in that battle, covered the angry prince with winged shafts. And\r\nonce more, he pierced the latter with ten shafts, remembering the\r\nslaughter of his father. Then cutting off the standard and bow of the\r\nPanchala prince with a couple of well-shot shafts, equipped with heads\r\nlike razors. Drona's son began to grind his foe with other arrows. In\r\nthat dreadful battle, Aswatthaman made his antagonist steedless and\r\ndriverless and carless, and covered his followers also with thick showers\r\nof shafts. At this, the Panchala troops, O king, mangled by means of\r\nthose arrowy showers fled away in fear and great affliction. Beholding\r\nthe troops turning away from battle and Dhrishtadyumna exceedingly\r\nafflicted, the grandson of Sini quickly urged his car against that of\r\nDrona's son. He then afflicted Aswatthaman with eight keen shafts. And\r\nonce more striking that angry warrior with twenty shafts of diverse\r\nkinds, he pierced Aswatthaman's driver, and then his four steeds with\r\nfour shafts. With. great deliberations and displaying a wonderful\r\nlightness of hand, he cut off Aswatthaman's bow and standard, Satyaki\r\nthen cut into fragments the gold-decked car of this foe together with its\r\nsteeds. And then he deeply pierced Aswatthaman in the chest with thirty\r\narrows in that battle. Thus afflicted, O king, (by Satyaki), and shrouded\r\nwith arrows, the mighty Aswatthaman knew not what to do. When the\r\npreceptor's son had fallen into that plight, thy son, that car-warrior,\r\naccompanied by Kripa and Karna and others began to cover the Satwata hero\r\nwith arrows. All of them began quickly to pierce Satyaki from every side\r\nwith keen shafts, Duryodhana pierced him with twenty, Saradwat's son,\r\nKripa, with three. And Kritavarman pierced him with ten, and Karna with\r\nfifty. And Duhsasana pierced him with a hundred arrows, and Vrishasena\r\nwith seven. Satyaki, however, O king, soon made all those great\r\ncar-warriors fly away from the field, deprived of their cars. Meanwhile,\r\nAswatthaman, O bull of Bharata's race, recovering consciousness, and\r\nsighing repeatedly in sorrow, began to think of what he should do. Riding\r\nthen upon another car, that scorcher of foes, viz., the son of Drona,\r\nbegan to resist Satyaki, shooting hundreds of arrows. Beholding\r\nAswatthaman once more approaching him in battle, the mighty car-warrior,\r\nSatyaki, once more made him careless and caused him to turn back. Then\r\nthe Pandavas, O king, beholding the prowess of Satyaki, blew their conchs\r\nwith great force and uttered loud leonine roars. Having deprived\r\nAswatthaman of his car thus, Satyaki, of unbaffled prowess, then slew\r\nthree thousand mighty car-warriors of Vrishasena's division. And then he\r\nslew fifteen thousand elephants of Kripa's force and fifty thousand\r\nhorses of Sakuni. Then, the valiant son of Drona, O monarch, riding upon\r\nanother car, and highly enraged with Satyaki, proceeded against the\r\nlatter, desirous of slaying him. Beholding him approach again, the\r\ngrandson of Sini, that chastiser of foes, once more pierced and mangled\r\nhim with keen shafts, fiercer than those he had used before. Deeply\r\npierced with those arrows of diverse forms by Yuyudhana, that great\r\nbowmen, viz., the angry son of Drona, smilingly addressed his foe and\r\nsaid, 'O grandson of Sini, I know thy partiality for Dhrishtadyumna, that\r\nslayer of his preceptor, but thou shalt not be able to rescue him or your\r\nown self when attacked by me. I swear to thee, O grandson of Sini, by\r\ntruth and by my ascetic austerities, that I shall know no peace till I\r\nslay all the Panchalas. You may unite the forces of the Pandavas and\r\nthose of the Vrishnis together, but I shall still slay the Somakas.\r\nSaying this, the son of Drona shot at Satyaki an excellent and straight\r\narrow possessed of the effulgence of the sun, even as Sakra had hurled in\r\ndays of yore his thunder at the Asura Vritra. Thus shot by Aswatthaman,\r\nthat arrow, piercing through the armour of Satyaki, and passing through\r\nhis body, entered the earth like a hissing snake entering its hole. His\r\narmour pierced through, the heroic Satyaki, like an elephant deeply\r\nstruck with the hook, became bathed in blood that flowed from his wound.\r\nHis bow, with arrow fixed thereon, being then loosened from his grasp, he\r\nsat down on the terrace of his car strengthless and covered all over with\r\nblood. Seeing this his driver speedily bore him away from Drona's son.\r\nWith another shaft, perfectly straight and equipped with goodly wings\r\nthat scorcher of foes, viz., Aswatthaman, struck Dhrishtadyumna between\r\nhis eyebrows. The Panchala prince had before this been much pierced;\r\ntherefore, deeply wounded by that arrow, he became exceedingly weak and\r\nsupported himself by seizing his flag-staff. Beholding Dhrishtadyumna\r\nthus afflicted by Aswatthaman, like an infuriated elephant by a lion,\r\nfive heroic car-warriors of the Pandava army, viz., Kiritin, Bhimasena,\r\nVrihatkshatra of Puru's race, the youthful prince of the Chedis, and\r\nSudarsana, the chief of the Malavas, quickly rushed against Aswatthaman.\r\nArmed with bows, all these rushed with cries Oh and Alas. And those\r\nheroes quickly encompassed the son of Drona on all sides. Advancing\r\ntwenty paces, all of them, with great care, simultaneously struck the\r\nangry son of the preceptor with five and twenty arrows. Drona's son,\r\nhowever, with five and twenty shafts, resembling snakes of virulent\r\npoison, cut off, almost at the same time, those five and twenty arrows\r\nshot at him. Then Aswatthaman afflicted the Paurava prince with seven\r\nsharp shafts. And he afflicted the chief of the Malavas with three,\r\nPartha with one, and Vrikodara with six shafts. Then all those great\r\ncar-warriors, O king, pierced Drona's son unitedly and separately with\r\nmany shafts, whetted on stone equipped with wings of gold. The youthful\r\nprince of the Chedis pierced Drona's son with twenty and Partha pierced\r\nhim with three. Then Drona's son struck Arjuna with six arrows, and\r\nVasudeva with six, and Bhima with five, and each of the other two viz.,\r\nthe Malava and the Paurava, with two arrows. Piercing next the driver of'\r\nBhima's car with six arrows, Aswatthaman cut off Bhimasena's bow and\r\nstandard with a couple of arrows. Then piercing Partha once more with a\r\nshower of arrows, Drona's son uttered a leonine roar. With the sharp,\r\nwell-tempered, and terrible arrows shot by Drona's son, the earth, the\r\nsky, the firmament, and the points of the compass, cardinal and\r\nsubsidiary, all became entirely shrouded both in his front and rear.\r\nEndued with fierce energy and equal to Indra himself in prowess,\r\nAswatthaman with three arrows, almost simultaneously cut off the two\r\narms, like unto Indra's poles, and the head of Sudarsana, as the latter\r\nwas seated on his car. Then piercing Paurava with a dart and cutting off\r\nhis car into minute fragments by means of his arrows, Aswatthaman lopped\r\noff his antagonist's two arms smeared with sandal-paste and then his head\r\nfrom off his trunk with a broad-headed shaft. Possessed of great\r\nactivity, he then pierced with many arrows resembling blazing flames of\r\nfire in energy, the youthful and mighty prince of the Chedis who was of\r\nthe hue of the dark lotus, and despatched him to Yama's abode with his\r\ndriver and steeds. Beholding the chief of the Malavas, the descendant of\r\nPuru, and the youthful ruler of the Chedis slain in this very sight by\r\nthe son of Drona.. Bhimasena, the mighty-armed son of Pandu, became\r\nfilled with rage. The scorcher of foes then covered Drona's son in that\r\nbattle with hundreds of keen arrows resembling angry snakes of virulent\r\npoison. Endued with mighty energy, the angry son of Drona then destroying\r\nthat arrowy shower, pierced Bhimasena with sharp shafts. The mighty-armed\r\nBhima then, possessed of great strength, cut off with a broad-headed\r\narrow the bow of Drona's son and then pierced Drona's son himself with a\r\npowerful shaft. Throwing away that broken bow, the high-souled son of\r\nDrona took up another and pierced Bhima with his winged shafts. Then\r\nthose two, viz., Drona's son and Bhima, both possessed of great prowess\r\nand might, began to shower their arrowy downpours like two masses of\r\nrain-charged clouds. Gold-winged arrows, whetted on stone and engraved\r\nwith Bhima's name shrouded Drona's son, like gathering masses of clouds\r\nshrouding the sun. Similarly, Bhima was soon shrouded with hundreds and\r\nthousands of strong arrows shot by Drona's son. Though shrouded in that\r\nbattle by Drona's son, that warrior of great skill, Bhima yet felt no\r\npain, O monarch, which seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then the\r\nmighty-armed Bhima sped ten gold-decked arrows, of great keenness and\r\nresembling the darts of Yama himself, at his foe. Those shafts, O sire,\r\nfailing upon the shoulders of Drona's son, quickly pierced his body, like\r\nsnakes penetrating into an ant-hill. Deeply pierced by the high-souled\r\nson of Pandu, Aswatthaman, closing his eyes, supported himself by seizing\r\nhis flagstaff. Recovering his senses within a moment, O king, Drona's son\r\nbathed in blood, mustered all his wrath. Forcibly struck by the\r\nhigh-souled son of Pandu, Aswatthaman, endued with mighty arms, rushed\r\nwith great speed towards the car of Bhimasena. And then, O Bharata, he\r\nsped at Bhimasena, from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, a hundred\r\narrows of fierce energy, all looking like snakes of virulent poison.\r\nPandu's son Bhima also, proud of his prowess in battle, disregarding\r\nAswatthaman's energy, speedily showered upon him dense arrowy downpour.\r\nThen Drona's son, O king, cutting off Bhima's bow by means of his arrows,\r\nand filled with rage, struck the Pandava in the chest with many keen\r\nshafts. Incapable of brooking that feat, Bhimasena took up another bow\r\nand pierced Drona's son in that battle with five keen shafts. Indeed,\r\nshowering upon each other their arrowy downpours like two masses of\r\nclouds at the close of summer, two warriors, with eyes red as copper in\r\nrage, completely covered each other in that battle with their shafts.\r\nFrightening each other with the terrible sounds they made by their palms,\r\nthey continued to fight with each other, each counteracting the feats of\r\nthe other. Then bending his formidable bow adorned with gold, Drona's son\r\nbegan to gaze steadfastly at Bhima who was thus shooting his shafts at\r\nhim. At that time, Aswatthaman looked like the meridian sun of blazing\r\nrays in an autumnal day. So quickly then did he shoot his shafts that\r\npeople could not see when he took them out of his quiver when he fixed\r\nthem on the bowstring when he drew the string, and when he let them off.\r\nIndeed, when employed in shooting his arrows, his bow, O monarch, seemed\r\nto be incessantly drawn to fiery circle. Shafts in a hundred thousands,\r\nshot from his bow, seemed to course through the welkin like a flight of\r\nlocusts. Indeed, those terrible shafts adorned with gold, shot from the\r\nbow of Drona's son, coursed incessantly towards Bhima's car. The prowess,\r\nO Bharata, that we then beheld of Bhimasena, and his might, energy, and\r\nspirit, were exceedingly wonderful, for, regarding that terrible shower\r\nof arrows thick as a gathering mass of clouds, failing around him to be\r\nnothing more than a downpour of rain at the close of summer. Bhima of\r\nterrible prowess, desirous of slaying the son of Drona, in return poured\r\nhis arrows upon the latter like a cloud in the season of rains. Bhima's\r\nlarge and formidable bow of golden back, incessantly drawn in that\r\nbattle, looked resplendent like a second bow of Indra. Shafts in hundreds\r\nand thousands, issuing from it, shrouded Drona's son, that ornament of\r\nbattle in that encounter. The showers of shafts, shot by both of them\r\nwere so dense, O sire, that the very wind, O king, could not find room\r\nfor coursing through them. Then Drona's son, O king, desirous of slaying\r\nBhima, sped at him many gold-decked arrows of keen points steeped in oil.\r\nShowing his superiority to Drona's son Bhimasena cut off each of those\r\narrows into three fragments before they could come at him. The son of\r\nPandu then said, 'Wait Wait.' And once more, the mighty son of Pandu\r\nfilled with rage, and desirous of slaying the son of Drona, shot at him a\r\nterrible shower of fierce arrows. Then Drona's son that warrior\r\nacquainted with the highest weapons, quickly destroying that arrowy\r\nshower by the illusion of his own weapons, cut off Bhima's bow in that\r\nencounter. Filled with rage, he then pierced Bhima himself with\r\ninnumerable shafts in that battle. Endued with great might, Bhima then,\r\nafter his bow had been cut off, hurled a dart at Aswatthaman's car,\r\nhaving whirled it previously with great impetuosity. The son of Drona,\r\ndisplaying the lightness of his hand in that encounter, quickly cut off,\r\nby means of sharp shafts, that dart as it coursed towards him with the\r\nsplendour of a blazing brand. Meanwhile, terrible Vrikodara, taking up a\r\nvery strong bow, and smiling the while, began to pierce the son of Drona\r\nwith many arrows. Then Drona's son, O monarch, with a straight shaft,\r\npierced the forehead of Bhima's driver. The latter, deeply pierced by the\r\nmighty son of Drona, fell into a swoon, O king, abandoning the reins of\r\nthe steeds. The driver of the Bhima's car having fallen into a swoon, the\r\nsteeds, O king, began to fly away with great speed, in the very sight of\r\nall the bowmen. Beholding Bhima carried away from the field of battle by\r\nthose running steeds, the unvanquished Aswatthaman joyfully blew his huge\r\nconch. Beholding Bhimasena borne away from the field, all the Panchalas,\r\ninspired with fear, abandoning the car of Dhrishtadyumna, fled away on\r\nevery side. Then Drona's son, shooting his shafts fiercely, pursued those\r\nbroken troops, causing a great carnage among them. Thus slaughtered in\r\nbattle by the son of Drona, those Kshatriyas fled away in all directions\r\nfrom fear of that warrior.\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that force broken, Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, of\r\nimmeasurable soul, proceeded against Aswatthaman from desire of slaying\r\nhim. Those troops then, O king, rallied with effort by Govinda and\r\nArjuna, stayed on the field of battle. Only Vibhatsu, supported by the\r\nSomakas and the Matsyas, shot his arrows at the Kauravas and checked\r\ntheir onset.[268] Quickly approaching Aswatthaman, that great bowman\r\nhaving the mark of the lion's tail on his banner, Arjuna addressed him,\r\nsaying, 'Show me now the might thou hast, the energy, the knowledge, and\r\nthe manliness, that are in thee, as also thy affection for the\r\nDhartarashtras and thy hatred for us, and the high mettle of which thou\r\nart capable. Even Prishata's son, that slayer of Drona, will quell thy\r\npride today. Come now and encounter the Panchala prince, that hero\r\nresembling the Yuga fire and like the Destroyer himself with Govinda.\r\nThou hast displayed thy pride in battle, but I shall quell that pride of\r\nthine.'\r\n\r\n\"Dhritarashtra said, 'The preceptor's son, O Sanjaya, is possessed of\r\nmight and worthy of respect. He beareth great love to Dhananjaya and the\r\nhigh-souled Dhananjaya also loveth him in return. Vibhatsu had never\r\naddressed Drona's son before in this way. Why then did the son of Kunti\r\naddress his friend in such words?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of the youthful prince of the Chedis, of\r\nVrihatkshatra of Puru's race, and of Sudarsana, the chief of the Malavas,\r\nwho was well-accomplished in the science of arms, and upon the defeat of\r\nDhrishtadyumna and Satyaki and Bhima, and feeling great pain and touched\r\nto the quick by those words of Yudhishthira, and remembering a his former\r\nwoes, O lord, Vibhatsu, in consequence of his grief, felt such wrath rise\r\nwithin him the like of which he had never experienced before. It was for\r\nthis that like a vulgar person, he addressed the preceptor's son who was\r\nworthy of every respect, in such unworthy, indecent, bitter, and harsh\r\nlanguage. Addressed, from wrath, in such harsh and cruel words by Partha,\r\nO king, Drona's son, that foremost of all mighty bowmen, became highly\r\nangry with Partha and especially with Krishna. The valiant Aswatthaman,\r\nthen, staying resolutely on his car, touched water and invoked the Agneya\r\nweapon incapable of being resisted by the very gods. Aiming at all his\r\nvisible and invisible foes, the preceptor's son, that slayer of hostile\r\nheroes, inspired with mantras a blazing shaft possessed of the effulgence\r\nof a smokeless fire, and let it off on all sides, filled with rage. Dense\r\nshowers of arrows then issued from it in the welkin. Endued with fiery\r\nflames, those arrows encompassed Partha on all sides. Meteors flashed\r\ndown from the firmament. A thick gloom suddenly shrouded the (Pandava)\r\nhost. All the points of the compass also were enveloped by that darkness.\r\nRakshasas and Pisachas, crowding together, uttered fierce cries.\r\nInauspicious winds began to blow. The sun himself no longer gave any\r\nheat. Ravens fiercely croaked on all sides. Clouds roared in the welkin,\r\nshowering blood. Birds and beasts and kine, and Munis of high vows and\r\nsouls under complete control, became exceedingly uneasy. The very\r\nelements seemed to be perturbed. The sun seemed to turn. The universe,\r\nscorched with heat, seemed to be in a fever. The elephants and other\r\ncreatures of the land, scorched by the energy of that weapon, ran in\r\nfright, breathing heavily and desirous of protection against that\r\nterrible force. The very waters heated, the creatures residing in that\r\nelement, O Bharata, became exceedingly uneasy and seemed to burn. From\r\nall the points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary, from the\r\nfirmament and the very earth, showers of sharp and fierce arrows fell and\r\nissued with the impetuosity of Garuda or the wind. Struck and burnt by\r\nthose shafts of Aswatthaman that were all endued with the impetuosity of\r\nthe thunder, the hostile warriors fell down like trees burnt down by a\r\nraging fire. Huge elephants, burnt by that weapon, fell down on the earth\r\nall around, uttering fierce cries loud as the rumblings of the clouds.\r\nOther huge elephants, scorched by that fire, ran hither and thither, and\r\nroared aloud in fear, as if in the midst of a forest conflagration. The\r\nsteeds, O king, and the cars also, burnt by the energy of that weapon,\r\nlooked, O sire, like the tops of trees burnt in a forest-fire. Thousands\r\nof cars fell down on all sides. Indeed, O Bharata, it seemed that the\r\ndivine lord Agni burnt the (Pandava) host in that battle, like the\r\nSamvarta fire consuming everything at the end of the Yuga.\r\n\r\n'Beholding the Pandava army thus burning in that dreadful battle, thy\r\nsoldiers, O king, filled with joy, uttered leonine shouts. Indeed, the\r\ncombatants, desirous of victory and filled with joy, speedily blew\r\nthousands of trumpets, O Bharata, of diverse kinds. Darkness having\r\nenveloped the world during that fierce battle, the entire Pandava army,\r\nwith Savyasachin, the son of Panda, could not be seen. We had never\r\nbefore, O king, heard of or seen the like of that weapon which Drona's\r\nson created in wrath on that occasion. Then Arjuna, O king, invoked into\r\nexistence the Brahma weapon, capable of baffling every other weapon, as\r\nordained by the Lotus-born (Brahma) himself. Within a moment that\r\ndarkness was dispelled, cool winds began to blow, and all the points of\r\nthe compass became clear and bright. We then beheld a wonderful sight,\r\nviz., a full Akshauhini (of the Pandava troops) laid low. Burnt by the\r\nenergy of Aswatthaman's weapon, the forms of the slain could not be\r\ndistinguished. Then those two heroic and mighty bowmen, viz., Kesava and\r\nArjuna, freed from that darkness, were seen together, like the sun and\r\nthe moon in the firmament. Indeed, the wielder of Gandiva and Kesava were\r\nboth unwounded. Equipped with its banners and standards and steeds, with\r\nthe Anukarsa unjoined; and with all the mighty weapons stored on it\r\nremaining uninjured, that car, so terrible to thy warriors, freed from\r\nthat darkness, shone resplendent on the field. And soon there arose\r\ndiverse sounds of life mingled with the blare of conchs and the beat of\r\ndrums, from among the Pandava troops filled with joy. Both hosts thought\r\nthat Kesava and Arjuna had perished Beholding Kesava and Arjuna,\r\ntherefore (freed from darkness and the energy of that weapon) and seeing\r\nthat reappear so quickly, the Pandavas were filled with joy, and the\r\nKauravas with wonder. Unwounded and full of cheerfulness, those two\r\nheroes blew their excellent conchs. Indeed, seeing Partha filled with\r\njoy, thy soldiers became exceedingly melancholy. Seeing those two\r\nhigh-souled ones (viz., Kesava and Arjuna), freed (from the energy of his\r\nweapon) the son of Drona became very cheerless. For a moment he\r\nreflected, O sire, on what had happened. And having reflected, O king, he\r\nbecame filled with anxiety and grief. Breathing long and hot sighs, he\r\nbecame exceedingly cheerless. Laying aside his bow, then, the son of\r\nDrona speedily alighted from his car, and saying, 'O fie, fie! Every\r\nthing is untrue,' he ran away from the fight. On his way he met Vyasa,\r\nthe abode of Saraswati, the compiler of the Vedas, the habitation of\r\nthose scriptures, unstained by sin, and of the hue of rain-charged cloud.\r\nBeholding him, that perpetuator of Kura's race, standing on his way, the\r\nson of Drona with voice choked in grief, and like one exceedingly\r\ncheerless, saluted him and said, 'O sire, O sire, is this an illusion, or\r\nis it a caprice (on the part of the weapon)? I do not know what it is.\r\nWhy, indeed, hath my weapon become fruitless? What breach (has there been\r\nin the method of invocation)? Or, is it something abnormal, or, is it a\r\nvictory over Nature (achieved by the two Krishnas) since they are yet\r\nalive? It seems that Time is irresistible. Neither Asuras, nor\r\nGandharvas, nor Pisachas, nor Rakshasas, nor Uragas, Yakshas, and birds,\r\nnor human beings, can venture to baffle this weapon shot by me. This\r\nfiery weapon, however, having slain only one Akshauhini of troops, hath\r\nbeen pacified. This exceedingly fierce weapon shot by me is capable of\r\nslaying all creatures. For what reason then could it not slay Kesava and\r\nArjuna, both of whom are endued with the attributes of humanity? Asked by\r\nme, O holy one, answer me truly. O great Muni, I desire to hear all this\r\nin detail.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'O highly significant is this matter that thou enquirest of\r\nme from surprise. I will tell thee everything; listen attentively. He\r\nthat is called Narayana is older than the oldest ones. For accomplishing\r\nsome purpose, that creator of the universe took his birth as the son of\r\nDharma. On the mountain of Himavat he underwent the severest ascetic\r\nausterities. Endued with mighty energy, and resembling fire or the sun\r\n(in splendour), he stood there with arms upraised. Possessed of eyes\r\nlike: lotus-petals, he emaciated himself there for sixty-six thousand\r\nyears, subsisting all the while upon air alone. Once more undergoing\r\nsevere austerities of another kind for twice that period, he filled the\r\nspace between earth and heaven with his energy. When by those\r\nausterities, O sire, he became: like Brahma[269] he then beheld the\r\nMaster, Origin, and Guardian of the Universe, the Lord of all the gods,\r\nthe Supreme Deity, who is exceedingly difficult of being gazed at, who is\r\nminuter than the minutest and larger than, the largest, who is called\r\nRudra,[270] who is the lord of all the superior ones, who is called Hara\r\nand Sambhu, who has matted locks on his head, who is the infuser of life\r\ninto every form, who is the First cause of all immobile: and mobile\r\nthings, who is irresistible and of frightful aspect, who is of fierce\r\nwrath and great Soul, who is the All-destroyer, and of large heart; who\r\nbeareth the celestial bow and a couple of quivers, who is cased in golden\r\narmour, and whose energy is infinite, who holdeth Pinaka, who is; armed\r\nwith thunderbolt, a blazing trident, battle axe, mace, and a large sword;\r\nwhose eye-brows are fair, whose locks are matted, who wieldeth the heavy\r\nshort club, who hath the moon on his forehead, who is clad in tiger-skin,\r\nand who is armed with the bludgeon; who is decked with beautiful angadas,\r\nwho hath snakes for his sacred thread, and who is surrounded by diverse\r\ncreatures of the universe and by numerous ghosts and spirits, who is the\r\nOne, who is the abode of ascetic austerities, and who is highly adored by\r\npersons of venerable age; who is Water, Heaven, Sky, Earth, Sun, Moon,\r\nWind and Fire, and who is the measure of the duration of the universe.\r\nPersons of wicked behaviour can never obtain a sight of that unborn one,\r\nthat slayer of all haters of Brahmanas, that giver of emancipation.[271]\r\nOnly Brahmanas of righteous conduct, when cleansed of their sins and\r\nfreed from the control of grief, behold him with their mind's eye. In\r\nconsequence of his ascetic austerities, Narayana obtained a sight of that\r\nunfading one, that embodiment of righteousness, that adorable one, that\r\nBeing having the universe for his form. Beholding that supreme Abode of\r\nall kinds of splendour, that God with a garland of Akshas round his neck,\r\nVasudeva, with gratified soul, became filled with delight which he sought\r\nto express by words, heart, understanding, and body. Then Narayana\r\nworshipped that Divine Lord, that First cause of the universe, that giver\r\nof boons, that puissant one sporting with the fair-limbed Parvati, that\r\nhigh-souled Being surrounded by large bands of ghosts, spirits, that\r\nUnborn one, that Supreme Lord, that Embodiment of the unmanifest, that\r\nEssence of all causes, that One of unfading power. Having saluted Rudra,\r\nthat destroyer of the Asura Andhaka, the lotus eyed Narayana, with\r\nemotion filling his heart, began to praise the Three-eyed one (in these\r\nwords), 'O adorable one, O first of all the gods, the creator of\r\neverything (viz., the Prajapatis) who are the regents of the world, and\r\nwho having entered the earth,--thy first work,--had, O lord, protected it\r\nbefore, have all sprung from thee. Gods, Asuras, Nagas, Rakshasas,\r\nPisachas, human beings, birds, Gandharvas, Yakshas and other creatures:\r\nwith the entire universe, we know, have all sprung from thee. Everything\r\nthat is done for propitiating Indra, and Yama, and Varuna, and Kuvera and\r\nPitris and Tvashtri, and Soma, is really offered to thee. Form and light,\r\nsound and sky, wind and touch, taste and water, scent and earth,[272]\r\ntime, Brahma himself, the Vedas, the Brahmanas and all these mobile\r\nobjects, have sprung from thee. Vapours rising from diverse receptacles\r\nof water, becoming rain-drops, which failing upon the earth, are\r\nseparated from one another. When the time of the Universal dissolution\r\ncomes those individual drops, separated from one another, once more unite\r\ntogether and make the earth one vast expanse of water. He that is\r\nlearned, thus observing the origin and the destruction, of all things,\r\nunderstands thy oneness. Two birds (viz., Iswara and Jiva), four\r\nAswatthas with their wordy branches (viz., the Vedas), the seven\r\nguardians (viz., the five essences or elements and the heart and the\r\nunderstanding), and the ten others that hold this city (viz., the ten\r\nsenses that constitute the body), have all been created by thee, but thou\r\nart separate from and independent of them. The Past, the Future, and the\r\nPresent, over each of which none can have any sway, are from thee, as\r\nalso the seven worlds and this universe. I am thy devoted adorer,--be\r\ngraceful unto me. Do not injure me, by causing evil thoughts to penetrate\r\nmy heart. Thou art the Soul of souls, incapable of being known. He that\r\nknows thee as the Universal Seed, attaineth to Brahma. Desiring to pay\r\nthee respects, I am praising thee, endeavouring to ascertain thy real\r\nnature, O thou that art incapable of being understood by the very gods.\r\nAdored by me, grant me the boons I desire but which are difficult of\r\nacquisition. Do not hide thyself in thy illusion.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa continued, 'The blue-throated God, of inconceivable soul, that\r\nwielder of Pinaka, that divine Lord ever praised by the Rishis, then gave\r\nboons unto Vasudeva who deserved them all. The great God said, 'O\r\nNarayana, through my grace, amongst men, gods, and Gandharvas, thou shalt\r\nbe of immeasurable might and soul. Neither gods, nor Asuras, nor great\r\nUragas, nor Pisachas, nor Gandharvas, nor men, nor Rakshasas, nor birds,\r\nnor Nagas, nor any creatures in the Universe, shall ever be able to bear\r\nthy prowess. No one amongst even the celestials shall be able to vanquish\r\nthee in battle. Through my grace, none shall ever be able to cause thee\r\npain by the weapon of thunderbolt or with any object that is wet or dry,\r\nor with any mobile or immobile thing. Thou shalt be superior to myself if\r\nthou ever goest to battle against me.' Thus were these boons acquired by\r\nSauri in days of yore. Even that God now walketh the earth (as Vasudeva),\r\nbeguiling the universe by his illusion. From Narayana's asceticism was\r\nborn a great Muni of the name of Nara, equal to Narayana himself. Know\r\nthat Arjuna is none else than that Nara. Those two Rishis, said to be\r\nolder than the oldest gods, take their births in every Yuga for serving\r\nthe purposes of the world. Thyself also, O thou of great heart, hast been\r\nborn as a portion of Rudra, by virtue of all thy religious acts and as a\r\nconsequence of high ascetic austerities, endued with great energy and\r\nwrath. Thou wert (in a former life) endued with great wisdom and equal to\r\na god. Regarding the universe to consist only of Mahadeva, thou hadst\r\nemaciated thyself by diverse vows from desire of gratifying that God.\r\nAssuming the form of a very superior person, that blazes fourth with\r\nsplendour, thou hast, O giver of honours, worshipped the great god with\r\nmantras, with homa, and with offerings. Thus adored by thee in thy former\r\nlife, the great god became gratified with thee, and granted thee numerous\r\nboons, O learned one, that thou hadst cherished in thy heart. Like\r\nKesava's and Arjuna's thy birth acts, and ascetic austerities are also\r\nsuperior. Like them, in thy worship, thou hast, in every Yuga, adored the\r\ngreat God in his Phallic form. Kesava is that devoted worshipper of Rudra\r\nwho has sprung from Rudra himself. Kesava always worship the Lord Siva,\r\nregarding his Phallic emblem to be the origin of the universe. In Kesava\r\nis always present that knowledge, in consequence of which he views the\r\nidentity of Brahman with the: universe and that other knowledge by which\r\nthe Past, the Present and the Future, the near and the remote, are all\r\nseen, as if the whole are before his eyes. The gods, the Siddhas and the\r\ngreat Rishis, adore Kesava for obtaining that highest object in the\r\nuniverse, viz., Mahadeva. Kesava is the creator of everything. The\r\nEternal Krishna should be adored with sacrifices. The Lord Kesava always\r\nworshippeth Siva in the Phallic emblem as the origin of all creatures.\r\nThe God having the bull for his mark cherisheth greater regard for\r\nKesava.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Vyasa, Drona's son, that\r\nmighty car-warrior, bowed unto Rudra and regarded Kesava as worthy of the\r\nhighest regards. Having his soul under complete control, he became filled\r\nwith delight, the marks whereof appeared on his body. Bowing unto the\r\ngreat Rishi, Aswatthaman then, casting his eyes on the (Kuru) army,\r\ncaused it-to be withdrawn (for nightly rest). Indeed, when, after the\r\nfall of Drona, the cheerless Kurus retired from the field, the Pandavas\r\nalso, O monarch, caused their army to be withdrawn. Having fought for\r\nfive days and caused an immense carnage, that Brahman well-versed in the\r\nVedas, viz., Drona, repaired, O king, to the region of Brahma!'.\""

      "content": "\"Dhritarashtra said, Upon the slaughter of the Atiratha, viz., Drona, by\r\nPrishata's son, what did my sons and the Pandavas next do?'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya, said, 'After the rout of the Kuru army, upon the slaughter of\r\nthat Atiratha, viz., Drona, by Prishata's son, Dhananjaya, the son of\r\nKunti beholding a wonderful phenomenon in connection with his own\r\nvictory, asked Vyasa, O bull of Bharata's race, who came thither in\r\ncourse of his wanderings, saying, 'O great Rishi, while I was engaged in\r\nslaying the foe in battle with showers of bright shafts, I continually\r\nbeheld before me, proceeding in advance of my car, a person of blazing\r\nhue, as if endued with the effulgence of fire. Whithersoever he proceeded\r\nwith his uplifted lance, all the hostile warriors were seen to break\r\nbefore him. Broken in reality by him, people regarded the foe to have\r\nbeen broken by me. Following in his wake, I only destroyed those, already\r\ndestroyed by him. O holy one, tell me who was that foremost of persons,\r\narmed with lance, resembling the sun himself in energy, that was thus\r\nseen by me? He did not touch the earth with his feet, nor did he hurl his\r\nlance even once. In consequence of his energy, thousands of lances issued\r\nout of that one lance held by him.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa said, 'Thou hast, O Arjuna, seen Sankara, that First cause from\r\nwhich have sprung the Prajapatis, that puissant Being endued with great\r\nenergy, he that is the embodiment of heaven, earth and sky, the Divine\r\nLord, the protector of the universe, the great Master, the giver of\r\nboons, called also Isana. O, seek the protection of that boon, giving\r\nDeity, that lord of the universe. He is called Mahadeva (the Supreme\r\nDeity), of Supreme Soul, the one only Lord, with matted locks (on head),\r\nthe abode of auspiciousness. Of three eyes and mighty arms, he is called\r\nRudra, with his locks tied in the shape of a crown, and his body attired\r\nin skins. That boon-giving lord of the universe, that Supreme Deity, is\r\nalso called Hara and Sthanu. He is the foremost of every being in the\r\nuniverse, he is incapable of being vanquished, he is the delighter of the\r\nuniverse and its supreme ruler. The first cause, the light and refuge of\r\nthe universe, he is ever victorious. The Soul and the creator of the\r\nuniverse, and having the universe for his form, he is possessed of great\r\nfame. The Lord of the universe, and its great Ruler, that puissant one,\r\nis also the master of all actions. Called also Sambhu, he is self-born,\r\nhe is the lord of all creatures, and the origin of the Past, the Future,\r\nand the Present. He is Yoga and the lord of Yoga; he is called Sarva, and\r\nis the Lord of all the worlds. He is superior to everything. The foremost\r\nof everything in the universe, and the highest of all, he is called also\r\nParumesthin. The Ordainer of the three worlds, he is the sole refuge of\r\nthe three worlds. Incapable of being vanquished, he is the protector of\r\nthe universe, and abode (the necessity of) birth, decay, and death. The\r\nSoul of knowledge, incapable of being compassed by knowledge, and the\r\nhighest of all knowledge he is unknowable. Through grace, he giveth unto\r\nhis worshippers the boons they desire. That Lord hath for his companions\r\ncelestial beings of diverse forms, some of whom are dwarfs, some having\r\nmatted locks, some with bald heads, some with short necks, some with\r\nlarge stomachs, some with huge bodies, some possessed of great strength\r\nand some of long ears. All of them, O Partha, have deformed faces and\r\nmouths and legs and strange attires. That Supreme Deity, called Mahadeva,\r\nis worshipped by followers that are even such. Even that Siva, O son,\r\nendued with such energy, proceedeth through kindness, in advance of thee.\r\nIn that fierce battle, O Partha, making the very hair stand on end, who\r\nelse, O Arjuna, than the divine Maheswara, that foremost of all bowmen,\r\nthat Deity of divine form, could even in imagination venture to vanquish\r\nthat force which was protected by those great smiters and bowmen, viz.,\r\nAswatthaman and Karna and Kripa? None can venture to stay before the\r\nwarrior that hath Maheswara walking before him. There is no being in the\r\nthree worlds that is equal to him. And the very scent of the enraged\r\nMahadeva, foes in battle tremble and become senseless and fall in large\r\nnumbers. For this, the gods in heaven adore and bow to him. Those men in\r\nthis world and those other men of pious conduct, that devoutly worship\r\nthe boon-giving, divine, and auspicious Rudra, obtain happiness here and\r\nattain to the highest state hereafter. O son of Kunti, bow down unto him\r\nthat is peace, unto him, called Rudra of blue throat, exceedingly subtle,\r\nand of great effulgence, unto him called Kapardin, him that is terrible,\r\nhim that of tawny eyes, him that is boon-giving; unto that great\r\nordainer, of red locks and righteous conduct; unto him that always does\r\nauspicious acts; unto him that is an object of desire; him that is of\r\ntawny eyes; him that is called Sthanu; him that is called Purusha; unto\r\nhim that is of tawny hair; him that is bold, him that is exceedingly\r\nsubtle and of great effulgence; unto him that is the giver of light; him\r\nthat is the embodiment of all sacred waters; him that is the God of gods;\r\nand him that is endued with great impetuosity; unto him that is of\r\nmanifest form; him that is called Sarva; him that is of agreeable attire;\r\nunto him that has an excellent head-gear, him that is of handsome face;\r\nhim that has the mountains for his habitation; him that is peace; him\r\nthat is the protector; him that has barks of trees for his attire; him\r\nwhose arms are decked with ornaments of gold, him who is fierce, him that\r\nis the lord of all the points of the compass; him that is the lord of the\r\nclouds and of all created beings; him that is the lord of all trees and\r\nof all kine; him that has his body shrouded with trees; him who is the\r\ncelestial generalissimo; him who inspires all thought; him who has the\r\nsacrificial ladle in his hand; him who is blazing; him who wields the\r\nbow; him who is Rama's self, him who has diverse forms; him who is the\r\nlord of the universe; him who had the munja grass for his attire; him who\r\nhas a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand arms, and a thousand\r\nlegs. O son of Kunti, seek the protection of that boon-giving Lord of the\r\nuniverse, the lord of Uma, that God of three eyes, that destroyer of\r\nDaksha's sacrifice; that guardian of all created things, that being who\r\nis always cheerful, that protector of all beings, that God of unfading\r\nglory; that one with matted locks; that mover of all superior beings,\r\nthat one whose navel is like that of a bull and who hath the bull for his\r\nsymbol; that one who is proud like the bull, who is the lord of bulls;\r\nwho is represented by the horns of the bull; and who is the bull of\r\nbulls; that one who hath the image of the bull on his banner; who is\r\nliberal to all righteous persons; who can be approached by Yoga only; and\r\nwhose eyes are like those of a bull; who owneth very superior weapons:\r\nwho hath Vishnu himself for his arrow; who is the embodiment of\r\nrighteousness; and who is called Maheswara; who is of vast stomach and\r\nvast body; who hath a leopard's skin for his seat; who is the lord of the\r\nworlds; who is devoted to Brahma and who loveth Brahmanas; who is armed\r\nwith trident; who is boon-giving; who wieldeth the sword and the shield,\r\nand who is highly auspicious, who wieldeth the bow called Pinaka, who is\r\ndivested of the battle axe,[273] and who is the protector and lord of the\r\nuniverse. I place myself in the hands of that divine Lord, that grantor\r\nof protection, that God attired in deer-skins. Salutations, to that Lord\r\nof the celestials who hath Vaisravana for his friend. Salutations ever to\r\nhim of excellent vows; to him who hath excellent bowmen for his\r\ncompanions; to him who himself wieldeth the bow; to that God with whom\r\nthe bow is a favourite weapon; who is himself the shaft impelled by the\r\nbow; who is the bowstring and the bow; and the preceptor teaching the use\r\nof the bow. Salutations to the God whose weapons are fierce; and who is\r\nthe foremost of all the gods. Salutations to him of diverse forms; to him\r\nwho hath many bowmen around him. Salutations ever to him who is called\r\nSthanu and who has a large number of excellent bowmen for his companions.\r\nSalutations to him who destroyed the triple city. Salutations to him who\r\nslew (the Asura) Bhaga. Salutations to him who is the lord of trees and\r\nof men. Salutations to him who is the lord of the (celestial), Mothers,\r\nand of those tribes of spirits known by the name of Ganas. Salutations\r\never to him who is the lord of kine and of sacrifices. Salutations ever\r\nto him who is the lord of the waters and the lord of the gods, who is the\r\ndestroyer of Surya's teeth, who is of three eyes, who is the grantor of\r\nboons; who is called Hara, who is blue-throated, and who is of golden\r\nlocks. I will now tell thee, according to my knowledge and as I have\r\nheard of them, all the divine deeds of Mahadeva of Supreme wisdom. If\r\nMahadeva becomes angry, neither gods, nor Asuras, Gandharvas, nor\r\nRakshasas, even if they hide themselves in deep oceans, can have peace.\r\nIn the days of yore, Daksha, for performing a sacrifice, had collected\r\nthe necessary articles. Mahadeva destroyed that sacrifice in wrath.\r\nIndeed, He became very stern on that occasion. Shooting an arrow from his\r\nbow, he uttered terrible roars. The celestials then became filled with\r\nanxiety and fright. Indeed, when Mahadeva became angry and the Sacrifice\r\n(in its embodied form) fled away, the gods became exceedingly frightened\r\nat the twang of Mahadeva's bow and the sound of his palms. The gods and\r\nAsuras all fell down and submitted to Mahadeva. All the waters swelled up\r\nin agitations and the earth trembled. The mountains split, and all the\r\npoints of the compass and the Nagas became stupefied. The universe,\r\nenveloped in a thick darkness, could no longer be seen. The splendour of\r\nall luminaries, with the sun was destroyed. The Rishis, filled with fear,\r\nbecame agitated, and desirous of their own good as also of all creatures,\r\nperformed propitiatory rites. Surya was then eating the principal\r\noblation. Smilingly Sankara approached him and tore out his teeth. The\r\ngods then, humbling themselves to him, fled away, trembling. Once more,\r\nMahadeva aimed at the gods a shower of blazing and keen arrows resembling\r\nflames of fire mixed with smoke, or clouds with lightning. Beholding that\r\narrowy shower, all the gods bowing down unto Maheswara, assigned to Rudra\r\na substantial share in sacrifices. In fright, the gods, O prince, sought\r\nhis protection. His wrath being dispelled, the great God then restored\r\nthe sacrifice. The gods that had fled away came back. Indeed, they are to\r\nthis day afraid of Maheswara. Formerly, the valiant Asuras had, in\r\nheaven, three cities. Each of those cities was excellent and large. One\r\nwas made of iron, another of silver, and the third of gold. The golden\r\ncity belonged to Kamalaksha, the silver city to Tarakaksha, and the\r\nthird, made of iron, had Vidyunmalin for its lord. With all his weapons,\r\nMaghavat (Indra) was unable to make any impression on those cities.\r\nAfflicted (by the Asuras), all the gods sought the protection of Rudra.\r\nApproaching him, all the gods with Vasava at their head, said, 'These\r\nterrible dwellers of the triple city have received boons from Brahma.\r\nFilled with pride in consequence of those boons, they are greatly\r\nafflicting the universe, O Lord of the gods, none, save thee, is\r\ncompetent to slay them. Therefore, O Mahadeva, slay these enemies of the\r\ngods: O Rudra, creatures slain in every sacrifice shall then be thine.\r\nThus addressed by the gods, Mahadeva thus accepted their request, moved\r\nby the desire of benefiting them, and said, 'I will overthrow these\r\nAsuras. And Hara made the two mountains, viz., Gandhamadana and Vindhya,\r\nthe two poles of his car. And Sankara made the earth with her oceans and\r\nforests his battle car. And the three-eyed deity made that prince of\r\nsnakes, viz., Sesha, the Aksha, of that car. And that God of gods, the\r\nwielder of Pinaka, made the moon and the sun the two wheels of that\r\nvehicle. And the triple-eyed Lord made Elapatra and Pushpadanta, the two\r\npins of the yoke. And the valiant Mahadeva made the Malaya mountains the\r\nyoke, and the great Takshaka the string for tying the yoke to the poles,\r\nand the creatures about him the traces of the steed. And Maheswara made\r\nthe four Vedas his four steeds. And that lord of the three worlds made\r\nthe supplementary Vedas the bridle-bits. And Mahadeva made Gayatri and\r\nSavitri the reins, the syllable Om the whip, and Brahma the driver. And\r\nmaking the Mandara mountains the bow, Vasuki the bowstring, Vishnu his\r\nexcellent shaft, Agni the arrow-head, and Vayu the two wings of that\r\nshafts, Yama the feathers in its tail, lightning the whetting stone, and\r\nMeru the standard, Siva, riding on that excellent car which was composed\r\nof all the celestial forces, proceeded for the destruction of the triple\r\ncity. Indeed, Sthanu, that foremost of smiter, that Destroyer of Asuras,\r\nthat handsome warrior of immeasurable prowess, adored by the celestials,\r\nO Partha, and by Rishis possessing wealth of asceticism, caused an\r\nexcellent and unrivalled array called after his own name, and stood\r\nimmovable for a thousand years. When, however, the three cities came\r\ntogether in the firmament, the lord Mahadeva. pierced them with that\r\nterrible shaft of his, consisting of three knots. The Danavas were unable\r\nto gaze at that shafts inspired with Yuga-fire and composed of Vishnu and\r\nSoma. While the triple city commenced to burn, the goddess Parvati\r\nrepaired thither to behold the sight. She had then on her lap, a child\r\nhaving a bald head with five clumps of hair on it. The goddess asked the\r\ndeities as to who that child was. Sakra, through ill-feeling endeavoured\r\nto strike that child with his thunderbolt. The divine lord Mahadeva (for\r\nthe child was none other), smiling, quickly paralysed the arm of the\r\nenraged Sakra. Then god Sakra, with his arm paralysed accompanied by all\r\nthe celestials, speedily repaired to the lord Brahma of unfading glory.\r\nBowing unto him with their heads, they addressed Brahma with joined hands\r\nand said, 'Some wonderful creature, O Brahma, lying on the lap of\r\nParvati, in the form of a child, was behold by us but not saluted. We\r\nhave all been vanquished by him. We, therefore, desire to ask thee as to\r\nwho he may be. Indeed, that boy, without fighting, hath with the greatest\r\nease vanquished us all with Purandara at our head.' Hearing these words\r\nof theirs, Brahma. that foremost of all persons, acquainted with Brahma,\r\nreflected for a moment and understood that boy of immeasurable energy to\r\nbe none else than the divine Sambhu, Addressing then, those foremost of\r\ncelestials with Sakra at their head, Brahma said, 'That child is the\r\ndivine Hara the Lord of the entire mobile and immobile universe. There is\r\nnothing superior to Maheswara. That Being of immeasurable splendour who\r\nwas beheld by you all with Uma, that divine lord, had assumed the form of\r\na child for Uma's sake. Let us all go unto him. That divine and\r\nillustrious one is the Supreme Lord of the world. Ye gods, ye could not\r\nrecognise that master of the universe.' Then all the gods with the\r\nGrandsire repaired to that child, endued with the effulgence of the\r\nmorning sun. Beholding Maheswara, and knowing that he was the Supreme\r\nBeing, the Grandsire Brahma thus adored him: Thou art Sacrifice, O lord,\r\nthou art the stay and refuge of the universe. Thou art Bhava, thou art\r\nMahadeva, thou art the abode (of all things), and thou art the highest\r\nrefuge. This whole universe with its mobile and immobile creatures, is\r\npervaded by thee. O holy one, O lord of the past and the future, O lord\r\nof the world, O protector of the universe, let Sakra, afflicted with thy\r\nwrath, have thy grace.'\r\n\r\n\"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of the lotus-born Brahma,\r\nMaheswara became gratified. Desirous of extending his grace, he laughed\r\naloud. The celestials then gratified (with praise) both Uma and Rudra.\r\nThe arm of the thunder-wielding Sakra re-got its natural state. That\r\nforemost one of all the gods, that destroyer of Daksha's sacrifice, that\r\ndivine lord having the bull for his sign, became gratified with the gods.\r\nHe is Rudra he is Siva, he is Agni, he is everything, and he hath\r\nknowledge of everything. He is Indra, he is the Wind, he is the twin\r\nAswins, and he is the lighting. He is Bhava, he is Parjanya, he is\r\nMahadeva, he is sinless. He is the Moon, he is Isana, he is Surya, he is\r\nVaruna. He is Kala, he is Antaka, he is Mrityu, he is Yama.[274] He is\r\nthe day, and he is the night. He is the fortnight, he is the month, he is\r\nthe seasons. He is the morning and evening-twilights, he is the year. He\r\nis Dhatri, he is Vidhatri, he is the Soul of the universe, and he is the\r\ndoer of all acts in the universe. Though himself without body, it is he\r\nwho is the embodied celestial. Endued with great splendour he is adored\r\nand praised by all the gods. He is One, he is Many, he is hundred and\r\nthousand. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas say that he hath two forms. These\r\nare the terrible and the auspicious. These two forms, again, are\r\nmultifarious. His auspicious forms are water, light, and the moon.\r\nWhatever is highly mysterious in the several branches of the Vedas, in\r\nthe Upanishads, in the Puranas, and in those sciences that deal with the\r\nsoul, is that God, viz., Maheswara, Mahadeva is even such. That God is,\r\nagain, without birth. All the attributes of that God are not capable of\r\nbeing enumerated by me even if, O son of Pandu, I were to recite them\r\ncontinually for a thousand years. Even unto those that are afflicted by\r\nall the evil planets, even unto those that are stained with every sin,\r\nthat great protector, if they seek him, becomes gratified with them and\r\ngranteth them salvation. He granteth, and taketh away life and health and\r\nprosperity and wealth and diverse kinds of objects of desire. The\r\nprosperity is his that is seen in Indra and other gods. He is ever\r\nengaged in the good and evil of men in this world. In consequence of his\r\nsupremacy, he can always obtain whatever objects he desires. He is called\r\nMaheswara and is the lord of even the supreme ones. In many forms of many\r\nkinds he pervadeth the universe. The mouth which that God has is in the\r\nocean. It is well-known that mouth, assuming the form of a mare's head,\r\ndrinketh the sacrificial libation in the shape of water. This god always\r\ndwelleth in crematoriums. Men worship that Supreme lord in that place\r\nwhere none but the courageous can go. Many are the blazing and terrible\r\nforms of this God that men speak of and worship in the world. Many also\r\nare the names, of truthful import, of this Deity in all the worlds. Those\r\nnames are founded upon his supremacy, his omnipotence, and his acts. In\r\nthe Vedas the excellent hymn called Sata Rudriya, hath been sung in\r\nhonour of that great God called the infinite Rudra. That God is the lord\r\nof all wishes that are human and heavenly. He is omnipotent, and he is\r\nthe supreme master. Indeed, that God pervadeth the vast universe. The\r\nBrahmanas and the Munis describe him as the First-born of all creatures.\r\nHe is the First of all the gods; from his mouth was born Vayu (the wind).\r\nAnd since he always protecteth the creatures (of the universe) and\r\nsporteth with them, and since also he is the lord of all creatures,\r\ntherefore is he called Pasupati. And since his Phallic emblem is always\r\nsupposed to be in the observance of the vow of Brahmacharya, and since he\r\nalways gladden the world, therefore he is called Maheswara. The Rishis,\r\nthe gods, the Gandharvas, and Apsaras, always worship his Phallic emblem\r\nwhich is supposed to stand upright. That worship maketh Maheswara glad.\r\nIndeed, Sankara (at such worship) becomes happy, pleased, and highly\r\nglad. And since with respect to the past, the future, and the present,\r\nthat God has many forms, he is, on that account, called Vahurupa\r\n(many-formed). Possessed of one eye he blazeth forth in effulgence, or he\r\nmay be regarded to have many eyes on every side of his body. And since,\r\nhe possesseth the worlds, he is for that reason called Sarva. And since\r\nhis form is like that of smoke, he is for that reason called Dhurjjati.\r\nAnd since those deities, viz., the Viswedevas are in him, he is for that\r\nreason called Viswarupa. And since three goddesses adore and have\r\nrecourse to that Lord of the universe, viz., Firmament, Water and Earth,\r\nhe is for that reason called Tryamvaka. And since he always increaseth\r\nall kinds of wealth and wisheth the good of mankind in all their acts, he\r\nis for that reason called Siva. He possesseth a thousand eyes, or ten\r\nthousand eyes, and hath them on all sides. And since he protecteth this\r\nvast universe, he is for that reason called Mahadeva. And since he is\r\ngreat and ancient and is the source of life and of its continuance, and\r\nsince his Phallic emblem is everlasting, he is for that reason called\r\nSthanu. And since the solar and the lunar rays of light that appear in\r\nthe world are spoken of as the hair on the Three-eyed one, he is for that\r\nreason called Vyomakesa. And since, afflicting Brahma and Indra and\r\nVaruna and Yama and Kuvera, he destroyeth them ultimately, he is for that\r\nreason called Hara. And since, he is the Past, the Future, and the\r\nPresent, and, in fact, everything in the universe, and since he is the\r\norigin of the past, the future, and the present, he is for that reason\r\ncalled Bhava. The word Kapi is said to mean supreme, and Vrisha is said\r\nto mean righteousness. The illustrious God of gods, therefore, is called\r\nVrishakapi. And since Maheswara by means of his two eyes closed (in\r\nmeditation), created through sheer force of will a third eye on his\r\nforehead, he is for that reason called the Three-eyed. Whatever of\r\nunsoundness there is in the bodies of living creatures, and whatever of\r\nsoundness there is in them, represent that God. He is the wind, the vital\r\nairs called Prana, Apana (and the others) in the bodies of all creatures,\r\nincluding even those that are diseased. He who adoreth any image of the\r\nPhallic emblem of that high-souled God, always obtaineth great prosperity\r\nby that act. Downwards fiery, and half the body, that is auspiciousness\r\nis the moon. His auspiciousness is the moon. So also half his soul is\r\nfire and half the moon. His auspicious from, full of energy, is more\r\nblazing than the forms of the gods. Among men, his blazing and terrible\r\nform is called fire. With that auspicious form he practiseth\r\nBrahmacharya. With that other terrible form he as supreme Lord devoureth\r\neverything. And since he burneth, since he is fierce, since he is endued\r\nwith great prowess, and since he devoureth flesh and blood and marrow, he\r\nis for this called Rudra. Even such is the deity called Mahadeva, armed\r\nwith Pinaka, who, O Partha, was seen by thee engaged in slaying thy foes\r\nin advance of thy car. After thou hadst vowed to slay the ruler of the\r\nSindhus, O sinless one, Krishna showed thee this God, in thy dream,\r\nsitting on the top of that foremost of mountains. This illustrious God\r\nproceedeth in advance of thee in battle. It is he who gave thee those\r\nweapons with which thou didst slay the Danavas. The hymn approved of the\r\nVedas, and called Sata-Rudriya, in honour of that God of gods, that\r\nexcellent, famous, life-enhancing, and sacred hymn, has now, O Partha,\r\nbeen explained to thee. This hymn of four divisions, capable of\r\naccomplishing every object, is sacred, destructive of all sins, and\r\ncompetent to drive away all stains and to kill all sorrows and all fears.\r\nThe men that always listen to this succeeds in vanquishing all his foes\r\nand is highly respected in the region of Rudra. The person who always\r\nattentively reads or listens to the recitation of this excellent and\r\nauspicious account, appertaining to battle, of the illustrious Deity, and\r\nhe worships with devotion that illustrious Lord of the universe,\r\nobtaineth all the objects of desire, in consequence of the three-eyed God\r\nbeing gratified with him. Go and fight, O son of Kunti, defeat is not for\r\nthee, that hast Janardana. on thy side for thy adviser and protector.'\r\n\r\n\"Sanjaya said, 'Having addressed Arjuna in these words, the son of\r\nParasara, O chief of the Bharatas, went away to the place he had come\r\nfrom, O chastiser of foes.'"

      "content": "\"Sanjaya said, 'Having battled fiercely for five days, O king, the\r\nBrahmana (Drona) endued with great strength, fell and repaired to the\r\nregion of Brahma. The fruits that arise from a study of the Vedas arise\r\nfrom a study of this Parva also. The great achievements of brave\r\nKshatriyas have been described here. He who readeth or listeneth to the\r\nrecitation of this Parva every day is freed from heinous sins and the\r\nmost atrocious acts of his life. Brahmanas may always obtain herefrom the\r\nfruits of sacrifices. From this, Kshatriyas may obtain victory in fierce\r\nbattle. The other orders (Vaisyas and Sudras) may obtain desirable sons\r\nand grandsons and all objects of desire!'\"\r\n\r\nThe end of Drona Parva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1. Literally, like an oration teeming with unrefined expressions.\r\n\r\n2. i.e., deprived of robes and ornaments because of her widowhood.\r\n\r\n3. A Sarabha is a fabulous animal of eight legs supposed to be stronger\r\nthan the lion.\r\n\r\n4. The sense seems to be, that when such an one hath been slain, what is\r\nthere on earth that is not subject to destruction? Ye, should, therefore,\r\ngrieve for your wealth, children etc. as things already gone.\r\n\r\n5. There is a slight difference of reading in this sloka as it occurs in\r\nthe Bombay text. The sense seems to be, that since everything is destined\r\nto die, why should I fear to do my duty.\r\n\r\n6. The last line is read incorrectly, I think, in the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n7. The second fine of 12 is read incorrectly in the Bengal text. Instead\r\nof tathapi the true reading (as in the Bombay edition) is tavapi.\r\n\r\n8. Kula-samhanana-jnana, i.e., 'knowledge of Kula, as also of samhanana,\r\nwhich latter, as Nilakantha explains, means the body. A knowledge of the\r\nbody, of vital and other limbs, was possessed by every accomplished\r\nwarrior who wanted to smite effectually.\r\n\r\n9. i.e., who will feel it humiliating for him to walk behind Drona?\r\n\r\n10. A substantial difference of reading occurs here between the Bengal\r\nand the Bombay texts. Both have defects of their own. It seems to me that\r\nDrona, as leader, proceeded in the van. Karna, when described as\r\nproceeding at the head of all bowmen, must be taken marching at the head\r\nof the whole rear guard. In the case, his position would be immediately\r\nbehind Drona's.\r\n\r\n11. Lit, \"placed army to their right,\" i.e., these birds wheeled to the\r\nleft of thy host, which is an evil omen.\r\n\r\n12. The first line of 23 is read with a slight variation in the Bengal\r\ntext. The words 'nothing could be seen save Drona's arrows' are added\r\nhere to make the sense clear.\r\n\r\n13. Probably, a ready instrument.\r\n\r\n14. The sense seems to be that having carefully attained Arjuna in arms\r\nhe has got the fruit of his care and labour in the form of defeat and\r\ndeath at the hands of, or, at least, through, his own pupil.\r\n\r\n15. This sentence comprises 7. 8 and the first line of 9. I have followed\r\nthe exact order of the original. The peculiarity of the Sanskrit\r\nconstruction is that the Nominative Pronoun is made to stand in\r\napposition with a noun in the objective case. The whole of this Section\r\ncontains many such sentences.\r\n\r\n16. 10 and 11 also refer to Ajatasatru.\r\n\r\n17. Ghatotkacha was the son of Hidimva by Bhimasena. Rakshasi women bring\r\nforth the very day they conceive, and their offspring attain to youth the\r\nvery day they are born!\r\n\r\n18. Hayaraja, lit., the prince of steeds. He was an Asura, otherwise\r\ncalled Kesi, in the form of a steed.\r\n\r\n19. i.e., without weapons of any kind.\r\n\r\n20. Kaliprasanna Singha, in his Bengali translation, makes a mess of this\r\nSloka.\r\n\r\n21. Jarasandha, the powerful king of the Magadhas, and the sworn foe of\r\nKrishna, was slain by Bhima through Krishna's instigation.\r\n\r\n22. viz., the transplantation of the Parijata from Amaravati to the earth.\r\n\r\n23. Though gods, they have taken their births as men, and, they must\r\nachieve their objects by human means. It is for this that they do not, by\r\na fiat only of their will, destroy this host.\r\n\r\n24. The Bengal Texts read this verse incorrectly. For Prataptam, the\r\ncorrect reading is satatam; and for anukarinas, the correct word is\r\nasukarinas.\r\n\r\n25. The Bengal reading is Sura-vyala. The Bombay texts reads Sulav-yala.\r\nI adopt the latter. Vajinas, in Prani-vaji-nishevitam, is explained by\r\nNilakantha to mean fowl or bird.\r\n\r\n26. It is evident that the very minuteness with which the comparison is\r\nsought to be sustained, destroys the effect. Regarding the repetition,\r\nthey are just such as one may expect to find in verses composed extempore.\r\n\r\n27. This verse is read incorrectly in the Bengal texts. For hayan read\r\nDhanus.\r\n\r\n28. The word \"heroic\" occurs in the next verse.\r\n\r\n29. The word in the original are Sampata, Abhighata, and Nipata.\r\n\r\n30. Nishka, literally, a golden coin, whose weight is diversely stated by\r\ndiverse authorities.\r\n\r\n31. I adopt the Bengal reading which is Vidhayaivam. The Bombay reading\r\nis Vihayainam, meaning 'leaving Yudhishthira.'\r\n\r\n32. Soldiers sworn to conquer or die. Instead of using a long-winded\r\nphrase each time the word occurs, it is better to repeat it in this form.\r\n\r\n33. The second line reads differently in the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n34. It seems that the text here is vicious. It certainly requires\r\nsettling. One complete Sloka seems to be wanting.\r\n\r\n35. The second line of this verse is certainly vicious.\r\n\r\n36. Ekacharas is explained by Nilakantha as 'unable to bear the sight of\r\nothers of their species,' i.e., walking by themselves, or solitarily or\r\nsingly. Some of the vernacular translators are for taking this word as\r\nimplying the Rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n37. Literally, 'thought in his mind that his hour was come.'\r\n\r\n38. Literally, half-moon-shaped.'\r\n\r\n39. Cruel because it was a Brahmana with whom Satanika was fighting.\r\n\r\n40. The Bengal reading Vahupellava is a mistake. The correct reading is\r\nVahupannaga as in the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n41. Using even these as implements for striking, for Bhima's might was\r\nsuperhuman.\r\n\r\n42. Hemadandais is a mistake of the Bengal texts for Hemabhandiers.\r\n\r\n43. The first line of 20 is vicious as it occurs in the Bengal texts. The\r\nBombay reading is correct.\r\n\r\n44. 'This seems to be a repetition of the 6th verse.\r\n\r\n45. i.e., not to abandon their comrades in distress.\r\n\r\n46. The last word of the first line of 74 is vicious as printed in the\r\nBengal texts.\r\n\r\n47. The custom, when one warrior attacked another, was invariably to give\r\nhis name and lineage before striking.\r\n\r\n48. All the printed texts, not excepting that of Bombay, read Drupadeyas.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that it should be Draupadeyas.\r\n\r\n49. The first line of 54 is read incorrectly in the Bengal texts. I\r\nfollow the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n50. After 19 occurs a complete sloka in the Bombay text which does not\r\nappear to be genuine.\r\n\r\n51. The second line of 46 is omitted in the Bengal texts.\r\n\r\n52. The Bengali translators have made a mess of these two verses. Among\r\nothers, K. P. Singha makes Ruchiparvan follow Bhima and suppose Suvarchas\r\nto be some Pandava warrior who slew Ruchiparvan. The reading Suvarchas is\r\nvicious. The correct reading is Suparva, meaning, as Nilakantha explains,\r\n\"of beautiful limbs.\" Parvatapati is Bhagadatta himself.\r\n\r\n53. The Bengal reading abhitas is incorrect. It should be Kshubitas.\r\n\r\n54. I render 16 and 17 rather freely, as otherwise the sense would not be\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n55. The Bengal texts read,--\"he is either the first or the second, on the\r\nearth, I think.\"\r\n\r\n56. The Bombay reading paritas is vicious. The Bengal texts read twaritas.\r\n\r\n57. The Bengal texts read the second line differently. Lokam\r\n(accusative). For Gharmancubhis the Bengal reading is Gharmamvubhis.\r\nNilakantha explains that varsha (whence varshika) means season. Hence\r\nNigadavarshikau masau would mean the two months of summer. If the Bengal\r\nreading were adopted, the meaning would be \"like summer and the rainy\r\nseasons afflicting the world with sweat and rain.\"\r\n\r\n58. The Bengal reading Samprapte is vicious. The Bombay reading\r\nSambhrante is evidently correct.\r\n\r\n59. I render 5 a little freely, and expand it slightly to make the sense\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n60. The Bengal reading Purvabhilashi is better than Purvabhilbhashi.\r\nBetween Nila and Aswatthaman existed a rivalry since some time.\r\n\r\n61. The word in the original is dhumaketu. Elsewhere I have rendered it\r\ncomet. It would seem, however, that is wrong. In such passages the word\r\nis used in its literal sense, viz., \"(an article) having smoke for its\r\nmark,\" hence fire.\r\n\r\n62. The first half of the first line of 21 seems to be grammatically\r\nconnected with 20.\r\n\r\n63. The last half of the second line of 4 is vicious as occuring in the\r\nBengal texts. The correct reading is ayuduha-viarada.\r\n\r\n64. Janghas, etc., are diverse limbs of cars used in battle.\r\n\r\n65. 'The second half of the second line of 2 is vicious in the Bengal\r\ntexts.\r\n\r\n66. I omit the names as they occur in the text. These are: (1)\r\nKshurupras, i.e., arrows sharp as razors, (2) Vatsadantas, i.e., arrows\r\nhaving heads like the calf-tooth, (3) Vipathas, i.e., long arrows having\r\nstout bodies, (4) Narachas, long arrows; Ardhachandrabhais, i.e., looking\r\nlike shafts furnished with heads of the form of the half-moon; it is an\r\nadjective qualifying Narachis, (5) Anjalikas were broad-headed shafts.\r\n\r\n67. There are the names of diverse kinds of drums small and large.\r\n\r\n68. I adopt the Bombay reading of the 1st line of 4.\r\n\r\n69. The fruit being the present encounter with Abhimanyu in which\r\nDuhsasana, according to Abhimanyu, shall have to lay down his life.\r\n\r\n70. Pravanddiva is explained by Nilakantha as nimnadeeam prapya. The\r\nmeaning seems to be, as I have put it, \"like an elephant in a low land,\r\ni.e., land covered with mud and water.\"\r\n\r\n71. These words occur in 17 lower down.\r\n\r\n72. 'These are limbs of cars.\r\n\r\n73. The Bombay reading is slightly different.\r\n\r\n74. Literally, \"like another son of the Lord of Treasure\".\r\n\r\n75. I confess I do not understand what the meaning is of asiva vachvz\r\nSrijatam. The rendering I offer is tentative.\r\n\r\n76. I follow the numbering of the Bengal texts. 23 consists of three\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n77. I expand the 5th a little to make the sense clear.\r\n\r\n78. I expand the 5th a little to make the sense clear.\r\n\r\n79. In the first fine of 3, the correct reading is Karnanchapy akarot\r\nkradha, etc., the reading in the Bengal text is vicious and unmeaning.\r\n\r\n80. Bengal text read Taru-tringani i.e., tree-tops.\r\n\r\n81. The correct reading is Mahavalan Mahavalat.\r\n\r\n82. The Bombay reading which I accept, is Valabudhischa. Of course Bengal\r\nreading is Avalabudhischa.\r\n\r\n83. During the days of mourning a person is regarded as unclean, being\r\nunable to perform his ordinary worship and other religious rites. After\r\nthe obsequies are performed the mourning is ended, he is supposed to be\r\ncleansed.\r\n\r\n84. The first line of 6 is read differently in the Bombay edition. The\r\nBengal reading, however, seems to me to be preferable.\r\n\r\n85. Both the Bengal and Bombay editions, in the first line of 12, read\r\nprita, i.e., gratified. There can be no doubt, however, that the correct\r\nreading is Bhita, i.e., affrighted, as I have put it. I find that some of\r\nthe Bengali translators have also made this correction.\r\n\r\n86. Devas, in the first line of 46, means the senses, Vrittas, as\r\nexplained by Nilakantha, means Vritavantus.\r\n\r\n87. Verse 55, as occuring in both the Bengal and the Bombay text,\r\nrequires corrections, 55 is incomplete. For the words tada Raja,\r\ntherefore, I read Sokam tyaja, as suggested by K. P. Singha. Then the\r\nVisarga after Yudhishthira must be dropped to make it a vocative.\r\nSimilarly, Pandavas in 58 should be Pandava, a vocative and not a\r\nnominative upakramat should be upakrama. The last two corrections are\r\nmade in the Bombay text. The fact, is, are 55 to 58 the words of Vyasa,\r\nor of Sanjaya? Evidently, it is Vyasa that speaks, and, hence the\r\nnecessity of the corrections noted.\r\n\r\n88. I follow Nilakantha in rendering these two verses.\r\n\r\n89. Of golden excreta.\r\n\r\n90. The Bengal reading is Samvartam. The Bombay text makes Samvarta a\r\nnominative. I have adopted the Bengal reading. If the Bombay reading be\r\naccepted, the meaning would be that Samvarta himself, piqued with\r\nVrihaspati, caused Marutta to perform a sacrifice. K. P. Singha makes a\r\nludicrous blunder in supposing Samvarta to have been a kind of sacrifice.\r\n\r\n91. The word in the original Atavika, literally meaning one dwelling in\r\nthe woods. It is very generally used in the sense of thieves or robbers,\r\nthus showing that these depredators from the earliest times, had the\r\nwoods and the forests for their home.\r\n\r\n92. Vahinyas rivers. Swairinyas, open to every body. The Bengal reading\r\nis abhavan; the Bombay reading Vyatahan. If the former reading be,\r\nadopted, it would mean the rivers were of liquid gold.\r\n\r\n93. i.e., sacrifices ordained for Kshatriyas.\r\n\r\n94. Siksha, one of the six branches of Vedas; it may be called the\r\northoepy of the Vedas. Akshara, letters of the alphabet. The sense seems\r\nto be that these Brahmanas were good readers of the Vedas.\r\n\r\n95. The word in the original Murddhabhishikta, which literally means one\r\nwhose coronal locks have undergone the ceremony of the sacred\r\ninvestiture. Hence, it is used to denote Kshatriyas or persons of the\r\nroyal order.\r\n\r\n96. Havisha mudamavahat; or havisham udam avahat, which would mean, he\r\npoured libations unto Indra as copious as water.\r\n\r\n97. Because juniors pre-deceased their seniors. The causative form of\r\nakarayan is a license.\r\n\r\n98. The four kinds of creatures that owned Rama's sway were (1) those\r\nthat were oviparous, (2) those that were viviparous, (3) those born of\r\nfilth, and (4) the vegetables.\r\n\r\n99. These were ghats for facilitating access to the sacred stream.\r\n\r\n100. Both 5 and 6 are difficult slokas. But for Nilakantha I could never\r\nhave understood their sense. The reading Jalaughena, occuring in both the\r\nBengal and the Bombay editions, is a mistake for Janaughena. The\r\nconstruction of 5 is this: Dakshina Bhuyasirdadat: tena hetuna Janaughena\r\nakaranta. The story of the salvation of Bhagiratha's ancestors is a\r\nbeautiful myth. King Sagara (whence Sagara or the Ocean) had sixty\r\nthousand sons. They were all reduced to ashes by the curse of the sage\r\nKapila, an incarnation of Vishnu himself. Bhagiratha, a remote\r\ndescendant, caused the sacred Ganga to roll over the spot where the ashes\r\nof his ancestors lay, and thus procured their salvation.\r\n\r\n101. The correct reading is Valguvadinas, and not the form in the\r\ngenitive plural.\r\n\r\n102. In the Bombay edition some verses occur after the 3rd.\r\n\r\n103. Literally \"Having me for his sustainer.\"\r\n\r\n104. Instead of Suna, the Bombay text gives Puru.\r\n\r\n105. The Bengal text reads this verse differently.\r\n\r\n106. The words in italics are names of Indian confectionery, prepared\r\nwith wheat or barley, milk, and sugar or honey.\r\n\r\n107. These are the methods by which he sought knowledge of the Vedas.\r\n\r\n108. 'Nakshatra-dakshina is explained by Nilakantha as Nakshatra\r\nvihitro-Dakshina.\r\n\r\n109. The Bengal reading of the second line of the second verse is\r\nvicious. At any rate, the Bombay reading is better.\r\n\r\n110. Animals slain in sacrifices are believed to go to heaven.\r\n\r\n111. Identified with the modern Chumbal.\r\n\r\n112. A kind of vessel used by Brahmanas and others for begging.\r\n\r\n113. Vaswoksara means made 'of gold.' It is a feminine adjective. The\r\nsubstantive is omitted. I think the passage may mean--'The city of\r\nRantideva is made of gold.'\r\n\r\n114. A Vyama is the space between the two arms extended at their furthest.\r\n\r\n115. Literally, a Kshatriya is one that rescues another from wounds and\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\n116. A raja is one who enjoys the affection of his people, and with whom\r\nthey are delighted.\r\n\r\n117. The bow of Siva, otherwise called Pinaka.\r\n\r\n118. Aklishtakarman, literally, one who is never fatigued with work;\r\nhence one capable of obtaining the results of action by a mere fiat of\r\nthe will. It may also mean, of unspotted acts.\r\n\r\n119. Parthivas, i.e., relating to the earth.\r\n\r\n120. The first line of the verse, I think, has been correctly explained\r\nby Nilakantha. The paraphrase is ya imam bhumim sukham kurvan adyam i.e.\r\nadyam yugam anuparyeti sma.\r\n\r\n121. The Bombay text adds some verses here which do not occur in the\r\nBengal texts.\r\n\r\n122. K. P. Sinha makes a ludicrous blunder in reading this line.\r\n\r\n123. Sannahikas, i.e., clad in mail.\r\n\r\n124. The Bengal reading Dwijaidhitam is certainly better than the Bombay\r\nreading Dwijochitam although Nilakantha explains uchitam as abhimatam.\r\n\r\n125. Twilight is herself the goddess who is supposed to be adored by\r\ncertain prayers and on the occasion.\r\n\r\n126. These slaps mark the cadences.\r\n\r\n127. Literally, 'in crossing.'\r\n\r\n128. The Bengal reading Satyavrataiv in the first line of 9 is vicious. I\r\nadopt the Bombay reading Satyaratas, qualifying tara. To suppose that\r\nKrishna paid such a complement to the Kauravas as is implied by the\r\nBengal reading is an absurdity.\r\n\r\n129. i.e. added his voice to that of Jayadratha, requesting Drona to\r\nprotect the latter.\r\n\r\n130. A kind of car or vehicle.\r\n\r\n131. Nilakantha supposes that tasmai here refers to the Three-eyed and\r\nnot to Krishna. This seems to be right.\r\n\r\n132. The second note of the Hindu gamut.\r\n\r\n133. Vasavamiva is a mistake for Vasavasyeva.\r\n\r\n134. Apavrittam is explained by Nilakantha as endangered or made\r\ndoubtful. What Sanjaya says is that if it is not so, thou shalt then have\r\nto undergo the bitterness of ruling over the whole world bestowed upon\r\nthee by the Pandavas. Either the Pandavas will snatch away thy kingdom or\r\nmake thee ruler of the whole after slaying thy sons. Either of these\r\nalternatives would be bitter to thee.\r\n\r\n135. The original is pleonastic.\r\n\r\n136. This verse obviously needs correction. Instead of \"golden coats of\r\nmail,\" I think some such correction is needed, viz. coats of mail, of\r\nblack iron, decked with gold and dyed with blood, etc.\r\n\r\n137. The original is pleonastic.\r\n\r\n138. This Sloka occurs in all the texts. It would seem, therefore, that\r\nSanjaya was not always a witness only of the battle for narrating what he\r\nsaw to Dhritarashtra, but sometimes at least he took part in the battle.\r\n\r\n139. The words tatsainyanyabhyapujayan seem to be unmeaning in this\r\nconnection. The Bengali translators, unable to do anything with them,\r\nhave left them out.\r\n\r\n140. The celestial weapons were forces dependent on mantras. Ordinary\r\nshafts, inspired with these mantras, were converted into celestial\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\n141. In other words. Arjuna's car shot as quickly through the enemy as\r\nthe arrows themselves sped from it.\r\n\r\n142. The Bengal reading of the first line is vicious. The Bombay reading\r\nis Vamatkum Vipathum, Vanan. The first word means the froth in the mouth\r\nof the steeds.\r\n\r\n143. i.e., his funeral obsequies. The vernacular translators do not see\r\nthe intended joke.\r\n\r\n144. I give the sense of this verse, without giving a closely literal\r\nversion.\r\n\r\n145. Avabhritha is the final bath undergone, on completion of as\r\nsacrifice by the person performing the sacrifice. The slaughter of\r\nDuryodhana would according to Krishna, be the avabhritha of the sacrifice\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\n146. Praviddham means fallen down or loosened from its usual place. Thus\r\nNilakantha.\r\n\r\n147. Tripura means the three cities constructed by the Asura artificer\r\nMaya. The Asura, however, who owned those cities is also called Tripura.\r\nIt was Mahadeva who destroyed the three cities with all their population\r\nvide the close of the Harivansa.\r\n\r\n148. The true reading is alohita and not lohita. Arka here is crystal and\r\nnot the sun. It was a silvern boar, which could not, evidently, be like\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n149. Owners of golden cars.\r\n\r\n150. Nidas were niches or drivers boxes.\r\n\r\n151. Many of the opening slokas of this section are nearly the same as\r\nthose of section 76 of Bhishma Parva, vide ante. In a few instances I\r\nhave adopted the readings of the Bombay edition.\r\n\r\n152. I prefer the reading Samakulam to Jhashakulam.\r\n\r\n153. i.e., using cars and elephants as weapons for destroying cars and\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\n154. The fear behind them was from the Pandava army. The fear before them\r\nwas from the car-warriors who had succeeded in penetrating the Kuru host.\r\n\r\n155. Many of the Bengal texts have Calabhairiva. This is a mistake, the\r\nword being Calada, and not Calabha which would be unmeaning here.\r\n\r\n156. I render the second line of 4 too freely. The sense seems to be that\r\nwhen two persons fight, one cannot say beforehand who will succeed. Both\r\nhave chances of success, as, indeed, both have chances of defeat.\r\n\r\n157. The genius of the two languages being entirely different, I give the\r\nsense of the first line of 14 separately, without seeking to connect it,\r\nin the assertive form, with the second half of 13.\r\n\r\n158. Literally, 'disregard of Krishna.'\r\n\r\n159. The Bombay reading, which I adopt, seems to be better than the\r\nBengal one.\r\n\r\n160. I think that both Vrikodaram and nisitais in this verse as given in\r\nthe Bombay text are incorrect. I read Vrikodaras and navavhis following\r\nthe Bengal texts.\r\n\r\n161. The sense seems to be that Karna and Bhima were like fire and wind.\r\n\r\n162. Verse 28 is a triplet. The second line is obscure. It seems that a\r\nline has been omitted.\r\n\r\n163. Literally, mustered all his rage.\r\n\r\n164. In the first line of the 62 the Bengal reading Ayastam is better\r\nthan the Bombay reading Ayastas.\r\n\r\n165. Literally, 'a mountain overgrown with medicinal herbs of great\r\nefficacy.' Of course, the allusion is to Hanumat's removal of\r\nGandhamadana for the cure of Lakshmana.\r\n\r\n166. i.e., the little indent caused by a cow's hoof.\r\n\r\n167. The sense is that he that will slay me will always be victorious in\r\nbattle, will always slay the warriors with whom he may be engaged in\r\nbattle. Defeat will never be his.\r\n\r\n168. do not render 55 literally. Satyaki is called 'Satyavikrama,' i.e.,\r\nof true prowess' or 'of prowess incapable of being baffled.' If he\r\nsustains a defeat today at Bhurisrava's hand, that title of his will be\r\nfalsified. This is all that Krishna means.\r\n\r\n169. Verse 20 is incomplete. I supply the words,--'Why then should I not\r\nprotect' in order to make the meaning intelligible. The first line of 21\r\nis grammatically connected with 20. To avoid an ugly construction I\r\nrender it separately.\r\n\r\n170. Literally, 'who could witness with indifference Satyaki reduced to\r\nthat plight?'\r\n\r\n171. Generally, to die, abstaining from all food. It is a method of\r\nfreeing the soul from the body by Yoga.\r\n\r\n172. Literally, 'near the place assigned for the sacrificial butter.'\r\n\r\n173. Nilakantha explains chakram as Pratapam.\r\n\r\n174. The second line of 94 I render a little freely to make the sense\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\n175. A Kavandha is a headless trunk moving about as if endued with life.\r\nTales are told of these headless beings drinking the blood of victims\r\nfalling within their grasp.\r\n\r\n176. The second of the seven notes of the Hindu gamut.\r\n\r\n177. The printed editions and the manuscripts do not agree with one\r\nanother in respect of the order and numbering of the last dozen verses.\r\nThe Bombay edition omits a few of the verses.\r\n\r\n178. Everything even the inanimate creation, exists and adores the\r\nSupreme deity.\r\n\r\n179. This is a triplet in the Calcutta edition.\r\n\r\n180. Literally, 'the fact of the Dhartarashtras having sunk (into\r\ndistress).'\r\n\r\n181. Literally, 'of persons whose coronal locks have undergone the sacred\r\nbath.'\r\n\r\n182. Praluvdhas is explained by Nilakantha differently. He supposes that\r\nDuryodhana here characterises Sikhandin to be a deceitful fowler or\r\nhunter in consequence of the deceit with which he caused Bhishma's fall.\r\nThis is far-fetched.\r\n\r\n183. I adopt the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n184. The Bombay edition reads this verse differently and introduces\r\nanother after it which does not occur in the Bengal texts.\r\n\r\n185. I am not sure whether I have rendered the 31st and the first half of\r\n32nd correctly. The vernacular translators have made a mess of the\r\npassage. The difficulty lies with Surhittamais. I take it to mean that\r\nDuryodhana says, 'Karna, Sakuni, Duhsasana, with myself, had taken thee,\r\nO preceptor, for a friend, and had engaged thee in this battle. We did\r\nnot, however, then know that thou art an enemy in disguise.'\r\n\r\n186. i.e., 'he should, by very means in his power, avenge himself on the\r\nSomakas, those enemies of mine.'\r\n\r\n187. This is a triplet in the Bengal texts.\r\n\r\n188. I render the second line freely, following Nilakantha.\r\n\r\n189. Literally, 'with shafts resembling his rays.'\r\n\r\n190. Or, 'as a lake overgrown with lotuses is agitated on every side by\r\nan elephant.'\r\n\r\n191. Sixteen lines, occurring after this in the Bombay edition, have been\r\nomitted in the Calcutta edition.\r\n\r\n192. Drums of diverse kinds and sizes.\r\n\r\n193. The Bombay reading is apalavam and not viplatam.\r\n\r\n194. This is a triplet in all the editions.\r\n\r\n195. The brother of the Kalinga prince.\r\n\r\n196. Patanipam is explained by Nilakantha as something that causes the\r\npatana or downfall of a person hence sin. [There is no reference for this\r\nnote in the body of this page, so I have placed it in a likely\r\nlocation.--JBH]\r\n\r\n197. A nalwa measured four hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n198. Nilakantha explains that there were Pisachas.\r\n\r\n199. Aswatthaman and the Pandavas were like brothers, for both were\r\ndisciples of Drona Ghatotkacha, therefore, having been Bhima's son was\r\nAswatthaman's brother's son.\r\n\r\n200. i.e., the weapon endued with the force of the thunder.\r\n\r\n201. Different species of Rakshasas.\r\n\r\n202. Tripura, belonging to an Asura of the same.\r\n\r\n203. Asani literally means the thunder. Probably, some kind of iron mace.\r\n\r\n204. The Bengal texts read Utkrisha-vikramas. The correct reading seems\r\nto be Aklivhtavikramas. Then again Sahanujam seems to be inaccurate. I\r\nfollow the Bombay reading Sahanugam.\r\n\r\n205. Achyuta, when used as a proper noun, refers to Krishna. It means of\r\nunfading glory and 'the immortal.'\r\n\r\n206. Sight differences are observable between the Bengal and the Bombay\r\ntexts as regards the last three verses.\r\n\r\n207. This is a triplet.\r\n\r\n208. This is a triplet.\r\n\r\n209. In the second line of 4, utsedha and not udvrita is the true\r\nreading. So also kanchit and not kinchit. The paraphrase, according to\r\nNilakantha, in kanchit dhanurdharam na ganayan, etc.\r\n\r\n210. 147 is a triplet.\r\n\r\n211. The Bengal reading sudakshinas at the end of 49 dose not seem to be\r\ncorrect. I adopt the Bombay reading sudarnnam.\r\n\r\n212. The Bombay edition reads the first line of 3 differently. The Bengal\r\nreading is also defective. The correct reading seems to be Rathanaga\r\ninstead of Naranaga.\r\n\r\n213. This is a Triplet.\r\n\r\n214. Instead of mattagaje, the Bombay edition reads tatragaje.\r\n\r\n215. There seems to be a mistake in this sloka in its reference to the\r\nPandavas. The reading, however, that occurs in all the printed edition,\r\nis the same. In one manuscript I find Kamrava-yodhavurgais (which I\r\nadopt) for Pandava-Kauraveyais.\r\n\r\n216. The second line of 30, as it occurs in the Bengal texts, is adopted\r\nby me. A slight difference of reading occurs between the Bengal and the\r\nBombay editions.\r\n\r\n217. As regards almost every one of these slokas, differences of reading\r\nare observable between the Bengal texts and the Bombay edition. The\r\nreadings of the Bombay edition are almost uniformly better. Then, again,\r\nmany of those verses are disfigured with syntactical pleonasms and other\r\ngrave errors. Abounding with tiresome repetitions that scarcely attract\r\nnotice amid the variety of synonyms with which the language of the\r\noriginal abounds and amid also the melodious flow of the rhythm, the\r\ndefects become glaring in translation. At the latter, however, of\r\nfaithfulness, I have been obliged to sacrifice elegance, in rendering\r\nthis section.\r\n\r\n218. The Bengal reading tatha loka is incorrect. The Bombay text\r\ncorrectly reads tadaloka. Then also, instead of the Bengal reading\r\nrajasacaa samavrite (which is faulty), the true reading is raja tamasa\r\nvrite.\r\n\r\n219. Lokanamabhave is explained by Nilakantha as pralaya-kale.\r\n\r\n220. A different reading occurs in the Bombay edition.\r\n\r\n221. Nalikas, as used here, appear to have been some species of shafts.\r\nIn an earlier note, relying on other authorities, I took it to mean some\r\nkind of air-gun.\r\n\r\n222. Vaikartana may also mean one who has peeled off his skin of natural\r\narmour. To preserve dramatic propriety, the Hindu commentators explain it\r\nin this sense when it occurs in any such passage, for the real origin of\r\nKarna, viz., his procreation by the deity of the sun, became known after\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n223. 'The second line of 9 is read differently in the Calcutta edition. I\r\nadopt the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n224. In the second line of 13, Avyayatturnam instead of Maharaja is the\r\ncorrect reading.\r\n\r\n225. This sloka seems to be a vicious one.\r\n\r\n226. Yena and tena here are equal to yatra and tatra.\r\n\r\n227. In the first line of 30 Vaganais and not Vanaganan is the true\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n228. The second line of 30 is read differently in the Calcutta edition.\r\nIn consequence also of some differences between two printed editions, 30\r\nof the Calcutta text is 32 of the Bombay text.\r\n\r\n229. In the Bengal texts this is a triplet.\r\n\r\n230. It is for this that I see thee with this head as a tribute.\r\n\r\n231. An arani is a cubit measuring from the elbow to the end of the\r\nlittle figure.\r\n\r\n232. Both reading, viz., asaktam and asaktam are correct. The former\r\nmeans engaged' the latter, 'to the measure of his might!'\r\n\r\n233. The second line of 85 is differently in the Bombay edition.\r\n\r\n234. Rakshasas at certain hours were believed to be inspired with greater\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n235. Mainaka the son of Himavat, has a hundred heads.\r\n\r\n236. i.e., they thought they obtained a new lease of life.\r\n\r\n237. Literally means, \"united by Jara.\"\r\n\r\n238. Nilakantha thinks that Sagadaya in one word, meaning 'deprived of\r\nthe both Rakshasas and the mace.' This is far-fetched.\r\n\r\n239. Fire being the mouth of the celestials, without fire, the celestials\r\nbecome mouthless. Thus Nilakantha.\r\n\r\n240. This is a triplet in the Bengal texts.\r\n\r\n241. 66 is a triplet in the Bengal texts.\r\n\r\n242. Triyama, literally, consisting of three Yamas, a Yama being a watch\r\nof three hours. The first hour and a half of the night and the last hour\r\nand a half, being regarded as twilight, the night, truly as such, with\r\nthe ancient Hindoos, consisted of only nine hours.\r\n\r\n243. Literally, 'of a thousand Yamas.'\r\n\r\n244. The moon is called the lord of lilies because the water-lily is seen\r\nto bloom at moonrise, just as the sun is called the lord of the lotuses\r\nbecause the lotus blooms at sun-rise, The direction presided over by\r\nIndra means the East.\r\n\r\n245. Dasatakasha-kkupa means the Kakup or direction presided by him of a\r\nthousand eyes; hence the East.\r\n\r\n246. Instead of Vrishodara, the Bombay text reads Vrishottama, which I\r\nadopt.\r\n\r\n247. In the first line of 31, the Bengal texts read Rajanam probably\r\nreferring to Drupada. The correct reading, however, is Rujendra in the\r\nvocative case as in the Bombay edition.\r\n\r\n248. I render this a little too freely. The form of the oath is, \"Let\r\nthat man lose, etc. whom Drona escapes today with life or whom Drona\r\nvanquishes today.\"\r\n\r\n249. This, in the Bengal texts, is a triplet.\r\n\r\n250. I adopt the Bombay reading of the first line of this verse.\r\n\r\n251. All these arrows inflicted had wounds and could not be easily\r\nextracted. Shafts of crooked courses were condemned because the\r\ncombatants could not easily baffle them, not knowing at whom they would\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n252. This verse is omitted in the Bombay text. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, about its genuineness.\r\n\r\n253. The celestial weapons were all living agents that appeared at the\r\nbidding of him who knew to invoke them. They abandoned, however, the\r\nperson whose death was imminent, although invoked with the usual formulae.\r\n\r\n254. I adopt the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n255. Deprived of both the worlds, having sustained a defeat, they lost\r\nthis world, and flying away from the field, they committed a sin and lost\r\nthe next world.\r\n\r\n256. Celestial weapons were invoked with mantras, as explained in a\r\nprevious note. They were forces which created all sorts of tangible\r\nweapons that the invoked desired. Here the Brahma weapon took the form of\r\nbroad-headed arrows.\r\n\r\n257. Dharmadhwajin literally means a person bearing the standard of\r\nvirtue, hence, hypocrite, sanctimoniously talking only virtue and\r\nmorality but acting differently.\r\n\r\n258. I think the correct reading is aputrinas and not putrinas. If it is\r\nputrinas, literally rendered, the meaning is, 'Why should persons having\r\nchildren, feel any affection for the latter?' It the worthy of remark\r\nthat the author of Venisamhara has bodily adopted this verse, putting it\r\nin the mouth of Aswatthaman when introduced in the third Act.\r\n\r\n259. The last line of 37 is read differently in the Bombay edition.\r\nNilakantha accepts that reading, and explains it in his gloss remarking\r\nthat the grammatical solecism occuring in it is a license. The Bengal\r\nreading, however, is more apposite.\r\n\r\n260. Literally, \"the animals kept the Pandavas to their right.\"\r\n\r\n261. Dasaratha's son Rama, during his exile, slew the monkey-chief Bali,\r\nthe brother of Sugriva, while Bali was engaged with Sugriva in battle.\r\nBali had not done any injury to Rama. That act has always been regarded\r\nas a stain on Rama.\r\n\r\n262. I expand the original to make the sense clear.\r\n\r\n263. The first line of the 23rd verse in the Bengal editions, is made the\r\nsecond line of that verse in the Bombay text. There seems to be a\r\nmistake, however, in both the texts. Vishnu slew Hiranyakasipu without\r\nallowing, the latter to say anything unto him. Vide Vishnu Purana, if\r\ninstead of Hiranyakasipu Harim, the rendering be Hiranyakasipu Haris, the\r\nline may then be connected with Bhima's speech, and the comparison would\r\nbecome more apposite.\r\n\r\n264. The Nishadas were and to this day are the lowest caste in India.\r\n\r\n265. The Bengal reading is vicious, I adopt the Bombay reading which is\r\nSurorgurunsha bhuyopi, meaning, \"this preceptor again.\" The fact is,\r\nArjuna was Satyaki's preceptor; Drona, therefore, was the latter's\r\npreceptor's preceptor.\r\n\r\n266. Kimpurushas were fabled creatures, half men and steeds. Not a\r\nmountain but had its Kimpurushas, according to the Hindu belief. Yakshas\r\nwere a sort of superhuman beings inhabiting inaccessible halls and\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n267. I adopt the Bombay reading of the 2nd line of 35 and think that\r\nNilakantha explains it correctly.\r\n\r\n268. I adopt the Bombay reading.\r\n\r\n269. Nilakantha explains this to mean that when he became unconnected\r\nwith the world, rising superior to everything connected with the world.\r\n\r\n270. The terrible.\r\n\r\n271. Amritasya yonim, literally, the origin or cause of immortality,\r\ni.e., he from whom immortality springs. Hence, as explained by\r\nNilakantha, the phrase means the source of salvation, for those only that\r\nare emancipate became immortal as the Supreme Soul itself.\r\n\r\n272. i.e., the five attributes perceivable by the five senses, with the\r\nfive objects of Nature with which they are directly connected or in which\r\nthey manifest themselves.\r\n\r\n273. Having given it away to Rama, his disciple.\r\n\r\n274. All these terms imply Death or the Destroyer"
