Additional proofing and\r\nformatting at sacred-texts.com, by J. B. Hare, October 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as\r\nalso to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \"Jaya\" be uttered.\r\n\r\nJanamejaya said: \"Having heard of that encounter with iron bolts between\r\nthe heroes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, and having been informed\r\nalso of Krishnas ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter\r\nof the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world. He\r\naddressed Arjuna, saying, O thou of great intelligence, it is Time that\r\ncooks every creature (in his cauldron). I think that what has happened is\r\ndue to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee\r\nalso to see it.\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed by his brother, the son of Kunti only repeated the word\r\nTime, Time! and fully endorsed the view of his eldest brother gifted with\r\ngreat intelligence. Ascertaining the resolution of Arjuna, Bhimasena and\r\nthe twins fully endorsed the words that Arjuna had said. Resolved to\r\nretire from the world for earning merit, they brought Yuyutsu before\r\nthem. Yudhishthira made over the kingdom to the son of his uncle by his\r\nVaisya wife. Installing Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the\r\neldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed Subhadra,\r\nsaying, This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus. The survivor\r\nof the Yadus, Vajra, has been made a king. Parikshit will rule in\r\nHastinapura, while the Yadava prince, Vajra, will rule in Shakraprastha.\r\nHe should be protected by thee. Never set thy heart on unrighteousness.\r\n\r\n\"Having said these words, king Yudhishthira the just, along with his\r\nbrothers, promptly offered oblations of water unto Vasudeva of great\r\nintelligence, as also unto his old maternal uncle and Rama and others. He\r\nthen duly performed the Sraddhas of all those deceased kinsmen of his.\r\nThe king, in honour of Hari and naming him repeatedly, fed the\r\nIsland-born Vyasa, and Narada, and Markandeya possessed of wealth of\r\npenances, and Yajnavalkya of Bharadwajas race, with many delicious\r\nviands. In honour of Krishna, he also gave away many jewels and gems, and\r\nrobes and clothes, and villages, and horses and cars, and female slaves\r\nby hundreds and thousands unto foremost of Brahmanas. Summoning the\r\ncitizens. Kripa was installed as the preceptor and Parikshit was made\r\nover to him as his disciple, O chief of Bharatas race.\r\n\r\n\"Then Yudhishthira once more summoned all his subjects. The royal sage\r\ninformed them of his intentions. The citizens and the inhabitants of the\r\nprovinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and\r\ndisapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king.\r\nThe monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not\r\nlisten to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the\r\npeople to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world.\r\nHis brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son,\r\nYudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore\r\nbarks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of\r\ngreat fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having\r\ncaused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which\r\nwere to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost\r\nof men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding\r\nthe princes in that guise, wept aloud. They seemed to look as they had\r\nlooked in days before, when with Draupadi forming the sixth in number\r\nthey set out from the capital after their defeat at dice. The brothers,\r\nhowever, were all very cheerful at the prospect of retirement.\r\nAscertaining the intentions of Yudhishthira and seeing the destruction of\r\nthe Vrishnis, no other course of action could please them then.\r\n\r\n\"The five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming\r\nthe seventh, set out on their journey. Indeed, even thus did king\r\nYudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city\r\nnamed after the elephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal\r\nhousehold followed them for some distance. None of them, however, could\r\nventure to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention.\r\nThe denizens of the city then returned; Kripa and others stood around\r\nYuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of\r\nKuntis race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set\r\nout for the capital of Manipura. The other ladies who were the\r\ngrandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled\r\nPandavas, O thou of Kurus race, and Draupadi of great fame, having\r\nobserved the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east.\r\nSetting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe\r\nthe religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and\r\nreached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind\r\nhim was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order\r\nof their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race,\r\nproceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of\r\ndark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the\r\nPandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.\r\n\r\n\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya\r\nhad not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of\r\ninexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches\r\none to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire\r\nstanding before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there\r\nin his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the\r\nPandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire.\r\nO mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O\r\nArjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost\r\nones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was\r\nburnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let\r\nyour brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva,\r\nthat high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus,\r\nwhich was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\r\nWhen the time again comes, it will come back into his hands. This\r\nforemost of bows, Gandiva, was procured by me from Varuna for the use of\r\nPartha. Let it be made over to Varuna himself.\r\n\r\n\"At this, all the brothers urged Dhananjaya to do what the deity said. He\r\nthen threw into the waters (of the sea) both the bow and the couple of\r\ninexhaustible quivers. After this, O chief of Bharatas race, the god of\r\nthe fire disappeared then and there. The heroic sons of Pandu next\r\nproceeded with their faces turned towards the south. Then, by the\r\nnorthern coast of the salt sea, those princes of Bharatas race proceeded\r\nto the south-west. Turning next towards the west, they beheld the city of\r\nDwaraka covered by the ocean. Turning next to the north, those foremost\r\nones proceeded on. Observant of Yoga, they were desirous of making a\r\nround of the whole Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"Those princes of restrained souls and devoted to\r\nYoga, proceeding to the north, beheld Himavat, that very large mountain.\r\nCrossing the Himavat, they beheld a vast desert of sand. They then saw\r\nthe mighty mountain Meru, the foremost of all high-peaked mountains. As\r\nthose mighty ones were proceeding quickly, all rapt in Yoga, Yajnaseni,\r\nfalling of from Yoga, dropped down on the Earth. Beholding her fallen\r\ndown, Bhimasena of great strength addressed king Yudhishthira the just,\r\nsaying, O scorcher of foes, this princess never did any sinful act. Tell\r\nus what the cause is for which Krishna has fallen down on the Earth!\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said: O best of men, though we were all equal unto her she\r\nhad great partiality for Dhananjaya. She obtains the fruit of that\r\nconduct today, O best of men.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"Having said this, that foremost one of Bharatas\r\nrace proceeded on. Of righteous soul, that foremost of men, endued with\r\ngreat intelligence, went on, with mind intent on itself. Then Sahadeva of\r\ngreat learning fell down on the Earth. Beholding him drop down, Bhima\r\naddressed the king, saying, He who with great humility used to serve us\r\nall, alas, why is that son of Madravati fallen down on the Earth?\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, He never thought anybody his equal in wisdom. It is\r\nfor that fault that this prince has fallen down.\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"Having said this, the king proceeded, leaving\r\nSahadeva there. Indeed, Kuntis son Yudhishthira went on, with his\r\nbrothers and with the dog. Beholding both Krishna and the Pandava\r\nSahadeva fallen down, the brave Nakula, whose love for kinsmen was very\r\ngreat, fell down himself. Upon the falling down of the heroic Nakula of\r\ngreat personal beauty, Bhima once more addressed the king, saying, This\r\nbrother of ours who was endued with righteousness without incompleteness,\r\nand who always obeyed our behests, this Nakula who was unrivalled for\r\nbeauty, has fallen down.\r\n\r\n\"Thus addressed by Bhimasena, Yudhishthira, said, with respect to Nakula,\r\nthese words: He was of righteous soul and the foremost of all persons\r\nendued with intelligence. He, however, thought that there was nobody that\r\nequalled him in beauty of person. Indeed, he regarded himself as superior\r\nto all in that respect. It is for this that Nakula has fallen down. Know\r\nthis, O Vrikodara. What has been ordained for a person, O hero, must have\r\nto be endured by him.\r\n\r\n\"Beholding Nakula and the others fall down, Pandus son Arjuna of white\r\nsteeds, that slayer of hostile heroes, fell down in great grief of heart.\r\nWhen that foremost of men, who was endued with the energy of Shakra, had\r\nfallen down, indeed, when that invincible hero was on the point of death,\r\nBhima said unto the king, I do not recollect any untruth uttered by this\r\nhigh-souled one. Indeed, not even in jest did he say anything false. What\r\nthen is that for whose evil consequence this one has fallen down on the\r\nEarth?\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, Arjuna had said that he would consume all our foes in\r\na single day. Proud of his heroism, he did not, however, accomplish what\r\nhe had said. Hence has he fallen down. This Phalguna disregarded all\r\nwielders of bows. One desirous of prosperity should never indulge in such\r\nsentiments.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"Having said so, the king proceeded on. Then\r\nBhima fell down. Having fallen down, Bhima addressed king Yudhishthira\r\nthe just, saying, O king, behold, I who am thy darling have fallen down.\r\nFor what reason have I dropped down? Tell me if thou knowest it.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, Thou wert a great eater, and thou didst use to boast\r\nof thy strength. Thou never didst attend, O Bhima, to the wants of others\r\nwhile eating. It is for that, O Bhima, that thou hast fallen down.\r\n\r\n\"Having said these words, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira proceeded on,\r\nwithout looking back. He had only one companion, the dog of which I have\r\nrepeatedly spoken to thee, that followed him now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nVaishampayana said: \"Then Shakra, causing the firmament and the Earth to\r\nbe filled by a loud sound, came to the son of Pritha on a car and asked\r\nhim to ascend it. Beholding his brothers fallen on the Earth, king\r\nYudhishthira the just said unto that deity of a 1,000 eyes these words:\r\nMy brothers have all dropped down here. They must go with me. Without\r\nthem by me I do not wish to go to Heaven, O lord of all the deities. The\r\ndelicate princess (Draupadi) deserving of every comfort, O Purandara,\r\nshould go with us. It behoveth thee to permit this.\r\n\r\n\"Shakra said, Thou shalt behold thy brothers in Heaven. They have reached\r\nit before thee. Indeed, thou shalt see all of them there, with Krishna.\r\nDo not yield to grief, O chief of the Bharatas. Having cast off their\r\nhuman bodies they have gone there, O chief of Bharatas race. As regards\r\nthee, it is ordained that thou shalt go thither in this very body of\r\nthine.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, This dog, O lord of the Past and the Present, is\r\nexceedingly devoted to me. He should go with me. My heart is full of\r\ncompassion for him.\r\n\r\n\"Shakra said, Immortality and a condition equal to mine, O king,\r\nprosperity extending in all directions, and high success, and all the\r\nfelicities of Heaven, thou hast won today. Do thou cast off this dog. In\r\nthis there will be no cruelty.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, O thou of a 1,000 eyes. O thou that art of righteous\r\nbehaviour, it is exceedingly difficult for one that is of righteous\r\nbehaviour to perpetrate an act that is unrighteous. I do not desire that\r\nunion with prosperity for which I shall have to cast off one that is\r\ndevoted to me.\r\n\r\n\"Indra said, There is no place in Heaven for persons with dogs. Besides,\r\nthe (deities called) Krodhavasas take away all the merits of such\r\npersons. Reflecting on this, act, O king Yudhishthira the just. Do thou\r\nabandon this dog. There is no cruelty in this.\r\n\r\n\"Yudhishthira said, It has been said that the abandonment of one that is\r\ndevoted is infinitely sinful. It is equal to the sin that one incurs by\r\nslaying a Brahmana. Hence, O great Indra, I shall not abandon this dog\r\ntoday from desire of my happiness. Even this is my vow steadily pursued,\r\nthat I never give up a person that is terrified, nor one that is devoted\r\nto me, nor one that seeks my protection, saying that he is destitute, nor\r\none that is afflicted, nor one that has come to me, nor one that is weak\r\nin protecting oneself, nor one that is solicitous of life. I shall never\r\ngive up such a one till my own life is at an end.\r\n\r\n\"Indra said, Whatever gifts, or sacrifices spread out, or libations\r\npoured on the sacred fire, are seen by a dog, are taken away by the\r\nKrodhavasas. Do thou, therefore, abandon this dog. By abandoning this dog\r\nthou wilt attain to the region of the deities. Having abandoned thy\r\nbrothers and Krishna, thou hast, O hero, acquired a region of felicity by\r\nthy own deeds. Why art thou so stupefied? Thou hast renounced everything.\r\nWhy then dost thou not renounce this dog? \"Yudhishthira said, This is\r\nwell known in all the worlds that there is neither friendship nor enmity\r\nwith those that are dead. When my brothers and Krishna died, I was unable\r\nto revive them. Hence it was that I abandoned them. I did not, however,\r\nabandon them as long as they were alive. To frighten one that has sought\r\nprotection, the slaying of a woman, the theft of what belongs to a\r\nBrahmana, and injuring a friend, each of these four, O Shakra, is I think\r\nequal to the abandonment of one that is devoted.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the\r\njust, (the dog became transformed into) the deity of Righteousness, who,\r\nwell pleased, said these words unto him in a sweet voice fraught with\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\"Dharma said: Thou art well born, O king of kings, and possessed of the\r\nintelligence and the good conduct of Pandu. Thou hast compassion for all\r\ncreatures, O Bharata, of which this is a bright example. Formerly, O son,\r\nthou wert once examined by me in the woods of Dwaita, where thy brothers\r\nof great prowess met with (an appearance of) death. Disregarding both thy\r\nbrothers Bhima and Arjuna, thou didst wish for the revival of Nakula from\r\nthy desire of doing good to thy (step-) mother. On the present occasion,\r\nthinking the dog to be devoted to thee, thou hast renounced the very car\r\nof the celestials instead of renouncing him. Hence. O king, there is no\r\none in Heaven that is equal to thee. Hence, O Bharata, regions of\r\ninexhaustible felicity are thine. Thou hast won them, O chief of the\r\nBharatas, and thine is a celestial and high goal.\"\r\n\r\nVaishampayana continued: \"Then Dharma, and Shakra, and the Maruts, and\r\nthe Ashvinis, and other deities, and the celestial Rishis, causing\r\nYudhishthira to ascend on a car, proceeded to Heaven. Those beings\r\ncrowned with success and capable of going everywhere at will, rode their\r\nrespective cars. King Yudhishthira, that perpetuator of Kurus race,\r\nriding on that car, ascended quickly, causing the entire welkin to blaze\r\nwith his effulgence. Then Narada, that foremost of all speakers, endued\r\nwith penances, and conversant with all the worlds, from amidst that\r\nconcourse of deities, said these words: All those royal sages that are\r\nhere have their achievements transcended by those of Yudhishthira.\r\nCovering all the worlds by his fame and splendour and by his wealth of\r\nconduct, he has attained to Heaven in his own (human) body. None else\r\nthan the son of Pandu has been heard to achieve this.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these words of Narada, the righteous-souled king, saluting the\r\ndeities and all the royal sages there present, said, Happy or miserable,\r\nwhatever the region be that is now my brothers, I desire to proceed to. I\r\ndo not wish to go anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing this speech of the king, the chief of the deities, Purandara,\r\nsaid these words fraught with noble sense: Do thou live in this place, O\r\nking of kings, which thou hast won by thy meritorious deeds. Why dost\r\nthou still cherish human affections? Thou hast attained to great success,\r\nthe like of which no other man has ever been able to attain. Thy\r\nbrothers, O delighter of the Kurus, have succeeded in winning regions of\r\nfelicity. Human affections still touch thee. This is Heaven. Behold these\r\ncelestial Rishis and Siddhas who have attained to the region of the gods.\r\n\r\n\"Gifted with great intelligence, Yudhishthira answered the chief of the\r\ndeities once more, saying, O conqueror of Daityas, I venture not to dwell\r\nanywhere separated from them. I desire to go there, where my brothers\r\nhave gone. I wish to go there where that foremost of women, Draupadi, of\r\nample proportions and darkish complexion and endued with great\r\nintelligence and righteous of conduct, has gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of Mahaprasthanika-parv\r\n"
